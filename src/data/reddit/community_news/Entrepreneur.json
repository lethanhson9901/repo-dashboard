      "text": "So i started my agency about 2 years ago focused on brand strategy and visual identity, the whole package, deep discovery sessions, custom positioning, the works. That was the vision, thats what i built everything around.\n\nAbout 8 months in i threw in a basic \"brand refresh\" package almost as an afterthought, like a lower entry point for people who werent ready to commit to the full thing. No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week. I genuinely thought it was a filler offer.\n\nFast forward to now and that \"filler\" package accounts for almost 70% of my revenue. The thing i spent months obsessing over barely moves.\n\nHad some money from Stаke saved going into this year which gave me the breathing room to actually sit with this instead of just panicking and restructuring everything. And what i realized is the market doesnt care about what you think your best work is, it cares about what solves their problem fast.\n\nStill not sure if i lean fully into the boring offer and let the premium stuff be a side thing, or if i keep pushing the original vision hoping the positioning catches up.",

If you don't personally like doing the \"boring\" offer, scale by hiring entry-level brand experts and visual designers to run that offering, and spend your own time on the few premium deals that come through.  Let the new hires graduate to the fun stuff if they succeed at the entry level, and as the premium demand warrants.\n\nMakes perfect sense though, for a new agency. Most companies have woefully insufficient marketing budgets.  If they do have the budget, time, and energy to pay for a premium package, they will go pay a premium agency to build it.  You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?  That's an offer people will take, even from a market newcomer, because the alternative is to have Joe from Sales try to draw the new logo, and you are definitely better than Joe from Sales.\n\nIn time, with lots of happy customers whose brands are enhanced, some will become very successful and need more from you, and you will also develop a reputation that wins you more of the premium business.",

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Listen to it. Your \"vision\" offer can be the upsell for people who come in through the boring one. Use the brand refresh as the front door, then offer the full strategy package to the people who loved the refresh and want more.

Agencies aren't as unique as they like to present and believe in. So when your gimmick thing sells so well it outpaces and outsells the actual business service your agency is trying to sell, you focus on the thing that sells as the new flagship product/service and expand from that outwardly. \n\nOr look into selling your company now before you commit to it and let the new owner capitalize on what you're unsure about and reap the rewards for just being there and discovering the jackpot situation but not doing much else after. \n\nThese are very good problems to have. Capitalize on the interest and frenzy buying of the new shiny cheap thing before someone at your agency figures it out and goes off to start their own agency and capitalizes on what you didn't!",

Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.",

      "text": "Been studying ad patterns lately. Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out. ",

          "text": "It’s interesting that American Christianity is such a heavily commercial enterprise. It’s like the ultimate expression of American capitalism. Since religions form to propagate the norms of the society they form in, you can use the primary religion of an area, and its most popular priests and figures, as a way to gauge what that society values.\n\nTraditional European Catholicism valued humility and charity, even if individuals didn’t always practice that. It was the “good” that people strived for, or respected in others. It also valued poverty (sometimes - there were huge debates and even wars about whether Christians should practice poverty even in the Middle Ages) and simplicity. Of course, cardinals and popes eschewed poverty and were caught up in vicious intrigues over absurd levels of wealth and power, but the priests and saints who were worshipped by regular people were largely poor, humble, and simple. Few people worshipped the flamboyant and corrupt cardinals. \n\nWhen you look at American Christianity, the popular versions largely created in the US are Evangelism and Mormonism.  Catholicism is practiced by immigrants and their children for the most part, and is not a very American religion. If you look at Evangelicals and Mormons, at their churches and the popular preaching style, you get the sense of a for-profit business, one very focused on marketing and PR and branding. \n\nEverything in these religions revolves around money and consumption. You can go on any random Evangelical church’s website and find the pastor has posted a video where he prays for money and success for himself and his congregation. The most respectable members have huge houses and cars, big white fake veneers and bleached hair and still openly and blatantly pray for even more money and success. It’s the ultimate expression of American values. There is even a sense that if one is poor, or has had struggles in life. it’s because one is not favored by God, and hence must be evil. \n\nThe American church feels more like a multi-level marketing scheme than anything else. Get suckered in, then sell to other suckers. Recruitment is aggressive, much like in an MLM, and practitioners put immense effort into displaying the appearance of success. You even kick back 10% of your profits up the chain, much like an MLM.\n\nThe American conman preacher and evangelist is not even a recent thing stemming from the acceleration of consumerism in recent faces. Nearly 200 years ago, religious grifters were a fixture in the rush to the West, and the American scamming preacher is as classic as Thanksgiving. \n\nI can’t think of any other religion that is so focused on wealth, success, and image. Buddhism is obviously actively against it. Hinduism a little less so, but still actively focuses on spiritual rather than material wealth. Judaism preaches education, knowledge, curiosity and learning, and Islam values poverty and tribulations as a test before God. Other non-American forms of Christianity also actively preach poverty. \n\nIt says a lot about the US that the primary religions invented in the country are so financially- and image-oriented. I have been to services for every major religion and some more obscure one, but Evangelicals and Mormon services are the only ones I’ve ever been to where the sermon was focused on asking God for wealth and material success. \n\nThis is why American Christianity can be such a successful business proposition. The those belief system focuses on wealth and consumption, the religion itself is effectively a brand, and it’s natural for a brand to have lots of product tie-ins. \n\nNote: Obviously humans are humans, and people can often be materialistic and selfish, but religion is meant to espouse the perfection of character and spirit, and thus be somewhat out of reach to inspire people.",

Once informed them that their conversation with me was over and they could continue it with my lawyer, I received a refund in full.",

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Better than losing your money to something you don't understand.\n\n\nHere's the easiest investment you can make:\n\n\n- Open up a Roth IRA with Fidelity or Vanguard.\n\n\n- Also open up a regular taxable brokerage account with either.\n\n\n- Add the maximum amount of money for the year to your Roth IRA ($7500 for 2026).\n\n\n- Buy a target date retirement fund for roughly the year you'd like to retire (Vanguard VTTSX-2060 or VFIFX-2050, Fidelity FFFHX-2050 or FDKLX-2060).\n\n\n- Repeat the same with your taxable brokerage account. Put in as much money as you want, buy the same fund.\n\n\n- Keep adding money to the funds as often as you want. For the Roth, you can't put in more than $7500/year, but no limits on the brokerage. Buy nothing else. You can literally just keep adding money to the exact same target date funds and never do anything else.\n\n\n- Target date funds invest everything for you. They buy and sell various stocks and bonds and they rebalance based on how close you are to retirement. When you're young, they'll have more money in stocks and move away from them as you get older. The beauty though is you do nothing, just keep adding money to them.\n\n\nThat's it. Congratulations you will outperform almost all other investors.",

Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, your bank, or whatever preferred platform you want to use. Roth IRAs tax the money when it goes in, not when it comes out at or after age 65. That's best, because it gets taxed before the balance grows, so you pay less. Again, put it into an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nMax out your 401(k) contribution up to the amount that your employer will match, either total or partial. Again, allocate it to an index fund.\n\nAfter that, the easiest thing to do is to put the remaining chunk that you want to invest into an index fund through Fidelity or similar.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't invest in anything other than index funds unless you're really hardcore, and even then, it probably isn't worth it lol",

Almost everyone who comes to r/Entrepreneur to ask for advice is asking about something that has been discussed extensively. That's just the bell curve that is real life. Most problems are typical problems.\n\nIn your case, I think you should consider that **your current job is your passive income**. Because if you're saving 75%+ of your income, then you are already halfway there: you just went backwards. The trope of the successful entrepreneur is:\n\n1. Come up with working business idea  \n2. Have plenty of money with little effort\n\n[You did the opposite. ](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-20-2017/_IufW-.gif) Step 2 is done, so now it's on to step 1.\n\nGetting your aesthetician license is a great idea, especially if you can stay full-time. It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans. Hang out in forums like this one. \n\nCongrats! And good luck.",

Almost all of the employees have been here for over 15 years. All of us know that we are extremely lucky to be a part of his business. He’s truly one of a kind. He doesn’t care how I spend my time, as long as the job is done, he’s happy.",

His job title was to clean three properties. He would start at 8 AM and be done by 1 PM latest. Just picking up trash and making sure the property was clean. That’s it. And 80% of the time the properties were always clean because people pick up after themselves. So the dude would get to go home early if he was finished. And since he lived on site at one of the properties, we gave him a huge discount on his rent. About $800 off. And I believe the position paid $19 an hour (not great, but not bad either for the little work you do). Well, my cousin‘s girlfriend was looking for a job and she lives with my cousin at one of the properties I manage. They currently pay about $2000 for a one bedroom one bath.\n\nI told her that he quit and that she should apply immediately with my company. At the time, she wasn’t working and was looking for a job. She could definitely benefit from the rental discount PLUS, she could be done with work at 1 PM and the rest of the day could be spent doing something else or another part-time job... Well, she never took me up on that offer. And now she’s working 12 hour shifts at T-Mobile making minimum wage. I don’t understand how someone could turn down an $800 rental discount plus the decent pay. She never even told me why she didn’t want the job. She would just say “oh okay” any time I’d mention it. I even told her that there was plenty of opportunity for her to move up in the company. And I was right. A couple months later, one of our leasing agents quit and the position was available. I would’ve been able to train her and the job would’ve been hers. Knowing the owner, he would’ve allowed me to train her.",

Improve based on what they tell you.\n\nThe people travelling the world didn't get there overnight.

It sounds like you haven’t been making $9k/month for very long. \n\nIf I had to start over from your position this is what I would do. \n\nKeep your expenses low. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing as long as you can. Save up $150k-$250k or as close to it as you can. It’s gonna take you about 4 years. Based on your line of questioning, you may have shiny object syndrome. The “business” is the shiny object. If you can’t save up that amount in 4 years at $9k/month then take a look at your lifestyle and budget better to save money wherever possible. Live on $50k and invest $50k into the S&P or some index per year. \n\nFor now, don’t try to start a salon business from scratch. Buy one that’s already profitable with the money you save up. But don’t cash out your investments, use it as collateral to buy the business. Go do your own research for buying a business, seller financing is popular these days.\n\nBefore you buy a beauty salon, get a job in one to learn how it works. Buy one that’s been profitable for a good enough time frame, for me that would be 5 years minimum. \n\nThe reason you buy one is because it’s gonna cost you a lot to start up, and a lot of time and risk. If you get into the business and you find out that it’s not for you, you can sell it and get your money back because it was a profitable asset when you bought it.\n\nI was taught this by a former client who buys businesses, holds them, and sells them, for a living. Personally, I wish I took that route. It would’ve saved me a lot of pain and tears. Goodluck.",

I built something based on my assumptions instead of actual customer needs.\n\nNow running a second business that's profitable, I approach everything differently.\n\nHere are the key changes that saved me:\n\n* Interview at least 30 to 50 potential customers before any serious development.\n* Launch a bare bones MVP as quickly as possible to test demand.\n* Prioritize sales and customer feedback from week one, not perfection.\n\nIf you're just starting or in the early stages, please don't repeat my mistake.

Not because the interviews give you a perfect roadmap, but because they reveal assumptions you didn't even know you were making.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: pay attention to what people are currently doing to solve the problem, not just whether they say they'd use your product. If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

Be genuine, not salesy. Something like \"Hey, I'm researching [problem]. Would you be open to a 15 minute chat? No pitch, just trying to understand the space better.\"\n\nLinkedIn works well too, especially for B2B. Filter by job title and industry, then send connection requests with a short note about your research.\n\nThe other underrated move is posting in relevant communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack groups) asking people to share their experience with the problem. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to talk when you frame it as learning, not selling.\n\nStart with 5. Once you get comfortable with the format, the next 25 come much easier.",

People say yes to be polite. Instead I started asking \"walk me through the last time you dealt with \\[problem\\]\" and just listening.

          "text": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

Talking to people early feels uncomfortable, but it saves you from months of false confidence. Your point about prioritizing sales and feedback over perfection is spot on. A rough product with real users teaches you more in weeks than a polished one sitting unused.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this honestly.

Made the exact same mistake you're talking about. Built the whole thing on assumptions, sent it out... crickets. No replies, zero traction, and my bank account started looking scary.\n\nSo now I don't build anything first.

I have always noticed that being early to new channels that are growing often helps a ton for growth! For example, we were first to be super active in reddit communities our customers hang out at and genuinely help and this gave us a lot of early growth. Today its slightly tougher cause Reddit is quiet saturated but still works tho.\n\nSo curious, what is the most underrated marketing channel most Entrepreneurs ignore in 2026?",

But since more and more people were getting answers from Gemini, ChatGPT etc, we noticed both the users and these tools behind the scene ran super long tail search queries like \"what is the best software to do XYZ for financial assistants in United States?\" etc. \n\nSo we basically setup a process using Frizerly to look at search data and  auto-publish blogs on our website daily exactly answering these questions one by one using AI. The content is written with our tool as the authoritative answer when it makes sense!\n\nThis has helped up basically be mentioned constantly by Googles AI overview and gemini over time. However I am little scared typing this because if my competitors do the same thing, it's probably going to get trickier! I really hope they won't read this post haha!",

A solid Reddit comment can get indexed by Google, show up in AI summaries, and stay discoverable for years.\n\nThe real moat is patience. Most founders post once, get ignored, then quit. If you stick around for 3 to 6 months as a real community member, it starts to compound.\n\nAnother underrated channel is niche newsletters under 10K subs in a tight vertical.

Gamma and Canva get mentioned a lot for a reason, you can dump your content in and they handle most of the layout so you’re not fighting fonts for 3 hours.  \n  \nAnother angle that actually works well for sales stuff (especially insurance where you’re basically walking people through info step-by-step) is turning your material into a flipbook style presentation with Flipsnack. You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

So I definitely had a hard time because all of this (and to keep the company running) but at the end it's worth it since it's getting harder to find jobs and pension age (Rentenalter) is also rising up every couple of years.\n\nIf I can give any advice, DO NOT believe social media blindly, yes there are some benefits but you'll always pay a price.",

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

You can always take online classes to work towards a degree if they becomes necessary, and some colleges will give you credits for your business experience to shorten the time and classes required.\n\nYou can always sell your business to cash out and take time off to get a degree if you wish, but I think you will want to see how far you can go with your agency over the coming 5+ years as who knows how far it can grow.\n\nOnce you do get to a level of financial success you can travel the world however you wish. Also, look into organizations like Rotary, Kiwanis, or some other local groups where business owners meet. I travelled to conferences held for owners and principals in the business I owned, and it was great to connect and network with others doing what I as doing, so look for those opportunities. \n\nOne tip is to start putting money away early and save as much as you can. This will help give you breathing room if the business can't be sold or goes through a downturn. ",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

          "text": "This isn't a hot take. It's the same cliché flipped upside down.\n\n\"Corporate jobs are safe\" is a myth. Agreed. But \"entrepreneurs control their destiny\" is equally romantic. You don't control the market. You don't control your customers' decisions. You don't control the economy, the timing, or whether someone with more resources builds the same thing faster. You traded one type of uncertainty for another and called it freedom.\n\nThe real question isn't which path is riskier. It's which kind of risk you're equipped to handle, and whether you've thought honestly about why you're choosing it. \"I want control\" sounds empowering until you realize most new businesses don't fail because the founder lacked control. They fail because the founder didn't know what to build, who to build it for, or why it mattered beyond revenue.\n\nAnd the conspiracy angle at the end weakens an otherwise interesting conversation. \"Media wants us to stay employees\" isn't critical thinking. It's just suspicion wearing the costume of insight. The real reason most people stay in corporate jobs isn't brainwashing. It's that entrepreneurship demands a kind of self-knowledge that most people haven't done the work to develop. That's not a media problem. That's a human one.\n\nBoth paths are hard. Both paths are uncertain. The difference isn't control. It's whether you've been honest with yourself about what you actually want and what you're willing to lose to get it.",

If you've been an entrepreneur for several years, your job history will be a mish-mash of every function of a company - you've done some accounting, some legal, some marketing, some sales, some etc etc.  You don't have proven experience at any specific corporate job.  So, yes, it's a lot riskier, because if your business fails you're going to have a hell of a time replacing the income.\n\nAlso, in a corporate job you typically have a benefits plan that includes PTO and short and long term disability.  If you suddenly develop lupus or whatever, as a corporate employee, you have a viable financial path (not that living on 60% of your income is _easy_, but it's at least _possible_).  If you're unable to work as a solo or small company entrepreneur, even in you have disability insurance, the company itself is going to run out of money without you and be unable to pay the premiums.  More likely you just never signed up for this kind of insurance because it was way too expensive, particularly STD.\n\nThe reality is that owning your own business is a great deal more risky than being an employee, even taking layoffs into account.  Nobody actually controls their destiny, but corporate employees are typically way better off when bad things happen.",

But with a box your best bet is to spend some time looking around at local businesses. Most if not all are going to have some kind of regular delivery. Avoid chains because they’re using sisco, etc. Get together a list of a good 20+ local businesses. See if you can figure out anything they’d need regularly that you’d be able to get. I’ve not done it on that level so the only example I can think of is I had a guy locally that would deliver our buns. We didn’t go through enough where I was to do bulk orders because it’d go bad. But he’d pull up in his box full of bread and hit I can’t remember how many businesses. He did his runs in the morning then went home. But with the time and effort you could definitely(again, location will play in for sure) find a lane paying you $500 a day running 5 days a week. Obviously you know there’s gunna be overhead but with a box and driving it yourself it’s as low as it can be. You wouldn’t even need the MC if nothings changed. DOT is enough to run a box inside state lines.",

A few months ago I crossed $10k in retainers and guaranteed monthly contracts, which I’m really grateful for.\n\nOne of the biggest stress relievers has been focusing on a lower tier monthly offer so my recurring revenue is spread across dozens of clients instead of depending on two or three large ones.\n\nI also build custom solutions for industrial, manufacturing, and logistics companies. These tend to be very niche use cases where traditional SaaS doesn’t really work. Those projects are usually in the $25k to $60k range, but they’re less frequent.\n\nLooking back, getting to $10k felt relatively straightforward. The harder part is breaking past that into the $20k to $30k range because it requires shifting from pure hustle into management, and that’s the phase I’m in now.\n\nI’ve worked with a few hires so far and learned a lot from each experience. My current goal is to reach about $15k in retainers and bring on a full time PM locally. I’ve found that fully remote dynamics can be challenging depending on the role and level of ownership required.",

But the customers are sticky as hell because switching costs in niche workflows are brutal.\n\n  \nThe \"search for anger\" framing is perfect too.

Meanwhile demand for recovered materials - copper, gold, rare earth metals - is only going up as supply chains tighten.\n\nThe business case is real. But what makes it interesting from an entrepreneurship standpoint is the structure of the market.\n\nTo operate legitimately and land corporate clients, you need R2v3 or e-Stewards certification. These are industry standards that verify your downstream - meaning you can prove where materials actually end up. Most large corporations now require this from their recycling vendors.\n\nThat certification requirement acts as a real moat. It keeps casual competitors out. But it also means the barrier to entry is higher than just buying equipment and opening a warehouse.\n\nThe compliance side is genuinely complex - documentation, audits, downstream vendor diligence, ongoing reporting. Most people looking to enter the space underestimate this part completely.\n\nThe entrepreneurs I've seen succeed in this space treat compliance as a competitive advantage rather than a cost. Once you're certified with MG Environmental Consulting, you're in a much smaller pool competing for enterprise contracts.\n\nCurious if anyone here has explored this space or knows people in it.",

Most recycling programs are bullshit but some of them are okay. \n\nBattery recycling is something that makes sense and the only reason is because it’s profitable at a certain scale and efficiency. \n\n1st Problem is feedstock. It’s a “reverse distribution, logistics” kinda business. Where are you going to collect the batteries? How many kg/ton per location? How many locations? How many trucks needed? Depending on your location, are you charging a disposal fee? Are you collecting for free? Or are you paying the disposer a rebate? \n\nNext problem is Capex and know how. Processing plants are not cheap, and you need to get licensing and approval from govt agencies etc. And then there’s the know how. Nobody who’s figured it out will actually teach you the best and efficient way to extract the maximum amount of black mass from your feedstock. It requires a lot of R&D and by R&D I mean trial and error. So it’s actually a business with a very high barrier to entry IMO. It cannot be bootstrapped. Literally need a few million just to start up (at least in my country)",

They were applying for certification back in the early days of the industry, and it was the guy that wrote the standard they were trying to certify against that came in to do the audit. He took one look at the software, and said we should sell it to other companies - it's exactly what was needed in the industry.\n\nSo I did. Re-wrote it as a SaaS and worked with a few other ITADs to get feedback, then launched about 10 years ago.\n\nOne thing everyone seems to be missing in the replies here - e-waste can be a little misleading. Here in the UK we tend to use the term ITAD (IT Asset Disposition). The main focus is NOT on destroying PCs, but rather on refurbishing them for onward sale. Just because a large enterprise customer has decided to replace the machines, it doesnt mean they are dead. Erasing the hard disks and re-selling the machines is big business.\n\nAnd with sustainability being a key thing here in the UK and Europe, proper reporting on this can be a massive boost to ITADs.",

I still own that property and as of today there is 8 companies currently that rent some portion of it. The beauty of it is they maintain their own rented space and a lot of them have built something on their rented portion which has increased the property value. I make 1.2 million a year off of those 32 acres and yes I've repeated the same thing in surrounding cities and continue to look for more and different opportunities. I owe alot to the first company who reached out(a fence company) for actually coming up with the idea for me.",

          "text": "When I graduated from HS my parents said bye-bye you’re on your own. When I was 19 I literally rented a room in a flop house in the early 1990s. I shared a bathroom with 2 other tenants. Woke up in the morning with the cops running around the house because one of the tenants died in the shared bathroom. I barely had enough money to eat. Found a second job. Worked 70-80 hours a week. Luckily the local state university opened an extension school in our local HS. I could take a couple classes a semester in the evening. Still worked the 2 jobs and >70 hours. Eventually graduated. Saw the movie Wall Street. Figured, if you want to make money go to where the money is. Took my 1 week vacation to NYC. Called, dropped off and sent out resumes to anyone I could. Within the week I had a few interviews. Late ‘90s NYC was a great job market. Took a chance, called in and quit my job back home and stayed another week. Got an entry level job at a premiere wealth management company. Went back home, sold, dumped, packed up everything I had. Found a roommate from a classified in the Village Voice (newspaper). Worked as many hours as I could. Kept getting promoted. After almost 20 years of working harder than everyone else in the office I was making over $1 million a year. But Wall Street is a feast or famine business. Eventually the company I worked for made some bad decisions and went under. Now I’m in my mid 50s and unemployed. But at least I wasn’t a crazy spender and I have a few million in saving.",

You should know how to fix it and you will learn by actually trying to build the real thing and failing.
