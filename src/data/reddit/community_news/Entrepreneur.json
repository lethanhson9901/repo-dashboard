      "text": "I sell workflow optimization services to small businesses. For months, my cold emails got ignored.\n\nThe problem wasn't the service. It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

          "text": "This principle applies to so many business conversations beyond just sales pitches. I've seen the same thing with customer communication channels.\n\n\n\nBusinesses will say \"We have omnichannel support\" or \"We use AI chatbots\" - and customers tune out immediately. But when you say \"Text us anytime, we respond in under 2 minutes\" - suddenly people lean in.\n\n\n\nThe pattern you've identified isn't just about avoiding buzzwords. It's about starting the conversation where your customer's pain lives, not where your solution lives.\n\n\n\nYour \"before\" pitch answered \"What do you do?\" Your \"after\" pitch answered \"What problem do I have that you fix?\"\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add: the specificity matters too. \"15+ hours/week\" and \"cut that to 2\" are concrete numbers that make it real. Vague promises like \"save time\" or \"increase efficiency\" don't land the same way because people can't visualize them.\n\n\n\nSMBs especially respond to this because they're drowning in vendor pitches all day. The moment you demonstrate you understand their actual daily reality (not just industry pain points), you're in a different category.",

I see this all the time with SMBs - they don't care about the tech stack, they care about getting their weekends back.\n\n\n\nOne thing to add: the communication channel matters as much as the message. A lot of SMB owners are drowning in email but will respond to a text within minutes. If you're doing cold outreach, consider testing SMS vs email with the same value-focused pitch.\n\n\n\nI've seen response rates jump 3-4x just by meeting them where they already are (phone) vs where we want them to be (email/forms).\n\n\n\nYour point about \"show the math\" is crucial. When you can say \"you're spending $2k/month on admin time for X task, I can do it for $500\" - that's a conversation starter, not a sales pitch. The decision basically makes itself.\n\n\n\nFor anyone reading this struggling with the same thing: ask yourself \"what specific task is eating their time?\" not \"what can my tool do?\" The minute you can name the exact pain point, your pitch writes itself.",

I'd heard him ask the same question on a podcast. \n* Had my answer ready. He pushed back on market size. I'd already rehearsed that objection multiple times. \n* He wanted to know \"why you?\" - I knew from his content he values founder-market fit over credentials, so I leaned into that.\n\nHe committed on the call. $50K wired last week.\n\nSame pitch deck. Same me. The only difference was how prepared I was.\n\nWalking into a pitch already knowing how someone thinks, what they care about, and how they communicate changes everything.\n\nAnyone else do this level of research before investor calls?

I oversimplified it especially because I haven't gotten to the second season yet, though I have immensely enjoyed the first.\n\nSynecdoche, New York is my favourite movie of all time, and is a surrealist movie focused on many themes, some of which (in my opinion) are those of existential anxiety, neurotic obsessions with perfection, internal fragmentation, and the importance of every small person as crucial element of the whole of society. In this movie, >!at a certain point, the main character begins writing and rehearsing a play in a gigantic warehouse to be his magnum opus. As time progresses, the play is never finished, but evolves in constantly self-referential ways, with actors hired to play the part of people in the main character's life, and then actors to play the actors themselves, inside a second warehouse within the first. Eventually, the main character even casts someone to play himself in the play and actually gets replaced by another actor (in what many claim to be an allusion to transgenderism). This muddles the line between reality and fiction ever more in a movie which barely has any footing in reality anyway. !< The Rehearsal is sometimes compared to Synecdoche, New York due to this \"actors playing actors\" fact.\n\nI personally find that Synecdoche New York is the closest I've ever seen to Fernando Pessoa's body of work. Fragmentation laid bare. Every feeling that was ever felt and will ever be felt is, in a way, in this movie, because everyone is in this movie, and no one is.",

That's the main crical strategy.\n2. You need to know very well the numbers of you business.\n3. You need to show how your products are much better than your competitors.\n4.

Got great at it. Raised money. Then realized I had no idea how to sell the actual product to actual customers because I had never studied them with the same intensity.\n\nThe investor pitch is a one-time performance. Customer conversations happen every single day and they compound. Every customer call you walk into unprepared is revenue you left on the table.\n\nWhat I do now before every important customer call: I pull their LinkedIn, their company blog, their recent job postings (tells you what they are investing in), their Glassdoor reviews (tells you what is broken internally), and any podcast appearances. Feed it to Claude and ask it to roleplay as this person pushing back on my product.\n\nThe job postings thing is the real cheat code nobody talks about. If a company is hiring for a role related to what you sell, they have already decided to invest in solving that problem. You are not convincing them they have a problem. You are convincing them your solution is better than hiring someone.\n\nOne customer call where I did this prep resulted in a 6-figure annual contract. They literally said \"it feels like you understand our business better than most people who work here.\" I did. Because I spent 2 hours studying them like they were a final exam.\n\nThe meta lesson: preparation is the most underrated competitive advantage in business. Most people wing it. The ones who don't, win disproportionately.",

          "text": "Great if it worked for you, I would put me off however.\n\nSome background: I'm part of a local investment group, an initiative from a private bank. Think we are around 60 ppl atm. There are days when there are 20-30 pitches scheduled, and we know beforehand what kind of business it is and when they pitch, so we don't have to be there all the time (though of course the bank always makes sure there are at least 5 people for a pitch, and sometimes if you see something interesting you recommend it to the others and they get to pitch a 2nd time). If you want in it's up to you to decide your size: e.g. once I invested 3k while someone else invested 80k in the same business (total was € 125k). Obviously there are different tiers of investors: I'm small potatoes compared to some captains of industry. Which is what makes this actually work: as a small potato I am often quite involved, which sort of reassures the big potatoes. I think it's an awesome concept and the bank does a great job with their recommendations.\n\nAnyway, it's very obvious when someone has tailor made their pitch to score a particular big potato. And I'd say 90% of the time it has the opposite effect. However what is true in my experience, is that investors like to ask the same questions. So being prepared for those is definitely a positive (mine for example is how they see themselves collaborate with other companies).\n\nSee it like going on a date: being too cheesy is a turn off.",

For example a quite old fashioned business wanted to go digital to scale, so I was kept in the loop and could review all design/business decisions, attended ~10 meetings over the course of 1,5 year. Meanwhile big potato will ask me in an informal way/setting how it's going with the project from time to time.\n\nThe upside for me is threefold:  \na/ I can get in these potentially lucrative projects really early without having (to risk too) much capital, i.e. much less than those who these projects are typically presented to first. \n\nb/ I can have a direct impact on the success (think the difference between having access to the significant experience/expertise of 5 small potatoes for free and not having that access).\n\nc/ I have direct access to really big potatoes, with some on a personal level, which opens up all kind of other opportunities.\n\nNow there have been instances where a business of one of the investors (including mine) gets chosen as an external partner/supplier if it makes sense.

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

Also buying is so much less ego driven because you are basically paying for validation. The part that interests me is how you find deals most people ignore. Are you hunting small marketplaces or just networking in indie communities. Also how do you avoid the garbage like fake MRR screenshots, inflated Stripe revenue, or founders hiding churn. I love the idea of operating from Dubai long term once things scale, and free zones like Meydan make it easier to structure properly, but the first step is finding real deals.",

You inherit problems, yes, but at least the market already paid. Curious what your top 3 reasons for a deal to be a hard no are. For me it would be one channel dependence, high refund rate, and support heavy product. Also would love to know what your playbook is post acquisition. Like do you improve onboarding, pricing, or marketing first. If you’re running multiple assets, setting up a clean base like Dubai through Meydan later can make operations smoother.",

My only question is what your due diligence checklist looks like for these sub $10k deals. Like do you prioritize churn, traffic sources, support load, or tech debt. I’ve seen small SaaS deals where the founder is basically the product and once they leave, it collapses. Also how do you handle payment processing and legal structure early on. I’m Dubai based and eventually set up through Meydan for clean invoicing and banking, so I’m curious if you ever relocate entities or just keep it simple.

Do you focus on customer interviews, product stability, or marketing growth. Also where do you host your ops and legal.

Nobody noticed til it was too late because the rats looked like they belonged there.\n\nThat’s literally what’s happening to the internet right now. Bots everywhere, on every platform, and you can’t tell anymore because they all sound like that one overachieving kid in class who read the textbook twice.\n\nMedieval doctors wore bird masks and prescribed leeches. We have AI detection tools that are wrong half the time. Same energy honestly.\n\nThe plague ended when the rats ran out of people to infect. This one ends when AI runs out of human content to train on and starts eating its own output. We’re watching the internet develop mad cow disease in real time.",

So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

How much risk am I willing to take in the supply chain?

If the problem you're solving doesn't come up organically, that tells you something critical.\n\nOne question I've found cuts through everything: **\"What did you try before, and why did you stop?\"** That answer reveals the real buying criteria, because it tells you what actually matters enough for someone to attempt a solution, and what bar that solution failed to clear.",

If I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now. Any day off I take is a day I don't get paid. You get the issue.\n\nLast November I started building my first SaaS. Content tool for text-based platforms. Launched it, got some early users, learned a ton. My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\n\nLooking back at the last 4 months? I'm nowhere close.\n\nI'm heavy in tech, 15+ years. I've launched ecom stores before, so I'm not new to building things. But SaaS growth is a different game. It's slow. And I'm impatient.\n\nRight now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground. Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here? Am I being naive thinking I can replace $20k/month in year one? When should I kill my SaaS and move on to something else?\n\nAny advice here is appreciated",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

Raising your rates is such an underused tactic, because all those want-to-bes repeat the \"passive income\" bs because they don't know better.\n\nThere are two paths in your situation and they are not exclusive.\n\n1) Change the terms with your current clients\n\n2) Find better clients\n\n1) I would try to educate them on the benefits of paying a set monthly investment (don't call it retainer) to future-proof your relationship. Tell them you're raising prices 30% for your other clients, but if they agreed to a 12-month contract with a monthly fee, you'd be happy to forego that price increase for them, and only them, because they are such great clients. Blame the change in pricing on your business partner or board or whatever, even if you don't have one.\n\nIf they don't want to commit, raise your rates.\n\n2) Could your clients refer other clients to you? You'd even bump them up into your 'VIP program' for 2 months for free as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOtherwise, go through your list of LinkedIn connections who may be in the market for your service and write to them. You're launching a new service (even if you don't) and thought they may be interested or potentially know someone, and you'd be happy to give a referral fee.\n\nYou could also start posting on LinkedIn, even though it's a slog with the latest changes and takes a long time to get traction.\n\nCold outreach also works. Just learn how to find your ICP with [apollo.io](http://apollo.io) or clay and then use LinkedIn DM, email or call.\n\n\\------------\n\nI've been down a similar road where I bought multiple e-commerce businesses to replace my consulting business, but I should've done it more slowly and not drained the cash cow too fast, and instead raised my rates sooner.",

And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible. But it's exceptionally rare. Don't base your livelihood on an the stars aligning.",

Transitioning to a SaaS model is a smart move, especially since you’ve already had some early users.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar position was focusing on building a minimal viable product (MVP) quickly. This way, you can test your ideas without a huge investment of time and resources. I spent a lot of time figuring out what features my users really needed versus what I thought they needed, which can be a game changer for product-market fit.\n\nAlso, consider leveraging the feedback loop from your early users. Their insights can help you pivot or refine your offering, making it more attractive in a competitive market.\n\nI worked on something that streamlines that journey from idea to MVP, which made it easier to launch and iterate quickly.

Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

Killing it too early is often a bigger mistake than letting it crawl alongside income.\n\nIf the product doesn’t show clear pull after users actually depend on it (not just signups), that’s usually the real signal to move on\n\nIf you ever want to spar on this, I’m Dutch too happy to brainstorm.",

          "text": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

Optimize the thing that works: Raise consulting rates to $35k/mo, work less, bank $25k/mo for 24 months. Then burn on SaaS with runway.\n\n2. Bet on SaaS now: Accept $12k/mo for 2 years while building. If it fails, you restart at consulting.\n\n\n\nChoice #1 is mathematically safer for someone with mortgage obligations.

Keep consulting but get pickier. Raise rates, fire bad clients, buy back time.\n2. Use that time for SaaS. Even 10 hours a week compounds.\n3. Don't quit until SaaS hits maybe 30 to 40% of your consulting income AND is growing.\n\nThe \"save runway and quit\" approach works if you're single with low expenses. With family and mortgage? Too risky.\n\nAlso consider: your SaaS doesn't need to replace 21k. It needs to replace your minimum viable lifestyle. What's the actual number where you're fine, not comfortable but fine? That's your real target.\n\n4 months is nothing for SaaS. Most take 18 to 24 months to get real traction. The ones that blow up fast are survivorship bias.\n\nDon't kill it yet.

Here's what actually worked:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth first:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou probably won't replace $20k/month SaaS income in year one. The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have < $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook. The boring answer is: you do both, longer than feels comfortable, until the SaaS can actually support you. Usually 18-24 months, not 12.\n\n\n\nWhat does your SaaS do, and what's your current MRR/user count after 4 months?",

What are you selling?\n2. How many are you selling per month/per year?\n3. At what price?\n4. Is the revenue enough to pay for business expenses,  taxes, your living expenses and contribute to your retirement?\n\nIf you have a realistic true answer to these questions a 5 year old or an 80 year old will be successful running the business. \n\nDo you know how your business will make money? Is it realistic or a dream hope?",

Everyone's journey looks different. \n\nAs for your original question, I officially started my business at 40 and have been very successful. I honestly think the 20 years spent working a corporate job was vital to that success.  It gave me the opportunity to truly understand the industry from a lot of angles.\n\nAt the same time, I decided about 5 years in that owning my own business was the end goal.  That gave me 15 years to plan and save so that I was able to start out without partners, investors, or loans.  That was key to my ability to be competitive with more established businesses right out of the gate.  If I had started out in my 20s it would have been much harder.\n\nIn my experience, there are a lot of things that might cause you to fail at being a successful business owner.

Before that I spent a decade working at other peoples companies, convinced I was \"learning\" when really I was just comfortable.\n\nThe kids building things at 16 have one advantage: they dont know what failure looks like so they arent afraid of it. Thats it. Everything else favors you. You have context for real problems. You have savings (or at least a credit history). You have professional relationships. You know how businesses actually operate from the inside.\n\nMy first company flopped. Built it in stealth for 8 months because I was paranoid someone would steal the idea. Nobody cared. Not because it was bad, but because nobody knew it existed. I was 33 and felt like a complete idiot.\n\nStarted again at 34. This time I talked to 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code. Within 6 weeks I had my first paying user. The difference wasnt talent or timing. It was that I finally had the maturity to do the uncomfortable thing first instead of hiding behind the fun stuff.\n\nThe honest truth about starting at 35: your biggest enemy isnt age. Its the voice in your head that says you should have figured this out by now. That voice is lying. Most successful founders I know started their winning company after 30. The ones who started younger just failed more times before they found the thing that worked.\n\nYou have maybe 30+ working years ahead of you. That is an absurd amount of time. Start now and stop comparing your beginning to someone elses middle.",

But after 2 years I realised I don't want to spend my life working 14 hrs a day.\n\nThen I moved onto building a product. 2 companies came and went. A news agency, and a dating app. Didn't work out.

      "text": "Hi after my husband lost his job due to being laid off last year while his boss approved our new apartment knowing he was about to let him go\n\nWe tried applying to jobs non-stop and got nothing so we decided to start our own small business or so we thought and it failed because clients don't want to work with people from Africa even though we speak fluent English (no strong accent either) and have worked with international clients before \n\nWe offered a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\n\nWe've had meetings with potential clients non stop\n\nBut ghosted us relentlessly and ignored even by those who posted they were looking for help\n\nSince last year October we've been living in what feels like hell\n\nSelling all our belongings not because we are lazy but because we arent being given a chance to work\n\nWe can't even secure a client for 300 or 200 a month nothing nobody seems serious even the ones posting jobs\n\nWe've started to grab at any kind of work even toxic work underpaid exploitative rates just to survive \n\nI'm not sure what this world is turning into\n\nWe've gone from having a good paying salary and freelance work on my end to nothing since last year October when our savings ran out since his lay off in April\n\nWhat is happening?\nIf I go online people say don't beg for work we did try to approach people with value and what we can do\n\nA reliable team yet I’ve been wondering whats next should we beg for work?\n\nAlso worst part is everyone online assumes every person is a scammer\n\nThanks to the amount of scams going around online especially on Reddit\n\nWe even had to ask money from everyone we know and people treat us so poorly and judge us like why don't we work when we spend some nights looking for work/opportunities, we do everything possible to overcome our situation\n\nMeanwhile bills keep piling up\n\nI'm not sure what to do anymore, none of us want to beg for anything we just want to work and prove our skills\n\nPlease no negative comments.\nI'm even typing this not sleeping late night on my side.\n\n",

What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered. Wanting to work and contribute already says everything about you.",

Create case studies, loom videos, or free audits that prove competence before the call. Trust is built before the meeting, not during.\n\n3. Target companies that already hire remote/international talent. Look for \"async-first\" or \"distributed team\" in their job posts.\n\n4. LinkedIn outreach with warmth. We built a tool (ReactIn) specifically because cold outreach was painful. The key is engaging with their content first, then reaching out. Not the other way around.\n\nThe market is hard, but 300/month is achievable with the right positioning. Dont give up. The first yes will change everything.",

It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

          "text": "Hey guys, freelance UK marketer and solo agency owner here, really sorry to hear how hard it's been, the economy has been beyond brutal.  Wishing you the best and hope things get better for you soon.\n\nI've utilised marketing contractors and agencies from all over the world during my 10 years or so doing this, both solo and on behalf of clients. Here are some things that I think would help you:\n\n- Website, make one. Seriously. I won't hire any freelancers without a portfolio or website. Even an Upwork profile with some portfolio pieces and feedback, or a simple Wix with some links will do. If I can't see evidence of some work somewhere, I don't trust you - this rule applies to anyone I screen regardless of location.\n\n- I sell a lot of services, but I pitch one thing as an opener. For example, first website I made started as a graphic design and content creation project, first PR retainer started with a website copy overhaul, first strategy consultation as copywriting etc. \n\n- As such, don't pitch for retainers, do one project really well, then open up subtly about other services. I learnt this selling for marketing agencies before I went solo. You need to prove trust as a small company with some wins before the client invests. Pick the 3 things you're best at and proven in as your opener.\n\n- Niche down in industry. I offer a lot of services through my own skills and subcontractors, but I'm in a tech niche that I have a network and 10+ years experience in. If you don't have one, find something underserved with less competition. No one wants general services anymore, you either specialise in a few or run lots in specific verticals like luxury, D2C, local businesses, AI, games, telecoms, SaaS etc\n\n- You're understandably scared and I can read it in your text, no offense. Potential clients smell fear a mile away. It's a confidence game. Find something, even part-time or low paid, to keep you afloat. Building a business is very hard with no safety net - been there many times in my career and it sucks. Truly. \n\nBusiness always improved, ironically, when I felt good in of myself and sometimes when I was doing a low-paid job and felt some financial relief. Get some rest, make some time for hobbies, animals and friends, you're both working hard and deserve it 💜",

I know that is absurd, but it's the simple truth. Africa, in particular Nigeria but a few other areas as well, including South Africa, have become centers of scammers. Honestly, it can be a non-stop onslaught. Some want to scam businesses, some want to scam individuals, but many of us know someone who got caught up in one of these scams. \nIs that brutally unfair to all the honest folks like yourself to be the lumped in with people you've never met and countries thousands of kilometers away? Yes. Yes it is. Is that the reality? Yes. Yes it is. \nThat's what you're up against, at least in the North American market. I think you can overcome it, but you'll need to address it.

But I want to share something that might help reframe what's happening.\n\nI went through a period where I couldn't land a single client for 4 months. Not because I was bad at what I did, but because I was selling the wrong thing to the wrong people in the wrong way. I kept pitching \"digital marketing services\" which is what every freelancer on the planet offers. There was nothing for a prospect to grab onto.\n\nWhat changed everything was getting brutally specific. Instead of \"we do digital marketing,\" I started saying \"I'll set up your abandoned cart email sequence and you'll recover 5-15% of lost sales within 2 weeks.\" Same skills. Same me. Completely different response rate.\n\nThe painful truth about service businesses is that \"a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\" sounds like everything and nothing at the same time. When a client reads that, they think \"this person does a bit of everything\" which translates to \"this person isn't the expert I need for my specific problem.\"\n\nPick the ONE thing you're best at. Not the 5 things you can do. The ONE thing. Then find the specific type of business that desperately needs that one thing and can't do it themselves.\n\nAlso - and I say this with zero judgment because I've been there - when you're desperate, prospects can feel it. It changes the energy of every interaction. The meetings where I finally closed were the ones where I genuinely stopped caring whether they said yes because I'd accepted that I'd survive either way. That mental shift is almost impossible to fake but it's the difference between \"please hire us\" energy and \"here's what I can do for you, take it or leave it\" energy.\n\nYou're not failing because you're from Africa or because you lack skills. You're failing because the positioning is too broad and the desperation is leaking through. Both of those are fixable.",

I can use Claude code for 20$ a month and gemini for additional 20$ to cover almost every need, from research, to development and image editing, and they work 24/7 without complaining asking for raise etc. Your skills need to be better than that and it's obviously not. And that's sad reality now. You won't lose job due to ai if you already have one but you definitely will struggle to find new one if your skills are low! \n\nSo it's not about you can't find the job, it's about noone can find the job who have less skill level than middle. You would be better off finding local jobs or increase your skill levels. And definitely better to be specialised on specific aspect and not everything at once!\n\nThe best way to find the job is word of mouth, not applying to random places and offering as cheap as you can. If you have something great to show the employers will propose the work to you instead!",

You need to surround yourself with a vision and a purpose. \n\nIll tell you about a struggle I had in business today. I was trying to sell a customer a kitchen. He was excited and ready to pull the trigger. THEN we started talking about his bathroom and eventually he decided he wanted to do a bathroom first. I didn't take his money even though he tried to pay me multiple times. \n\nIts because of the mindset and culture I developed. \n\nYou never want to step over dollars trying to pick up pennies.\n\n I had a new salesperson with me and I was trying to teach her the ropes. She didn't understand why I didn't take the guys money. \n\nWe got in the truck and drafted 3 different proposals to the customer. The kitchen, the kitchen AND bathroom, and the kitchen and 2 bathrooms. \n\nIt wasnt an easy decision to turn him down, but the culture is luxury and we dont want to chase the small jobs. It puts you in a downward spiral. You reminded me of that when you said you wanted customers to pay you 200 or 300. That signals you are cheap and no one worth it is cheap. \n\nAnother thing. Probably the MOST important.\nHave you tried praying about it? If you seek for financial gain, you'll most likely not receive it. If your higher power can't trust you with a little, hes not going to bless you with a lot",

          "text": "Okay as someone that runs a business, and i've built many. I'm also also a father of ten children from 7-33 years old.\n\nBreathe.\n\nThe key is you have to find your path. It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

                  "text": "My passion has always just been business. I love the process of researching an industry and learning the supply chain and the channel's market. I spend countless hours researching seemingly mundane industries. I try to find the corners that need to be thought around. A lot of people assume that these big billion dollar corporations have everything tied up tightly.\n\nWhat I seem to find is that there are tons of crumbs. These opportunities that I find look like severe risk. Usually, there is a lot of risk. Just in the fact that the companies that you're competing against can crush you by giving the parts away for free, if they really wanted to. Especially in the first few years, getting traction.\n\nThat's why my channel to market is direct.Calling the customers and bypassing distribution channels traditionally established. I don't do online advertising or online sales or any marketing.Because that shines a light on me.And I don't want the biggest players to see what i'm doing until it's too late. Once I control the market share, I can do anything I want.But by then, marketing doesn't really help me gain customers.Because I already control the market.\n\nIt's a long slow process. It's full of dead ends. To me, it's the ultimate game, though better than any video game better than my passions for rock, climbing or sailing or surfing. To me it's the last life or death game.That man has that we can play with.\n\nThe goal is to find the value to bring to the market place. That might be by rewriting the traditional distribution chain in an industry. Combined with revamping the channels to market. Or it might be bringing the first import version, always of higher quality. At half the price. It might be taking a part that's been used one way for decades and finding a new life for it.\n\nThere's so many ways to build wealth out there through opportunities. But everyone's looking for the shortcut. When it's hidden in the work that they're trying to avoid. There's never a guarantee in any of the research of the searches. It's just like playing with puzzle pieces.\n\nThat's what i'm passionate about. I would sell dirty diapers if it was moral, legal and ethical. And it fit my principles, and I could find a way to bring more value to the marketplace.\n\nMy next ten year goal is a billion dollars in revenue. We fire surpass the need for money ourselves. But we have a lot of charitable giving that we feed, and that'll be never ending. So my wife and I have decided that we will never stop.And we will work until the day we die.",

Most people do not start with a clear business idea that feels meant for them, that usually comes after doing something boring or messy first. The internet makes it look like everyone woke up with a genius concept, but in reality most ideas are discovered through action, not thinking.\n\nGiven your situation, unemployed, low capital, not technical, working from home, you are actually in a good spot for service based things rather than products or SaaS. Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind. It usually just means you have not done enough experiments yet.",

Okay, so basically, I was in the same scenarios where you are right now. And like I was struggling with almost seven years. I was, I have been confusion while choosing what should I do? Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief. Because your beliefs are not your beliefs, okay, right now. Your beliefs are from The world that shaped  you from the people around you that you. So what pattern I have noticed in myself and I think you should also notice in yourself, maybe you can relate with me. So I'm just honestly sharing my journey a little bit.\n\nSo maybe it will help you out. First of all, taking validation, yeah. What do i mean by taking validation? If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes. And whatever the thoughts coming in your mind, maybe related to your business or anything, you will get the answer. Just do it for at least 7 days and you will maybe get the idea that you are looking right now.",

Most real businesses start as “this kinda sucks, I’ll try to make it slightly better.” Boring > brilliant. Don’t pre-optimize problems you don’t have. Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced. Product businesses are harder, slower, and riskier early on. You don’t need to be an expert yet. Pick something you’re slightly better at than average or willing to learn fast.\n\nAlso: SaaS being “trendy” doesn’t mean it’s the path. I didn’t code when I started either. Most people learn after committing, not before.\n\nThe biggest trap is waiting until you feel “ready” or confident. That day never comes. Start tiny, embarrassingly tiny. A $100/month win beats a perfect idea that never launches.\n\nIf you take one thing from this: clarity comes from action, not thinking.",

          "text": "As a starting point, you say you're stuck between product vs service? You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

I do own a small cosmetics manufacturing business that pays for the bills, but doesn't seem to grow beyond where it's at now, so I was supplementing things with doing a little IT consulting here and there.\n\nI decided to stop pursuing to grow the cosmetics manufacturing and focus on the IT work back in November so I put an ad in the local newspaper closest to me. That's the one that's yielding me a much busier flow of customers. \n\nThis week, I asked to be put on two more remote towns that are about 30 minutes and 1 hour away from me. I know each of those ads will yield me another 1-5 calls a week each, but what I decided to do there was to charge a 2 hour minimum per visit. I'm sure some customers will turn me away because they'll find the rate to be too ghih, but if I can get 1-2 at 2 hours minimum, then it's worth the drive. I have an EV which costs me next to nothing to charge.\n\nIf I'm busy that week, then I quote a higher rate. \n\nI'm hoping that, with time, I can eventually hire someone who I can send to the further off places while I service the locals. \n\nI used to do this many years ago and had 5 techs working for me at one point, but started to pursue several startup ideas and spun my wheels. One of the startups is on automode now and gets me a couple of grand a year, but definitely not the millions I was hoping for haha.\n\n\nThe ad reads:\n\nThe top is\nLocal techs\nAt your service\n\nThen a list of the services I offer and to the right of it, there's a picture I generated of a \"nerd\" using AI.\n\nBelow that, it says:\n\nIf we can't fix it\nYOU DON'T PAY\n\nThen my number.\n\nVery basic. You can do this with anything, house cleaning business, etc. \n\nThe above only works in small country towns. Not in cities.",

Nobody tweets about building inventory management software for auto parts distributors. Its not sexy. It will never go viral. And thats exactly why competition is low.\n\n2. The customers are easy to find. They are literally posting job ads for roles that exist only to manage these manual processes. If a company is hiring a \"data entry specialist\" or \"operations coordinator\" you know they have a process that could be automated.\n\n3. Switching costs are insane. Once a company builds their workflow around your tool they will not switch for years. Thats recurring revenue with almost zero churn.\n\n4. You dont need venture capital. These businesses can be profitable from month one because you are replacing a salary not competing for attention.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that the best tech businesses solve problems that are too boring for most developers to care about.

For local SEO the biggest thing is setting up Google Business Profile, thats free and gets you showing up in map searches for \"nutritionist near me\". On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff.

And overall, is it ethical type of self-promotion?\n* At what point does it still make sense to invest in seo instead of reallocating effort elsewhere?

          "text": "What I’ve seen with my clients is that SEO didn’t disappear, it just stopped working the old way (in some way)\n\nFor example, I have clients who technically “did SEO” for years. Blogs every month, indexed, keywords sprinkled everywhere. Traffic was flat and barely any leads. When I looked closer, the issue wasn’t effort. It was clarity.\n\nOnce we simplified things, clearer homepage, clearer service pages, clearer explanations of what they actually do and who it’s for, a few things happened:\n\n* Google traffic became more relevant, even if it wasn’t huge\n* AI tools started referencing them for very specific use cases\n* Leads understood the offer before the call\n\nI’ve also seen the opposite. Clients with strong authority or lots of content, but vague messaging, rarely show up in AI answers. The systems don’t know *when* to recommend them.\n\nSo to your questions:\n\n* Traditional SEO still helps with visibility, but it’s mostly the foundation now\n* Blog content works when it explains real problems and use cases, not when it’s just “content”\n* AI visibility isn’t random. The pattern I keep seeing is clear explanations + consistent language across the site + getting your brand mentioned in various places\n\nhope this helps",

It’s basically a 'ReadMe' for LLMs so they can ingest the site's context without the HTML noise.\n\n   2. Batch PDF Generation: Mass generation of multi-page PDF blueprint manuals from our existing pages. It creates an additional SEO source that LLMs seem to like citing as an authoritative source.\n\n   3. Programmatic Video: Recently started using Remotion in CLI to automate video creation based on the same data.\n\n  Just making sure the data is available in every format an AI agent might want to consume.

          "text": "Great find - this thread nails the exact shift happening right now.\n\nTraditional SEO is getting tougher for startups because people increasingly ask AI (Perplexity, Claude, Grok, etc.) instead of typing queries into Google. The answer often comes from the model's interpretation/synthesis, not direct site ranking. If your startup gets distorted, omitted, or lumped with wrong competitors in those responses, even solid on-page SEO won't help much - decisions happen before anyone hits your site.\n\nI've been digging into this a lot lately. One thing that's surprisingly effective (and underrated) is actively auditing + optimizing how LLMs perceive your company: what labels/associations/strengths/weaknesses they assign, where the perception gaps are vs. your real positioning, and targeted fixes (content tweaks, new angles) to make the model \"get\" you better. It's like GEO but focused on closing the reality vs. AI-narrative gap, which directly impacts early-stage discovery and trust.\n\nFor bootstrapped founders especially, this can be a high-leverage move cheaper/faster than scaling paid ads when the narrative is off.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with AI-perception tools or seeing real lifts from it in 2026? Curious what approaches are working beyond classic SEO. If anyone's curious, I can share more on how we've approached it for our own stuff (no pitch, just real talk). 😄",

Spent months on SEO for solution-category keywords that had almost no volume.

Skip the keyword stuffing garbage and just be clear and helpful. When people search or when they ask an AI they should be able to understand your value quickly. \n\nCheck out what agencies like RH Blake or Convince & Convert are saying about this because theyre working with real companies dealing with the same shift. Dont overthink it just make good stuff.\n\n",

I have trained smaller companies and individuals before but this is a whole beast in itself. From logistics, to fulfillment, to continued support after the 5 day training is over.\n\nI don't know how many of you are in the same position as I am but if you are in a spot where your back is against the wall, take it as a sign that you are exactly where you need to be. I have never felt pressure like this in such a long time because I was used to training employee sizes of < 50. Now I 20x it. \n\nInsane.\n\nI remember telling myself the key to make more money in business is to solve bigger problems. This is me solving a bigger problem. My back being against the wall is just what comes with it. It is situations like this that causes you to expand your knowledge base, your understanding as a business owner, and your willingness to adapt.\n\nI would love any feedback from anyone who has done huge training sessions for businesses before (does not have to be ai focused training). How did you fulfill? How long did you work with the enterprise for?\n\nI'm excited to deliver for this huge enterprise client but I'd be lying if I said I was not scared haha. Let's do this!",

Start everyone from the basics and give them a very streamlined 80/20 path to proceed. \n3. Backup your back up plan with another back up plan - something will always break\n4. Get help. More people makes a difference. Especially at your scale. \n5. Make it memorable. Emotions massively improve memory. Having jokes, active gestures, asking questions, and bringing energy is a requirement if you want them to be successful in the long term. \n6. Make it as active as you can for your students.

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this. Just don't forget to breathe during the first session 😅",

      "text": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

You're building your skill-set, you're building your _name_, you're building yourself.\n\nMaybe you are the product currently, and without you there's no business, but that is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nThe easiest way for you to become an entrepreneur would be to hire an employee, and to teach them your way of working, now you've got two products generating income for your company. When you start scaling up to 5+ people it starts to make sense to take stock of what work there is in your company, and who should do this work, but for now it's all stuff you've done, which means you should be able to teach someone how to do it.",

You essentially need to productise the service, experience good and bad recruitment, adjust KPIs to align with margin requirements, monitor and implement quality controls, codify all knowledge into processes. These things take YEARS to get right.\n\nI'm all for encouraging OP, I think it's great they're aware of what they want and what their gap is. But I think it's a hard journey to go on that I see many founders struggle with. In fact, it's more common for me to meet founders that are still delivering the sales/service, than those that have largely freed themselves.\n\nI believe setting expectations is important so that OP can prepare themselves for what's next and ask themselves if it's worth the struggle (like you said - nothing to be ashamed of being a freelancer).",

The next step is asking: what systems, processes, or assets could generate revenue without my direct involvement?

To me entrepreneurs have way more options than employees, can create a ton of flexibility and create systems. I’ll end my response with a suggestion. Check out this old classic called The E-Myth Revisited. You might’ve seen it or heard of it or possibly even read it.  I hope It’ll be incredibly eye opening for you as it was for me 3 weeks ago when I listened to it on Spotify for the first time. Best of luck. This exact thing is addressed btw.",

You left the E quadrant thinking you were starting a B but it turned out to be an S. I did the same thing too. I “escaped” one Matrix just to land in another one LOL.\n\nA similar quote gave me a wake-up call: “If you can’t leave your ‘business’ for a month and it runs without you, you don’t have a business, you have a job.”\n\nI’ve shut down several “businesses” after realizing this.

Like a workshop or productized service. It’s the middle of the road. Active income has a 1-to-1 time to money ratio. Leveraged is still linked to time, but the ratio is better. I’m currently focusing on leveraged income as I build more passive.\n\nBTW, some books that helped me with your frustration are The E-myth, The Cashlow Quadrant, and Built to Sell by John Warrillow (good advice even if you don’t want to sell your biz).\n\nBest of luck 👊🏾",

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point. \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

AI for customer comms. not chatbots, but actual voice AI that handles inbound calls, qualifies leads, books meetings. we've seen companies cut response times from hours to seconds. the tech is genuinely good now, most callers can't tell the difference.\n\n3. AI for research and summarization. feeding it docs, transcripts, competitor pages and getting structured analysis back. saves hours of manual work every week.\n\nwhat i'd skip: most \"AI marketing\" tools. they produce generic content that doesn't convert. and any tool that promises to \"automate your entire business\" is overselling hard.\n\nstart with one painful workflow, automate that well, then expand. trying to adopt 10 AI tools at once just creates 10 new problems.",

Great for strategy work.\n\n📋 Outreach & follow-up agents : they draft personalized outreach, reminders, and sequences based on brief inputs rather than manual writing.\n\n🧠 Knowledge assistants : manage internal docs, product specs, meeting notes, and make them searchable via natural language.\n\n🪄 Content co-creation agents: help turn an idea into a structure, then into actionable drafts (not just fluff). The best ones give you *framework + context*, not just words.\n\n🤖 Workflow orchestrators:  agents that can chain tasks (e.g., scan email → summarize → propose actions → send replies) are still emerging, but super powerful when configured right.\n\nFor many teams, the ROI isn’t a single tool:  it’s how you *embed* an agent into a real workflow (e.g., weekly competitor summary + task suggestions, or automated status updates).\n\nCurious: what’s the biggest bott your team wants to remove first :  research, writing, communication, or execution?\n\n",

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely.

Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder.

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date & time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

Also, by no means would a payment due at time of service policy  be out of the ordinary. \n\nMy advice for what it’s worth don’t let someone else tell you how to run your business. You’ve taken time to set up systems that make you successful.  It’s okay to say this is my policy.  You’re not required to explain it or change it because someone doesn’t like it. It’s your business.",

There is a script, a syllabus, and a safety net. It’s a space for NPCs to follow a path where the walls keep the \"monsters\" out.\n* **The Entrepreneur Matrix:** A vast, open battlefield. It’s a transition from a protected role to being a player with zero XP. No tutorial, no quest markers, and no guaranteed respawn.\n\nIn the first system, the goal is to keep everyone in line. In the second, the system is simply indifferent.\n\nLeaving the script behind doesn't mean the simulation ended; it just means the difficulty was dialed up. It’s a bigger, colder Matrix than most realize, and the real game only starts once the safety net is gone.\n\n**The question isn't just about leaving the cage...it’s about**   \n  \n**ARE YOU Ready for a world without a script?** ",
