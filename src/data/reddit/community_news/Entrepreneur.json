      "text": "Hi everyone. Please excuse any mistakes; English isn't my first language.\n\nI've been learning Python on my own for a few months now (i recently finished CS50P). My dad told me to stop programming simple games and create something useful, so i took his advice.\n\nI contacted a local clothing brand that was having trouble with their catalog photos. They wanted professional-looking photos of models but didn't have the budget for a photoshoot.\n\nWhat i built:\n\nI wrote a Python script that takes the flat images of their products and runs them through an AI workflow (generating variations, scaling to 4K, removing watermarks). It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business. He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before. My questions for experienced entrepreneurs:\n\n1. Is it a bad idea to accept an advance when I'm still learning?\n2. For those automating businesses: What are the safest and lowest-risk automations\n\ni\n\n1. should propose first so\n\ni\n\n1. don't accidentally ruin their business?\n2. How do you deal with \"imposter syndrome\"? I feel like I got lucky with the first question.\n\nThanks for reading.",

You were paid $500 for a script, job done. Now they will ask you ad-hoc to create other scripts for them. That's it. Their business doesn't rely on you and if it does that's their problem. You are just 1 kid who can script a bit. Remember to ask for help if you need it, from the business and others.\n\nGood luck!",

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

Just because it doesn't feel like \"so difficult it's worth 500$\" doesn't mean that's the case: it's \"easy\" because you've got a skill, one which your CEO wasn't able to fill until now. That has value.\n\nBy the way, people learn by doing first and foremost, if there was no struggle in it you wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nDon't accept an advance in my opinion - there's nothing worse than trying to retroactively meet an objective just because they already paid you and you owe it to them; start working, and if after a month or two it's too difficult foor you, just explain it and part ways. But I think you have talent and this is a great opportunity.\n\n--------\n\nTo not negatively affect mission critical business data, **it's very important you research best practices**. Always back up data before you modify it for your tests; even afterwards keep the backups in case you sneak in an error you didn't notice. Learn about proper testing methodology to detect errors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, test driven development.\n\nI could go on forever, but really learn what are the best practices in whatever you do, they are your friend and they exist for a good reason.\n\nFor workflow automation software, I used make.com in the past and it was nice, and also recently n8n has gotten lots of hype.",

You don't know security infrastructure, you will not be doing anything that could compromise customer/company data.  This is for senior level coders, and they screw it up all the time.\n\nYou will be over your head at times, but your luck you will be able to use AI to help you, reddit, stackoverflow, etc..    \nYou should also try to find a mentor who knows a lot more than you.    \n  \nCongratulations on the script that did that for them.

They like you.  They want to see you succeed for years to come.  The retainer offer may be too much for the work you actually do, but then the owner may like you, and want you do even more, like expand your services for their website into other areas than product representation.\n\nIt is up to you to come up with those ideas.  And bounce them off the owner.\n\nWhat I would not do yet, is go to his direct competition and offer the same.  Why?

If you're this nervous, what I would do is come up with a plan for the business owner to pay for Terms-of-Work:  Negotiate \"I will automate X process for Y dollars\" and then only get paid when you are done.  He sees you as a much cheaper solution than an adult, and he's right about that, you also need to set his expectations as a gifted teenager who is still in the learning process.\n\nGood luck, and pursue this!

This is a good option if the customer is not a techy. But if you know layman techy steps you are good with wordpress. You anyway spent 1200usd for ads. You can run them here too. Wordpress is amazing with seo. Build your search engine identity.\n\n2.build using a custom techstack like angular or react. Complete control of everything including UI, UX, data, features. But this comes with a high budget. Comparison with wordpres this can be 10 to 15 times more. But scalable, complete ownership, can be copyrighted. This is how a enterprise works.",

We thought we were being smart.\n\nBut the result is that now the internet is just noise.\n\nI'm a solofounder. I don't have a marketing team. The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users. Maybe the answer isn't a better tool. Maybe is just doing the work we are trying to avoid. ",

I had a similar issue when trying to get better at LinkedIn.\n\nWhat actually helped me was making LinkedIn a daily habit instead of just posting randomly. Now, I focus on a list of the people I want to reach. I check only their posts, leave real comments, and then send connection requests. After they accept, I send a short, personal message. I also keep track of who I need to follow up with each day.\n\nTo keep a targeted feed of prospects and draft comments and messages, I use **Depost AI**. It helps me track follow ups so I don't miss anyone.",

I've found that engaging with potential users in a meaningful way not only builds trust but often leads to valuable feedback too. \n\nWhen I was starting out, I focused on reaching out to a handful of people who genuinely needed my solution, rather than casting a wide net. It’s more work upfront, but the relationships you build are so much more rewarding. \n\nIf you're looking for a way to gather insights without losing that personal touch, you might want to explore analytics tools that help you understand user behavior better like [Personnn.com](http://Personnn.com), for example. Just remember, at the end of the day, it’s about human connection!",

I replaced myself as CEO about 16 months ago and am completely lost. I have built a large business, many in fact. But because I recently I replaced myself with a more capable leader in my largest company and now feel completely useless. I don't run anything anymore. I dont hire/fire. I check in biweekly at most. I almost lost my key staff today because I have been so overbearing and basically not trusting them as well as second guessing decisions. \n\n  \nThey gave me their 60 day notice today, and I refused to take it, instead we agreed that I would work on my seperation/reactive attachment issue. I need to stop interferring with the people that put in charge. We agreed to make goals with deadlines, and if I interfer 1 more time, they will quit. If they dont meet the goals and deadlines that they set, I will ask them to leave.\n\nNow my identity. \n\n  \nMy entire identity for 20+ years has been building and running businesses. I get mailbox money now that I dont earn daily, which sucks trust me. I am having issues in my marriage and home life because I am misrable knowing that I literally have no business purpose any more. \n\nYes. I should be happy. But I am genuinely miserable. I have a beautiful family, beautiful house. I have had more sports cars than most athletes. This is not to boast, its to send a clear message. None of this is or ever made me happy (Except my family, love them! :)).\n\n  \nIm sitting here as a multi-millionaire, with so much business intellect, and 0 outlet. I dont want to make some cheesy course, or consult. \n\n  \nI just want to talk about business, day in and day out, I have owned and invested in so many markets because its all exciting to me. But the internet has created a somewhat nasty reputation to anyone who wants to help people solve problems.\n\nQuestion: \n\n**How if at all, can I genuinely help people when they are building or built great businesses?**\n\nI thought about angel investing and mixing fun content like dave ramsey when people call in, I thought about interviewing other successful people (easy to call on when I mention who I am). \n\nI am not gatekeeping info, Ill help if I can, but the few people that I have tried to help publicly, like instagram and such, just want me to invest. Which I have in the past, but most times I say no. And most times they need someone to hand hold. Not anwer questions.\n\n  \nPlease help GODS of reddit! :D \n\nGenuinely appreciate you for listening",

Also, I became a bit distant being away from all my employees and I know that caused resentment with a number of my staff and managers in multiple locations.",

As someone about to finally do something with my LLC I have a million questions and no one to ask them besides strangers on the internet. If your goal is to help people, and not get boring or money hungry pitches all day, I feel like your best bet for fulfillment would be mentorship. Or helping people who aren't even at the investment stage. Watch something grow from just the idea, helping with budgeting and gov docs, taxes etc. Might not be exciting, but if you believe in the person or in the idea, you could scratch that itch without needing to sink all your time and energy into it. Then again, if things not being under your full control is a problem area, that may need to be addressed prior. Alternatively, create. Seems to me a lot of broke creators are really happy, and a lot of rich people tend to lack that outlet.

Take the family on vacay to some island.  Go to one of those Tony Robbins seminars in Fiji.  Or just listen to the audio of his programs.  The personal development programs in your case, not the business programs. Trust me it will really help to find out what you want. It sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are now and what you want.\n\nWhat problems in teh world could you solve? If you have that amazing business ability, can you put it toward creating charitable organizations that would truly help people? Here and in other parts of hte world? A spiritual search maybe might aid this.\n\nBut before doing anything it sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are at this stage of your life and what that looks like without this or that business. Is that all you are?  If they all went south tomorrow, and you were left with nothing, no businesses, no cars, no fancy house, no fancy clothes, who would you be?  Would you give back?  To who? Would you pick up a long ago abandoned interest or hobby?  What type of person would you be?  What really matters?  Who in your life really matters? What would you notice that previously got lost in the whirlwind. Are you missing things in  life that are right in front of you? Material things come and go, and in the end you can't take them with you. Some major event could happen tomorrow that affects all of it. What's important is the people around us, relationships and what we give back.\n\nOne of the good clarity exercises Robbins talks about is the Rocking Chair test -where you imagine yourself at the end of your days, sitting in a rocking chair, and imagine what you are glad you did and what you regret, and what you regret NOT doing. My paraphrase.\n\nSome therapy is a very good suggestion if you have the right therapist.  Good luck to you.",

We judge ourselves and others by what they do, how much they have, what status they hold etc. Size them up, evaluate them, respect or disrespect them based on that. But is that a real measure of someone?  In some other cultures outside the US, it's considered offensive to ask what someone does for a living.  It's considered more appropriate to ask what someone likes to do or what their interests are.\n\nOne life event, one major disaster that disrupts the economy, one environmental disaster, then none of that matters. For perspective, imagine someone who might have owned a store in Ukraine, or owned an apartment building, or who's been a big shot in this or that. Now those same people are fighting on the front lines together in a town that is unrecognizable.  No one cares if the person next to them was a big shot or an ordinary guy, a saint or a sinner.  Zombie apocalypse, indeed.\n\nHave fun doing the Robbins seminar.  Cheers",

We were 23 years in, when we sold.  And within about a week after life changing money showed up in bank account, I found myself staring at an empty calendar and wondering what the hell I'd done.

It's changed a lot in ten years.  There are entire forums of ex-founders who have moved up to chair or sold the firm. You may need to advocate for yourself to get into one of these - but I expect you'd find the conversations gold.\n\nOne last thought?  don't jump into anything too quickly.  give yourself some time to adjust, as hard as that is.

I feel like we are right at the tipping point, but not sure we have the capital to make it through. Insurance reimbursements can take a long time to pay out, so while we just had a good month, we are struggling to pay expenses because we are probably 4-6 weeks from actually getting the payments. At the same time we’re reconciling a lower revenue per patient (the reason our revenue isn’t matching our projections). So it seems like the solution is additional locations so we can have a higher patient count, but I might be stuck putting up the capital myself, which I really don’t want to do since I might have to reach into my own pockets to cover expenses while we wait for payment anyway. What do you think we should do to solve current cash flow problems? Try for an AR based loan or something? And what should I do as far as the future of the business? Wait until it can support additional locations on its own? Or fund it myself?",

Tackle hard questions and help contribute to scientific progress where there is a legacy and purpose beyond just profit.\n\nSame with charitable giving in general. Sustainable charity work is hard to come by - supporting charities building systems that benefit their communities and help their members improve their situation is very similar to your Dave Ramsey idea, because those folks aren’t looking to sell a startup for a specific ROI they’re just looking to create a living that improves their life. And mentorship in those spaces is entirely possible. \n\nSimilarly, helping non-profits build a non-donation based revenue stream is something that can feed your need for building while also having a higher purpose than profit. Meaning helping charities be less reliant on donations - as global giving can fluctuate and it helps ensure their long term survival. (They can’t make a profit of course but they can do activities that generate revenue).",

Knowing the mistakes you made, your approach to leadership and where your mental health is, are you really ready to offer mentorship or to start something that is focussed on impact and not income and growth?\n\nThis is a similar story to an acquaintance of mine. He built a business over a number of years and sold it last year. He pocketed millions and stills gets a residual income off the business.\n\nAfter he transitoned out staff moral and employee satisfaction went up, churn went down, quality went up. Despite being a big and busy business he was never able to let the people he hired do the job...he was an angry, overbearing micromanager.\n\nOn the outside he became unbearable to be around. He has spent years working insane hours and only thinking about and talking about business and money. He forgot how to have a day off and keep himself entertained or mentally nourished.\n\nHis kids are now grown up, starting university and absolutely do not need him trying to help...they got this far without dad being a reliable, supportive presence so why now.\n\nHis wife has her own life, hobbies, friends and a job and will probably move out soon.\n\nThey don't have any real memories of being a family together. Family vacations were actually his wife taking the kids on her own while he stayed buried in the business.\n\nOf course he thinks he is the one that has sacrificed so much to give his family a 'life' but I think they would have been fine without the trappings of...things...if they had a better family life.\n\nSo anyway this is a long way of saying to literally go for a walk in nature every day, turn your phone and emails off, play with the kids, do housework, see your friends, have lazy days on the couch, go on a trip...for a year...you are burnt out and have trained yourself to only think one way.

We also work on a blockchain wallet that must be as easy for end-users to use as possible, so they don't need to know anything about crypto, and that provides the ecosystem around it.

Have you taken the time to wind down from years of cortisol filled days and accepting that is time to fully close a chapter? It seems to me that it will be good to start with Journaling your self reflections and starting to vocalize or in this case write down these feelings. I can tell you are a problem solver by how successful you have been with your business for the past decades. Writing things down may help you to not just get it out but materializing these feelings into something physical may in a way kick in your problem solving skills on solving the big problem of inadequacy that you are currently facing. Life is short, there is so much more to see and learn, even maybe teach as well as a way to give back in a way. \n\nHave a good life, you have the tools for it at your disposal.",

Build that person up, build your business up, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis might allow you the ability to get back in the trenches with small teams, build people back up and mentor them again, and build a portfolio of assets that will cash flow for you.\n\nAs for the team at your current business, one of the greatest lessons I learned from a CEO from a large company, was don’t try and be involved in everything. You hired these people because they are talented, capable, and you have to get out of their way and let them do what they do best. Doesn’t mean you fully walk away, but at that stage you’re prob going to be set at setting direction and objectives and letting them figure it out and execute.",

I want to help and drives me to do so. Its honeslty overwhelming at times. My 2.5 yr old daughter is why i do it. I hope she can have a better life then i did in my war torn childhood. (When i was 9 i was shot. Burried alive in mass grave. Crawled out at night. Over the river and through the woods. Into hands of evil and a concentration camp.) Now i am here for a reason. Funding businesses and solutions is what i am good at, but only enjoy the people who are kind, honest, and really want help from me. 1000s have just tried to use me. 1000s of investors, brokers, banks, etc have \"backdoored\" me.... its been a wild ride, and i have learned a ton. Hopefully one day i can take less on, have a good team to depend on. I do everything myself. From intake calls, strategies, solutions, UW convos, presentations, and work is on my mind 24/7.\n\nIts the challenges of my industry and the rewards are great. But doing it all by myself is going to run me dry one day. \n\nI don't know why I typed all of this out. Thank you for reading. We can always go fishing together If you want.  We can bring the kids! \n\nThat be nice. \n\nEnjoy a bit of time off. Sounds like you and i need just a small vaca. Enjoy the little one.

Honestly, I really wish that I would have just kept doing what I loved which I now come to realize 10 years later is company building. I should’ve just picked another project. Let those checks come trooping on in, but then picked something else and did what I loved before learned everything I count about something new figure out how to make it happen , execute..

And the other thing I was thinking of if these dont resonate with you, you could always start from scratch, find a passion project, make it hard for yourself and give yourself a limited amount of capital for your start up. So for me i have to work a day job to pay for my buisness. Im 2 years in now and its been a grind. If i had a pile of capital I could be so much further ahead, but im not in that position yet, but im getting there slowly. Most people would love to be in your position, but i definitely get it, we all need purpose no matter where in the wealth scale you are. So you could Give yourself a challenge and imagine your starting off from scratch again with $10k in the bank to start a buisness. I imagine someone with your knowledge could scale that pretty fast to a $100k or more, but it could be a fun project for you and its you doing all the work.\nGood luck with it all man, ive been through my fair share of depression and it sucks, but it does get better, just remember to keep your family close, love them and dont lose them, there the most important",

          "text": "You know. In a completely different way I understand.\n\nEnd of last year I lost my Mom to stage 4 cancer (still getting used to saying that). Soon after her memorial service the startup I worked at ran out of money and couldn’t pay me (I am still waiting for that payment). I ended my contract with them with immediate effect (they ghosted me for weeks) and put so much focus into finding a new job.\n\nSitting around and not doing what you are used to doing is a killer and the breakdown was quicker than I expected. Your routine starts to feel pointless really quickly.\n\nThe only way I could solve this was to give myself a different outlet. I chose to look at my weak points in my career and learn more. With my strong points I spent some tome collecting my thoughts and understanding where my value is. It slowly started to make sense to me.\n\nFrom what you mentioned, you are an amazing person with amazing skills but toning down like that can be a major hit. I think writing about what you have learnt would be an amazing start. Heck, if you do sign me up. I would bloody love to learn how you managed to reach this point. The beautiful part is that you could potentially build a community that you could collaborate with and that may just give you what you are looking for.\n\nThere will definitely be haters though but I feel that maybe readers will be a little more receptive to your advice.",

          "text": "I’m going through a similar problem. I have a large portfolio of real estate that brings in enough money for me not to have to work. And if I do get a job, the pay will amount to the rent of one of my assets. So a job won’t make sense. So I am stuck in this situation that if I got a job, I will not be able to take care of my assets (some are overseas so I need to travel). But sitting at home drives me nuts. I’ve managed to find a way to survive though.\n\nI go to the gym in the morning. Or I go for a swim. Exercise helps expel all that energy that’s irritating you; all the energy you were using for business. So vacant days are for exercise. Then you will have days where you need to run some errands, like checking up on your businesses. Or you can decide to travel somewhere. Or you can write a book. I’m writing a book addressed to my daughter, for example; and I’m pouring in all my life experiences and giving her advice on life. Even if it never gets published, I can gift it to her. Plus it’s very therapeutic. \nAnd also there’s other things you can get into. I’m in real estate, and I’m itching to try a business. You’ve tried business; why not get into real\nestate? Build something. Buy a building and rent it out. Real estate is great for the kids. It’s easier for them to run a building than a business. And it’s more difficult for your kids to squander a building or real estate assets; very easy for them to squander cash or sell stocks.\n\nYou just need to fill up the first half of the day with something like exercise, or a side project, or writing. Or maybe take yoga classes. Then after lunch, spend some time with family. Or take them out. My father, a retired lawyer, goes to a poetry club every morning, then goes back home for lunch, then brings his friends over for a card game, or he goes to one of his friends and plays cards. He has a driver, and a cook. So his driver takes him everywhere. He has managed to keep himself busy.\nAnyway, good luck. And be sure that the whole busyness phenomenon is a modern thing. Ancient Romans and Greeks used to spend much time in leisure. That’s how philosophy was invented 😂 No need to keep running around. Enjoy life!!!",

You can do a lot? THINK BIGGER.\n\nMy first thought was, why not go into private equity as a sub division? That litterally meets everything here. And no private equity isn’t just for billionaires. \nBut most billionaires have done it through private equity, also you build long term aswell, you talk business day in and day out and do that? Basically make your empire bigger, instead of consolidating.\nWould get assets for yourself instead of gambling on “markets” you’re a business owner/founder/ceo/entrepreneur, not anything else. \nYou invest in markets that’s basically modern day gambling or secure 10% at most. Unless you’re in that game and have an edge then it’s more iknow. Investing in markets for founders and ceos, should only be done with an edge or capital gains. Stop going for fking 10% at most. Also it’s not an asset in reality. \n\nPrivate equity or a subsidiary company of the current company and build an empire? \n\nInvesting in markets for people like you it’s stupid, iknow we all get the advice and iknow most want you to go through this. But the actuality unless you’re an employee or professional in the markets or have an edge. You should NOT do it. \n\nAssets also that’s gonna make the family happy and yourself in the process, they all want you to be happy and they want to be secure, right now? You need a purpose and stop gambling cause that’s how the women see it. They do not understand it, it’s gambling and they hate you see gambling away your success. \n\nAssets > normal advice (matrix shit)",

I have been struggling with moving from idea to producing because of doubt and wanting to do everything myself and make it perfect. I over analyze my decisions and cause delays, mainly because of my fear of failure and its possible impact on my family.  I have a lot of people depending on me and have been teetering on pushing my startup back a bit and getting a \"real job\" as has been mentioned by some family members.  But all of the people in this thread have been so empathetic and encouraging with great ideas. It makes me want to keep going! \nTo @BOWLeader- you are an inspiration! To hear your passion and what it has done for you is awesome. I'm sorry you've found yourself in a challenging spot. And it sounds like you've already conquered the hardest part which is being aware. And then taking the step towards fixing it. That's a place many never make it to. \nIf you do decide to mentor-my hand is raised :) But I also think self care is most important now.  I always wondered why there weren't more therapists that specialized in specifically helping people impacted by their career, in some way or another. Because when it's your passion-it affects your soul, that cannot be helped. \nI don't have any better advice than the more experienced people have given.  I'm a 50 yr old newborn entrepreneur. So I will just throw as much luck and blessing towards you as I can!",

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

I think if your going to go down this route, a wise choice would be in Marketing and building trust and showing that you are the best which will allow you to charge a higher rate which in turn if your doing it as a whoel buisness, your margins will look nicer! \n\nJust my two cents.",

When everyone can ship fast, speed stops being an advantage and depth starts to matter again.\n\nOversaturation usually shakes out into two paths. A race to the bottom for generic, easily copied offerings, and a smaller group that survives by being closer to real-world constraints, customers, or physical systems. That’s probably why unsexy and physical products feel more attractive right now. They’re harder to fake, harder to clone, and harder to undercut overnight.\n\nIt feels less like the end of entrepreneurship and more like the end of “easy” entrepreneurship. The next cycle rewards founders who can combine tech with domain insight, patience, and real execution, not just ideas.",

Everyone uses tools like Cursor and Windsurf and our engineering velocity has at-latest doubled if not tripped over the last 1 year without adding new members! So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

Customers are way happier now, response times went from hours to seconds. \n\nThe funny part is we're using AI for shit I never expected - like it analyzes our sales calls and tells us exactly which phrases close deals. Turns out saying \"let me show you\" instead of \"let me tell you\" increases close rate by like 18%. Who knew?\n\nStill figuring out the content side though. Our AI writes decent blog posts but they're kinda... soulless? Human touch still wins for anything that needs personality",

We built a triage system that now handles about 60% of incoming volume autonomously. Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now. Can't really imagine going back.",

          "text": "From my experience talking and consulting to many founders and entrepreneurs, I believe, the most useful skill set isn’t something fancy or trendy. It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Also depending on your age . For me I started in my early 20’s my entrepreneurial journey while trying to secure my undergraduate degree. Which lead me 20 steps ahead of my peers simply because I matured a bit faster because of a business,and I had a backup plan if I didn’t choose the path of my degree. Early 20’s ? Your peers won’t understand your hustle . Some will Later despise you for getting ahead . the top is lonely . and even if you don’t consider yourself the top of whatever business you’re in , you can be at the top of your environment. \n-tech savy \n-most importantly, don’t let it consume you . Have a life outside of your business. Yes , you will be in a learning curve at the beginning, but don’t structure your business to where you are working at it every single day . You will burn out and start to hate what you do . The true perks of being an entrepreneur is making your own schedule , time freedom , and not having a boss to respond to . \n\nI feel like I’m rambling , lol but good luck to you !

Learning how to learn fast\nMost skills you’ll need don’t exist yet when you start.\nIt is super valuable to learn stuff on your own (no big courses on big colleges) mastering one tool upfront, but not being affraid to switch and learn a new one that is better.\n\n3. Basic financial literacy\nYou don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand:\n1. Cash flow (not just profit)\n2. Your costs vs margins\n3. How long you can survive without revenue\n\nA lot of good businesses die just because founders ignored the numbers.\n\n4. Prioritization & focus\nEarly on, everything feels important. Well, its not.\nThe skill is knowing what not to do:\n1. Features that don’t matter yet\n2. Perfection too early\n3. Shiny opportunities that distract from revenue\n\n5. Emotional resilience\nThis one surprised me the most.\nYou’ll deal with:\n1. Rejection\n2. Self-doubt\n3. Slow progress\n\nBeing able to keep going without constant validation is a real skill.\n\n6.

These tours routes already exist. She lives in Northern Wisconsin. Trip #1 was Branson, MO. took her a while but found companies who put this all together.  She didn't put anything down but blocked a bus 9 months in advance. Went to every old person event in her town, neighboring towns, talked to senior groups, etc. They asked her what she got out of it - she got a free trip if she got 20 signups (true) but if the bus got over 40 (IIRC) everyone beyond that number was 50% profit to her.  Trip 1 she got like 30 people - and she didn't do a thing but enjoy the trip and helped wrangle people with the tour guide (college girl).  \nTrip 2 was easier as something like 75% of them who went before signed up with her again (following fall) and filled the bus. Trip #3 filled again.  Over time she built a network.  She gets about $10k/trip and does 2 trips in spring and fall. She also gets commission/referral to a travel agent that people use for Disney/Europe etc. Don't know exact numbers but was told she makes $60k annually, loves it and is grooming her daughter.  \n\nShe could probably do more if she spent some money on facebook ads to supplement her in-person visits.\n\nTyping this out has me wondering why I don't do it.",

I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises. There's 4000 different franchise concepts available. Many are not restaurants. \n\nGreg Isenberg launched ideabrowser. Everyday they post a business idea. They're always unique but once you read them you think \"yeah, he's right.\" Example from last week - building a database of where people are buried. It's a real problem. Not sexy.

Then the willingness to pay is actually insanely high. \n\nThe market is saturated at the low end, but there’s still a real shortage of high-quality execution. 2D/3D rigging is a great example: top-tier riggers are expensive and booked out for months.  \n\nI am personally in the ai companion space for example. There are a quite a lot of them just simple ai wrappers just there for a quick buck with insanely high churn rates. But now if you really understand anime fans and actually designs around anime fandom culture (collecting, community, roleplay, stories), there’s room to build something people stick with. In my case i am getting pretty good roi in what i spend in ads and so on. \n\nAnyways, the market is great if you can create something high quality or offer high quality services .",

The second I see or hear \"this one change/this one product/I was never the same after x) I swipe past it. Long form content with experts also usually helps guide me to a sale, but rarely if the person being interviewed is selling the product (outside promo for performances e.g. music/comedy). Who is your customer? I have never once logged onto linkedin, but I don't market to finance bro's or execs. I dont market on facebook even though its extremely easy to dual post with meta. I don't market to 40 plus moms. Instagram and tiktok are the way for self-producing and self mixing musicians in the digital space.

If your buyers need trust, context, or to “get” how you think, socials tend to work better because they see you over time.

It’s less about which channel is better and more about where your audience already is and how much trust is needed before they buy. Plus you can always keep them informed of new products and sales etc, look at clothing stores or other physical product businesses, for instance. Never neglect the power of a \"click here to get 20% off your next purchase with us\" in a newsletter.",

You don't need orchestration and enrichment and all this other stuff until you're doing real volume.\n\nThe real question isn't \"what tools\". it's \"what's the bottleneck?\" Most of the time when people are switching tools, they're avoiding the real problem. their sales process sucks or their reps can't sell.\n\nApollo, Clay, Zapier... all fine tools. But none of them are going to teach your team how to isolate objections, do proper discovery, or actually differentiate from competitors. That's what drives revenue.\n\nSo before you go chasing the next tool, ask yourself this: can your team consistently close 30% of qualified leads?

So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation.

Not generic thanks for your hard work, but this bug you fixed at 2am saved this customer, this decision you made kept revenue stable, etc. People kept those.\n\nAnother great one was extra paid time off that was framed properly. Not here is a day off, but take a long weekend on me, no Slack, no guilt. That one hit harder than cash.\n\nIf you want something tangible, give them choice plus context. For example, a meaningful budget with a note saying use this on something that makes your life easier outside work. Flights, gym membership, a course, childcare, whatever matters to them.\n\nThe common thread is this: make it personal and make it about trust, not productivity. People remember being seen more than being rewarded.",

          "text": "I do elaborate scavenger hunts and parties with prizes for my team. It's honestly so much fun and is so great for team building. If your team is in person I can't recommend it enough, and if they're not then I would honestly arrange some sort of online scavenger hunt or trivia they can work together on. You can give them small, inexpensive prizes throughout and then like everyone else suggested a bonus at the end. \nThis does depend on your budget though. If you don't have the budget to give a decent chunk of change then give them a great experience to show you care.\n\n\nMy staff honestly works hard and despite how infuriating managing people can be, my income is because of them.\n\n\nHalloween this year I turned our business into a haunted house (I do this every year with a different theme/story). For our party I set up an elaborate scavenger hunt where a witch had put a curse on the business and they had to work together to find parts of an incantation they could use to summon the witch who cursed us and vanquish her. Lights out, only lit by electronic tea lights which they had to form into a circle and stand inside of to summon the witch once they found all the parts of the incantation. I had my dad and a friend dress up in some gnarly/hideous witch costumes and scare them. Used blue tooth speakers and some animatronics along the way. Last year it was my BIL hiding in the furnace room with a mask and a machete. Hearing them scream honestly just warms my heart every year. It's honestly so cathartic and they have SO much fun and talk about it with all of our clients and their friends and family.\n\n\nI skipped Christmas this year because everyone was sick but I was going to have a krampus come in and scare them. Saving it for next year.\n\n\nValentines is on the 7th and I'm doing a high tea for them, dress code is the fancier, the better. I've designed a giant galentine's (we're all women) board game for them which is actually coming along and will be so good! They work through toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, women's health and social issues (just board game spaces, not actually and I've kept it funny and unserious) and at the end of the game, the last square is \"Self Actualization\". To get there they have to roll dice, square off in trivia and activities like flip cup, summon each other for help with scavenger tasks where they can all work together to advance on the board.\n\n\nThe board game pieces are instax photos of them that will be taken when they arrive for the party. Small prizes like chocolates and lip gloss, hair clips etc...throughout the game and the winner gets a teddy bear, heart earings, and a tote bag. \n\n\nI share all this because I AM SO EXCITED for it but also because it will cost around $500 and be a great party. It's a team of 10 right now and a $50 cash bonus would really just be lame, so for them this is much more fun with the budget. It gets everyone talking about the business in a fun and positive way. People who don't work for me keep trying to get invites but we are excluuuusive!\n\nTeam does $40k - $50k monthly. If you're creative you can honestly still put something fun together on a scrappy budget. I'm all up in the dollar store for these things.\n\nEditing to add that I also had a fortune teller come in for the Halloween party and do tarot readings for them! Also doing mini photoshoots at the Galentine's party 🥳",

              "text": "> Hollywood is dying\n\nHollywood has been dying since it started. I would prefer specifics to general statements. The old method of making movies is dying off, I'd say, but only partially. The physical necessity of being on location in California to find actors and make movies is pretty much done. The rise of AI and other 3rd party platforms (Netflick, Youtube, and other internet platforms) does lessen the 'path' through Hollywood.\n\n\nBut people still are making movies, shows, hiring actors, making effects. So maybe starting your own part of the old system is the path forward. An example of this is Reese Witherspoon: she started a book club and has 1st right to book options that can be made into movies, based on her book club's feedback: essentially, crowd-sourcing film scripts. A24 was started in 2012, focused just on interesting films and directors Hollywood seemed to have ignored, and turned into a tour-de-force, putting out interesting projects every year. Maybe something similar for TV shows can be done? Or Youtube? I know Netflix is trying, but they have so much money it's actually causing them to cancel shows earlier in their prime rather than suffer through declining ratings. That's an issue that needs a fix.",

Plus your inbox is flooded, with emails that only contain part of the conversation. Are you looking at the email with the whole conversation? Or only part? You got a reply, but are they replying to an email with the whole conversation? Or are they replying to an incomplete email? Trick question. They are all incomplete because there is no central repository tracking the exchange as a single conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has email. You make a contact all the way across the world? They have email. Random customer who has a product question? Email.

I’ve been doing it that way since I was 14.\n\nThe first thing anyone should do is sit down and write out all the skills they already have. Real skills. Things you know how to do that someone else would pay for. Most people underestimate this part.\n\nFor example, fixing computers. It sounds outdated, but even in 2026 it’s often cheaper to fix a slow computer or remove viruses than to buy a new one. People will gladly pay $100 to get their computer back running smoothly, and they’re happy when they get it back.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing with simple services. A friend of mine started a mobile oil change business using his mom’s van. He’d drop her off at work, post ads on Craigslist, and spend the day driving around changing oil. That was it. Four, five, sometimes six oil changes a day. It worked because people value convenience.\n\nThe point is, you don’t need capital to start. You use the skills you already have and the tools already around you. When I was 14, I used my parents’ lawnmower, walked door to door cutting grass, and reinvested until I had multiple mowers and help. Eventually, we had over 30 yards, and I sold the entire client list to a larger landscaping company for thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are opportunities everywhere. You just have to stop waiting for money, permission, or the “perfect idea,” and start being creative with what you already have.",

Second close runner-up: Founders stopped over-polishing things that didn’t matter. Decks no one re-read. Features users didn’t ask for. Processes meant to impress instead of work. “Good enough” turned out to be a superpower.\n\nYour insight about removal is dead on.

I just have written out to me and deposited into my business account. I didn't get an LLC until about 5 years ago and and I didn't have business insurance until about 3:00 so I kind of dragged my feet on doing this. But I've always been making money with the business but it was always kind of a here or there thing really. The last 3 years was when I took it very seriously and it's really starting to scale and I made a lot of connections and I feel it's very professional but I had a lot of time where I could test stuff, work it out and just go slow with everything. So I would just say the hardest part is getting started and making money and then as that goes you can always refine it tweak it. Adjust it later",
