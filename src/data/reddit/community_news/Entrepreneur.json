      "text": "I run a small online plant shop, mostly succulents and stuff for apartments. Been doing it for about 2 years, decent side income that turned into my main thing last year. Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

We had some old windows the glass had been take out of and never really did much with them, so she cleaned them up and spray painted one side black and let it dry. Then she would find the perfect web and spray it gently with white, and before it could dry she would \"walk\" through the web with the black sheet of glass so the wet paint would firmly apply the web to the glass. She let it dry and then put the top piece of glass on and it was done except for the frame. She did one huge web on a large piece that came out almost perfect and sold it for $3,000.",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries?

      "text": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

Made some good profit on those (3k+ each) but those deals are hard to come by. \n\nBut keep in mind there’s also times where you hit big on a much cheaper watch.

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent.

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

Start with things that fit into gaps in your schedule. The dividend income grows automatically while I can dial the active stuff up or down based on work demands.  \nFor anyone starting out:  \n  \nBegin with one truly passive income source (investments)  \nAdd flexible side hustles that don't require set hours  \nAutomate everything possible  \nBe patient - took me 2+ years to see real momentum  \n  \nWhat side hustles are you all running alongside your day jobs?

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

          "text": "I know it's hard, or even seems impossible and pointless. I've been there, still there in a way. Put it to the side for now. There is no rush or time table on whatever you are working on... Just do what you can when you need the distraction. Don't do anything that will require your time, unless you need the distraction, or are sure you unable to be spending it with your loved one. I will share some of my story. I don't know if it will help or not, as I'm still not sure how it turns out....\n\nI quit my job (6-figures) last February to move 200 miles back to my hometown to take care of my father. He was  having a hard time and seemed to be going through early stages of dementia. My Dad in the 8 months before that lost his brother, his wife (step-mom) and his sister. He was best friends with his brother, extremely close to his sister, and married to his wife for over 40 years. The year before we lost his father and the year before that his mother. The lost seemed to take a piece of my Dad's mind each time. But I was just far enough a way to not see it... I talked to him 4 or 5 times a week but he was always according to him doing good. \nMy Dad and I have always been really close and if you ask him, his whole life he was always good, or fine. By the time I got here I instantly knew he wasn't good. It took a few months to find out he had stage 4 lung cancer, that had traveled to his brain, and bones. My Dad who was never sick, never had a surgery, or illness, and was the rock in my life. He was a good man, that was always smiling, and really cared for everyone he ever met. I only saw him mad a few times in my life, and never sad except when we lost loved ones.\nI dropped everything in my life the day he called me to ask if I had talked to his sister, my aunt.. who we lost 6 months before. I literally quit my job as a Program Manager at a Fortune 100 company, packed a suitcase, and drove the 200 miles to his house. I gave everything else I owned away to family and my wife of 30 years that I had recwbtly seperated from. \n\nI came here and since that day I took him to every appointment and treatment, watched him waste away all the way down to 85 lbs after the radiation treatments, cooked his meals 3 times a day that he just couldn't eat eventually, carried him to the bathroom, bathed him, and held his hand when he took his last breath on December 13th 2025. By then I was struggling to feed myself and keep the lights on. I scrapped up just enough to pay for the funeral. Now I have to be out of his home by February 1st and not sure what I'm going to do... probanly sleep in my car. Idk... \nWhatever happens I'm thankful for the time I had.. I'm haunted by it as well. He was who I talked to whenever anything happened in my life. I sometimes would put off something or whatever it was for days before talking to him, because I knew he would tell me the right thing to do.. and that was usually the hard thing I was avoiding. But that was the kind of person he was. He was good. In the 10 months we probably had 5 or 6 people stop by... He didn't want others to know or worry about him.. ever. But over 100 people showed up at his funeral. Many I didn't know. He was truly a great man, quiet, good looking, funny, talented, humble... and really so talented... as an artist, a musician, and really everything, he could literally do everything. The man was amazing and just so so humble. A professional musician his whole life. He could play any instrument since he was 6 years old. Didnt read music, you could just turn on the radio, hand him any instrument and he would start playing along with whatever was playing. He was a studio musician and recorded for a ton of names everyone would know. He was flawless thats why they hired him when making the final cut of a song or album. He also was a  business owner, and so much more. He was just good and I know I'm blessed to have had him as a father.  Sorry for going on. \nI'm still lost, I don't know how to deal with it or anything anymore. \n\nBut if you take anything away from my ramblings, just be thankful for whatever time you have left. Spend as much time as possible with your loved one. Ask them questions, make them tell you all their stories, experience anything they are still able to do... bring your laptop. There will be plenty of time between those moments to turn your mind to websites and whatever just to distract yourself from the doctor's office, or hospital room, or the nap they are taking. That's all I have. I will pray for you and your family. If you want to talk or need someone just to listen, im available.",

I've been studying these kinds of business frameworks lately for a project I'm building, and it's clear that clarity in your exit strategy is what determines the price.

Less day-to-day stress? Financial security? The answer changes depending on that.\n\nFor me, I sold because I was tired and $180K was life-changing money at the time. But your business prints $1M+ per year. Unless they're offering like 5-7x earnings, you might make more just keeping it and hiring a GM to run day-to-day.\n\nAlso exits sound great until you realize you just sold the thing you built. I felt weirdly empty after mine even though it was a win. Can't imagine selling something that big.\n\nGet a real advisor who knows your industry. Not Reddit. This is too big a decision for internet strangers. We can't tell you if the multiple is good or if you'll regret it.\n\nBut yeah if you just want less day-to-day, hire a GM first before selling. Way less permanent.",

          "text": "I've sold a few businesses.  It might look a lot of different ways depending on the type of acquirer and your own desires and goals.  It could be a larger property management company writes you a big check and you walk away immediately or in the very short term.  It could be a private equity leveraged buyout where you get a decent sized check but still own some of the company and work with your new lords and masters toward some bigger multi-year goals and a second payoff down the the road.  It could be a large corporate entity where you get a big check and become a middle manager employee doing essentially the same job you've been doing but now for a salary+bonus structure (contract or at will) under the umbrella of the corporation.\n\nI would start by asking one or more of those who have approached you.  Pick one who is actually in your business, not a broker or middleman type, and just have a chit chat about it.  But certainly don't just dance with one fella.  If you decide to get serious about working a deal, engage experienced help such as brokers and lawyers.  Cast a wide net and find the right deal for you.  I don't like to pay big bucks to brokers and lawyers any more than the next guy, but this is an area where professional help is a must.  These deals can get complicated and go wrong in unexpected ways, not something to be taken lightly.",

Usually because the buyer somewhat destroys the company culture after the fact. \n\nHowever, the ones who don't regret it are the ones who build a new business using everything they learned in their previous journey, and go to market with a nice chunk of capital to bring on great people from the start. \n\nI would say if you have another business idea that you've always wanted to take a shot at, it's a good idea to sell, but if you don't have another idea, and you're experiencing a steady growth rate, it likely doesn't make sense to sell it at this point. \n\nThat said, I do also believe in the concept that every business either dies or gets sold at some point, so likely better to engage in the latter. \n\nTake everything I say with a grain of salt as well, I'm no M&A expert, just someone who knows a handful of people who sold.",

      "text": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

          "text": "This is one hundred percent spot on the truth.\n\nI always remind myself that those giant Redwood trees in California have to suffer through decades of forest fires for their bark to grow thick enough to be able to grow so tall.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties, I wanted to be a business owner for fuck you money. When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business. You should always be testing new business ideas by first trying to find a customer. And then building upon that. Thats how many greats who started on a shoestring budget, without investors, did it.

          "text": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

I go without paying myself because the money just isn't there.

Truly insane being forced to honour “verbal contracts” aka conversations during reviews where nothing was promised other than a review of circumstances and a decision back turning into arbitration situations that wasted tons of time and money despite being provably in the right.

But that single number hides everything that matters.\n\nWhen you plot actual cohort curves (each signup month as a separate line), you see the real story: \n\n\\- Are newer cohorts retaining better than old ones? (product improving)  \n\\- Do all cohorts flatten at the same point? (you've hit natural retention ceiling)  \n\\- Is there a specific drop-off week/month across all cohorts? (onboarding issue)\n\nI learned this the hard way: our \"overall 80% retention\" looked healthy, but cohort analysis showed April signups retained at 65% while June was at 88%. Turned out we'd fixed a critical onboarding bug in May, but the blended average completely masked the improvement.\n\nYour bounce rate example is the same principle ... aggregates lie, segmentation reveals truth.

If some of them are driving disproportionate amount of churners it might indeed be a top-of-funnel problem dressed up as onboarding.\n\nIf that analysis doesn't reveal any insights, i'd deploy an in-app survey as the last step of account creation flow. Just one question \"What do you want to achieve today?\". Compare the answers with what your product does. If there's a mismatch then it's again an acquisition problem. \n\nIf none of the above indicates an issue, i'd say you need to double down on onboarding.",

Get feedback every step of the way.

This is a pretty common positive side for almost everyone. But no has really talked about the negative and dark side of the journey. Let me start with mine. I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

But reading your post and the replies, there's always people like us going through the same journey, same grind, this isolation doesn't feel so alone anymore.",

I never in my entire life saw a person without struggles. It doesn’t matter where you are what you’re doing. A few things are never in your hands even if you try to control them. Take an example of an athlete working and training his all life for one race which he needs to win or at least complete, but all of a sudden he loses the race because of an injury, what do you think about the athlete is he gonna sit there and feel very happy about losing the race or is he gonna learn from the injury and failure, train much more hard even after striving every single day and trying to overcome the failure. Improving, self-validations and making a better version of yourself needs discipline, validations and practice. A few times we might see some lows (which are temporary) and failures, which is good it helps in keeping the ego down.",

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\nEdited: Thanks for all responses and advices.",

Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply. But I don't know what I'll need to assemble a bed or fix the doorframe. Create a package. Assembly kit for product X. I'm happy to pay a small premium if you make my life easier.",

You can't outpace that. This is a generic example which can be twisted in many ways but you got the idea.",

I started with an idea that seemed solid, built it fully, and only then spoke with people who actually work in the field. Those conversations were eye-opening, they told me what they disliked about the tools they use every day.\n\nIn this case, it was Clay. Even though it’s one of the biggest GTM tools out there, there was still a major pain point: pricing for HTTP API enrichment which is a feature many teams rely on. That feedback made me pivot completely and build a cheaper alternative for teams that don’t have large budgets or don’t need the full product just to use one or two features.\n\nNow I have a few paying clients and I’m focused on marketing it.\n\nThe takeaway for me is that ideas don’t come fully formed. They evolve through use and feedback. The most important thing is to start, everything else can change along the way.",

It’s more like infrastructure for teams that want to stitch a lot of signals, data sources, and logic together. If you only need one or two enrichments over HTTP, of course it’s going to feel overpriced, you’re paying for optionality you’re not using. That doesn’t make your pivot wrong at all. In fact, it kind of proves the opposite point: there’s room for focused tools that do one thing well and cheaply. But I don’t think that means Clay failed to solve something, it’s just solving a different layer of the stack. Broad systems vs narrow utilities tend to coexist, not replace each other.",

You’re surrounded by people but you can’t really talk honestly about cash stress, doubt, or fear without killing the vibe. Another one is decision fatigue. Every small thing is on you, pricing, timing, what to build next, when to quit, when to push. It never switches off. Also the slow progress messes with your head. You can do everything right for months and still see nothing move, while everyone online only posts wins. And lastly, the guilt. When you rest you feel lazy, when you work you feel like you’re neglecting life. That tension never fully goes away, you just learn to live with it.",

If I notice I’m looping, I pause big choices and do something mechanical instead. Gym. Walk. Clean. Boring stuff. The mind settles on its own if you give it space.\n\nTalking helps too but only with the right people. Most people don’t get it and that makes it worse. Even just writing things down somewhere private helps unload it a bit.\n\nAnd some days you don’t handle it well at all. You overthink. You doubt everything. Then the next day you’re fine again.

Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

I help manage my wife's dental practice and we have seen a huge spike in patients finding us via AI overview mentions on Google and ChatGPT! Earlier it was mostly just google map and google searches!\n\nIn my experience, it's very similar to doing traditional SEO. Except the mapping is not one on one! But just improving our SEO helped with our AI visibility as well! We are basically the default answer for various queries in our locality. Specially here are everything we have been doing that seem to work\n\n1. Active Google Business Profile: If you are a local business, ensure your Google business profile is setup correctly with latest info, photos etc. Also ensure all your customers leave great reviews on there! Rate of new reviews seem to help more than total number of reviews\n2. Write Hyperlocal/specific blogs on your website: One thing that has immensely helped is writing hyper specific (and if local, hyper local) content on your website as blogs around topics your customers are already searching for on Google or asking AI. We have been publishing a blog every Monday! These days with AI tools like Frizerly, most of these are automatable as well! Just ensure it's plugged into Google search console so that it has the right data to work with!\n3. Get mentions and backlinks: Well earlier it was links that mattered but now it seems like just having your business or brand mentioned by relevant websites matter! There are many ways to do this like guest posts, signing up for local events, sponsoring events or you can even just pay and get PR! There are many services like Einpresswire that you can search around for this as well!\n4. Make sure your website is not broken: Last but not least, your website loads correct and quickly on all devices and phones and has a sitemap etc! These days most modern website builders like wordpress etc have most of SEO baked in, so you dont really have to over-invest! Just do a quick audit and ensure nothing is obviously broken!\n\nAnd that's about it! Hope this helps :)",

The AI models pull from their training data and real-time sources, so you need to be mentioned in high-authority content that's likely to be in those datasets.\n\nThe stuff that seems to work based on what our clients have tested: getting featured in authoritative publications and industry reports, having strong structured data on your site so AI can parse your info clearly, being cited in Wikipedia or academic sources if relevant, and building actual partnerships with AI platforms through their APIs or marketplaces. Generic SEO tactics don't translate directly because the algorithms work differently.\n\nReal talk though, chasing AEO right now is probably premature unless you're already dominating traditional SEO. The conversion data you mentioned is interesting but sample sizes are still tiny. Most businesses get way more value fixing their basic SEO and conversion optimization than trying to optimize for AI mentions that might send 10 visitors a month.\n\nIf you're gonna experiment with it anyway, focus on getting mentioned in high-quality content about your industry, make sure your brand positioning is crystal clear across all platforms, and structure your site data properly.

Showing up consistently and being genuinely helpful beats any clever funnel early on.\n\nReddit in particular rewards patience. The moment you treat it like a traffic source it stops working. When you treat it like a place to learn in public and help people, the right ones eventually ask what you are building. That 1 in 10 comment conversion you mentioned feels very real.\n\nThe DM thing is underrated too. Asking people what they are actually trying to do instead of pitching immediately builds trust fast and saves you from building stuff nobody wants. Early stage feels awkward but avoiding awkward conversations just delays feedback.\n\nCurious how long it took before the first real customer showed up. That waiting period is the hardest part and where most people quit.",
