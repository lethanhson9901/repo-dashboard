      "text": "Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

The vast majority of them have a layer of dust on them so thick that it’s clear she hasn’t worn them in a long time.  Some are in piles. I asked her to start small by throwing away five pairs, thinking this was a manageable goal that could lead to momentum in cleaning up the rest of their home. \n\nWrong.  She has made every excuse under the sun for why she couldn’t spare any time to this task.  I remind her every time we speak. That was two years ago. \n\nNow consider they have a 3500 sq ft home.  Every room has its storage depleted with her stuff that she doesn’t use.  \n\nUnfortunately I believe nothing will be cleared until after she passes.",

My mom has a memory of how she acquired a thing and who gave it to her. \n\nStill so much of what she has is junk.

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

I only decluttered and reorganized with new systems that would make staying organized easier for the client. And it looked great too :) \n\n\nI also offered maintenance subscription plans where I'd come back into the home on a regular schedule to reset the systems before they got too out of hand. \n\n\nI didn't clean or haul away trash or clutter, or work with hoarders or in dirty homes. If they needed cleaning, I had a housekeeper come in beforehand, and billed the client accordingly. \n\n\nYou are severely undervaluing your services. The good thing is, it sounds like you are in the right market, and there is a pressing need for these services. \n\n\nBefore hiring employees, which are a pain in the ass to manage, I would raise prices to the point where low-ball clients stop using you, but your schedule is still full.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n> Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

Helps put them at ease since they can still keep the pictures/memories while freeing up all the space decades of physical photos can take up. Can either help import them to their phone (ideally a cloud if they have the storage space) or have affiliate income with external hard drives and/or digital picture frames. If you really wanted to squeeze the juice, you could set up a sister company with a similarly-minded partner that then flips whatever they part ways with that isn’t garbage. Again, a win-win since it’s good for sustainability repurposing items instead of sending them to the dump, and it’s mostly profit with your clients paying you for inventory that you then get paid again to sell. Touch up and resell big ticket items like furniture, antiques, fancy garments and knick-knacks that can have collectible value, donate everyday clothes and housewares that just need a wash to be usable.",

Maybe pairing new hires with you initially or creating a clear process for sorting, valuing, and communicating could help.\n\nAlso, I imagine documenting your workflow , step-by-step checklists, how to handle sensitive items, and communication tips , would make it easier to scale without losing the personal touch.\n\nCurious , how did you handle the online sales side? Did you create any system for pricing items, shipping, or just do it ad hoc?",

My dad told me to stop programming simple games and create something useful, so i took his advice.\n\nI contacted a local clothing brand that was having trouble with their catalog photos. They wanted professional-looking photos of models but didn't have the budget for a photoshoot.\n\nWhat i built:\n\nI wrote a Python script that takes the flat images of their products and runs them through an AI workflow (generating variations, scaling to 4K, removing watermarks). It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business. He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before. My questions for experienced entrepreneurs:\n\n1. Is it a bad idea to accept an advance when I'm still learning?\n2. For those automating businesses: What are the safest and lowest-risk automations\n\ni\n\n1. should propose first so\n\ni\n\n1. don't accidentally ruin their business?\n2. How do you deal with \"imposter syndrome\"? I feel like I got lucky with the first question.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The only other option you have is just give up and never do anything ever.\n\nAlways charge ahead forward, knowing you will mess up some times and that is normal and where the best learning comes from. In fact, the more experienced you become the larger impact your mistakes will be because you are making bigger decisions, so your mistakes only become bigger over time\n\nNo reason to stress over it - the most successful people are those who made the most mistakes!",

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

Just because it doesn't feel like \"so difficult it's worth 500$\" doesn't mean that's the case: it's \"easy\" because you've got a skill, one which your CEO wasn't able to fill until now. That has value.\n\nBy the way, people learn by doing first and foremost, if there was no struggle in it you wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nDon't accept an advance in my opinion - there's nothing worse than trying to retroactively meet an objective just because they already paid you and you owe it to them; start working, and if after a month or two it's too difficult foor you, just explain it and part ways. But I think you have talent and this is a great opportunity.\n\n--------\n\nTo not negatively affect mission critical business data, **it's very important you research best practices**. Always back up data before you modify it for your tests; even afterwards keep the backups in case you sneak in an error you didn't notice. Learn about proper testing methodology to detect errors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, test driven development.\n\nI could go on forever, but really learn what are the best practices in whatever you do, they are your friend and they exist for a good reason.\n\nFor workflow automation software, I used make.com in the past and it was nice, and also recently n8n has gotten lots of hype.",

If you're this nervous, what I would do is come up with a plan for the business owner to pay for Terms-of-Work:  Negotiate \"I will automate X process for Y dollars\" and then only get paid when you are done.  He sees you as a much cheaper solution than an adult, and he's right about that, you also need to set his expectations as a gifted teenager who is still in the learning process.\n\nGood luck, and pursue this!

He probably will get you to sign a contract with those kind of clauses now that youve proven yourself but id make clear that the initial project + workflow was created  before the contract therefore its yours and the 500 was for you to deploy it to his business.\n\nI did a little python but nowhere near enough to script but its such a great language to learn so good on you. I can amend a little existing code but to tell me to code from scratch id be lost. \n\nExcel is a powerful tool itself, look into power query, learn the syntax of formulas, experiment with different functions in the formulas, play a little with macros for automation\n\nyou can record macros to start so the macro will repeat what you did every time its initiated. From there play with the existing code and see the stuff you can start getting it to do. When I started stackoverflow was your friend but tbh 9/10 nowadays chat gpt will tell you the solution without research",

You had a supportive partner who handled domestic labor so you could work 80 hour weeks. You had unpaid interns. You used infrastructure others built. You benefited from an education system. You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nWas on my couch last night playing grizzly's quest while reading another \"self-made\" success story on my laptop. Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate?

First off, I grew up relatively poor on a farm.  We weren't starving, but there was no financial help from my parents at any point in my adult life. As a matter of fact, it was me who was paying my parents bills when they got older. Couldn't afford college, so none of those connections. I went to work in the trades and spent 20 years learning the business and  living well below my means to save money \n\nWhen I say I built this alone, what I mean is that every step along the way the bucked stopped with me.  There were no loans, no partners, no backing, every dime was my money that I spent 20 years working and doing  without to raise.  Every piece of equipment, every stick of material, every dime paid for every service along the way has my sweat on it. Every decision, every bid, every success and failure have my fingerprints on them.\n\nMost importantly, from the beginning until today, if it all falls apart the consequences are all on me. I have never risked anything that wasn't mine to gamble. I never spent a dime of my wife's money, never used our joint accounts, and never dipped in to our household budget.  Nobody besides me loses anything if my business fails.\n\nOf course I've outsourced things. Of course I have employees. Of course they are vital to my business.  But they aren't here to help me grow my business.  They are here because I treat them fairly, have an awesome benefits package, and pay almost double the local rate for this work. Their positions are a result of my business growing from the risks I took to start and grow. I did that part on my own, with no guarantees and no safety nets.",

That’s real, and it matters.\n\n\nWhere I think the “no one is self-made” argument comes in isn’t to dismiss that, it’s to separate financial independence from human independence. None of us operate in a vacuum. \n\n\nPrinciples, work ethic, skills, and even what not to do usually come from somewhere, parents, tradesmen, early bosses, community, or hard lessons learned watching others fail.\nSo when people say “no man is an island,” I hear it less as a financial claim and more as a recognition that execution happens inside systems, cultural, educational, and relational, even when the risk and responsibility are borne by one person.\n\n\nI think both things can be true at the same time without canceling each other out",

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it? Being here in the comments, or with your friends, or even with other entrepreneurs saying, “I built all this with no help” - what is the value? \n\nReal question: is the value the motivation from the dopamine hit of pride/self-esteem? I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it. None of this is meant to be rude or condescending - genuinely curious about perspectives.",

Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money.

They are trying to think, decide, validate, and build all at the same time, alone. When things break, they blame themselves. This is something I always try to avoid because I’m also building alone, but I count on a group of friends that support me. Building alone shouldn’t mean thinking alone. Having structure and support isn’t cheating. It’s how people without privilege survive and move forward.",

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

          "text": "This part is very real and rarely talked about. The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction. What seems to change over time is not the doubt disappearing, but your relationship to it. You start recognizing which decisions are reversible and which ones are not, and that alone lightens the pressure. Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice. The uncertainty never fully goes away, but it does get quieter once you see that most “wrong” decisions are survivable.",

There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this. People like Steve Blank / Harvard have cracked a lot of it. Alexander Osterwaldwer / IMD as well. Anyone can learn from these leading educators on how it’s done.",

I went through this exact same thing when I started my first business back in 2018 and it completely destroyed me because I had no idea it was coming. Like you, I had the money part figured out but the constant second-guessing and mental noise made me change directions every other week, miss meetings, and basically become unreliable to everyone including myself. What helped me eventually was realizing that the uncertainty never really goes away, but you can build systems to contain it. I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing. Also started planning each day the night before and putting everything on my calendar instead of keeping endless to-do lists floating around in my head creating more anxiety.\n\n\n\nThe loneliness part is real too and having someone to bounce ideas off of, even if they can't give you definitive answers, makes a huge difference in staying sane through all the uncertainty.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

I just want something on paper before we get into the nitty gritty so I know you won't (sell my price list, secrets, try to undercut or cut me out, whatever.\"\n\nThen send them some bullshit doc with whatever you two talked about, but no real call to action.

I put the leads in the system... eventually sometimes. Okay that's not all true. I've got less leads in my hub spot than I have customers.So I must not be putting them all in. That means i've got a stack of spiral bound notepads.\n\nSee, there's always some area of improvement for everyone.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -> mediation -> arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

In multiple similar situations on Reddit, contributors have noted that this kind of pressure to give up equity or move to employee status without following the agreed dispute process usually signals fundamental relationship breakdown, not healthy evolution. \n\n\nFor example, other founders in squeeze-out situations have been advised to document contributions, insist on the existing co-founder agreement, and involve mediation or legal counsel before accepting any ultimatum because once equity is given up, decision rights evaporate. \n\n\nThe real leverage you have isn’t in giving up your stake; it’s in the fact that without your product and contributions, the business loses its core value.",

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

Ahí es donde muchos se quedan atrapados.\n\nHe notado que lo que sí resiste no es necesariamente lo más “tech”, sino lo que cambia el estado de una persona o grupo: identidad, hábitos, pertenencia, dirección. Por eso tiene sentido que veas más futuro en productos físicos o startups “poco atractivas”: hay fricción, hay proceso, hay algo que no se puede copiar en un fin de semana.\n\nAlgo parecido pasa con las comunidades pagadas: las que venden contenido mueren rápido; las que venden estructura, ritmo y un “nosotros” claro, sobreviven incluso en mercados saturados. No compiten por precio, compiten por significado.\n\nQuizá el cambio no sea solo qué construir, sino qué tipo de transformación prometemos y para quién.\n\n¿Crees que el próximo diferencial real vendrá más de la psicología y el diseño social que de la tecnología en sí?",

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

But for someone like me who is doing a multi country ug programme @ tetr college and actually running a D2C brand, nothing feels passive. You’re constantly dealing with shipments, customers, suppliers, creatives, inventory, and tomorrow’s problems. Even when things look “stable,” your brain is still working in the background. There is no passive. There is only **active now** and **active later**. Most so-called passive income is just income where the hard work happened earlier. During the building phase, it’s never passive. The moment you stop paying attention, something breaks, ads drop, suppliers slip, customers churn, platforms change the rules. Honestly, the only income that comes close to being truly passive is rent from real estate, and even that isn’t fully hands-off unless you outsource everything. So I’m curious.\n\nIs there any other income that’s genuinely passive? Or are we just dressing up delayed effort with a nicer name? What do you think?",

I am more inclined to offer a discount to a long term client, not someone who this is my first interaction with.\n\nThere are times when taking a small hit are worth it, mostly if the prestige of having this client, or being able to use them as a powerful reference, is something you can leverage to get more business.  Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.  Obviously, depends on the business.\n\nThat said, if they come in promising to pay more later, that's a pretty big red flag.  I very likely would also walk away.  Even if they could bring you in steady work in the future, they likely will always push to give you minimal margins, so you'll be working a lot for them, but not really profiting.  Again, depends on the type of business if this is worth it or not.",

So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! When it comes to LLMs, it looks like since they run super long question queries behind the scene often, getting yourself to be the best answer has much lower competition- if not zero! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

The first 2-3 years I did, but I was a college dropout and subconsciously needed that sort of affirmation.\n\n I'm not one of those people where work is my life.

When things are going well, it is exciting. When things are slow, it feels humiliating, almost. \n\nSo I guess my biggest regret is tying my brand to me.",

              "text": "That trajectory is textbook. Leaving a stable employer increases exposure to idiosyncratic risk, and when the venture \"blows up\" it usually reflects a mismatch between expected optionality and realized operational constraints. Freedom to choose strategy is real, but it is not synonymous with unconstrained autonomy. Customers, cashflow, investors, and legal liabilities create principal-agent dynamics that re-impose constraints faster than people expect.\n\n  \nFrom a systems perspective the right mental model is trade-off analysis: maximize autonomy subject to a viability constraint, i.e., runway, unit economics, and scalable processes. If relationships survived, that implies good boundary management, which is a positive signal. To reduce downside, architect redundancy: diversify revenue streams, codify delegation, and build operational leverage so choices become high-impact, low-frequency.\n\n  \nIn short, being your own boss buys decision rights, not immunity from consequences. Treat freedom as a design variable, not a binary state, and you get the upside without the social and financial volatility.",

The EBITDA numbers in the FDD didn't reflect real world operating conditions.\n\nAnother issue that doesn't get talked about enough is how much the business depends on a corporate website & booking system & how unreliable that system actually is.\n\nAs a franchisee you have no control over that system & are required to use it but your still the one dealing with the customer fallout when it fails.",

I got my bachelors degree in Business Admin but always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur, specifically in real estate. The only good thing I truly got out of going to college was meeting my real estate mentor. He had put up an ad for a marketing intern and I went for it and the rest is history. \n\nI was on the real estate team shadowing the hell out of everyone, learning a lot at every meeting we had, even translated for an agent when I shouldn’t have because technically that’s illegal (non-real estate agent being part of a legally binding contract). \n\nThe hardest part of everything right now is the last part you mention. My friends and family all think I’m not amounting to much or that I need a full time job because it’s important to have health insurance, a steady paycheck, and blah blah blah. I have learned SO MUCH these last 9 years of my life and I’m at the point where I’m finally ready to put it all together and create actions. I’m so thankful that I fully believe in myself and my dreams because I could have easily given up many years ago but momma ain’t raise no damn quitter! I’m excited to see myself put everything together this year but it’s tough. I live paycheck to paycheck but I know I’ll make it out soon like I did before. I did have a few successful years financially but I blew through it all for quitting a good part time job on the spot that kept me afloat while I looked for more deals lol",

You need to transition from being the 'operator' to the 'owner' by refining your systems. I've been studying these kinds of business frameworks lately for a project I'm building, and it's clear that clarity in your exit strategy is what determines the price. If the business depends on you, the price drops. If the 'system' runs itself, you name your price.",

It could be a larger property management company writes you a big check and you walk away immediately or in the very short term.  It could be a private equity leveraged buyout where you get a decent sized check but still own some of the company and work with your new lords and masters toward some bigger multi-year goals and a second payoff down the the road.  It could be a large corporate entity where you get a big check and become a middle manager employee doing essentially the same job you've been doing but now for a salary+bonus structure (contract or at will) under the umbrella of the corporation.\n\nI would start by asking one or more of those who have approached you.  Pick one who is actually in your business, not a broker or middleman type, and just have a chit chat about it.  But certainly don't just dance with one fella.  If you decide to get serious about working a deal, engage experienced help such as brokers and lawyers.  Cast a wide net and find the right deal for you.  I don't like to pay big bucks to brokers and lawyers any more than the next guy, but this is an area where professional help is a must.  These deals can get complicated and go wrong in unexpected ways, not something to be taken lightly.",

I know that sounds crazy. But it's entirely possible that the company is worth more to you then it would be to a buyer.  They may look at your numbers and realize they can't run it as lean as you do.  And when they add in their extra costs to their model, the profit drops significantly.  And it's this reduced profit that they'll use as the basis for their number.\n\nOne piece of unsolicited advice - inbound \"offers\" are not often real.  They often go away in due diligence (or earlier.)   If you decide you want to sell, do your best to get 3 or 4 buyers at the table at the same time. So that they compete for your company.

Somebody actually did this and then acted very surprised when I brought the hammer down on the whole shit show, loaded all the equipment and left them on a half finished job site with no equipment, no money and no clue.\n\nI have no idea whatever happened to that job, if it ever got done or if anybody ever sued the guy or whatever. I fired him shortly after, but you probably already figured that part out for yourself.",

Not the passive kind, but sticking with something long enough to actually understand it. A lot of people quit or pivot right before things start making sense.\n\nFiltering advice matters too. There’s a lot of noise out there, and most advice only works in very specific contexts. Taking everything at face value creates confusion fast.\n\nAnd honestly, emotional control is underrated.

When you say \"have separate emails\" for all your accounts... how does that work? They've specifically designed their systems to require a business owner to link all their accounts to a single personal profile. You're potentially more at risk of being flagged if you try to maintain several personal FB accounts each attached to a unique business page.",

Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary & Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs & Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Massive mental bandwidth saver.\n\n**Competitor monitoring** \\- AI agents track pricing changes, feature releases, job postings. No more manual stalking.\n\n**Community engagement at scale** \\- Honestly didn't expect this, but AI for finding relevant discussions (Reddit, forums, Twitter) where your product actually fits has been huge. Used to spend hours scrolling, now tools like ThreadPal surface the right conversations automatically.\n\n**Customer support triage** \\- AI categorizes tickets by urgency and suggests responses. Your team only touches the complex stuff.\n\nThe pattern: eliminate repetitive tasks so you can focus on the 20% that actually moves revenue.",

Ma attenzione, l'IA può farti costruire un prodotto in una settimana, ma non può costringere nessuno a comprarlo.\n\nNel mio libro, **'Startup Inferno'**,(lo trovi su Amazon) spiego che il vero valore dell'IA per un imprenditore nel 2026 non è solo l'efficienza, ma la **velocità di validazione**. Ecco tre casi d'uso 'brutali' che ogni founder dovrebbe implementare:\n\n1. **Il Grill della validazione H24:** Usa l'IA per simulare migliaia di interazioni con il tuo target e trovare i **'Fatal Flaws'** (difetti letali) del tuo modello di business prima ancora di scrivere una riga di codice.\n2. **Eliminazione della 'Lussuria dello spreco':** Esistono tool di IA che analizzano il tuo burn rate e le tue spese operative identificando istantaneamente il 'Lusso dello spreco'. Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri. L'IA costruisce la scala, ma sei tu che devi decidere su quale muro appoggiarla.\n\nOttimo spunto per il 2026!",

          "text": "Yeah, AI is genuinely a really useful tool for business right now. When it’s used correctly, it can bring a lot of value. Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",
