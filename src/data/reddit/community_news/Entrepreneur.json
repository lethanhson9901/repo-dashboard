I landed a job at large asset management firm (> $1 trillion aum) and was promoted after my first year for creating a tool that saved the funds 300-400k per year. I left after 2.5 years and now run the finance division for a billionaire who has a family office.\n\nI’ve learnt coding, financial statement analysis and modelling, but want to create something that’s mine.\n\nEveryone’s trying to make it, those that were able to do it early in their lives, why do you think that is? What was it that you did, that was different?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I shared a bathroom with 2 other tenants. Woke up in the morning with the cops running around the house because one of the tenants died in the shared bathroom. I barely had enough money to eat. Found a second job. Worked 70-80 hours a week. Luckily the local state university opened an extension school in our local HS. I could take a couple classes a semester in the evening. Still worked the 2 jobs and >70 hours. Eventually graduated. Saw the movie Wall Street. Figured, if you want to make money go to where the money is. Took my 1 week vacation to NYC. Called, dropped off and sent out resumes to anyone I could. Within the week I had a few interviews. Late ‘90s NYC was a great job market. Took a chance, called in and quit my job back home and stayed another week. Got an entry level job at a premiere wealth management company. Went back home, sold, dumped, packed up everything I had. Found a roommate from a classified in the Village Voice (newspaper). Worked as many hours as I could. Kept getting promoted. After almost 20 years of working harder than everyone else in the office I was making over $1 million a year. But Wall Street is a feast or famine business. Eventually the company I worked for made some bad decisions and went under. Now I’m in my mid 50s and unemployed. But at least I wasn’t a crazy spender and I have a few million in saving.",

I got an opportunity to purchase some land (32 acres) and just like the others was just going to hold it until the value increased, I received a call from a company saying they'd like to purchase the 32 acres and we agreed on a price where I would have profited about 200k which I was excited for but then they said they wanted to pay me in installments and I almost did I was going back n forth on my decision and that's when they told me they really only needed about 2 acres of it, if I didn't want to sell would I be willing to rent them the 2 acres after some informative digging we agreed on a price. I still own that property and as of today there is 8 companies currently that rent some portion of it. The beauty of it is they maintain their own rented space and a lot of them have built something on their rented portion which has increased the property value. I make 1.2 million a year off of those 32 acres and yes I've repeated the same thing in surrounding cities and continue to look for more and different opportunities. I owe alot to the first company who reached out(a fence company) for actually coming up with the idea for me.",

Got a free PC with a cheap internet plan my mom got back in the early 2000's and started doing entrepreneur things. Farmed gold on RuneScape and things like that and sold it and earned more than my mom. This gave me a good amount of knowledge about computers. Did some other shady things like some hacking here and there but never for profit, I didn't know hacking is a job. Didn't like school so I didn't even get a high school diploma.\n\nAt 18 moved to the UK by myself with £20 in my pocket and slept on a friend's sofa.\n\nGot a job as a junior chef, worked there for a few years. Then I found out Police is recruiting without a high school diploma so I applied and got in. Within 3 years became a detective, then joined a cybercrime unit. Got into crypto and cybersecurity pretty heavily, then around when I was 24 I got a job in Cybersecurity where I got a ton of certificates. I really got into tech BIG time at this age. I started learning how to code and probably launched like 20 failed startups.\n\nAround 28 I started doing crypto and built a project in the space that went super viral and made me $1.5m within 3 months then died out. Not going to say what it was but it was a platform where I earned fees, similar to a DEX. This made me a millionaire at 28, I went from negative balance to millionaire overnight. I was working 9-5 then 5-3am 7 days a week from ages 24-28. \n\nLife was extremely difficult, I cried when I had my lucky break but was super sad it only lasted a short time. I took the money and invested it and now living off the investment income and building another startup, in cybersecurity. I really hope this can be a long term project now that I got proper funding and have a goal to exit this business for at least $100m then hopefully retire around 40.",

          "text": "That is a very tough loaded question. It would be as hard as pushing a mountain through a pin hole but let me give it a shot. Let me see how I could help you:\n\n* Hunt for \"New money\", or combine with \"old money\" knowledge you've gathered and try to carve a path in old money from the systems usual go to path i.e. study or absorb high value knowledge and applying them. Learn the avenues of money and how to mine it. Keep at it and make it your game (like Robert Kiyosaki said his game is making money and the points or high scores are the numbers). Watch motivating things and keep grinding, grinding, grinding. Enjoy the breaks and time with members important to you 100% (the little time you have with them) as much as you go with your 100% grinding. (forgive me for the lingo I am just trying to connect). Update, analyze, envision the possibilities and prepare a backup plan if things go sour. Engage in hobbies.\n* Follow advice and find the right mentor as it would save you a lot of time (they'd guide you or simply tell you the way forward as you carve your path). Listen to wise time tested advice and you will see patterns. Do the money thing early in your age and learn it as early as possible (finances and such).\n* The other one is time and experience in the field of \"hunting for money with your skillset\". Plan well, run numbers, look ahead at the high hitting ones that you can work well into accomplishing.\n* Basically you have kind of done it in your field (you are doing pretty well yourself, you should actually be the one also giving advice). Now you just have to maintain it and move higher or sideways strategically (or if you go down then at least know you will bounce back up because you have the know how or do like the ones that call it a day and retire as their goal was simply to get up and build a nest egg and retire comfortably)\n* Figure out what works for you and do it like you love it. When you hit it big, everything else will follow.\n* Learn value and value extraction and learn conversion rates (like making a sale or something). Basically businesses are things that solve a problem (if you plan to go that route). As for work, it is how useful you are and what you offer society. It was like that show I watched a long time ago, the kid didn't know how to use ninja tricks or magic but he maxed out it physical ability he became so good they considered him a legend (a legend on top of the world considered him a walking legend). You don't have to be that good but been stable is good enough to pass the bar.\n* Wealth and Riches will simply at times multiply your behavior so keep some things in check. (there is the occasional leak out but at least keep it in check, you could look into Stoicism). Not a must but also wealth kind of has an effect on those around you so keep that in mind too and try to help where you could or mentor where you can (you can pick everyone along the way like motivational speakers if you want too).\n* Look at the power of compounding and disciplined steps.\n* Perseverance but also knowing when to rest and enjoy the view. You'll appreciate your efforts as you look for a 'save point' or nest egg so when you fall you don't have to start from ground 0 (well you can definitely bounce back from ground 0 but if you say have a family or something you wouldn't want that though if you must go through it then you must).\n\n***TL:DR;*** *\"Have a mentor, have a vision and work at it like a savage. If you failed, learn from it, get back up and bounce back\"*\n\n***Warning:***\n\nThing is this thing needs you to have a lot of life experiences that is why I hang out with older gens and also see how newer gens do things because they have very interesting questions.\n\nSchool, re-learn (deprogram and program again what works), be good but smart enough to eat the good and spit out the bad. Once you finish the schooling and intense training apply the the knowledge and skills you having been cumulating as you also built a hobby on the side with sort of a final goal as you also had fun with it.\n\n(but *do some calculations and* ***apply safety nets*** *and know when to pivot* if you should because sometimes people will doubt you even if you are right and it has happened a lot of times. Also be autocorrecting and know when you are messing up, be critical to yourself but try to understand other people when they mess up and how to better manage them to let their skill shine beside yours. As I said it is a loaded question).\n\nHope this helps. (Also it seems you did well for yourself in your field, the best game that I think best explains this is The Sims - the first game. You could see almost everything in a human lifecycle there)",

Instead of only working harder at a job, they build assets, equity, skills, or distribution that scale beyond their time. A lot of them get obsessive about one high-value skill early (tech, sales, finance, content, etc.), live way below their means even after earning more, and take calculated asymmetric bets where the downside is survivable but the upside is huge. Another big difference is speed, they ship faster, learn faster, and tolerate uncertainty way better than average. Also, environment matters more than people admit; being close to capital, networks, or high-growth industries compounds everything. And honestly, luck and timing play a role too, but the common thread is they put themselves in positions where luck could actually hit, instead of just playing safe for stability their whole life. ",

Stocks can help you get richer, but not make you rich in and of themselves.  The overall best return is starting a successful business.  This, over time, can be a return on investment 1000x.  But, it’s really fucking hard.  From my own sucesss and meeting and talking with other people, I have distilled success down to three traits.  It is these traits that matter, and will make or break you.\n\nPrimary is risk.  You have to be able to risk, to put something on the line for possible failure and loss.  You have to be able to sacrifice time and labor for nothing in the hopes of something.  This is fundamental.  A lot of people cannot do this and are essentially born to be employees.  Doesn’t mean they aren’t smart or competent.  They just can’t risk.\n\nSecondary trait 1 is conscientiousness.  Hard work.  Pride.  Quality first.  Working long hours without reward.  Speed is accuracy.  This is a trait that can be honed.  If someone has this and the ability to risk, they are probably at a 60% chance of success.  \n\nSecondary rest to is competence.  High IQ, creativity.  Critical thinking quickly, problem solving.  Learning fast and adapting.  This is essentially always having the right answer, the best idea.  This is more of something you are born with.  If you have this, and the ability to risk, you probably have an 80% chance at success.  \n\nIf you have all three you are a guaranteed millionaire.  But, to have all three traits probably puts you in maybe 2% of the population.  A lot of people can’t risk, and some that can’t risk either aren’t intelligent or are lazy or both.  \n\nSo the thing to do is sit down and figure out what your traits are.  Starting with risk.  If you can honestly determine that you truly cannot risk, then your time is best served finding the highest position you can to serve someone who can risk.  And one thing I would conjecture, and it isn’t a judgment, but the type of person who truly has trait 3 isn’t the type that would need to ask anyone how to do x or become y.  They would intuitively figure it out on their own.  They are the type to ask a specific question maybe from a lack of knowledge, like where on a website is the contact button or something like that.  They wouldn’t ask “how do I become rich.”  And for that person, if they can risk, they just need to find a high IQ creative individual who can’t risk and hire them.",

Those that are coming close are talkign about real estate investment which as a Georgist is hardly entrepreneurship to me. \n\nI did not grow up poor. My family is well-off and very comfortable in Pakistan. But that does not translate to wealthy for US. I was born in the US before my parents decided to move back. The main privileges that I enjoy are:\n\n1. Education was highly prioritized in my family and I had to work very hard in educaiton because of the insanely competitive environment of Pakistan. In fact, I worked less in a top 10 engineering school where I graduated with high honors than I did in Pakistan.\n\n2. I did not feel the pressure to support my family back in Pakistan.\n\n3. I am a US citizen so I could avail financial aid to pay for my school and work without needing authorization.\n\nAgain, I know I was very privileged but I feel I enjoyed fewer privileges than most of the people whining about how hard it is to make it. Money was financial aid, scholarships, work, and student loans. The student loans themselves were tiny because I went to a state school and were very easy to pay off because I am cheap so I saved a lot and went to a state school so they were small. I did not have any network I could lean on other than the network I built for myself by performing very well in school. My biggest advantage was the priority of education in my family.\n\nWorked for 5 years after my masters. I was fortunate that I took a job with ARM and the share price went up so I got a nice buffer. But then again, I also had a divorce that cost me a large chunk of the money I had saved. \n\nStarted a consulting company. Ran it for \\~7 years. Exited it to a GSI. Was a millionaire right around an age of 35. \n\nWhat people need to realize is that whether you work at a job or start your own business, you are someone that sells your labor for money. The question is how many customers you have and how much ownership you have of the systems. You don't need to be wealthy to start a business. You can just do what you're doing at a job as a business and make more money doing so.",

Using benefits like scholarships/military to get a free or cheaper education will also help. But most importantly stay out of debt, don't max out credit cards, don't buy a home you can't afford, don't waste money on expensive rent, don't waste money on a girl that does not really love you, don't waste money on drugs, ect. Also focus on getting a job in a good career feild that has a high ladder to climb to eventually reach over 200k a year at your peak, if your comfortable with being an employee this will help you build weatlh if you put most of your paycheck into assests every year and max your retirement accounts out. Assests can include rental homes, stocks, businesses ect. Know you will most likely not ever get super rich unless you own your own busniess or invest and get luckly. But this is a simple path to follow to be wealthy by 35 or 40. The main trend is starting young and not making any big mistakes like getting stuck in a bad career, getting into large debt, drugs ect.",

I treated early jobs as paid education, not just paychecks.** Stayed at Goldman for 2 years learning deal structure, now at a sovereign wealth fund where I'm still learning from people decades ahead of me. That knowledge compounds when I evaluate acquisitions. But I'm staying in W-2 longer than I probably should because I'm terrified of cutting the cord and owning my income 100%\n\n**2. I got comfortable being the least qualified person in the room.** Applied to jobs I thought were \"not for people like me.\" Turns out imposter syndrome is just fear with better marketing.\n\n**3. I learned the math.** Everyone in my old life told me I couldn't afford to buy a business. Turns out with SBA financing and understanding tax benefits, I put $65K into a deal that would have seemed impossible a year earlier. The barrier was knowledge, not money.\n\n**4. I asked dumb questions to smart people.** Mentors, advisors, CPAs who knew more than me. Most people will help if you're genuinely trying to learn.\n\nThe shift: stopped waiting for permission that was never coming. Nobody tells the kid from the food stamp line \"you should buy a company.\" Had to give myself that permission.\n\nYou're already doing the hard part - learning skills that create value (being reasonably technical, financial modeling). The \"something that's mine\" is closer than you think. What are you considering building?",

          "text": "I grew up very poor and we were even homeless for a short time after NAFTA wiped out all the jobs in our region but my mom was very, very hardcore about saving and managing money. She was also very against going into debt. Her flaw was she was a saver, not an investor so she was constantly living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI wanted to be an architect. I went to college but chose the most affordable accredited degree I could get instead of a more prestigious but way more expensive option. Back in the early 2000s college wasn't as crazy expensive as now. I was able to work nights and weekends to not go into debt. While every single person I knew was taking out tons of debt and spending money partying and living large in college I was penny pinching. Even though school and teachers threatened me to quit my job and focus on school I continued to work so I wouldn't need a loan. There were a few times I had to borrow money to get by but paid it back as soon as possible. I totally understand this is almost impossible nowadays unless you are talking a community college.\n\nAfter school I got an ok job with a firm paying very little and then the 2008 financial crisis hit. Job gave me a choice of halfing my pay which was already very low or leave. I halfed my pay to stay and literally made less than minimum wage with all the unpaid overtime I worked. I basically worked like a dog for years with minimal pay raises until about 2017 where I got married and finally decided to go out on my own and start my own firm with massive encouragement by my wife. Thank god for her. At this time I had a negative net worth with a home mortgage of about 150k and 20k car debt.\n\nThe first year on my own I think I only made like 20k but I made good connections and learned about business. I kept the company as lean as physically possible working from home and not hiring anyone just putting in 60+ hours a week. By 2019 I was finally making what I was at my previous firm about 80k a year. Then 2020 really blew up where I was finally making 6 figures. My wife was super encouraging and also got her degree in design and started helping me out.\n\nI aggressively paid off all debts and paid off my car and house in that year. I was finally at a positive net worth.\n\nI realized the real money wasnt in the design work but in the development. My wife and I started searching properties and I made some contacts with capital. I couldnt invest money but I could invest time so what was a 20k project turned into 40-50k returns after sale. Work also really picked up and with my wifes help our income exploded. Our lifestyle did not change and we kept penny pinching.\n\nWe also both aggressively put most our money in as high of yield of savings as possible and maxed out what we could in investments in both retirement and taxed accounts. All this just kept compounding. We also made sure to take advantage of big market drops. During the COVID drop we made sure to throw a ton of money into the market and it really paid off. We were making decent income of a few hundred grand a year but the compounding and zero debt just really kept things moving forward. We saved and invested about 80% of our income which also helped. Also the little crappy home we had went from about 160k to about 500k in value.\n\nRight now my wife and I together are about 3m net worth not counting our new home. Even now we still live well, well below our means. We travel a lot but choose very affordable places. We love camping and we go all over just camping outdoors. Its not only affordable but way more fun.\n\nA few years ago we realized even though we were doing well we still felt like being in the US really drained a lot out of us. We decided to pack up and move overseas to SE Asia and it was one of the best things we ever did. Its not perfect here but cost of living is so absurdly cheap.\n\nI think the key is learn how to manage money, avoid debt, dont just save but invest and grow your money and finally stop caring about what others think. Stop trying to impress other losers by wasting money on stupid stuff. I have a lot of friends that didnt make it and are really struggling now yet they somehow have the money to buy a 7-800k home with a 70k truck they dont need. Then complain the system doesnt work. I agree there are a lot of things broken but at the same time they dont do themselves any favors.",

They attach themselves to environments with asymmetric upside. High-growth industries, proximity to capital, proximity to decision-makers. You already did this by working in asset management and now in a family office.\n2. They build skills that compound. Coding + finance is a powerful combo because it creates optionality. Most people build linear skills.\n3. They ship something of their own before they feel “ready.” The jump from employee to owner usually happens before confidence arrives.\n4. They tolerate volatility longer than others. Most people optimize for stability. The ones who break out optimize for upside.\n\nBut here’s the honest part:  \nA lot of early millionaires also benefited from timing and access. It’s not purely merit.\n\nFrom what you wrote, you’re already around capital and decision-making. That’s rare access. The question isn’t “what do millionaires do differently?” It’s “what asymmetric bet are you willing to take?”\n\nYou’ve built skills inside other people’s empires.

The fast movers reverse it: they build an audience or reputation in a specific niche first, then figure out what to sell. Your coding + financial modeling background is already a rare combination. The question isn't what to build - it's who has an acute problem you can solve with that exact stack.\n\nOne practical thing: the move from \"employee who created value\" to \"owner of that value\" is mostly a positioning shift, not a skills gap. You've already proven you can identify and build high-ROI solutions. The next step is finding that problem before someone hands it to you.",

Revenue was okay but i was constantly context switching and burning out managing 14 completely different industries at once.\n\nThen one of my clients, a pediatric dentist in Scottsdale, referred me to her friend who also owned a pediatric dental practice. I didnt think much of it but after working with both of them for a few months I realized these businesses are basically identical in structure, same ad angles work, same seasonal trends, same parent demographics on Meta, same Google review strategy. I wasnt reinventing the wheel every time.\n\nSo I made the call to niche down completely. Updated my website, killed all other outreach, built out a proper case study from those two clients and just started cold emailing pediatric dental offices.\n\nFirst 60 days were rough ngl. Had some money saved from before I went full time that covered my personal expenses which was the only reason i didnt panic and go back to taking random clients. By month 3 I had 3 new clients purely from outreach. By month 6 referrals started coming in from within the niche itself because these dentists all know each other and talk.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about niching is that your deliverables get so much faster. I can onboard a new pediatric dental client in 2 days now because everything is templated from experience. My margins went up without raising prices just from the efficiency alone.\n\nIf your agency feels chaotic and all over the place this is genuinely worth considering. Pick the niche that already has some proof in your current client list.",

You already know which ad angles convert, which landing page structure works, what objections come up in the sales call. That compounds into:\n\n- Faster onboarding = more capacity without hiring\n- Better results = higher retention\n- Speaking their exact language = shorter sales cycle\n- Case studies that resonate = easier to close the next one\n\nThe referral network effect you mentioned is the other thing that's hard to replicate with a generalist model. Pediatric dentists go to the same conferences, are in the same Facebook groups, probably know each other by name in any given metro area. One happy client becomes a referral engine in a way that \"one happy landscaper\" just doesn't.\n\nCurious about one thing - are you seeing any ceiling in terms of market size?

Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.",

I asked who they were and he said they were his friends. I then asked if he understood why investors would think that’s a problem. He looked at me like I was stupid. \n\nI know many founders who were told by people they know that they’d buy after it was built. Then when it came time to pay, crickets. Don’t get us wrong. Warm sales are a great way to start. But they’re only the beginning. \n\nGreat post.",

But the \"just ship it and charge\" crowd sometimes swings too far the other way where they ship garbage and then conclude theres no market because nobody bought their half baked thing.\n\nThe sweet spot Ive found is talking to potential customers before building anything. Not surveys, actual conversations. \"Tell me about the last time you dealt with X problem. What did you do? How much did it cost you?\" If people cant articulate the pain without you leading them, the pain probably isnt that deep.\n\nThe founders Ive seen succeed the fastest are the ones who pre-sold before writing a single line of code. Like literally got a commitment (or even payment) based on a mockup or a detailed description. If you can get someone to say \"yes I would pay for that\" with their wallet and not just their words, you know youve got something.\n\nBut youre 100% right that the building phase is often just hiding. Ive been guilty of that myself. Its way more comfortable to tinker with code than to put yourself out there and hear \"no thanks.\"",

That's a rare starting point. The real question isn't the price, it's the purpose. What is this project for?\n\nThe $21 donation is infinitely more interesting than the $300 offer. One is a user telling you they got real value from your work. The other is someone offering you pocket change to go away. One is a signal to build, the other is a signal to sell cheap.\n\nIf this is a distraction from your real work, take the money and buy yourself a steak.

Also, small niche apps like that are hard to scale unless you pour time into marketing, data quality, and maybe local partnerships. That time is probably better spent on your next project with higher upside.\n\nIf you think you can actually 10x users in a few months and you’re willing to grind on it, then maybe hold.

If you can get $21 in donations from just one person, imgine what a small, well-placed revenue stream could generate over a year. You've already proven there's a need and an audience.

No one bats an eye. I feel like I must’ve met 100 different people in 2 1/2 days, I’ve never heard of any of them, they all seem to have more money than God and treated some of the most expensive things I’ve ever been around as normal every day nothing.

Never even met the boss who owned the house and yacht and jet, he was in London the entire time. \n\nI know people have money, good friends family sold their business for 120 million been on their private jets a dozen times, I’ve been around money, I’ve never before or after been around the lifestyle.

He told me that \"in the time it takes to deal with the paperwork for cruise cancellation and refund claims, he makes more than the entire cruise cost him\".\n\n-people asking me to make their tour longer when we reached the end. I couldn't accept, as I was just a single freelancer at the time and had to go tour another customer. They then offered to pay the longer tour hours and pay the fee of the other family's tour to cover their cancellation. Obviously, I didn't accept, but that's a wild offer. \n\n-Guest cancelling a tour, long before the final date, so eligible for a complete refund. They denied the refund, said they enjoyed the smooth communication and energy.\n\nNot gonna lie, meeting these customers has made me change my evaluation of my services and perception of value.

Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out.\n\n  \nEdit: Subreddit doesn't allow screenshots, however i got the data metrics from shophunter and no it does not mean that these numbers are true to the core but it aims for an accurate level. Also this is not a self promotion, i just found this while studying on other digital products and thought this was crazy. ",

You should find a problem that you want to solve not a way that you wanna make money. Because at the end of the day you need to be willing to just solve the problem and get paid nothing for it and that needs to be enough because if it’s not when the money is not coming in, you’re gonna quit. I call it finding your why/purpose. But for example, let’s say I start a business helping people find a retirement home. That’s extremely niche. And very likely would be difficult to get people on board with me effectively planning their retirement helping them get placed, etc. etc. but at the end of the day if I’m not dedicated to that for some of my own reasons if I’m not getting paid to do it eventually I’m just gonna quit rather than finding out. How do I make this work? Everybody talks about pivot, pivot, pivot, and that’s great. But there’s a difference between pivoting and completely changing your business. If you’re pivot means you’re gonna start making money in a different industry or a completely different way targeting a different niche, etc. then you’re probably changing your business. You’re not pivoting. And that does work out in some cases for some people, but in my experience. Figuring out your Y/purpose is more important than anything because if there’s no money, what else do you have to make sure that it keeps working?",

First 12 months were under $1k/month while building and iterating.\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n1. Solve a problem you understand deeply, not a generic \"build an app\" idea\n2. Distribution matters more than product quality at the start â Reddit, App Store SEO, and direct outreach got the first 50 customers\n3. Retention is everything in SaaS. Every churned customer is a permanent loss of recurring revenue\n4. Multiple small products > one big product early on\n\n**What most people get wrong:**\n\n- Building before validating (10 customer conversations before writing code saves months)\n- Chasing revenue instead of solving real pain\n- Underpricing because they're scared (lower prices attract worse customers who churn faster)\n\nThe honest answer: at $10k/month, recurring revenue businesses (SaaS, subscriptions, retainers) are most sustainable.

          "text": "My business is physical asset based. I do warehousing, trucking, and processing for manufacturers. Everything I do is B2B. AI has done nothing but make things better and easier for me. \n\nI started in 2016 with a big warehouse full of sand and a little bit of money (remnants of an old family business that has been closed for over a decade). The goal was simple: get the facility generating a stable income again. The process? Fuck. \n\nIt took 18 months to get the sand out and get the building back into usable condition. From there I tried a lot. Leasing. Selling. Subdividing. Hell at one point I spent 9 months and $80,000 working with engineers and contractors and lawyers and all sorts of other people to expand the building by 75ksf and move a manufacturer in that would employ over 300 people per shift, only for the project to die at the last minute because of an impasse on capitalization. \n\nOne day, straight up, I got fucking lucky. An old customer rep called and asked if I would be interested in doing warehousing for them. I said yes, but it was still almost two years from that conversation to the commencement date of the service agreement with them. From there, I finally had an actual operation.\n\nBefore, the old assets were generating some rental income, but not all that much; six figures for the entire year collectively. Getting started in warehousing was, admittedly, not exactly a cash cow. Yes getting rent from the warehouse space that was being utilized was good and the little bit of handling income I was getting was definitely better than before, but it wasn't much. I only had 5-6 people working for me then. It wasn't until about a year or so later, after also signing this company's intra-plant neighbor (two companies sharing production lines) as a warehousing customer, that I got the opportunity to get into trucking and toll processing.\n\nThat was huge. I hired an engineer to work for me full time to develop a processing line to meet the customers requirements. I built a 17,000 sf production facility attached to my warehouse to house the tolling equipment. From inquiry to start date, it was three full years of effort. They were only planning to send a small amount of their total required volume to us, but because my line is so much faster, better, and safer than everyone else's, I'm now processing more than half of the total annual volume the customer has. They told me one day that when we first got started that it would be AMAZING if we could get to the point where we could process a million pounds of material a month. We did it in the first month. That's when the money started really coming in. Altogether it was about 6 years of effort to get to that point. \n\nDo I regret it? Kind of. Getting into a family business, even one that is dead and gone that you're just trying to resurrect, comes with some serious challenges. While I am definitely doing well for myself, the strain it put on the most important relationships in my life, in a lot of ways, weren't worth it. There were times where I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. The darkest days I have experience in my life have surrounded this fucking business. I know now that I would have likely been a lot happier over the past decade had I just truly gone out on my own, even if I failed. \n\nFree time? Lol. Between the business, marriage, kids, board positions, other responsibilities, and the desire to have a couple of hobbies so I don't hate my life eats up just about all the free time I have. Basically, if I want free time, I have to schedule it ahead. However, the freedom I have to work when I want/need rather than be beholden to someone else's schedule is enough for me. \n\nSo long as I continue growing and gaining more market share, my business should endure indefinitely. Before the financial crisis of 2007 killed it, my business existed operationally since 1947. I know now that what killed the business in it's last life was a lack of service diversification and lack of scale, both of which have been my primary developmental focuses since day one. \n\nI'm currently nearer the ballpark of a 10k daily than monthly without being too revealing. It is still a very small company. My personal take home is well over 100k without putting any strain at all on the business.",

Not the “sell a course” stuff you’re talking about, actual diagnostic work with founders who need their positioning, messaging, and onboarding fixed so they can sell more confidently.\n\nWhat I do  \nI run a clarity consultancy. I audit a founder’s positioning, messaging, and client experience, then rebuild it so their brand feels premium and intentional instead of chaotic. It’s not marketing execution, it’s the strategic layer that makes everything else work.\n\nHow long it took to get into it  \nI spent years doing creative direction, branding, and systems work before I realized the real value wasn’t the deliverables, it was the clarity founders were missing. Once I repositioned myself around that, things scaled quickly.\n\nHow long it took to make real income  \nMy first “decent” month came once I packaged the service properly and tightened my onboarding. Clarity sells when the offer is clear. Before that, I was undercharging and doing too much.\n\nDo I regret the route?  \nNo. The only thing I regret is not specializing sooner. Generalists struggle to hit $10k+ consistently because the market can’t place them.\n\nFree time  \nMore than I had in traditional roles. When your offer is clear and your systems are tight, you don’t need volume, you need fit.\n\nHow long I think it will last  \nAs long as founders keep building things and getting stuck in the fog of their own ideas. Clarity is a timeless problem.\n\nHow much I’m making  \nEnough to stay selective, keep my client load low, and focus on premium work instead of volume. The exact number fluctuates, but the floor is above the threshold you mentioned.\n\nIf you’re trying to get to $10k+, the biggest unlock isn’t a new tactic, it’s choosing a problem you can solve deeply, packaging it clearly, and positioning yourself where people actually feel the pain.",

Most people try to sell $20 products to thousands of people, which is a marketing nightmare. In sales, you only need to close 2-4 high-value deals a month to exceed that goal.\n\nTwo critical rules I live by:\n\n1. Sell value, not fluff. Work for a company that offers a solution with genuine value.\n\n2. Believe in the product! Only sell something you actually believe in and would be willing to pay for yourself. Authenticity is your biggest asset in high-stakes deals.\n\nEven if you don’t plan on being a \"salesman\" forever, learning how to sell is the most important life skill you can acquire. Whether you are negotiating with your kids, your spouse, or future investors, we are always selling something. Master this, and you’ll never be without an income.",

          "text": "I'll answer every question because you're right, this sub is drowning in \"buy my course\" garbage.\n\n**What do you do?** I'm a fractional CTO/CPO. Basically I serve as the senior tech and product leader for 3 to 4 companies at the same time, each paying a monthly retainer. I also run a small AI focused investment fund. No course. No ebook. No community with a $49/month paywall.\n\n**How long did it take to get into it?** I started my first company at 18 with no degree and no money. That was over a decade ago. The fractional executive work specifically took about 8 years of building, shipping, failing, and learning before I had enough credibility that companies would trust me with their product and engineering decisions. There was no shortcut. Anyone selling you a 90 day path to this is lying.\n\n**How long to make your first decent income?** My first real company took almost 2 years before I could pay myself consistently. The product I scaled to $20M ARR took about 18 months to hit meaningful revenue. Nothing worthwhile happened fast.\n\n**Do you regret the route?** Not even slightly. But I'd be lying if I said there weren't years where I questioned everything. The path from 18 year old with no credentials to where I am now was not some clean upward curve. It was chaos with a general upward trend if you zoom out far enough.\n\n**How much free time do you have?** More than you'd expect actually. I've built AI agent workflows that handle a massive chunk of what used to eat my day. Content, research, scheduling, first drafts of almost everything. I work hard from about 8 AM to 4 PM, work out, and my evenings are mostly free. Weekends are mine. That said, this took years of deliberately designing my work to be async and systems driven. Early on I had zero free time and that's just the honest reality of building.\n\n**How long will it last?** The fractional model is only growing because startups can't afford full time C suite leaders but desperately need senior thinking. AI makes me more valuable not less because most founders need someone who actually understands how to operationalize AI, not just talk about it. I'd bet on this model for at least the next 5 to 10 years, probably longer.\n\n**How much?** Well above 10k/month. I won't give exact numbers because it varies by quarter and client load, but each retainer client is a meaningful five figure monthly engagement and I run multiple simultaneously.\n\nThe real answer to your actual question though: pick something where the value you provide compounds over time. Courses and dropshipping don't compound. Expertise does. Skills do. Reputation does. It's slower and less sexy and nobody will make a TikTok about it. But it's the thing that actually works.",

It's all about the context and market.   \n  \nAbout fear of failure..   \n  \nA friend told me a few months back that I inspired her. I rejected the praise and told her that from my perspective, it was all bullshit. That fundamentally, I am not good enough, that I am surrounded by people much smarter than I will ever be, and almost never delivering to my own standards. She reckoned I said that because I see how the sausage is made. She doesn't see the process, she just sees the result.\n  \nIt reminded me that there is your inner life and outer life. Feelings are something, as individuals and humans, we all share in our own way. Whatever is happening inside your head will never change. Insecurities, anxiety, fear of failure, etc. It never changed for me, and I accept it will never change. I can't undo my childhood and how it left an print in my mind. We are the same 10 y.o. kids we were then... in an older body.    \n  \nWhat makes a difference is whether you are a slave to your feelings (react to them instinctively) or whether you work \"with\" your feelings. I have lost count of the number of talented people who self-destruct because they are in a bad mental place. Like someone who is frustrated because they don't get a promotion and start acting out. Had they been able to put their frustration to one side and acted appropriately, they would have been promoted 6 months later. But because they were unable to handle their frustration, they de facto disqualified themselves for that promotion. Funny how it works. And by the way, that someone was me.  \n   \nTL/DR. Nevermind your fear of failure. If that's your thing and how your head is wired, chances are you'll probably always have it. It's fine. Nobody will know unless you tell them. Just don't act stupid because of it.",

I'm also an ex-entrepreneur.\n\nAt 39 years old, I'm currently in a phase of transition, maybe midlife crisis... and starting to think  if this is really the direction I want to continue in or try something different.\n\nEverywhere I look, whether it's LinkedIn, people trying to sell you playbooks, or content creators on Instagram telling you how you can build a AI or content-driven business in 5 steps. Everybody seems to be doing something with tech or AI. That it seems to be like the only way to make money now.\n\nI was listening to the Mel Robbins podcast today about how to live a meaningful life, and design the future you want. It's really fantastic. I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it.\n\nAnd then after some deep thinking, I was just wondering, is there anybody building any type of business anymore, or like starting something up now which has nothing to do with AI or tech?! 🤔\n\nIs there no going back from having to share one's 5 winning tips in a LinkedIn post, or downloadable pdf if one writes X in the comments? 🫣",

For years he averaged 6 tours a week at $35 a head, 8 to 12 people each time. That kept us afloat through tough years.\n\nTwo years ago cancer hit and he had to stop. He handed it to me with stories about groups who came back year after year because he made the city feel alive. Now I run the tours but bookings dropped to 2 a week max. summer was okay with 10 person groups but winter is brutal, down to 4 or 5 people paying $140 total some days.\n\nThe problem is visibility. he relied on word of mouth and flyers at hotels. I tried a basic website and posting on local facebook groups but it barely moves the needle. overhead is low, just permits and transit at $200 a month, but without steady groups we cant cover basics. people loved his personal touch, the way hed stop for coffee at a spot with history or adjust for kids in the group.\n\nI want to honor what he built without turning it into some generic bus thing. for anyone whos scaled small tours or personal guides: what got you past the word of mouth phase, did you find platforms that connect groups without high fees? \n\nThank you everyone.",

It’s discoverability.\n\nA few practical ideas that don’t turn it into a bus-tour machine:\n\n1. Lean into the legacy. Most tours sell “see NYC.” You can sell “30 years of hidden NYC stories passed from father to son.” That angle alone is powerful. Put that front and center on your site and listings.\n2. Get on high-intent platforms. Airbnb Experiences, Viator, GetYourGuide. Yes, they take a cut. But they solve visibility instantly. You can always upsell direct repeat bookings later.\n3. Raise your price slightly. $35 feels underpriced for NYC walking tours in 2026. Higher price can actually signal quality and attract better groups.\n4. Collect emails every single tour. Offer a “hidden NYC spots” PDF or short story recap and build a list. Repeat business compounds.\n5. Encourage Google reviews aggressively. If he ran it 30 years, there must be past customers who’d happily leave a review. 100+ strong Google reviews alone can change local discovery.\n6. Winter pivot. Offer themed tours: “NYC Crime Stories,” “Historic Speakeasies,” “Love Stories of Manhattan.” Give people a reason beyond sightseeing.\n\nYou don’t need scale. You need positioning + distribution.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact that you care about keeping it personal is already your advantage over the big operators.",

Lean into your legacy and if your comfortable with it tell your story of trying to continue what your dad started.\n\nWinter is brutally slow in our area.

Those worked when attention was easier to grab. Today the market is indifferent unless you build repeatable visibility systems around the authentic experience.  \n  \nQuick moves that actually move the needle for small personal tours right now:\n\n* List it properly on Airbnb Experiences, Viator, and GetYourGuide, they handle discovery and send consistent groups (even in winter) for 15-25% commission.\n* Add a dead simple online booking page (Calendly + Stripe is enough to start).\n* Turn your dad’s best stories into short, real Reels/TikToks (hidden alleys, forgotten plaques, the family vibe). This content performs stupidly well for local experiences.\n\nYou don’t have to turn it into a bus tour factory. Just make the real thing discoverable at scale.  \n  \nHave you listed it on any of the big platforms yet?  \nAnd what’s been the hardest part lately, getting people to find you or actually getting them to book?",

Later, Merchants would travel from village to village, selling salt to households who needed it to preserve meat and vegetables for the winter. And then salt was sold out of barrels in general stores. People would bring their own containers (like ceramic pots or cloth bags) to the store and the merchant would scoop out the desired amount.\n\n In rural areas, a \"saltman\" or peddler would travel door-to-door with a cart or on horseback, carrying blocks of salt. He would chip off pieces for customers right on their doorstep.\n\nThat whole \"You just grab salt at the grocery store\" stuff came *much later.*\n\nThose entrepreneurs identified a new need and served it until it became commoditized by \"the big guys.\" The entrepreneurs made some money along the way, rinse and repeat.",

          "text": "I get where you're coming from, but there's a lot of ignorance inside that sentiment.\n\nFirst, when Google or Notion or one of these big companies add \"a whole product as a button inside their app\", many times it is because they went to the \"salt shop guy\" and bought him out. Unfortunately, there are lots of salt shop guys out there, and its usually either the first to get big enough to get noticed or the guy who is the best connected that gets to sell his salt shop to the big guy. When you see a headline \"BIG COMPANY Acquires COMPARATIVELY TINY COMPANY for X Billion Dollars\", the reason is often so the big company can start offering what the small company came up with. Alternatively, the big company deploys internal resources to create that simple little button and kill every single salt shop guy out there all at once, but that simple little button could cost them MILLIONS in dev and implementation costs that they would rather have someone else take the initial risk on. \n\nSecond is the idea that you aren't running a business because you're just selling salt on someone else's shelf. Guess what? That is EVERY business that has ever existed. Whether you are a one-man-show salt maker, a multinational food retailer, or even a giant holding company that owns 40% of the market, you are still just one item on someone else's \"shelf\". The global market is a big place, and no matter what you do, you're still only one of 8 billion people trying to attract its attention. The only way you could possibly avoid having to sell on someone else's proverbial shelf is if your organization were fully integrated from top to bottom, front to back, and side to side in its supply chain. There isn't, nor has their ever been, a business on Earth fully capable of that. Hell, there aren't a lot of GOVERNMENTS capable of something like that. \n\nThird is the idea that a niche is somehow the incorrect approach to a business when, in reality, it is quite literally the only way to start a business from scratch. Unless you have millions of dollars, a full business development team, government backing, and a lot of luck, the chances that you start your business as some multi-faceted organization that produces lots of different products/services are slim to none. Furthermore, businesses that are already well established in a market are going to have the economies of scale to offer literally anything you can on your own far cheaper and better than you. Therefore, the only way to actually succeed IS to start with a niche and develop it into a high-quality offering that people/businesses are willing to pay a premium for. Some little tiny hole in the marketplace that's too small for the big players to take notice or take advantage of, but big enough for an individual to build out a business process to start growing with that niche as their base is what entrepreneurs look for. Sometimes the niche is a truly unique offering to the world, but more often than not it is simply a product/service offering that does not exist in a particular localized marketplace. \n\nAltogether, I think the sentiment that you're talking about here is less an identification of an actual problem and more of you just organically identifying one of the ways the global market functions.",

There are large dispatching companies, and people who do it themselves, get an LLC and work independently(what I did). When you do that you kinda fall into “driver manager” as well. Helping out with their routes, avoiding local roads that have low bridges or places a semi can’t get to.

Avoid chains because they’re using sisco, etc. Get together a list of a good 20+ local businesses. See if you can figure out anything they’d need regularly that you’d be able to get. I’ve not done it on that level so the only example I can think of is I had a guy locally that would deliver our buns. We didn’t go through enough where I was to do bulk orders because it’d go bad. But he’d pull up in his box full of bread and hit I can’t remember how many businesses. He did his runs in the morning then went home. But with the time and effort you could definitely(again, location will play in for sure) find a lane paying you $500 a day running 5 days a week.

Feet content works extremely well when you lean into specificity, certain aesthetics, themes, angles, accessories, or lifestyle positioning. I don’t rely on viral clips; I focus on recurring memberships, custom requests, premium bundles, and high-margin private content.\n\nAnd more importantly, the real leverage came from operating on adult turnkey scripts instead of depending on third-party platforms. I own the platform, the data, the pricing, and the backend funnels. Since I’m faceless, branding revolves around consistency, lighting quality, storytelling captions, and strong CTAs. Retention is where real money is made. Most people underestimate how strong this niche is because it’s subtle, but demand is global, production costs are low, and margins are high if you build it properly.",

I'm not even totally sure what I'm looking for advice maybe? If you've been in business for a while, have a similar story, any advice, tips, or just help would be appreciated tbh.\n\nI am a 25M my wife is 26F been together since we were 16. My wife has mostly stayed home with the kids, working part-time occasionally, which saved us from massive childcare costs while I focused on building my career/business.\n\nI started working young and come from a poor family so I have always had a \"work harder than everyone else\" mindset. I started at minimum wage in my industry (not tech/software... Important later). Working multiple jobs at once. I took on extra responsibilities at work and \"Job Hopped\" as needed to advance in my field. By 20, I was hired as a store manager and instead of working 90 hours a week (several jobs) I was working 70 hours a week (single job).\n\nWhen I was 21 I went on my first vacation ever and it changed my life. I realized my then 2 year old son barely knew me, he knew I was dad but didnt have a relationship with me. I missed every milestone working several jobs, finishing college, etc. I remember thinking what even is success and at what cost am i willing to achieve it... On the flight home, I decided I needed a remote career so I could actually be present in my life.\n\nLong story short I was in a position to do this because we had savings. But I stupidly quit my job before buying a house and essentially ruined our plans to do so. I then set out to find a remote job in my industry just to find out that remote and good pay didnt exist in my industry. So i decided if the job I needed didn't exist I would create it. \n\nI tried several business ideas that all failed because I was chasing money and not solving someones problem but eventually I found a problem and locked in. We served customers nationwide using mail carriers as part of fulfillment. Revenue came in, but not enough to live on. I reinvested everything. By the end the savings was basically gone, I had 20k in credit card debt, and I had 7k left in my business account. But I kept pushing forward, I'll figure it out later mentality.\n\nA few weeks later, a competitor approached me about merging. After a month of discussions, we combined companies. They were interested because I had built and operated everything myself. I taught myself software development and had already automated large portions of the business. I had real traction without funding.\n\nUnder the merger, I became head of my department, responsible for all technology and process development. My compensation was 25% equity (making me the second-largest shareholder), a $2,500/month salary, and a 5.5% monthly profit share. Based on EBITDA and projections, the company was valued around $9M. I treated the equity as my retirement plan, so I never pushed for higher pay and instead reinvested everything into growth even relocating my family to a lower cost-of-living state just to keep building.\n\nAfter the merger, the company exploded. We scaled nationwide using a franchise-style model, bringing in regional investors who shared in local profits. At our peak we were doing roughly $5M per quarter, opening locations weekly. I led multiple departments, built the operational infrastructure, automated processes, and spoke at events across the country. I even collaborated with Kathy Ireland on a NYT bestselling book about the company’s story.\n\nBut while the business grew, I neglected to protect myself. I didn’t build my personal brand, negotiate compensation, or insist on stronger legal and financial transparency. I assumed my equity would take care of me and focused entirely on execution... Building systems, documentation, and automation that made the company run.\n\nAs we scaled, expenses kept rising. The majority partner justified everything as “necessary for growth,” and because revenue was strong, I didn’t push back when I should have. Then things started unraveling. The COO abruptly left, surrendering his stake. Investors began asking questions I couldn’t answer because I didn’t have access to the financials. Franchisees started leaving, citing lack of support and ROI.\n\nAfter the CFO resigned, we finally forced access to the books.\n\nThat’s when we discovered the truth: the majority partner had been embezzling money, funding personal travel, diverting funds to unrelated businesses, and draining the company from the inside out. Operationally, the systems I built kept things running, but financially the business had already been gutted.\n\nTo avoid lawsuits and repay investors, we dismantled the company selling off profitable divisions and liquidating assets. When everything was gone, the remaining shell of what had once been a multi-million-dollar company sold for $10,000 and shares in a newly public entity.\n\nIn the end all said and done I walked away with 2.5k and 1M shares of a company I dont care about that were then valued at 500k but realistically are illiquid and could be worth 50k or less. We explored suing majority partner but first of all we all stupidly signed the documents and second of all he has nothing no house, no money, no investments, he works a dead-end job now. Pretty much every other partner besides him and I have gone on to start their own own semi-successful business after the fact. \n\nI had 2 kids when this all happened and needed to pay my bills so I went back to my industry (not tech/software) got rehired as a store manager and shortly after I was approached by a new company in our industry and they hired me into a remote position making a little less than 100k a year. This is probably the best job I've ever had and ironically was the goal all those years ago. But I don't feel like I did when I was running the company.\n\nIm more aware than my younger self, i have people who depend on me and Im now in a state with no support system to fall back on. I have a stable income, 401k, life insurance etc. My son has responsibilities, friends, sports etc. Worst of all were still renting and never bought a house. I want to start a new business but i cant justify gambling my families security like this all over again. \n\nHas anyone here experienced this or rebuilt after something like this? How can I justify starting over, not being present, investing in my company instead of a home etc. Should I just walk away from business, keep my stable job and hopefully climb the corporate ladder? Try to build another company but in a smarter, more controlled way? I don’t miss the chaos. But I do miss building something that was mine... Specifically the phase 2 version of past the startup phase.   \n\n\nWould really value advice from people who’ve navigated this stage of life/business.",

Almost exactly this.\n\nI worked in restaurant ops and major events management throughout my 20’s and when the pandemic hit and they all shut down, i co-founded a grocery distribution and parcel-rate cold-chain delivery company. My partner was the fundraiser and money manager and I oversaw literally everything else. The only other thing I didn’t do was write code but I still managed the tech team before we promoted one of them to CTO.\n\nI grew the operations to $3m ARR in 10 months. Two temp-controlled warehouses (total of 60k sqft), 23 reefer trucks, 55 employees, ~250 vendors, and thousands of customers, all exclusively within southern Ontario.\n\nI’m American and a college dropout out, so I was also arguing with Canadian immigration at the time, and after 3 years they came back and said they felt a Canadian could do my job and refused to renew my work permit. I wasn’t deported but it was heavily implied I would be if I didn’t leave myself or find a new way to qualify. \n\nThat’s when I found out that my co-founder had been mismanaging our funds and not paying our bills because the company wasn’t in a position to sponsor my employment anymore.\n\nI tried to pivot quickly because legally I wasn’t even allowed to work for the company anymore. I told him we needed to liquidate our physical inventory and convert all vendors to sell online and leverage our existing delivery platform so we don’t have to purchase inventory, but could instead rent out space in the warehouses to store their products if they preferred for us to pick and ship the product for them. It would have saved the company and all the vendors were on board because then they got far better sales insights and better inventory and production control.\n\nMy dipshit co-founder ignored my plans and kept trying to push the semi-traditional distribution model and within 3 months of my work permit renewal being denied he bankrupted the company to the tune of $3m CAD. All of our employees lost their jobs overnight with zero warning. All of our vendors and customers lost a pivotal distro partner that changed the whole game for them. \n\nI still cry about it to this day. I’m furious at him for what he did. To add insult to injury, once the dust settled, he restarted the business under a new name but using the model I suggested to save our company and it’s actually become very successful.\n\nAnd I have applied for many many jobs in the CPG industry and cannot even get an interview. It’s been almost 4 years. I have zero money. Zero debt too but zero money. Part of me believes that he somehow blacklisted me because I told people the truth when they asked me what happened.\n\nHe’s only operating in Canada though. If anyone here ever wanted to hear more about the business/would be interested in disrupting CPG distribution in the USA and has funding for it, holler. I can absolutely repeat what I did in Canada with the right partner and resources.",

I'm not sure that's the right advice. You don't have the time or the cash to do it, and I think you're probably just looking for us to confirm that it is possible- just not yet. \n\nIf you have got that entrepreneurial buzzer constantly going off in your head, then go for it. But just start something small and no budget. With your experience, you can do it. You don't need investors and you don't need a co founder, you just need to think smaller. Something to scratch the itch. Then you'll find the timing to go big, or you won't. Maybe it's enough for a side hustle with full time income and security?",

Simple.\n\nOthers are building niche SaaS tools on top of existing models. Instead of competing with OpenAI or whoever, they wrap AI around one industry specific pain point. Real estate descriptions. Recruitment screening. Amazon listing optimisation. Boring wins. And then there are service businesses using AI to increase margin. Marketing agencies using AI for research and drafts. Copywriters delivering faster. Consultants building internal GPT systems for clients. It is less magic and more leverage.\n\nThe hype is loud but the money usually comes from clarity. Clear problem. Clear outcome. Clear ROI. Not vibes.I break down practical online income and business experiments I am testing on my profile if that helps.",

They just happen to be using AI as the internal mechanism to make it work. Real game is in the boring stuff... for example, we build custom agents that act as internal knowledge bases for companies.   \n  \nWe feed it every SOP, doc, & past project file. Product isn't the AI... the product is cutting new hire onboarding time by 75%.   \n  \nThat's a real, measurable outcome you can put on an invoice. Another big one is just automating the grunt work for service businesses. We build systems that handle all the initial client intake... asking the qualifying questions, sorting the tire-kickers from the real leads, & booking the good ones. The product isn't a chatbot... it's guaranteeing the sales team only spends time with people who can actually afford them.   \n  \nAnd honestly, the biggest opportunity is just being the glue. Most businesses are already running on platforms like Salesforce, Hubspot or Highlevel. We build the connective tissue that plugs advanced AI capabilities into the tools they already use. We're not selling them a new platform... we're making the one they've already paid for 10x more powerful.   \n  \nYou have to stop looking at AI in a vacuum, start with a real business P&L. Find the most expensive, manual process on that sheet... & just replace it. The money isn't in selling AI, it's in selling solved problems.",

From what I'm observing, the most successful AI businesses right now fall into a few categories: companies automating specific, repetitive tasks (like document processing or customer service routing), those creating AI-powered features within existing products rather than standalone AI tools, and consultants helping traditional businesses identify where AI can actually solve real problems they're already paying to solve manually.\n\n\n\nThe key seems to be starting with a genuine business problem that costs time or money, then seeing if AI can address it more efficiently - rather than starting with \"how can I use AI?\" and working backwards.\n\n\n\nThis approach is exactly what led me to develop Bobos.ai. Having been on both sides of the marketing equation - running small businesses that couldn't afford $10K+ agency fees and working inside agencies watching small clients pay premium rates for junior talent - I saw a broken system. Small businesses needed real marketing help (strategy AND execution) at prices that actually made sense, with transparency instead of black boxes.\n\n\n\nSo we built Bobos around a simple premise: give away the marketing strategy for free, and only charge when businesses want help executing it. We use AI to streamline our strategy development and project management, but pair it with real marketing professionals - strategists, designers, ad specialists, content creators, and PMs who are accountable to you.\n\n\n\nAnd ironically, I'm using an AI social coach right now to help refine this very response, which is a perfect example of AI solving a real problem (helping me communicate more effectively) rather than being AI for AI's sake.\n\n\n\nWhat specific business challenges are you seeing in your industry that feel like they might benefit from this kind of hybrid approach - where AI handles the repetitive work but humans drive the strategy and relationships?

      "text": "If you’re a small founder, trying to outspend a nine figure giant on Google Ads or LinkedIn is basically a suicide mission. They have 50k a month just for \"test\" budgets. You have a mortgage.\n\nBut huge companies have a massive weakness: they are deaf. They rely on automated bots, generic marketing emails, and customer support teams that take three days to reply. We realized that if we couldn't outspend them, we could out-listen them.\n\nOver the last 60 days, we’ve been stealing customers from our biggest competitors by showing up at the exact moment they fail.\n\n# Finding Places Where Your Competitors Fail\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people vent their frustrations about big name software on Reddit and X.\n\n* \"Why did \\[Giant Competitor\\] just double their prices?\"\n* \"Is it just me, or is \\[Giant Competitor\\] down again?\"\n* \"Does anyone have a better alternative for \\[Competitor\\]? Their support is non-existent.\"\n\nMost companies don't see these posts until they’ve been live for two days. By then, the user has already moved on or just given up. We decided to make our response time our primary competitive advantage.\n\n# The Workflow\n\nWe built a \"Strike Team\" workflow (which is literally just me and one assistant) to catch these signals in real time.\n\n1. **The Trigger:** We monitor specific \"vulnerability\" keywords for our top five competitors. We don't just track their brand names. We track their names plus words like \"alternative,\" \"broken,\" \"slow,\" or \"overpriced.\"\n2. **The Contextual Reply:** When a signal hits, we don't send a sales pitch. We jump into the thread and offer immediate, specific help.\n   * **Example:** \"I saw you're struggling with that API integration. We actually built our tool specifically to solve that because we had the same issue. Happy to give you a free 3 month trial to help you migrate over today.\"\n3. **The Closing:** We offer a \"Concierge Migration.\" If they are leaving a big player, they are usually terrified of the data move. We tell them we’ll do the heavy lifting for them.\n\n# Our Results\n\n|**Metric**|**Google Ads (Old Way)**|**Social Intent (The New Way)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Budget**|$2,000/mo minimum|$0 in Ad Spend|\n|**Conversion Rate**|2-3%|15-20%|\n|**Lead Quality**|Just browsing|Ready to switch NOW|\n|**Customer Vibe**|Just another ad|You guys are a lifesaver|\n\nThe giants in your industry are moving too fast to care about a single frustrated tweet or Reddit thread. That frustration is your market opportunity.\n\nIn 60 days, we messaged 42 accounts for nearly $0 CAC (just software), and we closed 8 of those leads, adding over $1.5k MRR.",

Big companies almost never do this, and users feel like they're shouting into the void with their requests. Even just saying \"feature requests are open, and here's what we're prioritizing this month\" creates a sense of buy-in you can't really fake.\n\n\n\nWe built a product in the Chrome extension space around this idea, and it’s wild how much goodwill comes from actually listening, shipping fast, and letting users steer the ship.

I've seen accounts get shadowbanned for that even when the help was genuine. mixing in pure value comments (no mention of your tool at all) in those same communities helps a lot with not looking like you're astroturfing. like a 5:1 ratio of helpful comments to actual product mentions\n\nsolid numbers for $0 ad spend tho. 8 closes from 42 outreach is wild",

Here are the ones that gets mentioned often inside our company\n\n* Generating Presentations: After every client meeting, Zooms AI Summary, is auto routed to Gamma. Gamma then generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n* A/B testing ads: Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n* Content Based on Google Data: Again, we used to constantly manually look at our Google search console data and publish weekly content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those on Google! Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every Monday! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n* Meeting Notes & Followups: Granola has been great for recording meetings, summarizing, generating follow-up emails, and just making sure that we don't miss any context. \n\nFollowing to see what others have it going :)",

          "text": "Start with the boring stuff. That’s where you save the most time. Here are some of the repeatable tasks u can start with (depending upon ur business and priority) \n\n\\- For lead capture to CRM and follow ups, stop adding people manually. When someone fills a form or books a call, they should go straight into your CRM, get tagged and receive a follow-up email right away. Zapier and Make are great for connecting your forms to your CRM. HubSpot or ActiveCampaign are good if you want forms, CRM, and email sequences in one place.\n\n\\- For calendar booking and reminders, reduce no shows with simple automation. When someone books a call, they should get automatic reminders and a followups after the meeting. Calendly is very easy to set up.\n\n\\- For writing and brainstorming, sometimes typing slows you down. Being able to speak your first draft helps you get ideas out quickly, then clean them up after. Voibe also works well here since it lets you dictate into writing tools and AI apps. Other options include tools like Otter for transcription, Notion AI for cleaning up rough drafts.\n\n\\- For content repurposing, create once and reuse it everywhere. Record a video or podcast, then turn it into posts, emails, and blogs. Descript helps with transcripts and editing. Opus Clip turns long videos into short clips. ChatGPT can turn transcripts into posts or blog drafts. Buffer helps you schedule everything so you’re not posting manually every day.\n\n\\- For email sorting and replies, let your inbox organize itself. Instead of reading everything one by one, use tools that sort and draft replies for you. Superhuman is fast and clean. SaneBox auto-sorts emails. Marblism can manage your inbox, draft replies, and handle follow-ups so you just review and send.\n\nKeep in mind: automate clear(tasks for which u have SOPs), repeatable tasks first. If something already works well, automate it. If it’s messy, make a process/SOP before using or trying new tools.",

One area I hardly ever see folks mention is automating inventory demand forecasting and reorder workflows, most people still manually check inventory or rely on their gut, which ties up cash or leads to stockouts. There are tools that use AI to flag risky SKUs and even auto-generate purchase orders based on real-time trends, which can free up a ton of mental space and protect cash flow.

If I worked hard enough, things would click.\n\nThey don’t.\n\nThe biggest thing I wish I had known is this:  \nBusiness is less about working hard and more about working on the right thing.\n\nMarketing isn’t magic. It’s clarity.  \nIf people are “interested” but not paying, it usually means one of three things:\n\nThe problem isn’t painful enough\n\nThe value isn’t clear enough\n\nThe trust isn’t strong enough\n\nEarly on, I wasted time trying to convince people. Later I realized, if you have to push too hard, you’re either targeting the wrong audience or solving a weak problem.\n\nAnother lesson: revenue is truth.  \nLikes, followers, compliments - none of that matters. If someone pays you, that’s validation. If they don’t, that’s feedback.\n\nAlso, don’t romanticize starting from scratch. I used to think building from zero was the only “real” way. Over time I learned that smart entrepreneurs look for leverage partnerships, acquisitions, existing demand, distribution channels. Starting is good. Entering wisely is better.\n\nAnd lastly, confusion is normal.  \nEvery founder feels like they don’t know what they’re doing. The difference is successful ones keep moving anyway. They test, adjust, simplify, repeat.\n\nYou don’t need to know everything.\n\nYou just need to:  \nSolve a real problem.  \nCharge early.  \nListen carefully.  \nAnd stay in the game longer than most people.\n\nClarity comes from action, not overthinking.",

For what it takes, they’re really easy to make, just give yourself plenty of time because people take ages to reply to your emails, every fix up on paperwork takes like a week to amend, even if it’s small, it’s annoying. The biggest problem is getting up front money, so when you’re starting and scaling I’m take huge financial risk as I’m working on loans and a lot of hope that I can make enough money to pay off huge lump sums of money in deadlines so I don’t lose thousand and thousands in deposits, start small with a proof of concept and then go big",

Every decision goes through them. Every problem needs them. At first that feels normal, and even necessary. But over time it becomes a trap.\n\nIf the business can’t function without you, then you didn’t really build a business. You built a responsibility that never lets go of you.\n\nThe turning point is when you start putting the right people in place. People you trust. People who can handle things without needing you every five minutes. That’s when you can finally step back a little.\n\nAnd when you step back, you start seeing things differently. When you’re in the middle of it every day, you’re just reacting. Fixing problems. Answering questions. Putting out fires. You don’t have the mental space to see what actually needs to change.\n\nBut from the outside, things become more obvious. You notice inefficiencies. You notice patterns. You notice problems you didn’t even realize were there.\n\nYou also get your freedom back. You can take time off. You can breathe. And weirdly enough, the business often gets better when you stop hovering over everything.\n\nBeing involved is important, especially early on.

Your girlfriend walked into the middle of a movie that's been playing for years and you're expecting her to care about the plot twists the same way someone who's been watching from the start does.\n\nThe other thing is that \"sounds busy\" might be her honest response. If she's not an entrepreneur and her job doesn't consume her the same way, she might genuinely not know what to do with the information. She's not being dismissive, she just doesn't have a frame for it. That can feel like the same thing but it isn't.\n\nIt helped me ask myself what I actually needed from the conversation. If it was processing, I started calling a friend who runs a business. If it was connection with her, I stopped leading with work and found something else to talk about that we were both actually in. The relationship got better once I stopped treating her like a cofounder.",

I’m a non-technical founder who has never written a line of code.\n\nGoing from ceo of a 500-person company to a small startup was a shock. Suddenly, I had no one to delegate to. Hiring for marketing or sales would burn through runway, and pulling my small engineering team off the core product to build internal tools felt like a huge waste.\n\nSo I started feeding prompts to claude. I honestly thought it was a joke at first, but it's like becoming a spell-casting wizard without going to wizarding school. In the past month, I've built AI agents that manage my social media engagement, an app that writes my investor updates by pulling from slack and email, and I even rebuilt our entire marketing site in a day.\n\nThe result is my five engineers stay 100% focused on the core product, which has massively increased our velocity. And I can run all founder-led growth myself without hiring, which makes us incredibly capital efficient. It completely changed the trajectory of the business.",

DONT SPEND IT OR INVEST IN SOMEONE ELSE.\n\nTalk to AI or a free tax advisor about how to minimize your tax liability on it. Maybe take the money as a trust or LLC.\n\nDONT all the sudden think you are a businessman and quit your day job. Stay employed because $50k isn’t that much money these days.\n\nDONT tell anyone you won money especially people around you like friends and family.\n\nDO research on low cost/ low involvement side businesses like laundromats and the like. But tbh $50k isn’t that much and might get lost in these sorts of businesses. Be aware of your risk.\n\nDO pay off a vehicle but don’t just buy-a-bucket. Get something that is going to last and that has low maintenance costs. You could save money on auto insurance this way by carrying liability only. \n\nDONT pay off your debt. That’s horrible advice! There is good debt and bad debt. Having good credit is beneficial. Having current credit is beneficial. Debt should be kept at a percentage of income and preferably paid without penalty. Debt should be BUDGETED.\n\nDO budget your income and living expenses. Use this opportunity to get ahead but don’t think like you won the lottery (not in this economy). \n\nThe best businesses to get into are the ones you don’t have to fund yourself. If you do decide to go into business, get a LLC or Corp in Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada. (Ask ai the difference between them and which is better for your situation.) Register your business with an EIN and DUNS number. EIN and DUNS are free but you need to register your LLC (about $200). DUNS registered means you can get business credit.\n\nAs far as investing:\n\nI believe an IRA or Roth IRA might lower your taxable income also, but verify that. I think the yearly max for RothIRA is $6-7k though.\n\nYou could invest in life insurance also. MetLIFE policies is what union tradesman use. Which also might lower your taxable income. (There are different policies though that you are going to want to pay attention to and research beforehand). Whole life is better (than term-life) especially if you’re younger since its value appreciates and sometimes you can use it.\n\nAs far as ETF investing, when the sp500 is up gold goes down. Somewhat. You could invest in both when they pull back (down) to a 30 moving average. Invest slowly not all at once. But this sort of investment is what you should be doing regularly for yourself irrespective of winnings.\n\nBitcoin has proven itself also. But crypto could also be more risky. Maybe take a little cash and create your own mime coin. But don’t go all in with your winnings (into anything).",
