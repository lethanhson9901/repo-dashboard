      "text": "so we had this customer who was extremely frustrated with us(asking for refunds / angry emails on serivce etc). every week they'd email support with another complaint. my cofounder wanted to just refund them and move on\n\ninstead i got on a call and asked if theyd be willing to show me exactly what they hated. turned into a 2 hour screen share where they basically roasted our entire product lol\n\nat some point i just said screw it and asked \"what if you designed it yourself? what would it look like?\"\n\nthey sent me back a excalidraw file the next hour. it was ugly as hell but honestly it was genius\n\nwe had all these charts and graphs and filters because we thought it looked professional. they replaced it with like 5 big numbers and a single button that said \"export for my boss\"\n\nshowed it to the team and there was silence. our lead designer was honestly kinda offended. but i pushed us to build it exactly as the customer spec'd it. took maybe a week\n\nthat angry customer became our biggest referral source. theyve sent us like 12 clients\n\nnow we do this regularly. every quarter we find our most frustrated user and give them way too much access. they roast us and we build whatever they ask for\n\nturns out the people who complain the most are just the ones who care the most\n\nanyone else ever let customers dictate product decisions like this? curious if its worked for others",

Every morning feels like pushing a boulder uphill. There's no one I can turn to and say \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" or \"I'm exhausted\" without it affecting morale or their sense of job security. I have everyone analyzing my personality to see if I'm cut out for it, and I don't care to have all this pressure (I know pressure is a privilege, but I've stopped feeling the passion).\n\nI catch myself being jealous of the stability of those who have a salary (I've never had one). It feels like each month I have no clue what the next month will entail. I resent the company now and the clients. I dream about sending a resignation email TO MYSELF. But if someone took my place I would rather die. My business is like my child and I've put multiple six figures into it.\n\nI KNOW I'm not built for a corporate job. And there ARE parts of what I do that I enjoy - I just can't seem to hold onto them under along with everything else. I know theoretically I have the power to shape this into something I love. I built it, so I should be able to rebuild it, right? But I have no clue how to get from where I am to where I want to be since I've gone so far.\n\nAnyone else been here? Did you figure out how to fall back in love with what you built, or am I just spinning my wheels?",

The answer for me was figuring out how to do some of the work myself and also downsizing so I needed less help. I didn’t want to deal with firing my trusty employees that was the biggest issue but luckily a few of them ended up wanting to move on to different jobs anyway. The final step was I moved to a different state and closed my original office so that took care of another employee or two. Kinda just blamed it on the move and downsizing and they totally understood. \n\nAnyway, it was a long difficult transition but now I just have 2 employees - 1 of them is a salesperson who works remote and basically pays for herself and it’s very part time so no pressure, and the other is my spouse and we share our money so the salary thing doesn’t matter as much. I recognize this is a unique situation and might not be realistic for many businesses but it’s worked out beautifully. \n\nRegardless I think the sentiment of downsizing and doing more of the busy work yourself if possible is relatable. My dad was an entrepreneur and had the same issue but on a much larger scale but he said the same thing about there being a sweet spot when the business was smaller and then it all got messed up when he hired more people and expanded and everyone depending on him etc. \n\nidk your situation and if this is possible but hopefully it helps. \n\nAlso don’t sweat the employees depending on you and maybe needed to let some of them go, it’s just business not personal and in my experience the best thing you can do is give them a huge amount of time to figure out a different job if you do decide to downsize. I gave a couple employees like 3 months notice and they had new jobs secured before I actually wanted them to quit lol",

You've also said several yellow/red flags of common mistakes. \n\n\nI would highly recommend therapy and or a CEO coach, but first you need a week long vacation minimum where you don't answer any emails or check any work. No your company won't implode in 5 business days, but you will catch weaknesses in your processes.\n\n\nLet me address your yellow flags:\n\"Can't turn to anyone for help\". You absolutely can and should say \"I don't know\" followed by \"but I can help you find the answer\". Leadership is about learning and helping those around, not always already having the right answer.  Also you can find business owners, that are in similar spaces or promote/identify people on the team. I bounce ideas off other business owners, chances are the same problem you haven has happened millions of times before. \n\n\nYou absolutely can say \"I'm exhausted\". Literally you say \"hey guys I'm not feeling hot today so I may be a little slow in my response today\". We are whole human beings. In our weekly status meeting we would start with green yellow red for personal mood you could elaborate, but you didn't have to. \n\n\nyou're not responsible for the emotional state of everyone around you and your not solving for happiness. You shouldn't inflict panic or confusion but you absolutely can say \"Hey team that big job fell through so we are only going to have 10k in the bank at the end of this month, let's try to slow down non essentials\" if you give people more accurate information they can make more accurate decisions. \n\n\nI resented my company at one point. It usually means you're doing to much. I don't know your cost structure but go hire a chief of staff, coo, president etc. Let them run all the average business day to day and only focus where you add unique value. \n\n\n\"If someone took my place I would rather die\" HUGE red flag. You just said \"I don't want to grow and my ego is tied into this\". First at the end of the day this is about a lifestyle and money. There's nothing wrong about being at any size, but if you \"can't\" give up control you are acknowledging you will never scale past your personal bandwidth to make every important decision. I run two companies at the same time I absolutely give up as much work as possible to others. I'm there to inspire and pick strategy. I've already sold companies and lost them I'm at peace with any business.\n\n\n\"My business is like a child and I put six figures into it\" I'm confused is this a net positive venture? have you put in more than you've got out? Is this a viable business or a really expensive hobby? If you got your money out, hour much you put in makes no difference. If it's not cash for positive evaluate why. \n\n\nYes to answer your question I fell back in love my giving up everything I hated doing and dragging my feet on and only do the stuff I love and can add value. Best feeling was coming in when I wanted and leaving when I wanted because I was confident the team had it covered. I also have up control knowing people would do things differently, but it was my job to course correct not gate keep. \n\n\nPractical advise new company policy that every manager has to take off at least 4 days in a row once per quarter. Starting with your self. You need to step away and look at things objectively, and it prevents burnout.",

          "text": "Reading this, I hear someone whose nervous system has been under sustained responsibility for a long time. Being the person others depend on financially and emotionally activates something very primal. Over time, the work stops being experienced as creative or meaningful and starts being carried as a weight that never really comes off. The trapped feeling you describe often shows up when identity, responsibility, and safety become too tightly bound together. I see this all the time with the people I work with. When the business holds all of that at once, the system rarely gets to rest.  Resentment towards the company and the clients tends to appear when there has been no safe place to express uncertainty or exhaustion. If you’re always required to be the steady one, the honest parts of you get pushed into the background. Over time, that disconnect makes it harder to feel close to the work, even when parts of it are still meaningful.\nMany founders reach this stage because the business has grown beyond the internal structure that originally built it. What worked in the early years can become unsustainable when the stakes are higher and the responsibility wider. That shift often brings confusion rather than clarity, especially when there’s a sense that you should be able to handle it better by now.\n\nChange  is possible, but it usually unfolds once there is more internal safety and less pressure to hold everything together alone. Insight and motivation tend to return after the system feels supported, not before. You’re noticing something very common and real here , and you’re not the only one who reaches this point. Speaking it out loud is often the beginning of a necessary reorganisation, even if the next steps aren’t obvious yet",

It sounds like becoming the \"emotional shock absorber\", risk carrier and decision dumpster for everyone else. And dude, that role drains the joy out of anything, no matter how much you once loved it. Been there...\n\nA big trap a bunch of founders fall into is confusing being CEO with being a \"martyr\". I tell my friends that your team doesn’t actually need you to be invincible. They just need you to be predictable, clear, and definitely have systems in place. Feeling like you can’t say \"I’m tired\" isn’t a personal flaw... it's just a sign that the business depends too much on you.\n\nAnd you know, resenting clients usually is not about passion disappearing either. Most times i'ts a systems problem. When every issue, fire, or request hits your nervous system directly, something is broken either in boundaries, your pricing, your scope, or even delegation. Just try to fix those things once in a while and you'll see it'll bring you instant relief.\n\nMost founders who fantasize about resigning don’t really want out. Deep down they actually can't! They just want relief. And boy, the solution is never  stepping away from the company and much more often stepping away from being the center of everything. If you just try and yourself from day-to-day operations you'll see it'll change the weight of the role massively.\n\nAnd envying salary stability is more normal than people admit. Heck, how many times I wanted to throw everything out of the window?! But you see, employees envy freedom and us founders envy predictability. Both sides are only seeing the upside of the other. The grass is greener...\n\nI don't think that falling back in love with what you built is about motivation or mindset. For me it's more about redesigning the role. Get real honest about the small part of the job you still like to do and then delegate, systemize, or eliminate the rest. If the business can’t survive that, it wasn’t actually sustainable yet.\n\nAnd man, feeling trapped doesn’t mean you failed, even though failing isn't bad at all, it's just another lesson. It just means that your company outgrew the version of you that built it. The next move isn’t quitting. It’s evolving. I'm going through that right now, actually!\n\nKeep it up, man, you’re at the point where hustle stops working and design has to start. PM me if you need to chat!",

It will make your problems feel insurmountable and the pressure is so great you’d rather stay in bed than figure it out. \n\nWhen your levels are optimized, you actually enjoy the challenge. Struggle and pressure feel good again like it did when you were young and just starting your business. \n\nI’ll tell you something you could do in your business if you feel lost. Just start cleaning it up. Look for messes, chaos, ambiguity, waste, excess, and just starting tidying up. Don’t worry about growth or what’s next. Look at what you have right now and figure out what needs attention. Small stuff from organizing your desktop/inbox, to organizing and painting a mop closet, going over your finances and making sure you’re paying for what you need and nothing more. Look at roles and the org chart to see if it’s still optimal. \n\nIf you spend your time doing Maintence and upkeep on the business, it will run better and be more enjoyable. It will set you up to grab new opportunities when they arrive. \n\nSo that’s my answer.

While you should not say \"I don't know what I'm doing\", you can bring issues and problems to them so they can help solve them. \n   * They know more than you give them credit for. They know the issues of the businesses and know you are exhausted or burnt out, so stop treating them like they don't.\n   * Meet in an \"all hands\" meeting at least monthly and ask what they see as the top issues and then include them to help solve them. Trying to do it all yourself is not how effective leaders operate.\n* Find and develop a #2. All businesses need a #2 in case you are hit by the proverbial bus. This person will help you which will reduce the pressure on just you as they can share it. Make sure they have skin in the game by offering profit sharing, or some kind of small equity ownership position. \n   * Make sure this is NOT a \"yes person\". Deliberately select someone who has different views or approaches from you. Someone who will stand up and challenge you in private, then come to an agreement and be solidly together in front of the staff.\n   * Over time work to transition authority and key functions to your #2 so you can focus on the business.\n* A saying I learned was that process and planning can set you free. If you're so stressed out then this means you do not have solid planning or robust processes meaning your business is not in your control. \n   * Why is it some businesses run like clockwork, make good profits, and are virtually stress free, while others are chaos and struggle every day?\n   * Process and planning will smooth out your business to take a lot of stress off of you and everyone. \n   * In addition to running smoother, the business will be more efficient, lower expenses, have much better employee morale and customer satisfaction, which all leads to more loyalty and profits.\n* Culture: This maybe should be the top item, but takes the most time and leadership commitment. There is a saying that \"culture beats strategy\" every time. Strategy is great, but in a low performance culture even the best strategy can fail. In a high performance culture even a poor strategy can often succeed.\n   * Develop a high performance culture in your company. This encompasses a lot of the above as it will entail partnering with your employees, trusting them to help identify and provide, then deploy, solutions to the issues facing the business.\n   * Instead of seeing them as someone you have to provide livelihoods for, see them as partners and you are all in this together to win or lose as a team!\n   * There are some great books out there on highly successful companies who thrived because they had a high performance culture, read them and start making this change today.\n\nI could go on, but hopefully this helps!",

It sounds like the old you is standing on the way of the new more powerful you and doesn't let him out. \n\nThe old you has taken too much responsibility for other people's emotions and pain at your own expense. He agreed to things that aren't in your best interests, justifying it with responsibility, but secretly dreading their judgement or disapproval. \n\nAll of this happened because the old you, the younger version of you was conditioned to tolerate certain things you didn't really want to accept, but had to because the alternative was loneliness and disapproval from your parents, teachers, other kids, society and social norms in general.\n\nAnd while the old you felt passionate about the business because it allowed it to run away from the pain, the new you doesn't want to run. He wants to face all the shit you thought was ok but are not really ok. \n\n\n\nHaving no idea what you're doing? Sounds like accepting stories and narratives that you didn't really want to accept but still justified them somehow. Hence the resentment to clients. \n\nFeeling trapped because you feel responsibility for other people's livelihood? But your resentment screams \"it's not your responsibility to carry them if they don't make your business stronger!\"\n\nAnd having no clue how to get to where you want? A clear signal that you know what you have to do, but your mind protects you from all the pain and discomfort the old version of you has gotten into due to his conditioning.\n\n  \nIt sounds like me a few years back, a lot of people I know. You realize the old habits, beliefs, and values keep you chained to serving others in a way that's not beneficial to you or them. \n\nBut you're too scared that others will judge you if you change. That you will be alone (not realizing you already are). That they will hate you and attack you for not doing what they want you to do.\n\n  \nIf I were to give an advice, I'd say just pick one thing that gives you the most disdain and resentment, do nothing and just sit with the feeling. Your mind will tell you what to do. Don't resist it. \n\nYour business is not the end goal, it's your journey to becoming a more powerful version of you. Cut the crap that you know doesn't serve you, feel the pain, don't run away from it, and listen to your mind. It will tell you exactly what you need.",

It’s **role overload**. You didn’t just build a business, you slowly became the container for everyone else’s certainty, income, and emotional stability. That’s an impossible position to live in long-term without resentment showing up somewhere.\n\nA few things stand out to me:\n\n* The exhaustion isn’t just from work. It’s from **having nowhere to put doubt**. When you’re the emotional ceiling, even your humanity feels risky to reveal.\n* The jealousy of salaried stability doesn’t mean you want their lives. It usually means your nervous system is tired of unpredictability.\n* Resenting the business and clients is often a sign that **your identity fused with the company too early**. When that happens, every problem feels personal, and every month feels like a referendum on *you*.\n\nThe line about wanting to resign from yourself, and yet not wanting anyone else to take your place, is incredibly telling. That’s not ambivalence; that’s grief. Grief for the version of you who built this with hunger and possibility instead of responsibility and weight.\n\nYou’re right about one thing: you *can* reshape what you built. But most founders get stuck because they try to do that **from inside the same role that’s burning them out**. You can’t redesign the system while you’re still carrying all of it in your body.\n\nFalling back in love with the business usually isn’t about passion first. It’s about:\n\n* narrowing your role to what actually needs *you*,\n* rebuilding internal safety (predictability, boundaries, buffers),\n* and separating your worth from the company’s monthly performance.\n\nThat doesn’t mean abandoning it. It means **outgrowing the version of leadership that got you here**.\n\nSo no, you’re not spinning your wheels. You’re at a very real threshold that a lot of founders hit but few name out loud. The next chapter usually isn’t “quit” or “push harder.” It’s learning how to lead *without disappearing inside what you built*.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. And nothing you wrote sounds like someone who’s done, it sounds like someone who’s been carrying too much, for too long, without a place to put it.",

It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

Finally had a client tell me straight up \"I don't care what you call it, I just need my team to stop drowning in spreadsheets\"\n\n  \nThat math approach is huge - I started breaking down exactly how many hours their current process was eating and what that meant in actual dollars. Once you show them they're basically paying someone's salary just to do busy work, the conversation shifts real quick. Also learned the hard way about targeting too small - those solopreneurs will absolutely try to DIY everything even if it takes them 10x longer\n\n  \nThe competitor social media thing is brilliant though, never thought of that angle.

I've found the sweet spot is 5-50 employees - big enough that processes are actually breaking down and someone's job is to worry about it, small enough that the owner still feels the pain directly and can make fast decisions.\n\nCurious what your discovery process looks like now.

I've seen the same thing with customer communication channels.\n\n\n\nBusinesses will say \"We have omnichannel support\" or \"We use AI chatbots\" - and customers tune out immediately. But when you say \"Text us anytime, we respond in under 2 minutes\" - suddenly people lean in.\n\n\n\nThe pattern you've identified isn't just about avoiding buzzwords. It's about starting the conversation where your customer's pain lives, not where your solution lives.\n\n\n\nYour \"before\" pitch answered \"What do you do?\" Your \"after\" pitch answered \"What problem do I have that you fix?\"\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add: the specificity matters too. \"15+ hours/week\" and \"cut that to 2\" are concrete numbers that make it real. Vague promises like \"save time\" or \"increase efficiency\" don't land the same way because people can't visualize them.\n\n\n\nSMBs especially respond to this because they're drowning in vendor pitches all day. The moment you demonstrate you understand their actual daily reality (not just industry pain points), you're in a different category.",

I see this all the time with SMBs - they don't care about the tech stack, they care about getting their weekends back.\n\n\n\nOne thing to add: the communication channel matters as much as the message. A lot of SMB owners are drowning in email but will respond to a text within minutes. If you're doing cold outreach, consider testing SMS vs email with the same value-focused pitch.\n\n\n\nI've seen response rates jump 3-4x just by meeting them where they already are (phone) vs where we want them to be (email/forms).\n\n\n\nYour point about \"show the math\" is crucial. When you can say \"you're spending $2k/month on admin time for X task, I can do it for $500\" - that's a conversation starter, not a sales pitch. The decision basically makes itself.\n\n\n\nFor anyone reading this struggling with the same thing: ask yourself \"what specific task is eating their time?\" not \"what can my tool do?\" The minute you can name the exact pain point, your pitch writes itself.",

Would anyone believe he didn't have connections to make it such a success?\n\nHeck, there was one financial guru, who did seem to have a reasonably level head, till he said he bought a Ford GT for \"$0 dollars\".  Yeahhhh, he kinda forgot to mention that it's only \"$0 dollars\" after the car would be sold.  Totally skipping the $275K he still needed to drop on it to get it in the first place, and let the appreciation take care of the 'cost'.  I stopped following him right after that.\n\nI mean, let's not even mention that when was the last time you saw a millionaire posting an add on Instagram to make you rich as well?  Hell, even Tony Robbin's stuff is more about 'feel good' methods than it is about anything else.  Does anyone thing he already doens't have enough money to deal with all the things he's doing?\n\nWhat we need are real guides and practices that actually work for where any of us are in our journeys.  Those are usually not glamorous or necessarily product any kind of significant income.  Most really help you fine-tune what we are(or in some cases are not) already doing.  That's not very 'sexy' to sell.\n\nEven Tim Ferris, and he's about the only one I feels gets it, wrote a book (The 4hr Work Week) was great for the time, but now is dated and now being 'remote' for work is pretty common.  (Not to mentioned being....errr...'enforced' in recent times.)\n\nThose of us who are struggling can't afford a $1000 course, or $200/month for 'group support'.  \n\nIs there an answer out there or someone who really gets it and shares real world facts and assistance that doesn't take away from beginners who are mostly flailing around?

One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for the tool for a long term.\n4. Can it connect to your CRM without making things worse\n5. Will support actually help if LinkedIn sends you a warning\n\n\n\nWhat else should be on here?\n\n",

I like that you’re focusing less on “features” and more on risk and the real constraints.\n\nOne thing I’d add that people often underestimate: profile readiness and trust. Even the “safest” tool won’t help if your profile looks empty or spammy. Before you automate anything, tighten up your headline and experience, use a good photo, add a couple posts or quick case studies, and be clear about who you help and why you’re reaching out. It reduces reports and usually boosts conversion a lot.",

The best automation handles the repetitive parts (sending messages, follow-ups) but frees you up to focus on genuine engagement when someone responds.\n\n\n\nFor outreach beyond LinkedIn, consider multi-channel automation - SMS/WhatsApp can have even better response rates than LinkedIn messages, especially for local businesses.

Some cheaper ones keep auto-sending follow-ups even after someone responds, which looks terrible and burns relationships fast.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if the tool randomly varies timing between actions. If it's sending connection requests at exact intervals (like every 60 seconds on the dot), LinkedIn's algorithm picks up on that pattern pretty quickly.  \n  \nOn your point about limits, I've found the tools that force you to warm up your account gradually (like starting at 20-30 invites per day for new accounts) are actually the ones that keep you safer long term, even though it feels frustratingly slow at first.  \n  \nOne thing I'd push back on slightly though: automation works best for getting initial connections, but once someone accepts or replies, I've had way better results switching to manual, personalised messages rather than keeping everything in the sequence. The conversion difference is massive.  \n  \nAre you planning to run this yourself or have a VA handle it?",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

I’ve seen small SaaS deals where the founder is basically the product and once they leave, it collapses. Also how do you handle payment processing and legal structure early on.

      "text": "So in 1347 rats hitched rides on merchant ships and brought the plague to Europe. Nobody noticed til it was too late because the rats looked like they belonged there.\n\nThat’s literally what’s happening to the internet right now. Bots everywhere, on every platform, and you can’t tell anymore because they all sound like that one overachieving kid in class who read the textbook twice.\n\nMedieval doctors wore bird masks and prescribed leeches. We have AI detection tools that are wrong half the time. Same energy honestly.\n\nThe plague ended when the rats ran out of people to infect. This one ends when AI runs out of human content to train on and starts eating its own output. We’re watching the internet develop mad cow disease in real time.",

No matter what kind of business I think about, it feels out of reach because I lack the necessary knowledge.\n\nA few quick facts about me: I’m 30 and I’ve started studying computer science (but I’m still not very good at it).  \nHowever, I’m good at math. I also speak three languages: German, Russian, and English. I can think analytically as well.  \nUnfortunately, that’s where it ends, those are basically all my skills. I’m not writing this because I want to start something only where my skills already are, but just to give an impression of what I can do.\n\nCan anyone give me some tips on what I could do?",

My efforts were directed at creating a business idea rather than identifying a problem that I could grapple with for a while. I kept requesting “what can I offer?When the better question was Many problems do I tolerate working on every day?”.\n\nThe transition for me was recognizing that being analytical + multilingual + learning CS already puts one in a rare bucket: one can understand technical stuff and explain it across language and culture gaps. It offers a genuine and functional advantage, except it has not yet taken startup idea form.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learnt was to always try and be useful to a specific group of people instead of trying to start a business. I chose a niche, frequented their forums, and responded to questions I didn't feel qualified to answer. Patterns started to develop gradually. The business very much came from that.\n\nAt this point, you aren't required to have a business idea. You require closeness to individuals with messy dilemmas.\n\nIf you had the choice of one group being especially useful to you for the next 3 months   who is it?",

Even with rocket science though you could still probably find something scientists need and would pay for for example ... Point is. \n\nMy best tip would be do something you love. You don't need certifications or anything for it. Forget your skills too. This isn't a \"job\" youre being hired for or vetted for. Most things you'll need for a business you will learn as well by just doing it, so most of your skills are irrelevant most times... Just go with something you've always loved. \n\nSome people like shoes, others like plants. Others construction. Fashion. Business. Teaching. Cleanliness.  Sports. Logistics. Snacks & beverage. Real estate. Manufacturing. Technology. Ceramics. Gloves. Pillows. Wine. \n\nWhat do you like? (Answer in your head this)\n\nIf you for instance like shoes... \n\nSet up a shoe store. Set up an app that finds you custom made shoes for people looking for it. Make a shoe polishing business. Make a business that makes special shoe laces. Make a business that does custom painted shoes. Make a business that exports exotic shoe laces. Whatever you want that you like. \n\nOnce you got that just don't stop, keep going, get into the space meet people doing what you want to do. If you're consistent you can get great results and move past failures and obstacles more easily as well as build a tangible product overtime. Finding product market fit is also a whole other beast... and whatever skills you have or whatever idea you choose will have little to do with actually trying to ship whatever you make out to the world. \n\nIt's gonna take lots of hard work, lots of failures probably, lots of discipline and consistency. If you wanna be in it for the long run pick something you like ideally ... Not just for money, focus on loving what you do. Because you might not see money for a while. \n\nAsking us what you can do is something you should know better than anyone. Do something you like, it's that simple. After you pick something get into those areas. If it's, say, selling shoes. You're not gonna be here with this question. You're gonna be talking to people who are into shoes. So what you're asking here is extremely vague and you won't get much out of it because no one knows you or is you so its not easy. Ideas are abundant. \n\nSo, maybe speak more about what you like. What do you like? Is there something youve always been into? Then we can help turn that into a more viable business to an extent. No one's gonna hold your hand doing anything. So this is the moment you start what is a largely self discovered journey. \n\n No one can give you specific ideas here because only you should know what feels best to you... Choose something you'll have the best chance of excelling at, choose something you like that will make you feel happy when you get that first paying customer and see their smile. Not for the money. But for what you did. Something that will pull you through the hard times. Because things WILL get hard... And it's that light of passion for what you do that gives you that tap on the back to keep going. Money as an incentive is often always really rough (this is the classic give me ideas that make money....). Most people who start for money burn out quick for that reason. Their morale dies out too fast when they don't see money. Only a rare minority gets driven enough by it and actually succeeds. Best tip. Choose what you like. \n\nThe best things of people I've seen done always had some sort of initial passion for it or \"epiphany\" moment doing somethig that ignited a spark. \n\nModern vacuums for instance .. done by a guy who got fed up of his manual vacuum so he went through about 5,000 prototypes to get to what we use today. He probably didn't just sit to ask \"what should I do I need ideas\". Very different process. Lots of the best things done today happened like that. Lots of businesses same thing. \n\n Can change your life if you understand this.",

The more uncomfortable the problem and the harder or more annoying it is to solve, the higher are the prices you can ask for.\n\nI think those are the three main points you need to know to get a clear mind and set a focus, but I encourage you to ask me as many questions as you need, in order to make a decision.\n\nFinally I want to be honest with you about one thing, you are not to old to start a business, but it will absolutely become harder for you if you wait any longer.

You can also use Reddit to try and determine what problems people have and try and make a business offering out of solving these problems.  \n  \nIf you want something more hands-on and immediate, you have enough skills to do tutoring or even freelance translation work.  I'd say, just pick whichever one you'd hate the least and try getting your first paying customer as soon as possible.",

          "text": "I feel you. I'm 31, and have been trying to build my own business for several years. There's so much generic advice out there. Sometimes I feel like to \"make it\" as an entrepreneur you need a literal invention, funding / bags of cash, or luck. I've not \"made it\" by any means, but I've definitely learnt some lessons so far:\n\n1. To come up with an idea, you need to observe. Dedicate like min 10% of your constant conscious thoughts to entrepreneurial thinking. Why do they do that? Is there a way to make that better? Does a solution exist for this? Stupid example: see a bunch of people sat on the pavement eating lunch when you know round the corner there's empty benches -> do people not have access to nearby outdoor seating area knowledge? Is there an app does / could do this? Vocalise it and stir up discussion within your circle. Most of my friends get lowkey annoyed at how much I do this, but you need to gear your brain to find problems for you to solve. Get used to coming up with lots of ideas, no matter how dumb, because most of them will not make it past the next thing I'm gonna say.\n\n2. Once you have an idea, try your hardest to tear it down. I've spent a year working on something that I was too proud to admit nobody wanted - at least in the way I was delivering it. Don't let ChatGPT put your idea on an imaginary pedestal. Try your best to find out what \\*doesn't\\* work with your idea. Competitors, cost to run it, access to data, or even if people actually want it.\n\n3. Get feedback from possible users. This is my most recent failure. I built something that I was so sure would be useful to people, but never bothered to ask my target users - I thought I'd build it first then market it, and someone would buy it. In reality, it's pretty hard to get your first customers - they want reviews, but everyone's too busy to help give reviews. Still working this one out. I'm going to try offer lifetime free subs for beta testers? If this works I'll check back in and tell you. \n\n4. You need patience. This isn't for everyone and I can't tell you how many times I've felt so sh\\*t about myself and my ideas after another failure or just the grind of having to push on with the dream after so little reward. It's not cost me huge amounts of money - it's cost me my time. Some people might get lucky with knowing the right things or having the right ideas, but not me! I'm in it for the long haul, and maybe by the time I'm 40 I'll get my break.\n\nI have no doubt that everyone can make it in this business, but you need to love it, love the process, and be willing to go the distance. I guarantee you you're more talented than you think, and that you'll uncover the skills you need to make it happen. Believe in yourself, your abilities, your work ethic. I'm sure you can make it happen.",

          "text": "I’ll be honest here, when I was starting my business I just started looking around my area and identifying what was needed, what service were people paying for that I’m seeing people be profitable in? What was something I could learn quickly, market easily and make some extra money. I ended up landing on Lawn Maintenance, your standard mow, weed eat, edge and blow type if service. My decision to start with this came down to the below: \n\n(1) I’m in an area that grass grows year round, I see the demand is there and I just needed to carve out my little route to make some money. \n\n(2) When doing research the cost to entry wasn’t that high. I have a paid off truck, a small 5x8 trailer cost me $900 brand new, my mower and basic Stihl equipment was able to be financed for 48 months at 0% interest. All in my cost to be able to offer services was around $1500 to start. If you don’t have a truck it’s not bad still, I picked up an F150 with 250k miles for $2500 and it’s been used strictly for my business over the last year.. \n\n(3) It was something I could learn myself. I started with just my yard, my parents, family and friends while I honed my skills. My business only needed to make me $350 to break even and at the beginning I wasn’t worried about my time paying me as it was just the beginning. \n\n(4) It’s easily scalable. Get more yards? Add some help. Get a ton of yards? Hire a few employees and have them run your route. Then you can offer additional services like tree trimming, flower bed cleanouts and remulching that easily bring a few hundred in revenue. \n\n\nMy first year I was on my own, during the last 12 months I went from 12 accounts to 75 accounts, plus added 5 commercial properties. Now I have 2 full time employees that go out 4 days a week and handle everything. As I add new yards I go out and mow them the first time, take pictures of what it should look like when finished and place it on my guys routes. My goal for this year is to get to 150 accounts, run 2 crews and hopefully go hands off.",

The problem is you’re looking for a “business idea” instead of a **small paid problem you can solve right now**.\n\nYou don’t need to be great yet. You need to be useful.\n\nA few realistic directions based on what you shared:\n\n**1. Language + clarity**  \nYou don’t have to invent anything. People pay for:\n\n* Translating or localizing content into German or Russian\n* Rewriting technical or academic text so it’s easier to understand\n* Helping companies or creators adapt content for different markets\n\nThis works especially well with analytical minds.\n\n**2. Tutoring, but narrow**  \nYou don’t need to be an expert. You can tutor:\n\n* Math at a specific level\n* Beginners in programming or computer science concepts\n* German or Russian for people who prefer structured, logical explanations\n\nClear promise beats “I can teach anything.”\n\n**3. Analytical support work**  \nMany small businesses need help with:\n\n* Spreadsheets\n* Research\n* Data organization\n* Simple automation or comparisons\n\nIt’s not sexy, but it pays and builds confidence fast.\n\nHere’s the key shift:  \nStop asking “What business should I start?” and ask “What problem can I solve at a 6/10 level that someone would pay for?”\n\nYou don’t need passion or mastery first. Those come later. Money and confidence come from usefulness.\n\nBeing 30 and unsure isn’t failure. It’s normal. The real risk is waiting for clarity before acting. Pick one small thing, test it for 30 days, and adjust.\n\nYou’ll learn more from one paying client than from another year of thinking.",

Not because people sought danger, but because they were raised to believe this was the only way out. Alternatives either did not exist or were not understood.\n\nThe real shift began when the logic of intervention itself changed and realistic alternatives appeared on the ground.\n\nSimple but smart initiatives emerged, such as repurposing palm waste into flooring materials, inputs for simple footwear, handmade bags, or even household furniture.\n\nSheep and goat wool was collected, processed into usable yarn, and then transformed into handmade kilims with real market value.\nWomen were also trained in sewing and then guided into small production clusters, with their work connected to real markets.\n\nSome products were supplied to support tourism in Sharm El Sheikh, while others were designed specifically for coastal regions in Libya, tailored to the preferences of local tribal communities, which differ significantly from urban markets.\n\nIn other parts of Egypt, the challenges looked different on the surface but were similar at their core:\nlack of education,\nweak health awareness,\nfamily instability,\nand long-term dependence on aid instead of capacity building.\n\nThe real difference came when empowerment became conditional and clearly structured:\nlearning a skill in exchange for keeping children in school,\nincome tied to maintaining family stability,\nreal opportunities matched with real responsibility.\n\nAt that point, behavior genuinely began to change.\n\nWhen people saw a viable alternative, escape lost its meaning, complaints decreased, and something more important emerged: a sense of capability and self-worth.\n\nThese experiences taught me that economic empowerment is not just a theoretical concept.\n\nHandmade industries, such as traditional kilim weaving, are not only cultural heritage, but practical tools that, when applied correctly, can create income, preserve dignity, and build real stability.\n\nWhat I found most interesting was that a path I entered with the intention of service ended up changing me personally as well.\n\nIt deepened my understanding of human behavior, sharpened my ability to read market needs, and taught me how to build trust instead of relying on quick fixes.\n\nEventually, this translated into direct, practical, and profitable outcomes in my own work.\n\nThis experience taught me that real change, whether in communities or in business, begins when you engage with reality as it is, build from within, and avoid imposing solutions from the outside.\n\nOver time, I also became convinced that none of this could happen through one side alone.\n\nCivil society, which includes people like you and me and anyone willing to work on the ground, and governing systems that have vision and genuine intent for development, are both ends of the same thread.\n\nThis is what I witnessed in Egypt:\nan active civil society,\na government beginning to approach development as a long-term process rather than short-term fixes,\nand citizens willing to participate in positive change instead of escape or resignation.\n\nWhen these elements worked together, the results on the ground were tangible.\nNot perfect, not complete, but real and sustainable.",

They sound like commodities.\n\n\n\nBut that's the profitability signal.\n\n\n\nHere's the insight: Profitable = problem businesses spend money to solve. Unsexy = less competition.\n\n\n\nThe CRO angle: Stop trying to find the \"next big thing.\" Find the \"currently solving a problem thing.\"\n\n\n\nQuestions to find your version:\n\n\\- What do local businesses spend money on weekly? (Office supplies, cleaning, delivery, accounting)\n\n\\- What problems do YouTube videos get asked about repeatedly? (How to fix X, where to buy Y)\n\n\\- What do people search for that shows intent to BUY (not to learn)?\n\n\n\nThose aren't exciting. They're profitable.\n\n\n\nThe boring business model wins because:\n\n1. Customers KNOW they need it (no conversion work needed)\n\n2. Repeat customers (recurring revenue)\n\n3. Competitors ignore it (less competition)\n\n4. Margins stay high (no race to the bottom)\n\n\n\nThe mistake: Entrepreneurs optimize for interesting stories, not for the \"I solved a repetitive business problem\" story.\n\n\n\nFind a boring problem. Become the obvious solution. That's where profitability lives.",

I know that sounds basic as hell, but hear me out.\n\nWhen I first started, I was coming off D1 football and just thought I'd help a few people get in shape online. Wasn't trying to build some empire or anything.\n\nWhat blew my mind was how fast the money came in and how HIGH the margins were. Like, 90-100% profit margins when you're solo. No inventory, no shipping, no bullshit overhead. You're just selling what you know.\n\nAnd here's the part nobody talks about... people will pay you INSANE amounts of money to solve their problems faster. I've got clients now charging $40-50K for college admissions help. Another guy helping people get green cards. These aren't sexy businesses. Nobody's flexing about them on Instagram. But they're absolutely PRINTING money.\n\nThe crazy part? Everyone's chasing dropshipping, Amazon FBA, crypto, all this stuff that requires capital and has razor-thin margins. Meanwhile, coaching costs $0 to start and you can land your first client this week if you actually put in the work.\n\nThat's the secret. The boring stuff is what actually gives you freedom.",

      "text": "I freelance with big corporates, project-based work. Usually make $21k/month, $18k on a bad month.\n\nThe money is great. But it doesn't scale. If I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now. Any day off I take is a day I don't get paid. You get the issue.\n\nLast November I started building my first SaaS. Content tool for text-based platforms. Launched it, got some early users, learned a ton. My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\n\nLooking back at the last 4 months? I'm nowhere close.\n\nI'm heavy in tech, 15+ years. I've launched ecom stores before, so I'm not new to building things. But SaaS growth is a different game. It's slow. And I'm impatient.\n\nRight now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground. Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here? Am I being naive thinking I can replace $20k/month in year one? When should I kill my SaaS and move on to something else?\n\nAny advice here is appreciated",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

Raising your rates is such an underused tactic, because all those want-to-bes repeat the \"passive income\" bs because they don't know better.\n\nThere are two paths in your situation and they are not exclusive.\n\n1) Change the terms with your current clients\n\n2) Find better clients\n\n1) I would try to educate them on the benefits of paying a set monthly investment (don't call it retainer) to future-proof your relationship. Tell them you're raising prices 30% for your other clients, but if they agreed to a 12-month contract with a monthly fee, you'd be happy to forego that price increase for them, and only them, because they are such great clients. Blame the change in pricing on your business partner or board or whatever, even if you don't have one.\n\nIf they don't want to commit, raise your rates.\n\n2) Could your clients refer other clients to you? You'd even bump them up into your 'VIP program' for 2 months for free as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOtherwise, go through your list of LinkedIn connections who may be in the market for your service and write to them.

And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible. But it's exceptionally rare. Don't base your livelihood on an the stars aligning.",

No it's not obvious and you have to do a lot of work to do that. But you're missing the part where if you stop looking at the path of others there is a great path to scaling for a services companies that isn't explored much. Actually, that's my focus right now.\n\nBut in your shoes, you should first try to get fixed price contracts. It will help you get exact clarity on the value you're providing and what you want to do. From there you'll also own any value from any improvements to your processes and IP that you implement. From there focus on creating IP to make yourself faster. Even consider hirin someone to help you. Technically you're still needed but in the process you are productizing your consulting work. Your knowledge and skill is getting documented in your IP. It alo means you can get a lot more value from a junior implementor.\n\nIP that helps you work faster is just as much valid IP as IP that you sell directly to customers. Hell, AWS is more valuable than the store Amazon even though it's start was IP that was just an internal tool.

          "text": "I’m on the same journey, similar circumstances. In my 7th year. Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

          "text": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

Here's what actually worked:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth first:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou probably won't replace $20k/month SaaS income in year one. The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have < $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook. The boring answer is: you do both, longer than feels comfortable, until the SaaS can actually support you. Usually 18-24 months, not 12.\n\n\n\nWhat does your SaaS do, and what's your current MRR/user count after 4 months?",

I'd heard him ask the same question on a podcast. \n* Had my answer ready. He pushed back on market size. I'd already rehearsed that objection multiple times. \n* He wanted to know \"why you?\" - I knew from his content he values founder-market fit over credentials, so I leaned into that.\n\nHe committed on the call. $50K wired last week.\n\nSame pitch deck. Same me. The only difference was how prepared I was.\n\nWalking into a pitch already knowing how someone thinks, what they care about, and how they communicate changes everything.\n\nAnyone else do this level of research before investor calls?

I oversimplified it especially because I haven't gotten to the second season yet, though I have immensely enjoyed the first.\n\nSynecdoche, New York is my favourite movie of all time, and is a surrealist movie focused on many themes, some of which (in my opinion) are those of existential anxiety, neurotic obsessions with perfection, internal fragmentation, and the importance of every small person as crucial element of the whole of society. In this movie, >!at a certain point, the main character begins writing and rehearsing a play in a gigantic warehouse to be his magnum opus. As time progresses, the play is never finished, but evolves in constantly self-referential ways, with actors hired to play the part of people in the main character's life, and then actors to play the actors themselves, inside a second warehouse within the first. Eventually, the main character even casts someone to play himself in the play and actually gets replaced by another actor (in what many claim to be an allusion to transgenderism). This muddles the line between reality and fiction ever more in a movie which barely has any footing in reality anyway. !< The Rehearsal is sometimes compared to Synecdoche, New York due to this \"actors playing actors\" fact.\n\nI personally find that Synecdoche New York is the closest I've ever seen to Fernando Pessoa's body of work. Fragmentation laid bare. Every feeling that was ever felt and will ever be felt is, in a way, in this movie, because everyone is in this movie, and no one is.",

There are days when there are 20-30 pitches scheduled, and we know beforehand what kind of business it is and when they pitch, so we don't have to be there all the time (though of course the bank always makes sure there are at least 5 people for a pitch, and sometimes if you see something interesting you recommend it to the others and they get to pitch a 2nd time). If you want in it's up to you to decide your size: e.g. once I invested 3k while someone else invested 80k in the same business (total was € 125k). Obviously there are different tiers of investors: I'm small potatoes compared to some captains of industry. Which is what makes this actually work: as a small potato I am often quite involved, which sort of reassures the big potatoes. I think it's an awesome concept and the bank does a great job with their recommendations.\n\nAnyway, it's very obvious when someone has tailor made their pitch to score a particular big potato. And I'd say 90% of the time it has the opposite effect. However what is true in my experience, is that investors like to ask the same questions. So being prepared for those is definitely a positive (mine for example is how they see themselves collaborate with other companies).\n\nSee it like going on a date: being too cheesy is a turn off.",

For example a quite old fashioned business wanted to go digital to scale, so I was kept in the loop and could review all design/business decisions, attended ~10 meetings over the course of 1,5 year. Meanwhile big potato will ask me in an informal way/setting how it's going with the project from time to time.\n\nThe upside for me is threefold:  \na/ I can get in these potentially lucrative projects really early without having (to risk too) much capital, i.e. much less than those who these projects are typically presented to first. \n\nb/ I can have a direct impact on the success (think the difference between having access to the significant experience/expertise of 5 small potatoes for free and not having that access).\n\nc/ I have direct access to really big potatoes, with some on a personal level, which opens up all kind of other opportunities.\n\nNow there have been instances where a business of one of the investors (including mine) gets chosen as an external partner/supplier if it makes sense.

What’s just as important is when that number fluctuates I can tell you why; it could be a little lower because we are testing a new marketing channel or made some new hires to open a new office, or maybe we are high because some long shot bets we made a while ago hit.",

The when varies hugely, but at some range of time in every biz life cycle, profits don't matter.  A theoretical great profit margin on sales you aren't making doesn't get you anywhere good.  You have to find traction before you find profits.  So I'm happy to give an attaboy to anyone hitting early sales goals.  \n\nI had 4 interconnected bizes, $250M ARR at the peak, and 3 of them were never far above break even.   Profits weren't the goal.  Every penny of cash we had was cycled back into bizdev ( govt contracting speak for sales and marketing).  The bizes were grown to be sold and one of the metrics for biz valuation was 1x sales.  We wanted sales more than profits.  My partner and I were not even the highest paid employees because our short term personal income was not the priority.   \n\nYour advice fits a lot of businesses, but there's very good reasons that it won't fit all businesses.",

But I mean, it works - you just need to have a killer product, a killer team   \n  \nAnd on the flip side, obviously, having margins from day one for a killer product also works. I think it's more dependent on what the founder thinks their growth trajectory should be, and what they bet on what kind of education in terms of pricing they want their clients to have",

I’m not sure where to begin.\n\nHave you seen those videos where the speaker goes, \"You are not doing what you want to do because you are scared of failure\"? Back then, listening to such words, I always thought I would not be that guy. Today, I am pushed into a corner where I am afraid to do anything or try out something new, and I can feel the walls closing in.\n\nI am doing deliveries and other blue-collar gigs because it makes me happy, and it’s the only time I don't think about my failure. Looking back, I think I had a big ego when I had success. I loved being generous and taking care of people, but being in a position where I'm not able to do so, I don’t want to face anyone.\n\nMy brain is not able to think big right now or come up with ideas; it is in a stagnant state, I feel. And I think I went out of business at the worst time possible, because even the job market in IT is fed up.\n\nWhat I’ve learned during this time upon reflecting:\n\n* I truly understand the essence of networking.\n* Grit doesn’t always mean things will go well; you need a pragmatic thinker on your team who talks to you openly.\n\nAnyways, I have decided, in this Arab?Arabi?c restaurant, that I am going to start again. I have nothing to lose. I am starting at 0 today; 0 capital and 0 funding.\n\nJust my laptop, a roof over my head, and my bike. My trusty bike, the only thing putting food on my table right now. I love my bike; a stupid machine on two wheels, haha.\n\nI don’t have the \"big idea\" yet. I am going to take a different approach to building this time, something that gets me from 0 to 1. I will actively work on getting there rather than waiting for a light bulb moment.",

And if you learnt something, then you take it into your next business. You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain, because you've already paid for all the experience so you might as well cash it in.  Most successful businesses only come after multiple failures, according to research.  \n\n\nWorst case scenario it's you and your bike at a job again... that other people do daily.

For booking, Calendly or Cal.com (free) embed directly on your site and handle everything. For local SEO the biggest thing is setting up Google Business Profile, thats free and gets you showing up in map searches for \"nutritionist near me\". On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff. Testimonials section is easy on any platform. WordPress with a starter theme would probably give you the most flexibility for under $100/year total including hosting.",

In my experience with health/wellness businesses, a lot of clients prefer the simplicity of just texting or messaging to schedule rather than filling out booking forms.\n\n\n\nSo whatever platform you choose, make sure your phone number and messaging options are super visible. Some coaches I know even let clients book via WhatsApp or SMS directly - it's more conversational and removes friction.\n\n\n\nFor the website itself, keep it dead simple: who you are, what you do, testimonials, and clear contact info. The booking experience matters more than fancy features.",

Here are the ones I can think of:\n\n* Email & linkedin automation to generate leads: We have used tools like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n* SEO automation: Again, we noticed our SEO agency was basically just looking at our Google search data and industry keywords to come up with content answering specific questions customers were already asking on Google so that we became the top result! We were easily able to automate this using AI tools like Frizerly to get the same results for 1/10th the cost! This also translates to getting mentioned on both ChatGPT and AI overview as the go to tool for various questions! So again, this is saving us both agency fee and getting us actual customers over time!\n* Support automation: Once of the core problems we have had is customers often dont real our FAQs or website and ask the same question over and over again! Using tools like Sierra, we have been able to instantly auto resolve these questions! Others are still routed to a real support person! Saves our support team so much time now!\n* Quarterly Customer Reports: Lastly but not least, we used to send quarterly report presentations to all our customers based on our analytics for our tool helps them with to show ROI basically! We have been able to automate this almost completely using Gamma! We still review them and make ended before sending it their way- but saves 80% time for our team!\n\nFollowing to see what else others have been automation :)",

I made a tool for myself where I just enter my client's website, and it just spits out a fully revamped website that I just paste into Lovable. So I'm just mostly copy-pasting now, and prompting maybe a bit here and there, but often times I don't even prompt. \n\nThis allows me to give clients free homepage redesigns because its now quite fast for me. It's getting a lot of orders, nearly daily, but I wouldn't say its like super high ROI. \n\nI'm still new to sales, and web design, so I have to communicate better in my emails, and say the right things, but at least I'm seeing traction now. \n\nSo I can't say for sure if this path is super solid. But from what I'm intuiting, now that I'm getting clients (for free homepage redesigns daily) is that I can now move on to the phase where I'm focused on improving my selling skills, etc. \n\nI think also web design is hot now because of Gemini 3 Pro. Like the websites Lovable makes is pretty okay. They trained a small custom model to keep it cheap from my understanding. But Gemini 3 Pro is so amazing at website design. Try it out. That's what made me want to offer that to clients, and the excitement is pretty high for the free homepage redesigns. \n\nFor context I used to offer phone agents, and cold email engines. I would get like 2 replies per month from my cold emails. And many would just have negative sentiment to my cold emails. But with free homepage redesigns, people are actually excited, and appreciative, mostly because you're doing something for free (another key thing) and its something they need. \n\nSo when you talk about high ROI, I think we need to think in terms of a funnel. My focus is solving one part of the funnel at a time. If you just want high ROI, you're going to feel lost because the whole funnel is like a system you need to design and tweak. High ROI = improving every part of the system, not just the automation you offer. I'm still yet to see how this plays out, but I feel like I solved one part of the system now.",

From my experience, the simplest automation with a killer ROI is one that actually manages and scales your ad spend without you having to babysit it all day. For example, tools that automatically turn your links into tested Meta ads and optimize targeting in real-time save a ton of manual guesswork. Instead of juggling endless tweaks, you get fresh, targeted ad variants that focus budget on what's actually working. It’s like having a smart assistant poking the algorithm constantly so you don’t have to. That approach seriously cuts down the grind and delivers measurable lift without stealing your time.",

          "text": "In motivation psychology we see this a lot:\n\nWhat we often think of procrastination is just the brain trying to gather more information to balance out an effort/reward bias. Many people try to think or plan their way into action (increase success chance and lower effort), so you go through a loop of alternative action (productive procrastination) as a way to avoid the real task.\n\nThe answer: listening and learning to see what part of your mind is talking.   \nIm glad that you got out of the loop this time, but this anxious avoidant part of the mind will try to strike again.   \nThink of your mind as different parts of you. The brain loves being efficient, and doing as little action as possible. So it will first use distractions (craving to watch content or daydream). Secondly, it will use emotions (Tiredness when you sit to work, brain fog). Third it will use logic (\"I can take a cheat day\" or \"Maybe it would be better if I planned X out\"). Lastly it will try to use any addictive or paralyzing thing on you (becoming horny, anxiety, mental breakdown, heavy brain fog)  \n  \nYour goal: Find where the mind is leading you with every thought and emotion, it's not always on your side.  \nDiscipline (scientifically) is actually just the act of observing these conflicts of interest, the longer you see that your brain works this way, the better chance you have at not falling for its tricks, and doing what's correct. Learn to find the pattern of logic and anxiousness that leads away from your one very clear goal (make $100k, get 10,000 users) just have a clear goal and don't let any logic get in that way\n\ndm if you want any more advice or details",

I used to do the exact same thing with my first startup back in 2018 - had these elaborate plans and frameworks but kept finding reasons to \"refine\" them instead of just shipping something. The real breakthrough came when I set this rule: no new learning until I ship SOMETHING, even if its embarrassingly simple. \n\n\n\nWhat you did with the single page strategy is exactly right. I remember when I finally forced myself to just build one small feature of what became ScatterMind instead of mapping out the entire product roadmap. That first tiny win gave me momentum to keep going, and suddenly I wasn't hiding behind planning anymore. The fear of putting something imperfect out there never really goes away, but taking action despite that fear is what separates the people who build businesses from the people who build beautiful plans that nobody sees.",

Another one that works: define what \"done\" looks like before you start planning.

But failure isn't optional - it's the feedback mechanism that tells you what to fix. The 50-page plan is trying to skip that step, which just delays the learning.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that your first customers don't care about your plan.

      "text": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

You essentially need to productise the service, experience good and bad recruitment, adjust KPIs to align with margin requirements, monitor and implement quality controls, codify all knowledge into processes. These things take YEARS to get right.\n\nI'm all for encouraging OP, I think it's great they're aware of what they want and what their gap is. But I think it's a hard journey to go on that I see many founders struggle with. In fact, it's more common for me to meet founders that are still delivering the sales/service, than those that have largely freed themselves.\n\nI believe setting expectations is important so that OP can prepare themselves for what's next and ask themselves if it's worth the struggle (like you said - nothing to be ashamed of being a freelancer).",

Many people, especially online, use “entrepreneur” to mean “I don’t have a boss.” But independence and entrepreneurship aren’t the same thing. Self-employed people sell their time. Entrepreneurs build something that can keep creating value when they step away. Different games, different rules.\n\nThat said, I’d be careful not to swing too far into self-flagellation.\n\nRunning an agency is not fake work. You learned sales, delivery, hiring, client psychology, cash flow, and responsibility. Those are not trivial skills. The mistake isn’t that you ran an agency. The mistake would be thinking those years were wasted because the business wasn’t an asset.\n\nMost people who eventually build real leverage start exactly where you did. They first trade time for money. Then they notice the ceiling. Then they get uncomfortable. That discomfort is usually the signal that it’s time to evolve, not to invalidate the past.\n\nAlso, the definition of entrepreneur is a bit more nuanced than social media makes it. Plenty of real businesses start as time-bound services and only later turn into systems, products, or sellable assets. The transition is the hard part, not the label.\n\nThe important shift you’ve already made is this one: you’re no longer confusing being busy with building something. That’s huge. Most people never catch that.\n\nInstead of asking “Was I ever really an entrepreneur?”, a more useful question might be “What would need to change for this work to become an asset?” Systems, productization, delegation, or eventually moving beyond services entirely.\n\nYou weren’t lying to yourself before. You were early. Now you’re clearer. That’s progress, even if it doesn’t feel flattering yet.",

It's worth close to nothing, because the revenue walks out the door when you do.\n\nThe good news is you identified the right problem. The next step is asking: what systems, processes, or assets could generate revenue without my direct involvement? Even in services businesses, there are ways to build value - documented processes, recurring contracts, trained teams that can operate independently.

Check out this old classic called The E-Myth Revisited. You might’ve seen it or heard of it or possibly even read it.

Make a daily list of 3 major things that grow the business - finish those three and call it a win. Track outcomes, not hours.\n\nThe real trap isn't working too little, it's never shutting off.

On the other, it feels like discovery is shifting very fast and people are now getting most answers directly from AI instead of clicking blue links.\n\nHere’s what I’m trying to understand now:\n\n* Does traditional SEO still meaningfully increase business visibility (online presence in browser search results etc), or is it just table stakes now?\n* Should the focus be shifting toward blog-style content that helps increase AI visibility when tools like ChatGPT or Copilot recommend vendors and services?\n* Are there clear AI visibility trends yet, or is market mostly guessing?\n* (Follows from the previous question) - What are actual increase AI visibility best practices if any? And overall, is it ethical type of self-promotion?\n* At what point does it still make sense to invest in seo instead of reallocating effort elsewhere? Or only AI overviews matter now?\n\nCurious how other founders are approaching this challenge. Are you changing strategy, or just sticking with fundamentals and riding it out? YMMV.\n\nThank yall very much!",

Blogs every month, indexed, keywords sprinkled everywhere. Traffic was flat and barely any leads. When I looked closer, the issue wasn’t effort. It was clarity.\n\nOnce we simplified things, clearer homepage, clearer service pages, clearer explanations of what they actually do and who it’s for, a few things happened:\n\n* Google traffic became more relevant, even if it wasn’t huge\n* AI tools started referencing them for very specific use cases\n* Leads understood the offer before the call\n\nI’ve also seen the opposite. Clients with strong authority or lots of content, but vague messaging, rarely show up in AI answers. The systems don’t know *when* to recommend them.\n\nSo to your questions:\n\n* Traditional SEO still helps with visibility, but it’s mostly the foundation now\n* Blog content works when it explains real problems and use cases, not when it’s just “content”\n* AI visibility isn’t random. The pattern I keep seeing is clear explanations + consistent language across the site + getting your brand mentioned in various places\n\nhope this helps",

It’s basically a 'ReadMe' for LLMs so they can ingest the site's context without the HTML noise.\n\n   2. Batch PDF Generation: Mass generation of multi-page PDF blueprint manuals from our existing pages. It creates an additional SEO source that LLMs seem to like citing as an authoritative source.\n\n   3. Programmatic Video: Recently started using Remotion in CLI to automate video creation based on the same data.\n\n  Just making sure the data is available in every format an AI agent might want to consume.
