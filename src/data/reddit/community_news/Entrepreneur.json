Make it happen through sweat and creativity.\n5.  Give yourself a stop loss.  If the business idea is not profitable with X months then unemotionally shut it down and either get a job for a while to recoup capital or move to the next idea.  But set the stop loss at the beginning or else you’re likely to move the goalposts as you approach the drop dead date.  \n6.  Don’t give up.  Your idea may not have worked but as long as you learn from the mistake you can apply the lessons to future ideas.  You can imagine how frustrated and dejected I felt after back to back to back business failures.  But by getting up one more time than I was knocked down, it changed my life.\n\nGood luck entrepreneurs!!",

          "text": "Some things to keep in mind, since the topic of time has been touched on. (Years) and consider what starting actually means. I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

We stayed in a niche where there were no new players and dominated it.   \n  \nBut all I can say is none of that mentorship or experience i've accumulated over the years can ever be found from an \"online course\" on ecommerce or dropshipping. It is extremely challenging. But, one thing is for certain, if you think like the rest of the market you will NEVER achieve real results or business longevity.   \n  \nThere is no \"secret formula\" that can be found on a course, it's alot about thinking on your feet, discovering insights and achieving expertise in your product category that is unmatched. We've gotten really far, and we still work really hard everyday to figure out how we can scale in the years to come. It dosen't get easier, it gets more challenging.   \n  \nBut that's the point, it's not a game for the weak or lazy. we work monday to saturday and our business is operating 24/7. whoever said they just dropship products and work 4 hours a day is in a very much different income bracket than us.",

      "text": "Not sure if other app devs are seeing this, but wanted to share a shift we made recently that’s honestly been bigger for our growth than ASO or traditional SEO.\n\nA few months ago, we started getting feedback emails saying things like, *\"I asked ChatGPT for a cycling app that focuses on privacy\"* or *\"Gemini recommended you guys as a good Strava alternative.\"*\n\nIt happened enough times that we actually updated our onboarding survey. We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

One listing all links and another to provide the entire content of site as a compressed text file. \n\nHere is an example:\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt\n\nThis ensures agents can easily index your site. \n\nAnother tip is to try asking questions about your business in chatbots and see which queries they build to run against a web search tool. Then try to win on those keywords via traditional SEO",

People keep saying “just be disciplined” but they dont talk about the mental side.\n\nBeing on your own mess with your head. You doubt everything. You compare yourself too much. You wonder if you’re building something or just losing time.\n\nI’m not quitting. Just being honest.\n\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, how do you deal with those low motivation phases ?",

          "text": "Andy Frisella has a power list system of doing just 5 things; action items each day. I started doing this in early 2017. My list usually is mostly business but some days there's family and personal items in that five.\n\nI write it down in a note book every night. Then, at the end of each day, I write win or loss. If you win enough days, you win the week. If you win enough weeks, you win the month. \n\nIt also gives me a journal of action items that I can go back and look at over the years. If I don't hit a quarterly goal or if a habit doesn't change in my personal life. I can take a look and see what I did each day in that time period.\n\nAnother aspect of building a business, they're people don't talk about is how easy it is to lie to ourselves. We try to make ourselves believe that busy is productive. Are you really moving the needle though? \n\nIt's the easiest form of discipline building i've ever implemented. Now there have been some dark nights of the soul so to speak throughout the last ten years. Where I don't wanna do anything. In those moments on those days I make myself get up and do something very uncomfortable.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had a cold front come through Texas. Nothing major but colder than what we're used to. I live in a rural area, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres. I think it said thirty five mile an hour winds that day but our wind gauge was hitting fifty plus. It was miserable outside.\n\nI'd made myself get up at 6:30 in the morning, because I usually sleep until I wake up naturally. I got dressed quickly, and I went out to the horses barn/shed. And got his bucket and I hiked back to the shop to fill it with feed and let it soak with warm water. I made myself stand outside in the cold wind for that ten minutes. Then, I hiked back out through multiple gates that I had to unlock and lock. Disengaging and reengaging electric fences. Gave the beast his bucket. When I hiked back through the gates and went inside. All in all, it took about thirty minutes.And I was cold.\n\nI jumped in a hot shower.Got dressed again for the day. Grabbed my backpack with my business stuff in it and I headed to my office. I didn't feel better but I was moving. I started into my list which I had purposely made very easy for the day. Knocked it out within about two hours. \n\nWhen you're done with your five things, you're done for the day. Myself included everyone always says, oh I can do twelve things or thirty things. Just do the fucking five things. \n\nI finished my five things and I went to sit on the couch in my office and just scroll the internet. Then, my phone rang with a new customer. Then, another, and another, and another, and another. Turns out, one of our competitors was bought out, and the new company's prices went up another thirty percent. I have no employees.I handle everything for my company and it's quite large. When a new customer contacts us, though I have to do all the onboarding, enter their order set up the financials and the emails and then pick their order pack their order and ship their order all before three p m.\n\nI was not in the mood or the mind state.To do this shit. I was done for the day. \n\nNow i've switched into a different phase, which is called test days.... Another Andy Frisella process. This is where your discipline kicks in. I knocked out all the orders on time.And then I went back to the office to tally up the financial. $17,356 in new sales in one day. That was a record.My previous record was $13k. Each one of these customers will re order every single month forever. I had just had the best day. I'd had in business in a long time and it was one of the worst days for me mentally.\n\nIf I had not of woken up early and done the horse feeding  before forcing myself to the office to knock out my powerlist, it would have been too late in the day for me to accomplish all three things. \n\nThat leads me to another belief that I personally have, is that I have a path. I'm on my path and as long as I stay on my path, things will work out.\n\nThose test days are The Times that you look back on for brief encouragement when you need it to reinforce your discipline.\n\nKnow this though, when you become successful, even though you're still dealing with this type of shit, weekly, people are gonna tell you that you must have gotten lucky to be as successful as you are.",

This allows me to take advantage of my drive time. I live in a very rural area so everything is an hour drive one way, even Walmart. I now get 3-5 audio books read through Libby app per week.\n\nMy favorite genre to learn from is biographies. Its a buffet, take the lessons youwhat you want and leave the rest.\n\nFounders Podcast does an excellent job condensing biographies of great business people. I love all the old robber barons, because you see the truth of what they accomplished.\n\n\nI always recommend The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick. Its a hacker story, but he was also the godfather of social engineering. I think it's the greatest book for sales in so many people don't understand that. I helps you think around corners.\n\nPhysical books I'm going through all the classics I miss growing up alone as a run away orphan at 12 years old sleeping in national and state parks.

It's not supposed to.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is normal. It's the middle of the journey, where the excitement wears off and reality sets in. This is where most people quit. Not because they're not disciplined - because they're exhausted.\n\nThe \"just be disciplined\" advice is bullshit. You can't discipline your way out of building from the wrong place.\n\nHere's what helped me:\n\n**Stop asking \"am I motivated today?\"**\n\nStart asking \"why am I building this?\"\n\nIf the answer is external (prove something, hit metrics, look successful), you'll burn out. Because external goals keep moving. There's always another milestone.\n\nIf the answer is internal (this matters to me, this aligns with who I am, this serves something bigger), you'll find a different kind of fuel. Not motivation - purpose.\n\n**The mental side you mentioned?**\n\nThat doubt, that comparison, that \"am I wasting my time\" spiral - it's all coming from one place: you're building from pressure, not purpose.\n\nPressure to perform. Pressure to succeed. Pressure to prove you're not wasting your time.\n\nWhen you build from pressure, every low day feels like failure. Every slow week feels like proof you're not good enough.\n\nWhen you build from purpose, low days are just... days. Not evidence. Not identity.\n\n**Practically, what I did:**\n\n\\- Stopped checking metrics first thing (they controlled my mood)\n\n\\- Got clear on why THIS project, not just \"be successful\n\n\\- Set boundaries (work hours, offline time, non-negotiables\n\n\\- Found someone who'd been where I am, and five years ahead of me (coach, not just cheerleader)\n\nThe discipline people talk about? It's easier when you're building something that matters to you, not something you \"should\" be building.\n\nYou're not stuck because you lack motivation. You might be stuck because you haven't figured out if this is YOUR thing or someone else's idea of success. It's a lonely journey and sometimes you might lack the accountability, guidance, structure that you might have had before. That's ok to have.\n\nNot quitting is good. But also - ask yourself, am I building the right thing? Or am I just stubborn?\n\nThose are different questions.\n\nI also echo u/FatherOften on the 5 priority list items that no matter what, you action on.\n\nGood luck.

Think of it like an **LLM**: if you don’t provide clear **constraints**, the output is just high-speed hallucinations and chaos. That’s exactly what we do to our brains.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Strategy vs. Busywork:** Being submerged in tasks isn’t 'grinding'; it’s a one-way ticket to Burnout City. If your strategy doesn’t dictate a lean action plan, you’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall and wondering why the wall is messy.\n* **The 'Void' Factor:** For a first-timer, entrepreneurship is a literal leap into the void. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself actual time to **somatize** the shift. A total identity overhaul takes much longer than we’re willing to admit, and you can't rush the biological clock of adaptation.\n* **Neuroplasticity is your gym:** The 'mental side' isn't just something to 'endure.' You’re using neuroplasticity to hardwire the habits of the person you want to become. This takes time, repetition, and a lot of recalibration.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop adding tasks and start add better constraints. Above all, be supportive to yourself, you deserve it, even if only for the massive step you took by starting this journey on the first place.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

      "text": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

I never see any content talking about the way that I do it and how to actually use it for real client work.\n\nI've presented work that I have built and designed with AI to real clients, and they have loved it. These are not cheap projects; this is not $5K or $10K websites. These are $20K, $30K, $40K websites.\n\nI would love to create content around that to help educate people and fill that void because I go out and see that there's just no content, and all the content is trash, not actionable, and not actually presentable to real clients that are paying real money. It's all just hypothetical scenarios.\n\nIt's the classic issue where the people actually doing the work don't have time to create the content. So, you're kind of left with a bunch of people faking it, basically.",

We get tired of seeing:\n\n1. Get-rich-quick schemes based on faulty notions of “passive income”\n2. AI-centered nonsense\n3. Painfully predictable failure stories from people who had zero idea what they were doing\n\nRegarding #1: While you claim you didn’t want to get-rich-quick, your post bears all the hallmarks of the get-rich-quick formula: Money (even modest amounts) for little or no work.\n\nRegarding #2: While I applaud that your post seems to be human-written, the topic is still “making money with AI.” Which is a topic that is over-explored in this subreddit, and one which is not informative or even useful for people who are running actual IRL businesses that create and/or perform real-life goods and/or services.\n\nRegarding #3: You didn’t validate your business idea, do any market research, or perform any of the usual steps that go into the lead-up decision as to whether or not even launch a venture in the first place. In laughably predictable form, you earned $0.\n\nSo, yeah! Your post was good for a giggle while I was sitting on the toilet this morning. Thanks for the comedic mood-boost during my crap.",

Retailers also obtain their name brand stuff through authorized resellers or authorized distributors.  \n\nAside: Some years ago, I used to handle reseller accounts for major electronic brands.  I found out that many major brands like Netgear outright forbid their resellers from listing on Amazon because it encouraged shady price-falling practices and pitted their resellers against each other, which is actually bad for business.  So when you see certain electronics on Amazon and the seller is not listed as an \"Authorized Dealer\" by that brand, 9 times out of 10 it's stolen, bought from overstock, or being sold in breach of contract and therefore does not actually have a manufacturer's warranty.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

They have a large showroom of furniture and you order/post for it then go around to the loading area and they get it from the warehouse and load it up for you.\n\nNot quite everyday items, but it does somewhat fit what you’re asking about.\n\nI could see the business model you’re describing working now if you could fully automate the stock part. Robots/automation for the stocking and retrieval. A few humans for double checking and customer service. Big windows so folks could watch the machines work. Lots of upfront costs though.",

Once while on a road trip we stopped in for deodorant and left with “cute” ramen bowls which finished out our road trip and were transported all the way home with us. All because we had to pass housewares to get to deodorant and the bowls were sitting out on an end cap display.\n\nShe says “Target tells me what I need”.",

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -> Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution > Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" < \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

If you don't have to say anything different, just remove it and show problem validation, team's expertise, market is shifting etc... It fits naturally already.\n\nAnd about problem, you're 100% right. Problem slide shouldn't be statement. It should be validation with data. How many people face this problem?

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

I'm giving 3 versions:\n1) Trailer (3-5 slides) or one-pager: For the first cold emails only\n2) Longer email decks with more texts\n3) Meeting decks with less texts more visual\n\nI found this approach better to use same deck everywhere BUT it'll probably change because of AI.

We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup. Apparently its needed for some verification stuff. Anyway, any advice on the scope creep situation would be helpful cause im getting real tired of quick favors.",

I work more in software projects and this is a common issue. In the SLA it must be explicitly stated what is going to be developed (features), add some tests that are going to be covered, and be very explicit what is out of Scope (new features for example). With this signed, you can make them understand that these requests need to be quoted.\n\nHope this helps!",

Then charge hours to that budget, drawing down as you go.   Bill each month for hours used, and report how many hours are left. When it gets near zero, ask if they’d like to replenish. And so on.\n\nNote a drawdown is different than a retainer. A drawdown is just a pre-approved budget. A retainer is a use-it-or-lose it that holds your time. Most clients don’t like pure retainers without the confidence they will definitely will use you.\n\nThe main advantage is now there is a budget set up for them to get more work done, and because it’s already pre-approved, there is an incentive to use you instead of a competitor.",

Like responding to emails at 11pm, hopping on calls whenever they wanted, basically being their personal support bot.\n\nMy retention was okay, around 65% after 6 months which isnt terrible but not great either. Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

Those can be documented. Once they're documented, they can be delegated, scaled, or even pre-emptively answered for clients.\n\nYou've essentially done step one of building a real agency: you've separated the work from your constant presence. That's huge. The people who get stuck are the ones who can't make that separation.\n\nCongrats on the upgrade. Moving from a service provider to a trusted advisor is the entire game.

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

I got introduced to 5 computer guys, super smart, who developed a whole new architecture for massively parallel processing. Really cool tech. They averaged around $150K each in salary. When I met them they had all just quit their jobs to start a company and were asking me about business planning and constructing a pitch deck to look for investment. So these really smart guys left around $750K of annual salary on the table to live off their savings while they were just starting to define their company.

      "text": "hi everyone, \n\ni've been building serviceorca with my team, a zero-commission marketplace for service providers. We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

Your AI just created a huge problem where you have to get A) millions and millions of listings to be interesting enough in just one city and B) get world wide consumer traction.\n\nIn my opinion AI already totally messed up your directory and you might have to start over again. These  marketplaces work if you have at least one category, in one single city figured out well.\n\nIts a bit the same as when you let your META ads just focused on lead volume, often you only get volume of the shittiest possible leads.

Providers hate it, users hate the markup, and it encourages people to take deals offline. \n\n  \ninstead, we use a \"local booster\" model (still not in use, will be used when we are sure we have demand). \n\nCrucially, money doesn't buy rank. Our organic ranking is 100% merit-based (quality, reviews, retention). Whether a provider pays or not , everyone is equal in the eyes of the algorithm - the best service always wins the top spots. The 'Boosters' are just for separate visibility slots; they don't corrupt the search results.

Precision (the time saver) most platforms make you search for a generic business and hope they do what you want. We have over 600+ specific categories. You can search firectly for japanese manicure or ac repair instead of just HVAC or Beauty Salon. it saves you from calling 10 places to ask if they offer that specific service.\n\n2. Legitimacy: Our manual verification isn't a magic promise of perfect quality (users decide that via reviews), but it is a promise of reality. We verify that every listing is a real person/entity with a working phone number. It filters out the bots, scams, and dead listings you find on other classified sites.\n\nSo: it's free, it's safe from bots, and it finds exactly the specific service you need.   \n\n\nAlso, the platform is completely open. We don't hide service pages or contact details behind paywalls. Unlike commission-based platforms where you have to 'trick the system' just to exchange phone numbers, we give you the direct contact info immediately. You can call or message the provider freely without jumping through hoops.",

Under financial pressure, our patience disappears. We start chasing money by taking all sort of opportunities, lying to ourselves with the latest big thing. It's excitation and illusions taking control of our finance, hence ending up with more debts. Be patient, take the time to plan, learn and develop skills. Build on the side but don't let go your 9-5 too early.",

My brain was constantly busy and the second I reached that tipping point suddenly that memory dedicated to solving business problems turned to art and music. Now when there's a hobby I want to chase I can fully dive in financially and with the ability of knowing how to \"learn\" better than the average person I'm a pro in everything I touch.

Example they may hate their boss and hate being at work every day, while I bet you like yours ;)  I hope lol.  But I work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and I can tell you almost across the board they're feeling it the same way you are.    \n  \nThe ones who are growing aren't growing as much as they had hoped. Three of my long-term clients decided to retire early and close their business because the impacts of tariffs made their business no longer feasible. Others struggling with softer sales than anticipated. So it's not just you, but I also know how you feel ... we all do.  And you're not unemployed, you are SELF-employed. Sometimes that mental shift helps.   \n  \nThe fact that your business is still going means it has NOT failed, because it's still going. And even if it did actually fail, failure isn't bad, most often it tells us how NOT to do something.  Chin up!",

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified. This shows you're professional and gives you a chance to address concerns before they become issues.",

AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

          "text": "What did help us a lot;  \n\\- Translation in a true local tone of voice got much easier. We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong. It worked well as a context to JSON query converter, but it was lacking the actual intelligence part.",

Tools help with speed, but results still come from innovation, scalability, and staying connected to real users.\n\nAI is most useful when paired with fast iteration and validated learning. It makes shipping and testing easier, but customer feedback still matters more than intuition.\n\nAnother takeaway is that AI doesn’t remove the need to understand your ideal customer. Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter. Trust, relationships, and real conversations continue to be where clarity and momentum come from. AI helps execute, but humans still decide what’s worth building.",

          "text": "We used in our restaurant chain AI assistant which was specifically developed for restaurants. It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

Je me suis formée et je travaille sur la conception d'appli, et voici ce que j'ai appris après plusieurs mois de travail acharné  et deux app en finalisation : \n\nj'ai embauché deux devs pour des essais et ça a été une catastrophe.

Sauf que si j'avais fait cela avec les dévs, j'aurais mis des mois.

Paying them is honestly one of the most frustrating parts of my business. Wire transfers are slow and expensive, PayPal is blocked in some countries or has terrible rates, and dealing with 4 different payment timelines means I'm constantly managing who got paid and who's still waiting. Is there a legitimate solution for paying international contractors quickly without losing 10% to fees and dealing with week long delays? This shouldn't be this hard in 2025",

Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid. Automate reminders so you don't forget.\n\nThe 10% fees you're seeing are prob from using the wrong method. Switch to Wise or Payoneer and it drops to 1-3% depending on country.",

The logistics end up taking more time than the work itself.\n\nWhat helped me wasn’t finding a single “perfect” method, but standardizing the rules on my side. Same pay day for everyone, clear cutoff times, and no one-off exceptions. That alone reduced a lot of the mental load and back-and-forth.\n\nThe other big lesson was separating speed from cost. The fastest options were almost always the most expensive, and the cheapest ones required planning ahead. Once I accepted that tradeoff and planned payouts a few days earlier, things got way smoother.\n\nIt really shouldn’t be this hard, but right now the biggest win I’ve seen is reducing variability so you’re not constantly tracking who’s paid, who’s pending, and who’s stuck in limbo.

Google & LinkedIn Ads: as I said, \\~60% of our customers come from Google and LinkedIn ads! We spend about $7k combined every month! LinkedIn is slightly more expensive but we have basically hit the ceiling on Google alone unfortunately!\n2. Conferences:  We send someone from our team to most present at extremely specific industry conferences! I guess about 10% customers come this way\n3. Cold emails: We have setup Clay recently to automatically do cold outreach based on our ideal customer persona both via email and linkedin! The outreach is basically to book a sales call! About 10% customers come this way\n4. SEO: Since we already get customers from Google ads, it made sense to invest in SEO as well to ideally get some organic traffic without ads! We have setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly to use our Google search data to automatically publish a highly specific blog on our website on relevant keywords! About 10% of customers come this way when they search these keywords on Google!\n5. Communities & Reddit: Last but not least, we have used tools like F5B etc to setup alert on specific keywords all across reddit and few niche online communities and we usually join the conversation, provide value and subtly plug our product  in about 10% of the conversions! Again about 10% of customers this way!",

Content and real examples have done more than ads there.\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect: founder-led stuff works really well. People don’t trust brands that much, but they do trust people. Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

A couple “language” points to clarify what I think you’re saying.\n\nJobs are usually many different tasks. AI may automate or expedite some tasks, but the job itself becomes more about higher level thinking, more critical creative work. Honestly probably less rote, mindless work, and more about like, almost supervising the robot and understanding the “why” behind the work it is doing.\n\nLike you mentioned, the calculator didn’t impede our ability to do math; we actually just started working on much harder problems once we stopped wasting our time on manual calculations. We just need to know how to employ the calculator so we can tackle HARDER problems.\n\nIs that kind of where you’re thinking?",

The new skill is:\n1. define the problem and constraints (what matters, what doesn’t)\n2. supervise + verify outputs (because the robot is confidently wrong sometimes)\n3. turn results into decisions (trade-offs, timing, incentives)\n\nOne nuance: for a while, a lot of roles become “hybrid”. You still need enough “how” to catch failures and steer the tool.\n\nCurious: in the trainings you’ve run, what’s the #1 thing people struggle with most.

Many of us in the industry are pushing for updated roles that supervise the “AI intern” instead of mass automation of roles. \n\nYour question: Most people need real practice using paid AI tools (40-100 hours) and a strong belief that their employers aren’t going to outsource their job. If they really fear losing their jobs, they need to start learning to be an entrepreneur. It’s never been easier than right now.\n\nIf you haven’t already, check out Ethan Mollick’s blog at OneUsefulThing.org - he is one of the biggest experts in the field that combines practical entrepreneur/business sense with no joke scientific/academic reasoning. He’s a trusted voice, as far as I’m concerned. Everyone else is just repackaging the same garbage content.\n\n***Long Response***\n\nLike you mentioned, the real, long-term game now is strategically prioritizing which tasks add the most value and then consistently leveraging these tools to deliver quality products or services faster than the competition. The companies that empower their people to use these tools and mitigate the risk will have a compounding competitive advantage in the next couple years. All future knowledge worker jobs should have an AI supervisor component.\n\nAs for your question: it depends largely on the industry.\n\nGenerally: \n\n1. Many people don’t fully grasp the full range of what LLMs are capable of. They do surface level tasks and don’t realize they can go much deeper. Or they think AI can’t do what they can, so they don’t bother to put it through its paces. They hear the hype but haven’t seen or internalized the earth-shattering magic yet.\n\n2. There is a hands-on component that many lack, they don’t have 20, 40, 100+ of practice with PAID LLMs, so they don’t quite know how to get AI to give them what they want yet. This is easily remedied with practice and coaching. This practice also usually fixes problem 1.\n\n3. The last piece I see the most, and the one I struggle with the most is: many think of AI as an automation tool, not an enhancement tool for existing employees. People think all their jobs are going to be automated away and they are going to lose their jobs. This is a real possibility. So people resist any and all AI trainings, change efforts, etc. They resist because they fear their livelihoods depend on it. The only thing we can do for this one is share a vision of a positive AI enhanced future and actively lead people towards it.\n\nSome people will lose their jobs, but my company REALLY pushes the, “re-define your current roles, put your current employees on harder, more meaningful and valuable work, automate the bullshit busywork that no one wants to do” kind of track. I won’t work with organizations trying to do mass automation and layoffs.\n\n\n***More specific examples of problems and questions from specific industries, if you’re interested:***\n\n-Solopreneurs and small businesses just want to know how they can use these tools to scale their business.\n\n-Higher Education is a mixed bag, many still see using AI as cheating and want to try to ban it or find ways to catch students red-handed. Other academics see it as the future and want to know how to use AI to help them produce better research, faster.\n\n-Medical field: mostly how they can automate the insurance eligibility verification. Or use AI to transcribe appointment notes without violating HIPPA. Most providers want to actually focus on their patients, but have to spend most of their time documenting the whole ordeal that it feels like the Dr is on the computer the whole time. Many of the providers I’ve met know this is a problem and hate it, but they need to make sure your chart is as accurate as possible so they miss out on the actual helping the patient thing.\n\nIs there a specific industry you’re looking for?\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for coming to my TED talk!",

It just happens at the edges:\n- new combinations of old parts under new constraints\n- new problems created by new tech\n- new judgments about trade-offs when the costs are real\n\nI’m not defending slop or style-ripping.

I am not proud of what I have become but nothing excites me more than Entrepreneurship so games get boring, even social media becomes boring, sort of everything. Anyone who has ever had this problem and how they overcame this identity addiction please give me some advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: Thanks you guys for the concern and advices. I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building. The reason I made this post is because I noticed myself being a boring person with no hobbies but Entrepreneurship. Hence, I wanted to ask advices on hobbies similar in likes of Entrepreneurship or something that I can engage as much fun in Entrepreneurship. Thanks!",

If you've been building things, passing that knowledge on can be weirdly fulfilling. You're still \"building\" something - just with people instead of products.\n\nOpen source contributions. If you're technical, you can build things on weekends that aren't tied to revenue pressure.

Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

Not because the business was failing, but because I had built it in a way that worked against who I actually am.\n\nI was showing up in sales calls, client conversations, and daily work in ways that didn’t feel authentic. It felt like I had to perform a version of myself every day. Over time that creates a huge mental tax, even if things look “successful” on paper.\n\nThe hardest realization for me was understanding that you can build something profitable that still drains you if it’s misaligned. I spent years thinking the heaviness was just part of the grind. Only later did I see that the business itself was designed wrong for me.\n\nWhat I’d do differently much earlier is design the business around how I actually want to work, communicate, and think. Money matters, obviously. But being able to wake up and say “this feels like me” matters more long-term. That shift alone removed more stress than any revenue milestone ever did.",

Running my own analytics freelancing business gave me my life back and made me less of a burnt out shell.\n\nThe job I left before starting my business, they wanted me to blatantly lie about a dataset and I just could not do it. It wasn't a white lie. They literally wanted to lie about data on patients with late stage cancer in a way that would justify cutting a helpful program that was being offered to those patients. I was appalled and I tried so hard to 'be a team player' and 'be flexible.' But I'm not going to fucking lie about LATE STAGE CANCER. They said I 'lacked flexibility' because of that and were such assholes. I will bend over backwards to make data work, but I'm not going to flat out tell complete falsehoods.\n\nClients tend to love that I'm so passionate about the data. I don't use the term autism exactly with clients but we've jokingly mentioned that you want your data people to be a little weird for best results.\n\nHere's the lie if anyone wants to see if I was just being autistically literal about it.>! the client wanted to know if cancer patients have trouble traveling to get their treatments. They hired us to measure the distance people traveled to their infusion sites, and then see if there were any correlations between adverse outcomes and that distance. The company I worked for of course did not have actual patient addresses to measure distance to treatment centers, so they lied and used the prescribing doctor's address as the patient's address. Well that's completely tautological-- it meant that everyone who GOT treatment was 'zero miles' from their treatment center. So the data showed everyone was RIGHT on top of a treatment center, and nobody had any issues! They wanted me to tell the client, \"Anyone who got treatment traveled zero miles\" with a completely straight face. I refused and they wrote me up for insubordination and for not helping the business.!<",

So entrepreneurship seemed like the quickest way to spot something wrong and just go fix it myself.\n\nMy reasons for doing it changed over time. I kind of break it down into a few stages.\n\nFirst theres control like deciding what I work on and how I use my days. Back when I started that felt way more important than making money right away.\n\nThen leverage came into it building something once and watching it grow without starting over all the time every week or so.\n\nAnd meaning too working on stuff that Id still want to do even if nobody else cared or noticed.\n\nThe whole point for me isnt some huge exit or anything dramatic. Its more about having options being able to turn down things and pick projects because I want to not because I have to.\n\nTalking to other people who started businesses Ive noticed something. If the only reason is money or looking good it wears you out in that long boring stretch in the middle. But if its about being curious or having some freedom or scratching a real problem you can keep going longer without resenting it all.\n\nI wonder how others think about this.\n\nLike did your main reason shift after messing up the first time or getting a win.\n\nWhat are you aiming for in the end freedom or making a difference or something else specific.\n\nHonestly what keeps you showing up every day in this entrepreneurship thing.\n\nIt seems like we dont just pick it once most of us have to choose it again every year or so.

My friend is extremely dear to me and she's finally in a stable place where I feel comfortable working for her, it's her business, I just talked myself into a job! We've worked together before for a different company so we know each other's work-ethic. She's been wanting to grow her photography business for years but hasn't had the free time to do it, as she works full time elsewhere. Other than bi weekly meetings and her printing things (she works at a print shop) \n\nIt was pretty cool, I pitched her a few ideas with the question about doing this with her in one of our normal chats on the phone and we had a whole business model and general idea by the end of the phone call. Tonight we meet with her tax guy to ask questions! We hope to be off the ground by mid feb, ready to sell her prints and other merchandise.",

I was drowning in my own inconsistency back in 2018, had ADHD that made me feel like i was fighting my brain every single day, and watched a passion project completely implode because i couldnt lead worth shit. The breaking point was realizing id either figure out how to work WITH my brain instead of against it, or id be stuck forever in jobs that felt like slow death.\n\n\n\nMy endgame shifted over time tho. Started as \"prove to myself i can actually execute something\" and evolved into building systems that let people like me stop feeling broken. Now with ScatterMind its about showing other ADHD founders they don't need meds or burnout to build something meaningful. The money followed once i stopped chasing it and focused on solving real problems for people who think like me. Freedom came when i built guardrails instead of just hoping willpower would save me.",

      "text": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

It was brutal. The lessons I learned during that time were invaluable though. Understanding cash flow the hard way, realizing that not every business can be saved, and learning when to cut losses instead of throwing good money after bad. It stung, but those failures taught me more than any success could have.\n\n\n\nWhat kept me going was the same thing that kept you going - consistency. You showed up every day, learned what you didn't know, and adjusted when things didn't work. That's what separates people who eventually succeed from those who give up.\n\n\n\nKeep at it.

      "text": "I’m going to share a story with you about how the company I work for actually started, before it was a proper SaaS.\n\nNot the founder, not the dev. I work close to product and growth at a SaaS that turns Google Maps into usable lead lists. Seeing the \"behind the scenes\" here has been a serious reality check.\n\nBefore there was an automated platform, the founders were coming off a failed project. They were burned out from building features that looked great on paper but didn't sell. So for this new idea, they made a simple rule: Don’t code. Just sell.\n\nFor the first few months, the product was just a manual service. They found people who needed local business data, and when someone asked for a list, they ran scripts manually on a laptop. They cleaned the Excel files by hand, line by line, and sent them via email with a simple PayPal invoice.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive for a tech company, but this manual grind is exactly what saved the business. If the data was wrong, the customer complained instantly. They didn't need to analyze user behavior to know what was broken, they felt it in the inbox. It also proved that people weren't paying for a slick tool, they were paying for the result. If a customer is willing to wait 24 hours for a manual email, you know you have a real business. Plus, those early sales literally funded the first months of actual development.\n\nThe automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\n\nThe lesson from inside the machine is clear: The SaaS was built to scale a solution that already worked, not to try and find a problem with a shiny UI. If what you’re doing right now feels ugly, slow, and unscalable, you’re probably exactly where you need to be.\n\n**🛡️ Authenticity verified:** this content is based on real-world data and real-world events involving real people.

Not would they maybe use it if it were free, but will they literally give you money.\n\nWhat gets me is how the manual process wasn't just validation, it was education. Every angry email about bad data, every question about what fields they needed, every \"can you also include...\" request. That's signal you just can't get from analytics or surveys. You're learning what the product needs to be because you're doing the work yourself, feeling every problem firsthand.\n\nThe timing thing is huge too: \"The automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\" Most founders do the opposite. They build the whole thing before knowing if anyone wants it. By the time you're drowning in manual work, you know exactly which parts to automate first because you're living the pain.\n\nThere's also something powerful about being willing to do unscalable things. It shows early customers you're serious, that this isn't just a side project that might disappear. Someone who will manually clean a spreadsheet at 11pm to get you your data actually cares about solving your problem.\n\nOne thing though: this works great for services where the value is immediate and tangible, like data or clear results. It's trickier for products where the value is in the tool itself or needs network effects. But even then, the core idea holds. Find the simplest way to deliver the value and see if anyone actually cares.",

But those early manual workflows are often where you surface the true pain points and prove there's a market.\n\nIf this feels like the current phase for your product, I'd encourage you to lean into it. What specific aspects of the manual work are the most illuminating? Where do customers seem most engaged or frustrated? Observing those raw interactions can give you invaluable insights that may get lost once things are fully automated.\n\nJust remember to pace yourself. Avoid the temptation to over-optimise before the core foundation is solid. As long as you're learning and getting paid, the \"ugliness\" is a feature, not a bug. What's one small step you could take next to make that manual process just a little bit smoother?",

That’s a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI’m talking about founders who want to leverage **talent**, **capital**, **infrastructure**, and **speed**.\n\nWe tend to underestimate the value of being born or operating in Western countries nowadays. Yes, there is a lot to criticize and improve, no system is perfect, but the legacy you inherit is invaluable.\n\nWhen a founder operates with a team, efficiency matters. You don’t have time to constantly deal with:\n\n* people not being punctual (and it being “normal”)\n* deadlines not being respected (and it being “okay”)\n* feedback not being taken seriously\n* lack of accuracy and accountability\n\nIn many Southern countries, people are raised in environments where predictability is not a priority. A predictable environment with fewer frictions and fewer surprises is something many people in Western cultures take for granted.\n\nAs a founder, you end up wasting an enormous amount of energy on things that are **not core to your business**.\n\nThe hardest part is this:\n\nSome people accept this as “part of the culture” and don’t want to improve it, because changing it feels like betraying their identity and you are the one told you’re taking things too seriously.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I’m not trying to generalize or stigmatize anyone.\n\nBut as a founder, you don’t have the luxury of failing because of things that have nothing to do with your product, your market, or your execution.",

      "text": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

With weight loss your clients are people who are NOT obsessed with the gym, so the biggest issue for them, will always be the effort they have to invest and the lack of motivation. For you this means, once you have worked out a great core offer and have served a few clients, collected same positive proof etc. (the foundational work for any service business) - You will be in the sales/marketing business.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, your company will help people loosing weight. But because of the high churnrate, your work as the Entrepreneur won't be around helping people to loose weight, but to aquiere more customers (sales and on larger scale marketing) each month then you naturally loose, because working out and eating clean sucks.\n\nThis is not to discourage you, just figure out the rules of the industry you are entering quickly and then never expect those problems to ever go away entirely. The high churnrate is a fixed factor for the fitness industry, but that's not a reason to not pursue what you want.\n\n\nOther examples:\nThe software industry is a product industry, as long as the software is great, it will be ez to sell and market.\nThe drink industry, is a branding industry. Energy Drinks, Cocacola, pepsi etc. all depend on a strong brand and not on having the best drink.",

          "text": "Hi, I hope I can help you. There are several entrepreneurial profiles. And you have to figure out which one is yours. But from what I'm seeing, you're not the type to become an entrepreneur out of necessity. So you should keep an eye out for opportunities. It's likely that your choice will be in technology. Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but you have to follow a path full of strategies. And that's quite complicated, haha, because you don't always win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about competitors, because over time you realize that your competitors are actually your partners, haha. It's crazy. Because there are days when you'll only have \"water\" to survive and there are days when you'll have a \"banquet.\" The entrepreneur is always in the worst situation, because the objective is first and foremost their organization.\n\n\nNote: I am an entrepreneur in the technology sector and also a PhD in entrepreneurship. And do you know what the secret is? You must persevere. Change your product, but don't give up. However, if I were to tell you what I intend to specialize in from now on, it would be in manufacturing products and the financial market. Oh, and choose a partner who is resilient to loss. That's important. They also need to be strong enough to handle your yelling. Yes. A fragile partner won't do. Because when you don't have a psychologist, they need to have the vision of where you should go.",

You're not chasing the status symbols, you're actually investing in things that compound - freedom with friends, stability with a forever home, better travel experiences. That's not consumption, that's *lifestyle design*.\n\nThe fact that you naturally gravitated away from boats and jets without even trying tells me you figured something out early that most people take years (or never) to learn: the real wealth is in what you *don't* have to stress about anymore.\n\nHow long did it take before you stopped second-guessing every purchase?

Perhaps God is gifting me this, idk why He would be I can’t explain it otherwise. \n- I validate / evaluate all my ideas with ChatGPT. To make them viable and actionable. To see if there’s any way to improve. To get feedback whether it will be received well with my market.\n- I post and put myself out there without self-judgement. I’ve been consistent posting 1-2x daily and only taking days off for “creative expansion” days where I recalibrate and make room for even better ideas\n- I evaluate every single piece of content / sales page / offer I make by sharing my performance stats with ChatGPT. It shows me whats effective and where people are falling off. I take this info and reiterate and repost without worrying if people notice.”\n- I am constantly feeding my brain with expert ideas strategies and ways of thinking via low ticket info products. I feed what’s relevant to me into ChatGPT to help me expand on my current ideas and way of writing and working.\n\nSo far I’ve grown my Facebook platform from 0 to 8000 daily views and engagement has increased similarly too.\n\nI’ve got two different offers in the works - low ticket books and courses for my mom audience where I help them mitigate meltdowns\n\nAnd a mid-ticket group consulting offer for high level biz owners / marketers who want to reach more of their followers on Facebook like I have.\n\nI suppose I’m a mix of excited / curious :)\n\nAnd I keep myself in check asking myself “am I striving?

      "text": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

One biggest advice I would give for your situation to stop pushing yourself in doing what you can't. You have to build actually discipline from here on. I'm assuming that it's been a good amount of time since your lifestyle has gotten worse. So to fix it, you have to fix the environment first. You don't have to change everything at once or keep a separate time for \"work\". My real advice is to change the place where you live. If possible, just move to another room with a different kind of setup which is minimal. With a new environment, your brain would allow you to let go of current habits and allow you to build new good ones. If you can't change your room, just change the place of furniture. Just make a change. That could also mean minimalising your room by removing unnecessary things. Regardless, best wishes!",

I used targets/goals to make my buys before I had even proven the concept. It was so dumb.\n\n  \nThe first but of advice I give anyone starting in my space is that you can sink your entire business overnight with one bad inventory buy. I'm still scared, lol. I am guessing we could've push our numbers a little higher this year pretty easily by buying more but it's still so hard. Also, 2020 - 2022 were so stressful with inventory. It's stabilized somewhat now, tariffs aren't helping, but it's still hard for me to be really aggressive.\n\nThanks for the question, it was a bit therapeutic to type it out.",

I wanted quick delivery so my spouse and I didn't travel more than three days away from our home for 2 years. That was annoying so I sent the fulfillment to an outside company. Not a great situation. I am sure you can find much better places now but slower and more expensive.\n\nI eventually brought all the fulfillment in house once we rented a warehouse. Huge win for us, cheaper and faster. Sometimes when we are really busy I have to go down and help ship but that's fine, I am helping people so I don't mind.\n\nOne other thing was \"riding horses\". This is a term you hear sometimes or at least I've heard which is you saddle up your company to someone else's and ride on their horse. We made clothes for popular influencers and were able to grow a lot off them just doing what they normally would do and we got to come along for the ride and grow.",

Saying all of that I do recognise and appreciate that work did take precedence during the relationship and at times often did and I can relate to you on that front \n\nI’m integrating the understanding that the people who did truly support are still here and a friend made sense to me that “if she was truly supporting you she would have been a part of what you are doing not just being there ‘waiting’” for something to happen. \n\nWith your situation, you clearly show respect and appreciation for what your ex did with you and you needed to put that time in on your craft to get to where you were. Although you may not be able to enjoy the fruits with him, you owe it to yourself for the hard work you put in and the dreams and ambitions were yours. Yes hold that gratitude in your heart for him and if there’s ways you would like to extend that gratitude then do so, but don’t feel bad for your win (I did) just appreciation, I’m sure he would \n appreciate that even",

It's still hard, it's still painful, but it's doable. That means, no matter what mistakes you made, those expierences give you an edge against completely new Entrepreneurs who just started.\n\nAgain, even if you feel like you have nothihg to show for your efforts, you are in a better position then most wannabe entrepreneurs. Failure is part of the journey.\n\nIf you share your story publicly, you force yourself to exposure. It makes it much harder for you to stay ignorant, it makes it harder to delay the learning process further, and it encourages you to find clarity in what you actually gained from it and in what position you are actually in.\n\nYou can find \"success\" from any position in life, but you can't play the game if you don't even know what figures you have.",

When you get to a certain number of employees, you should obtain an HR consultant (e.g. they know legal requirements at various # of employees).  \n\nBookkeeping is an extremely high return activity to outsource, since it is something that needs to be done, yet the owner either has to spend too much time away from clients/prospects learning how to do it and also to do it, or it is not done timely or accurately.  Few business owners realize also that bookkeeping provides more than just the accounting, it provides good timely information to better manage your business.  (As you might be able to tell, I pivoted my business coaching business to providing bookkeeping...)\n\nThere are also what is often called 'fractional CFO's', who are experienced, likely semi-retired former CFO's and financial experts who would work with you to point out ways to bring your business to be more effective financially.",

Upwork charges just for you to bid on projects, even if you don't land them. \n\nAlso scammers are so abundant now that no one trusts anyone if they come from CL, which allows the gate keepers to justify their own scamming (their scamming being the process with which they gate keep, like upwork).\n\nI'm sorry about being all negative 😔.

If user is engaging with design and feeling a connection then that will surely reduce your churn.\n\nFor me exciting part will be adding new feature that helps people and solve their problems but UI/UX is also important so that users don't need to try hard to use that feature, if that feature is user friendly, your sales will automatically go high.",

      "text": "Some backstory: when I was 17, I was hit by a car and settled for $250k. After I paid my attorney and hospital bill, I had about $140k which I used to buy 2 beater homes in my neighborhood. After 5 years of fixing them up and trying to find reliable tenants, I practically just barely broke even on them after paying for materials, labor, and loss of rent from 3 separate tenants across both homes refusing to pay and waiting out the eviction process; the first \"tenant\" was a squatter, the second lost his job, and the third just had a laundry list of excuses every month, it was an absolute nightmare. I made no income since all of the rent money from one home was being reinvested into the other, and once it seemed like things were going good, my tenants would stop paying. Since selling last year, I continued working in transportation with my CDL and am almost done with my BS in finance and accounting which I am finishing online. My entire net worth of $200k is mostly liquid, I own a few ETFs, a couple individual stocks, some Bitcoin, and my car. I have no debt, I max out my Roth every year, and my student aid will cover the rest of my degree which I'm finishing this December.\n\nMy problem is that I have no idea what I'm doing really. I don't want to drive a truck forever, and if the career I want to go into doesn't work out right away (personal finance), then I'll be driving this truck for who knows how many more years. I don't want to buy my own truck or start my own transportation business, and anyone who does is probably insane. I'm not wanting to become filthy rich, I just want to have fun and make enough money to pay my bills and take care of my family when the time comes for me to start one.\n\nJust interested to hear what you guys would do if you were me. I'm not sure if I'll take a huge plunge into something different right away, but I would love to shake things up this year. I am not happy in my career, and I'm willing to take a risk to change that and be my own boss. Just looking for some inspiration.\n\nThanks!",

You’ve already learned one of the hardest lessons early (landlording isn’t passive and tenant risk is very real), you have zero debt, real capital, a finance/accounting degree about to finish, and a high-income fallback skill that pays the bills while you experiment. That combo gives you something most people don’t: time and optionality. I wouldn’t rush into another capital-heavy business or try to “force” entrepreneurship right now. Instead, I’d keep the CDL as a safety net, tighten your investments into something boring and diversified, and start testing low-risk paths aligned with where you’re already leaning: personal finance content, fee-only advising later on, or even a small solo service like bookkeeping, tax prep, or financial coaching once you’re properly licensed. Those paths let you build credibility, income, and autonomy without lighting your capital on fire. You don’t need a huge plunge to change your life this year; you need controlled experiments while preserving your downside. You’re not lost, you’re just early, and you’ve earned the right to be patient while you build something you actually enjoy.",

If your goal isn’t to get super rich then there’s really no need for risking that capital to start a business at this time. Continue to focus on long term investments in the market, especially with ETFs. That money will compound in no time. I would also look into house hacking, you can get a traditional loan on a 1-4 unit residential property, live in one unit and rent out the others. You can essentially live for free while building equity in the house. Eventually you can move out and rent the other unit and turn a profit as well. Rinse and repeat and before you know it you own multiple properties increasing your net worth as the properties get paid down and increase in value. The main goal is to buy assets, especially ones that can cash flow. Whatever they may be, holding on to a lot of cash and just letting it sit is never good because it’s losing value. Get your degree, get a good job (with growth potential) and keep being responsible with your money. If you eventually wanna roll the dice on a business idea, go for it but it has to align with your goals. But remember, no 9-5 will be harder than starting your own business. You’re in a good position right now to really set yourself up for when you are in your 30s and 40s. Best of luck.",

Before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) but now also on written text like \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\".

Call Summarization: Tools like Zooms AI transcription, Otter etc has immensely helped with summarizing call transcripts so you don't have to listen to 47 minutes of \"um\" and \"can you hear me\"! It can even create action items, update our CTM etc!\n2. Mockups and  Designs: Tools like V0 by Vercel, Google Nano Banana has helped us immesively by generating UI updates, UI for new features, product images for marketing etc\n3. Data driven SEO & content repurposing: We have used AI tools like Frizerly to automate the process of coming up of SEO strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well!\n4. Writing Code 2x Faster:  Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster!\n5. Email sequence follow up: We have setup Clay to automatically follow up with our leads with hyper personalization to ensure they book a call with our sales team! Still doesn't eliminate any of our sales people but allows them to automate boilerplate stuff!\n\nThat's all I can think of right now! Curious what others have it going!",

Instead of just looking at portfolio data or numbers, AI helped surface things like hesitation, life events, or confidence shifts from client messages that usually get lost.

Tell your AI who it is and how you want it to talk to you. Staples in all my prompts:\n\n>You are an expert in (X, Y and Z)\n\n>Speak plainly. Flag if I'm over ambitious and be blunt.\n\n>Flag pain points.\n\n>Warn if I'm bike shedding\n\n* Build special mini AI tools to format messy text into .json etc files, and have the model flag for missing or broken data points.\n\n* Don't be afraid to 'sidebar' or 'hard reset' conversations. Sometimes the model can get hung up on an things you said days ago and will keep brining it up.\n\n* Ask for sources AND CHECK THEM. AI has a tendency to over-weight older opinions. Presume you are talking to someone from 2024, even if you're providing new data to pull from. This is twice as important if you're troubleshooting tech/hardware issues. On a tech forum I'm a part of they have a huge warning to new users not to use AI for troubleshooting. Lots of fried circuitry/dangerous conflicts this way.",

These increased marketing activities are very mentally taxing for me.\n\nAs a way to wind off, I like to play games. Particularly, Dota 2. A game I used to play 20 years ago, one I still enjoy.\n\nThis leisure time is one of the things that helps me unwind and not think about the business after I've drained my battery on it; any other input in business would be unproductive.\n\nHowever, I found that the morning after playing a few games, I feel even more mentally fatigued. I assume this is because I've exhausted 100% of my mental capacity, and then a gaming session, which pushes it to 110% or more, draws on reserves from another day.\n\nMy dilemma is that, for me, games are one of the best ways to unwind and not think about the business. But games are also what drain my energy for the business.\n\nI wanted to ask you, entrepreneurs who also enjoy gaming: how do you approach this? Did you just quit gaming, or how did you reorganize your time?",

          "text": "I’ve been there honestly. Games feel like rest but they’re not actually rest, especially something like Dota. That game is constant decisions, pressure, adrenaline. It shuts your brain off from work, yeah, but it does not let it recover.\n\nWhat clicked for me is there are different types of off. Anything competitive still hits the same mental system I need for work. So I didn’t quit gaming, I just boxed it in hard. No ranked. No long sessions. And never on nights before heavy days. Sounds boring but the next day fog mostly disappeared.\n\nSwapping some sessions helped too. Walking with music. Light gym, not chasing numbers. Even mindless YouTube. Feels less satisfying in the moment but you wake up way clearer.\n\nTiming matters a lot. Gaming when you’re already mentally cooked is the worst combo. If I play now it’s earlier in the evening, strict stop time, and not every day. Maybe two or three times a week. Otherwise it leaks into tomorrow exactly like you described.\n\nI don’t think quitting gaming is the answer. It’s more accepting that some games are mentally expensive and you have to budget them like energy, not time. Business drains you, Dota drains you, stacking them back to back overdrafts tomorrow.\n\nAlso random thought. Intense games wreck sleep quality even if you fall asleep fine. That alone can explain the morning fatigue.\n\nShort version. Keep gaming, just treat it like caffeine. Nice, useful, enjoyable, but wrong dose at the wrong time messes you up the next day.",

Nothing else pulls me in and helps me unwind like that. This is very subjective, and it's probably because I grew up with games.\n\nThe problem is the mental fatigue it causes, and the business must not suffer.\n\nBased on all the comments you guys posted, I think the right approach isn’t to remove gaming, but to be extremely thoughtful about it.

The games themselves are pretty tense.\n\nThat’s why I got myself a VR headset and been cycling through some of the best VR games and trying out some old classic. Right now I’m doing Doom 3. Another positive about VR is that I don’t normally do more than 40-60 minutes because it gets a bit headachy after hours, unless maybe if you’re used to it. This gives me the break I need, to get back to work.\n\nI balance it out with exercise, and taking family out somewhere. Through the years, when I really was feeling mentally down, I would go on for runs. Eventually ran about 10-12 miles a few times. It helped understand that sometimes I tell myself I’m tired and done, but I could always can push a little further. That had a positive effect on other metal activities.

If you do it on your own, you're going to spend money in testing and trial and error, and things are more expensive because you don't have economies of scale. If you go the franchise route, you pay a bit more up front but the mistakes have already been made and the processes have been refined.\n\nThere's over 4,000 franchises in existence but less than 10% of them ever get over 25 locations. So the franchise that you partner with is extremely important and you need to make sure that it's well-established.\n\nOne of the more glaring red flags is a franchisor that hasn't learned how to be a franchisor yet. In that process you run the risk of their learning curve. By partnering with a more established franchise, there's repetition and time to improve or perfect the model. This is a much safer route in my experience.\n\nIf you're a self-starter and highly independent, you might be better off going on your own. But if you like mentorship, a coach, or a guide who can shorten your learning curve, franchises provide that. Either way you're going to pay. The biggest question is: do you want to pay for your learning curve or for someone else's? \n\nI'm a franchise consultant and I deal with established brands every day. If you want to talk it through or what to look for and how to interview a franchise company, let me know. I'm happy to help!",

I buy stuff on vinted and ebay and resell it. I ordered many items and some of them arrived already. I listed them on ebay, but ebay is slow.

My business is stalling and ebay is probably processing my new account or something before I appear in the search results, but that wait is the worst. I want things to happen now, but they ain't happening. \n\nI try to watch animes that I enjoy and make myself busy, but there's a limit.

Your brain wants dopamine now, but markets don’t work on your timeline. eBay is slow by design, new accounts even more so. The trick is to shift what you measure. Stop waiting on sales as the only win. Track controllables: number of listings, pricing tests, photos improved, titles rewritten, comps researched, cross-posting, outreach to watchers. If you don’t manufacture progress, your mind will eat you alive. Do your damnest to NOT emotionally anchor on “first sale.” It’ll come, and then you’ll immediately want the second, then the tenth. The waiting never goes away, you just get better at filling it with useful motion. If you really can’t sit still, stack parallel bets. While eBay warms up, source more inventory, test another platform, or start learning a second business line. \n\nEntrepreneurs don’t slow down, they redirect.\n35+ platforms you could be visible on if you want it bad enough.",

In 2026 what still works is boring, specific, and tied to a real problem that someone already wants to pay to fix.\n\nLocal and unsexy businesses still make money. Cleaning, trades, removals, clinics, pet services. Demand is constant. The opportunity is not inventing something new, it is doing marketing, systems, and customer experience better than owners who are stuck in the past.\n\nContent alone barely pays anymore, but it still works as leverage. Newsletters, YouTube, TikTok are not the business. They are the attention layer that feeds into something else like consulting, services, products, communities, or software.\n\nB2B is still strong because businesses pay faster and complain less than consumers. If you help save time or money through automation, operations, compliance, or simple systems, you do not need massive reach to make real income.\n\nNiche info products still work when they are extremely specific. One clear problem, one clear outcome, for one type of person. Distribution matters more than polish.\n\nCrypto is not dead, but the easy phase is over. The money now is around tools, services, audiences, and infrastructure, not blind buying and hoping.\n\nThe real shift is that the internet stopped rewarding copy paste ideas. It still rewards people who understand a small group of people better than anyone else.",

This thing is running. \n\ngenuine question:\n\nif this works in nagpur, what’s stopping other indian cities from doing the same? politics? infra cost? public perception? And is it happening in your country too?",
