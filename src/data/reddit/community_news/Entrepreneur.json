      "text": "so we had this customer who was extremely frustrated with us(asking for refunds / angry emails on serivce etc). every week they'd email support with another complaint. my cofounder wanted to just refund them and move on\n\ninstead i got on a call and asked if theyd be willing to show me exactly what they hated. turned into a 2 hour screen share where they basically roasted our entire product lol\n\nat some point i just said screw it and asked \"what if you designed it yourself? what would it look like?\"\n\nthey sent me back a excalidraw file the next hour. it was ugly as hell but honestly it was genius\n\nwe had all these charts and graphs and filters because we thought it looked professional. they replaced it with like 5 big numbers and a single button that said \"export for my boss\"\n\nshowed it to the team and there was silence. our lead designer was honestly kinda offended. but i pushed us to build it exactly as the customer spec'd it. took maybe a week\n\nthat angry customer became our biggest referral source. theyve sent us like 12 clients\n\nnow we do this regularly. every quarter we find our most frustrated user and give them way too much access. they roast us and we build whatever they ask for\n\nturns out the people who complain the most are just the ones who care the most\n\nanyone else ever let customers dictate product decisions like this? curious if its worked for others",

For two days, my store was in \"maintenance mode.\" New customers? Gone. Existing subscribers trying to update their card? Error message. I couldn't even log in to see who was trying to pay me\n\nI spent $1,200 on ads that drove to a dead page. My \"backup plan\" was Authorize .net... which was useless because the entire shopify storefront was disabled. the platform wasn't my partner; it was my landlord who changed the locks becz a neighbor complained\n\n\"review\" ended. no apology. the chargeback? customer lost their card and reported it stolen. bank's auto-system filed disputes for every recent charge. I won the case with tracking. My \"penalty\" was $1,200 in burned ads, 72 lost signups, and the realization that my biz is built on a foundation that can be paused on a whim\n\nso, for the scaled businesses here: what's ur actual, no-bullshit plan for when ur platform decides u're a risk for a day? not theory. what's in place rn that would keep u taking money if ur storefront vanished tomorrow?",

We thought we were being smart.\n\nBut the result is that now the internet is just noise.\n\nI'm a solofounder. I don't have a marketing team. The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users. Maybe the answer isn't a better tool. Maybe is just doing the work we are trying to avoid. ",

The thing is that if you could automate the proces of \"looking for\" the places, and start focusing more on \"how to join\", you'll be doing a better work. The same goes with AI.

Compare that to the hours I used to spend tweaking email sequences that nobody read anyway.  \n  \nYou're right that trust is everything when you're small. People can smell automation from miles away now. They've been conditioned to ignore it.  \n  \nWhat's your product solving? Curious if there are specific communities or signals you could focus on to make the manual work more targeted.",

Part of it, is when you're validating a SaaS (in my case), So you need to look for people who have the problem you're solving, and let them know what you're building. The main SaaS is a lead gen tool, but I decided to build this as a SaaS, not only as a private automation, because I found people complaining about another lead gen tools that are just an AI-wrapper using the Reddit's API so they can spam their projects/links, people complaining about pricing, or just tools that aren't really useful once they tried them, and I had the same issues.

One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to. Does it actually stop you from doing dumb stuff like 500 invites a day or just lets you set that and blames you when you get banned. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for the tool for a long term.\n4. Can it connect to your CRM without making things worse\n5. Will support actually help if LinkedIn sends you a warning\n\n\n\nWhat else should be on here?\n\n",

The best automation handles the repetitive parts (sending messages, follow-ups) but frees you up to focus on genuine engagement when someone responds.\n\n\n\nFor outreach beyond LinkedIn, consider multi-channel automation - SMS/WhatsApp can have even better response rates than LinkedIn messages, especially for local businesses.

Would anyone believe he didn't have connections to make it such a success?\n\nHeck, there was one financial guru, who did seem to have a reasonably level head, till he said he bought a Ford GT for \"$0 dollars\".  Yeahhhh, he kinda forgot to mention that it's only \"$0 dollars\" after the car would be sold.  Totally skipping the $275K he still needed to drop on it to get it in the first place, and let the appreciation take care of the 'cost'.  I stopped following him right after that.\n\nI mean, let's not even mention that when was the last time you saw a millionaire posting an add on Instagram to make you rich as well?  Hell, even Tony Robbin's stuff is more about 'feel good' methods than it is about anything else.  Does anyone thing he already doens't have enough money to deal with all the things he's doing?\n\nWhat we need are real guides and practices that actually work for where any of us are in our journeys.  Those are usually not glamorous or necessarily product any kind of significant income.  Most really help you fine-tune what we are(or in some cases are not) already doing.  That's not very 'sexy' to sell.\n\nEven Tim Ferris, and he's about the only one I feels gets it, wrote a book (The 4hr Work Week) was great for the time, but now is dated and now being 'remote' for work is pretty common.  (Not to mentioned being....errr...'enforced' in recent times.)\n\nThose of us who are struggling can't afford a $1000 course, or $200/month for 'group support'.  \n\nIs there an answer out there or someone who really gets it and shares real world facts and assistance that doesn't take away from beginners who are mostly flailing around?  I don't know.  Not sure there ever will be.",

I replaced myself as CEO about 16 months ago and am completely lost. I have built a large business, many in fact. But because I recently I replaced myself with a more capable leader in my largest company and now feel completely useless. I don't run anything anymore. I dont hire/fire. I check in biweekly at most. I almost lost my key staff today because I have been so overbearing and basically not trusting them as well as second guessing decisions. \n\n  \nThey gave me their 60 day notice today, and I refused to take it, instead we agreed that I would work on my seperation/reactive attachment issue. I need to stop interferring with the people that put in charge. We agreed to make goals with deadlines, and if I interfer 1 more time, they will quit. If they dont meet the goals and deadlines that they set, I will ask them to leave.\n\nNow my identity. \n\n  \nMy entire identity for 20+ years has been building and running businesses. I get mailbox money now that I dont earn daily, which sucks trust me. I am having issues in my marriage and home life because I am misrable knowing that I literally have no business purpose any more. \n\nYes. I should be happy. But I am genuinely miserable. I have a beautiful family, beautiful house. I have had more sports cars than most athletes. This is not to boast, its to send a clear message. None of this is or ever made me happy (Except my family, love them! :)).\n\n  \nIm sitting here as a multi-millionaire, with so much business intellect, and 0 outlet. I dont want to make some cheesy course, or consult. \n\n  \nI just want to talk about business, day in and day out, I have owned and invested in so many markets because its all exciting to me. But the internet has created a somewhat nasty reputation to anyone who wants to help people solve problems.\n\nQuestion: \n\n**How if at all, can I genuinely help people when they are building or built great businesses?**\n\nI thought about angel investing and mixing fun content like dave ramsey when people call in, I thought about interviewing other successful people (easy to call on when I mention who I am). \n\nI am not gatekeeping info, Ill help if I can, but the few people that I have tried to help publicly, like instagram and such, just want me to invest. Which I have in the past, but most times I say no. And most times they need someone to hand hold. Not anwer questions.\n\n  \nPlease help GODS of reddit! :D \n\nGenuinely appreciate you for listening",

Or helping people who aren't even at the investment stage. Watch something grow from just the idea, helping with budgeting and gov docs, taxes etc. Might not be exciting, but if you believe in the person or in the idea, you could scratch that itch without needing to sink all your time and energy into it. Then again, if things not being under your full control is a problem area, that may need to be addressed prior. Alternatively, create. Seems to me a lot of broke creators are really happy, and a lot of rich people tend to lack that outlet.

But that would require my full-time attention and I don’t really want that now. Our kids are elementary and middle school so it’s a fun time to have this much free time.

Take the family on vacay to some island.  Go to one of those Tony Robbins seminars in Fiji.  Or just listen to the audio of his programs.  The personal development programs in your case, not the business programs. Trust me it will really help to find out what you want. It sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are now and what you want.\n\nWhat problems in teh world could you solve? If you have that amazing business ability, can you put it toward creating charitable organizations that would truly help people? Here and in other parts of hte world? A spiritual search maybe might aid this.\n\nBut before doing anything it sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are at this stage of your life and what that looks like without this or that business. Is that all you are?  If they all went south tomorrow, and you were left with nothing, no businesses, no cars, no fancy house, no fancy clothes, who would you be?  Would you give back?  To who? Would you pick up a long ago abandoned interest or hobby?  What type of person would you be?  What really matters?  Who in your life really matters? What would you notice that previously got lost in the whirlwind. Are you missing things in  life that are right in front of you? Material things come and go, and in the end you can't take them with you. Some major event could happen tomorrow that affects all of it. What's important is the people around us, relationships and what we give back.\n\nOne of the good clarity exercises Robbins talks about is the Rocking Chair test -where you imagine yourself at the end of your days, sitting in a rocking chair, and imagine what you are glad you did and what you regret, and what you regret NOT doing. My paraphrase.\n\nSome therapy is a very good suggestion if you have the right therapist.  Good luck to you.",

We judge ourselves and others by what they do, how much they have, what status they hold etc. Size them up, evaluate them, respect or disrespect them based on that. But is that a real measure of someone?  In some other cultures outside the US, it's considered offensive to ask what someone does for a living.  It's considered more appropriate to ask what someone likes to do or what their interests are.\n\nOne life event, one major disaster that disrupts the economy, one environmental disaster, then none of that matters. For perspective, imagine someone who might have owned a store in Ukraine, or owned an apartment building, or who's been a big shot in this or that. Now those same people are fighting on the front lines together in a town that is unrecognizable.  No one cares if the person next to them was a big shot or an ordinary guy, a saint or a sinner.  Zombie apocalypse, indeed.\n\nHave fun doing the Robbins seminar.  Cheers",

I feel like we are right at the tipping point, but not sure we have the capital to make it through. Insurance reimbursements can take a long time to pay out, so while we just had a good month, we are struggling to pay expenses because we are probably 4-6 weeks from actually getting the payments. At the same time we’re reconciling a lower revenue per patient (the reason our revenue isn’t matching our projections). So it seems like the solution is additional locations so we can have a higher patient count, but I might be stuck putting up the capital myself, which I really don’t want to do since I might have to reach into my own pockets to cover expenses while we wait for payment anyway. What do you think we should do to solve current cash flow problems? Try for an AR based loan or something? And what should I do as far as the future of the business? Wait until it can support additional locations on its own? Or fund it myself?",

Tackle hard questions and help contribute to scientific progress where there is a legacy and purpose beyond just profit.\n\nSame with charitable giving in general. Sustainable charity work is hard to come by - supporting charities building systems that benefit their communities and help their members improve their situation is very similar to your Dave Ramsey idea, because those folks aren’t looking to sell a startup for a specific ROI they’re just looking to create a living that improves their life. And mentorship in those spaces is entirely possible. \n\nSimilarly, helping non-profits build a non-donation based revenue stream is something that can feed your need for building while also having a higher purpose than profit. Meaning helping charities be less reliant on donations - as global giving can fluctuate and it helps ensure their long term survival. (They can’t make a profit of course but they can do activities that generate revenue).",

Knowing the mistakes you made, your approach to leadership and where your mental health is, are you really ready to offer mentorship or to start something that is focussed on impact and not income and growth?\n\nThis is a similar story to an acquaintance of mine. He built a business over a number of years and sold it last year. He pocketed millions and stills gets a residual income off the business.\n\nAfter he transitoned out staff moral and employee satisfaction went up, churn went down, quality went up. Despite being a big and busy business he was never able to let the people he hired do the job...he was an angry, overbearing micromanager.\n\nOn the outside he became unbearable to be around. He has spent years working insane hours and only thinking about and talking about business and money. He forgot how to have a day off and keep himself entertained or mentally nourished.\n\nHis kids are now grown up, starting university and absolutely do not need him trying to help...they got this far without dad being a reliable, supportive presence so why now.\n\nHis wife has her own life, hobbies, friends and a job and will probably move out soon.\n\nThey don't have any real memories of being a family together. Family vacations were actually his wife taking the kids on her own while he stayed buried in the business.\n\nOf course he thinks he is the one that has sacrificed so much to give his family a 'life' but I think they would have been fine without the trappings of...things...if they had a better family life.\n\nSo anyway this is a long way of saying to literally go for a walk in nature every day, turn your phone and emails off, play with the kids, do housework, see your friends, have lazy days on the couch, go on a trip...for a year...you are burnt out and have trained yourself to only think one way.

I always lose everything I put into it. \nI work hard and I always manage business well but it’s always a a job when I’m working for someone else. \nI have nobody to talk to because everyone I know with a business inherited it or, they are a small business where they have a trade and do mostly contract work. \nI’ve been dreaming about starting something since before eBay. I actually started trying to build something similar in 1992 but quickly ran out of talent. I just got married (way too young) and thought I’d build a website where people could buy items that were backed by actual users of the product. \nA reliable and affordable taxi service was next based on the ride share idea in 2005. Sounds like fantasy, I know but I have friends that can back me up because I’d never stop talking about it with them. \nThe problem is, I have ideas but I don’t know how to move from there. I guess many have that problem. \n\nHave you got any advice for a guy mid fifties and still trying to find a mentor or someone who can help get there first one off the ground?",

The numbers say this business model works but opening a showroom and dealing with staff turnover during peak season hit the cashflow hard. This is the year we prove this thing. \n\nI’d love to dig into a brain like yours and get all the transferable knowledge I can. I am where I am now because I invited a serial entrepreneur out to dinner (he owns 13 businesses, I got sent on a service call with the company I was working for, met him in his home and I invited him out after asking what he did for work). He eventually convinced me to quit my job and start a business and the rest is history.\n\nThanks for sharing a piece of your story. I find it incredibly fascinating.\n\nI’m curious, do you have early life trauma that is contributing to how challenging this transition has been for you?",

Have you taken the time to wind down from years of cortisol filled days and accepting that is time to fully close a chapter? It seems to me that it will be good to start with Journaling your self reflections and starting to vocalize or in this case write down these feelings. I can tell you are a problem solver by how successful you have been with your business for the past decades. Writing things down may help you to not just get it out but materializing these feelings into something physical may in a way kick in your problem solving skills on solving the big problem of inadequacy that you are currently facing. Life is short, there is so much more to see and learn, even maybe teach as well as a way to give back in a way. \n\nHave a good life, you have the tools for it at your disposal.",

Build that person up, build your business up, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis might allow you the ability to get back in the trenches with small teams, build people back up and mentor them again, and build a portfolio of assets that will cash flow for you.\n\nAs for the team at your current business, one of the greatest lessons I learned from a CEO from a large company, was don’t try and be involved in everything. You hired these people because they are talented, capable, and you have to get out of their way and let them do what they do best. Doesn’t mean you fully walk away, but at that stage you’re prob going to be set at setting direction and objectives and letting them figure it out and execute.",

(Love my small family and the house mortgage :) ) i have originated over $2B in loans, and funded a good enough amount. Still going.\n\nI have done well, but seems like i have not enough time to enjoy just living. I have 20-50 opportunites a day, all requesting funding for thier operations. I want to help and drives me to do so. Its honeslty overwhelming at times. My 2.5 yr old daughter is why i do it. I hope she can have a better life then i did in my war torn childhood. (When i was 9 i was shot. Burried alive in mass grave. Crawled out at night. Over the river and through the woods. Into hands of evil and a concentration camp.) Now i am here for a reason. Funding businesses and solutions is what i am good at, but only enjoy the people who are kind, honest, and really want help from me. 1000s have just tried to use me. 1000s of investors, brokers, banks, etc have \"backdoored\" me.... its been a wild ride, and i have learned a ton. Hopefully one day i can take less on, have a good team to depend on. I do everything myself. From intake calls, strategies, solutions, UW convos, presentations, and work is on my mind 24/7.\n\nIts the challenges of my industry and the rewards are great. But doing it all by myself is going to run me dry one day. \n\nI don't know why I typed all of this out. Thank you for reading. We can always go fishing together If you want.  We can bring the kids! \n\nThat be nice. \n\nEnjoy a bit of time off. Sounds like you and i need just a small vaca. Enjoy the little one. Diper changes with phone in one hand can be a challenge! \n\nLife is short, challenging, and rewarding.  \nHope my story gives you some clearity and comfort.\n\nPeace internet stranger.

Honestly, I really wish that I would have just kept doing what I loved which I now come to realize 10 years later is company building. I should’ve just picked another project.

I really wish you the best of luck as I get older too I think teaching and mentoring if you can wrap that into the scheme, as well as picking something that you may be discounted before that has a humanitarian or helpful cause that you want to discounted because of it less than stellar, financial, earning capability, etc.",

And the other thing I was thinking of if these dont resonate with you, you could always start from scratch, find a passion project, make it hard for yourself and give yourself a limited amount of capital for your start up. So for me i have to work a day job to pay for my buisness. Im 2 years in now and its been a grind. If i had a pile of capital I could be so much further ahead, but im not in that position yet, but im getting there slowly. Most people would love to be in your position, but i definitely get it, we all need purpose no matter where in the wealth scale you are. So you could Give yourself a challenge and imagine your starting off from scratch again with $10k in the bank to start a buisness. I imagine someone with your knowledge could scale that pretty fast to a $100k or more, but it could be a fun project for you and its you doing all the work.\nGood luck with it all man, ive been through my fair share of depression and it sucks, but it does get better, just remember to keep your family close, love them and dont lose them, there the most important",

And if I do get a job, the pay will amount to the rent of one of my assets. So a job won’t make sense. So I am stuck in this situation that if I got a job, I will not be able to take care of my assets (some are overseas so I need to travel). But sitting at home drives me nuts. I’ve managed to find a way to survive though.\n\nI go to the gym in the morning. Or I go for a swim. Exercise helps expel all that energy that’s irritating you; all the energy you were using for business. So vacant days are for exercise. Then you will have days where you need to run some errands, like checking up on your businesses. Or you can decide to travel somewhere. Or you can write a book. I’m writing a book addressed to my daughter, for example; and I’m pouring in all my life experiences and giving her advice on life. Even if it never gets published, I can gift it to her. Plus it’s very therapeutic. \nAnd also there’s other things you can get into. I’m in real estate, and I’m itching to try a business. You’ve tried business; why not get into real\nestate? Build something. Buy a building and rent it out. Real estate is great for the kids. It’s easier for them to run a building than a business. And it’s more difficult for your kids to squander a building or real estate assets; very easy for them to squander cash or sell stocks.\n\nYou just need to fill up the first half of the day with something like exercise, or a side project, or writing. Or maybe take yoga classes. Then after lunch, spend some time with family. Or take them out. My father, a retired lawyer, goes to a poetry club every morning, then goes back home for lunch, then brings his friends over for a card game, or he goes to one of his friends and plays cards. He has a driver, and a cook. So his driver takes him everywhere. He has managed to keep himself busy.\nAnyway, good luck. And be sure that the whole busyness phenomenon is a modern thing. Ancient Romans and Greeks used to spend much time in leisure. That’s how philosophy was invented 😂 No need to keep running around. Enjoy life!!!",

You can do a lot? THINK BIGGER.\n\nMy first thought was, why not go into private equity as a sub division? That litterally meets everything here. And no private equity isn’t just for billionaires. \nBut most billionaires have done it through private equity, also you build long term aswell, you talk business day in and day out and do that? Basically make your empire bigger, instead of consolidating.\nWould get assets for yourself instead of gambling on “markets” you’re a business owner/founder/ceo/entrepreneur, not anything else. \nYou invest in markets that’s basically modern day gambling or secure 10% at most. Unless you’re in that game and have an edge then it’s more iknow. Investing in markets for founders and ceos, should only be done with an edge or capital gains. Stop going for fking 10% at most. Also it’s not an asset in reality. \n\nPrivate equity or a subsidiary company of the current company and build an empire? \n\nInvesting in markets for people like you it’s stupid, iknow we all get the advice and iknow most want you to go through this. But the actuality unless you’re an employee or professional in the markets or have an edge. You should NOT do it. \n\nAssets also that’s gonna make the family happy and yourself in the process, they all want you to be happy and they want to be secure, right now? You need a purpose and stop gambling cause that’s how the women see it. They do not understand it, it’s gambling and they hate you see gambling away your success. \n\nAssets > normal advice (matrix shit)",

I have been struggling with moving from idea to producing because of doubt and wanting to do everything myself and make it perfect. I over analyze my decisions and cause delays, mainly because of my fear of failure and its possible impact on my family.  I have a lot of people depending on me and have been teetering on pushing my startup back a bit and getting a \"real job\" as has been mentioned by some family members.  But all of the people in this thread have been so empathetic and encouraging with great ideas. It makes me want to keep going! \nTo @BOWLeader- you are an inspiration! To hear your passion and what it has done for you is awesome. I'm sorry you've found yourself in a challenging spot. And it sounds like you've already conquered the hardest part which is being aware. And then taking the step towards fixing it. That's a place many never make it to. \nIf you do decide to mentor-my hand is raised :) But I also think self care is most important now.  I always wondered why there weren't more therapists that specialized in specifically helping people impacted by their career, in some way or another. Because when it's your passion-it affects your soul, that cannot be helped. \nI don't have any better advice than the more experienced people have given.  I'm a 50 yr old newborn entrepreneur. So I will just throw as much luck and blessing towards you as I can!",

Everyone uses tools like Cursor and Windsurf and our engineering velocity has at-latest doubled if not tripped over the last 1 year without adding new members! So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now.

People chase sexy tech ideas, but miss the goldmine in basic needs done consistently well.\n\n\n\nI saw something similar with a power washing business. One guy, a van, and a pressure washer. He specialized in driveways and decks in suburban neighborhoods. No website, just referrals. Booked 2 months out every spring and summer.\n\n\n\nWhy it works: Low barriers to entry, but high barriers to consistency. Most people start, do sloppy work, or don't show up. If you're reliable and do quality work, customers will pay premium and refer you endlessly.\n\n\n\nSame goes for specialized cleaning (hoods, solar panels), mobile detailing, handyman services. The secret isn't finding a \"gap\" - it's executing on the basics better than everyone else in your area.",

It later turned out she’s a massive narcissist with a long history of burning workplaces to the ground, not literally, obviously, but functionally.\n\nI left four months after she was hired. Not because of her, actually, I got a better offer. She’s still there three years later.

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Lives in a small town in northern WI. \n\nShe did this first as a way to get a free trip but makes decent (not great money) - would be perfect for a 2nd income for people with flexibility. These tours routes already exist. She lives in Northern Wisconsin. Trip #1 was Branson, MO. took her a while but found companies who put this all together.  She didn't put anything down but blocked a bus 9 months in advance. Went to every old person event in her town, neighboring towns, talked to senior groups, etc. They asked her what she got out of it - she got a free trip if she got 20 signups (true) but if the bus got over 40 (IIRC) everyone beyond that number was 50% profit to her.  Trip 1 she got like 30 people - and she didn't do a thing but enjoy the trip and helped wrangle people with the tour guide (college girl).  \nTrip 2 was easier as something like 75% of them who went before signed up with her again (following fall) and filled the bus. Trip #3 filled again.  Over time she built a network.  She gets about $10k/trip and does 2 trips in spring and fall. She also gets commission/referral to a travel agent that people use for Disney/Europe etc. Don't know exact numbers but was told she makes $60k annually, loves it and is grooming her daughter.  \n\nShe could probably do more if she spent some money on facebook ads to supplement her in-person visits.\n\nTyping this out has me wondering why I don't do it.",

The only reason why you think they don't complain about those tools because you have never had a friend who is an accountant or lawyer. \n\nI have a friend who is an accountant. I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises. There's 4000 different franchise concepts available. Many are not restaurants. \n\nGreg Isenberg launched ideabrowser. Everyday they post a business idea. They're always unique but once you read them you think \"yeah, he's right.\" Example from last week - building a database of where people are buried. It's a real problem. Not sexy.

It’s less about which channel is better and more about where your audience already is and how much trust is needed before they buy.

AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation.

      "text": "Looking back, I think we made a lot of early sales tooling decisions way too quickly.\n\n  \nWe started with the usual stack. A CRM, an email tool, a data provider, a couple automations glued together. At the time it felt fine, but as we grew it became obvious we were just stacking point solutions.\n\n\n\n  \nWe have since moved away from some of the early tools we picked and now rely more on workflows and orchestration. Tools like HubSpot stayed, some things like Apollo and Zapier got reduced or removed, and we started using Clay for research, enrichment, and tying data together. What tools did you start with, what did you outgrow, and what are you using now? Always looking to improve",

But none of them are going to teach your team how to isolate objections, do proper discovery, or actually differentiate from competitors. That's what drives revenue.\n\nSo before you go chasing the next tool, ask yourself this: can your team consistently close 30% of qualified leads?

I quit and started on my own.\n\nHalf of his logo design clients followed me, and now he has gone nuts. He wants them back, like I borrowed them or something.\n\nWhat do I do? I did not ask, call, or text any of his clients to come to me. They found me and came on their own. Am I in trouble?",

Post on LinkedIn that you've started something new. Let clients make the first move.

I’ve been doing it that way since I was 14.\n\nThe first thing anyone should do is sit down and write out all the skills they already have. Real skills. Things you know how to do that someone else would pay for. Most people underestimate this part.\n\nFor example, fixing computers. It sounds outdated, but even in 2026 it’s often cheaper to fix a slow computer or remove viruses than to buy a new one. People will gladly pay $100 to get their computer back running smoothly, and they’re happy when they get it back.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing with simple services. A friend of mine started a mobile oil change business using his mom’s van. He’d drop her off at work, post ads on Craigslist, and spend the day driving around changing oil. That was it. Four, five, sometimes six oil changes a day. It worked because people value convenience.\n\nThe point is, you don’t need capital to start. You use the skills you already have and the tools already around you. When I was 14, I used my parents’ lawnmower, walked door to door cutting grass, and reinvested until I had multiple mowers and help. Eventually, we had over 30 yards, and I sold the entire client list to a larger landscaping company for thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are opportunities everywhere. You just have to stop waiting for money, permission, or the “perfect idea,” and start being creative with what you already have.",

You find the right people just by being you and choosing the type of people you want to be around. Eventually you just meet the same type of people over and over. Just be of value. Learn digital marketing too. It's the best way to get yourself recurring income but don't sell Bullshit services. Give your clients solutions that work and grow their business. Age is just a number and raw action beats talent. In my opinion you need $0 to start a digital marketing service. In the US people charge $1200 for managing a social media account.

Not here is a day off, but take a long weekend on me, no Slack, no guilt. That one hit harder than cash.\n\nIf you want something tangible, give them choice plus context. For example, a meaningful budget with a note saying use this on something that makes your life easier outside work. Flights, gym membership, a course, childcare, whatever matters to them.\n\nThe common thread is this: make it personal and make it about trust, not productivity.

          "text": "I do elaborate scavenger hunts and parties with prizes for my team. It's honestly so much fun and is so great for team building. If your team is in person I can't recommend it enough, and if they're not then I would honestly arrange some sort of online scavenger hunt or trivia they can work together on. You can give them small, inexpensive prizes throughout and then like everyone else suggested a bonus at the end. \nThis does depend on your budget though. If you don't have the budget to give a decent chunk of change then give them a great experience to show you care.\n\n\nMy staff honestly works hard and despite how infuriating managing people can be, my income is because of them.\n\n\nHalloween this year I turned our business into a haunted house (I do this every year with a different theme/story). For our party I set up an elaborate scavenger hunt where a witch had put a curse on the business and they had to work together to find parts of an incantation they could use to summon the witch who cursed us and vanquish her. Lights out, only lit by electronic tea lights which they had to form into a circle and stand inside of to summon the witch once they found all the parts of the incantation. I had my dad and a friend dress up in some gnarly/hideous witch costumes and scare them. Used blue tooth speakers and some animatronics along the way. Last year it was my BIL hiding in the furnace room with a mask and a machete. Hearing them scream honestly just warms my heart every year. It's honestly so cathartic and they have SO much fun and talk about it with all of our clients and their friends and family.\n\n\nI skipped Christmas this year because everyone was sick but I was going to have a krampus come in and scare them. Saving it for next year.\n\n\nValentines is on the 7th and I'm doing a high tea for them, dress code is the fancier, the better. I've designed a giant galentine's (we're all women) board game for them which is actually coming along and will be so good! They work through toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, women's health and social issues (just board game spaces, not actually and I've kept it funny and unserious) and at the end of the game, the last square is \"Self Actualization\". To get there they have to roll dice, square off in trivia and activities like flip cup, summon each other for help with scavenger tasks where they can all work together to advance on the board.\n\n\nThe board game pieces are instax photos of them that will be taken when they arrive for the party. Small prizes like chocolates and lip gloss, hair clips etc...throughout the game and the winner gets a teddy bear, heart earings, and a tote bag. \n\n\nI share all this because I AM SO EXCITED for it but also because it will cost around $500 and be a great party. It's a team of 10 right now and a $50 cash bonus would really just be lame, so for them this is much more fun with the budget. It gets everyone talking about the business in a fun and positive way. People who don't work for me keep trying to get invites but we are excluuuusive!\n\nTeam does $40k - $50k monthly. If you're creative you can honestly still put something fun together on a scrappy budget. I'm all up in the dollar store for these things.\n\nEditing to add that I also had a fortune teller come in for the Halloween party and do tarot readings for them! Also doing mini photoshoots at the Galentine's party 🥳",

Now it’s expensive, slow, and doesn’t guarantee anything, so of course people feel regret. That doesn’t mean college is useless, it just means it’s situational. If you want a regulated profession or a credentialed career, it still makes sense. If you want speed, optionality, or to build something on your own, it’s often the wrong move.\n\nSide hustling being so common feels less like ambition and more like survival. Wages haven’t kept up, rent is insane, and people are forced to stack income just to breathe. That’s not some entrepreneurial awakening, it’s a response to pressure. The mistake is pretending everyone should pick one lane at 18 when most people don’t even know how money works yet.\n\nThe advice probably needs to change from do this one thing to design your own path. Learn a skill that compounds, keep your costs low, avoid locking yourself into massive debt early, and stay flexible. College can be part of that, but it shouldn’t be sold as a golden ticket anymore. It’s just one tool, not the plan.",

My main focus is renovating kitchens and bathrooms (doing it for more than 10 years). Have a small team that I've been working with since the very beginning (we were employed together and decided to leave together), and a few more teams that I hired relatively recently.\n\nAt first, attracting customers was not an issue - word of mouth and contacts from my previous job took care of that, but then we realized that we couldn't grow that way.  \nTo solve that we created a website and started social media accounts, but that didn't help much, so we resorted to the services of SEO and SMM specialists. There were some results, but nothing impressive. Something else caught our attention: many customers said they found us in AI search results when they asked for recommendations on who to contact for repairs in California (we are based here). We didn't understand what was going on, but then it dawned on us - some articles from our website were randomly appearing in neural network search results.\n\nHere's my question: how does AI visibility optimization work? Is it possible to influence it in any way? Is it ethical?\n\nAnd this brings up another topic: how much sense does it make to focus specifically on AI SEO optimization to increase LLM brand visibility, instead of classic SEO? Is classic SEO dead in 2026?\n\nIn general, I was very impressed by how many people say they found us in ChatGPT, and now I want to figure it out, but don't understand how it works or where to start.\n\nSorry if my post is too confusing.

Trying to deliberately get into AI search results is a lost cause, because no one can tell you for sure how the algorithms work, so I advise you not to worry about it and just write good articles and content, as the commenter above suggested.\n\n3. Perhaps there are companies that specialize purely in this, but it seems to me that most of them do not understand how it works themselves.",

But there’s a ton of BS out there promising quick wins through tactics that’ll likely backfire as models get smarter at detecting manipulation.\n\nThere is overlap with SEO fundamentals including good consistent and relevant content across all your platforms. The main difference is AI models can conceptually understand what you actually offer in ways search engines couldn’t. They’re reading your content, understanding context, and making recommendations based on relevance not just keyword matching and backlinks.\n\nThat being said there are a few good tools and resources \n\nProfound: This is the most capable automated platform in terms of AI visibility + content creation but the most expensive \n\nWerkHaus.ai: Has free tools and resources so understand AI visibility and GEO they also offer consulting. Good starting point to learn the space.  \n\nSEMrush: This is the biggest especially in the Agency world they have been around almost 20 years. That being said AI visibility is a product they offer but not their main focus",
