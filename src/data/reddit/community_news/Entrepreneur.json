      "text": "Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

I asked her to start small by throwing away five pairs, thinking this was a manageable goal that could lead to momentum in cleaning up the rest of their home. \n\nWrong.  She has made every excuse under the sun for why she couldn’t spare any time to this task.  I remind her every time we speak. That was two years ago. \n\nNow consider they have a 3500 sq ft home.  Every room has its storage depleted with her stuff that she doesn’t use.  \n\nUnfortunately I believe nothing will be cleared until after she passes.",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n> Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

From a marketing standpoint, building trust is going to be the most important thing. People, especially elders, don't always feel comfortable letting a stranger into their home to go through their stuff.

However, some of the comments were very disturbing.  \n\nSome people appreciate the ability to help their aging parents while some look at it as a debilitating problem.  I felt a sense of joy to help my grandparents when I had any opportunity.  Especially when I realized the joy and way they invested into me.  That has quickly become a thing of the past.  Some cultures honor and really care for the aging whilst some look at it as a burdensome calculation (as I see in the feed).  I never had children so I won’t have to hear  someone tell me why I shouldn’t have what I have.  I am getting rid of a lot of things now. My things of value already with a destination in mind and it’s good to see this post to really understand the magnitude of giving and to whom.",

If you really wanted to squeeze the juice, you could set up a sister company with a similarly-minded partner that then flips whatever they part ways with that isn’t garbage. Again, a win-win since it’s good for sustainability repurposing items instead of sending them to the dump, and it’s mostly profit with your clients paying you for inventory that you then get paid again to sell.

It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly.

He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before.

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

Just because it doesn't feel like \"so difficult it's worth 500$\" doesn't mean that's the case: it's \"easy\" because you've got a skill, one which your CEO wasn't able to fill until now. That has value.\n\nBy the way, people learn by doing first and foremost, if there was no struggle in it you wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nDon't accept an advance in my opinion - there's nothing worse than trying to retroactively meet an objective just because they already paid you and you owe it to them; start working, and if after a month or two it's too difficult foor you, just explain it and part ways. But I think you have talent and this is a great opportunity.\n\n--------\n\nTo not negatively affect mission critical business data, **it's very important you research best practices**. Always back up data before you modify it for your tests; even afterwards keep the backups in case you sneak in an error you didn't notice. Learn about proper testing methodology to detect errors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, test driven development.\n\nI could go on forever, but really learn what are the best practices in whatever you do, they are your friend and they exist for a good reason.\n\nFor workflow automation software, I used make.com in the past and it was nice, and also recently n8n has gotten lots of hype.",

Explain the service, but not the process... do not give away your gems to your competition.\n\nNow, you are wondering what amount is good for a monthly retainer?\n\nPerhaps you want to start with them on a piece meal basis ... perhaps for less money than a retainer?\n\nI think you need to understand the motivation of the owner paying you.  They like you.  They want to see you succeed for years to come.  The retainer offer may be too much for the work you actually do, but then the owner may like you, and want you do even more, like expand your services for their website into other areas than product representation.\n\nIt is up to you to come up with those ideas.  And bounce them off the owner.\n\nWhat I would not do yet, is go to his direct competition and offer the same.  Why?  That may end your retainer too soon.\n\nStart reading web sites that tell you how to grow this business of yours.  Ask an AI... of course.\n\nAnd congrats.  Your story is quite heart warming.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

If you're this nervous, what I would do is come up with a plan for the business owner to pay for Terms-of-Work:  Negotiate \"I will automate X process for Y dollars\" and then only get paid when you are done.  He sees you as a much cheaper solution than an adult, and he's right about that, you also need to set his expectations as a gifted teenager who is still in the learning process.\n\nGood luck, and pursue this!  It can lead to a great career with such a good resume piece under your belt that you helped maximize a business' efficiency!",

That way you have less ties, and work on a project basis rather than have a monthly fee irrespective of the work they ask you to do\n\n2. Also, if 500USD is a lot, consider doing stuff like asking 500USD for a task, and outsourcing it to someone else for like 200-300USD. That way would be good in the long term capacity and finance wise",

I can amend a little existing code but to tell me to code from scratch id be lost. \n\nExcel is a powerful tool itself, look into power query, learn the syntax of formulas, experiment with different functions in the formulas, play a little with macros for automation\n\nyou can record macros to start so the macro will repeat what you did every time its initiated. From there play with the existing code and see the stuff you can start getting it to do.

I've had a store with a small fraction of the monthly volume you describe have multiple chargebacks in a small time period and never had an issue with Shopify. \n\nI agree that any platform is inherently untrustworthy, but it seems unlikely that just 1 chargeback triggered some algorithmic threshold on your store that shut it down even temporarily.",

You had a supportive partner who handled domestic labor so you could work 80 hour weeks. You had unpaid interns. You used infrastructure others built. You benefited from an education system. You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nWas on my couch last night playing grizzly's quest while reading another \"self-made\" success story on my laptop. Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

Also, we actively reject developers without experience, especially recent graduates, because they are so useless, and Universities are not giving students an OOBE to the business market.  I don't know how Universities are teaching, but it is not working at all.  Plus, some students from the top universities think they deserve a leadership position without previous experience.",

The “I built this alone” narrative often resonates because it simplifies complexity into a story that’s easy to tell. It doesn’t reflect reality. Most successes are built on networks of support, systems, mentors, community infrastructure, and the ecosystem that makes opportunity possible.\n\n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said for the personal agency in execution. Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate? Is it about resource constraints? Autonomy of decision? Ego? Or something else?",

First off, I grew up relatively poor on a farm.  We weren't starving, but there was no financial help from my parents at any point in my adult life. As a matter of fact, it was me who was paying my parents bills when they got older. Couldn't afford college, so none of those connections. I went to work in the trades and spent 20 years learning the business and  living well below my means to save money \n\nWhen I say I built this alone, what I mean is that every step along the way the bucked stopped with me.  There were no loans, no partners, no backing, every dime was my money that I spent 20 years working and doing  without to raise.  Every piece of equipment, every stick of material, every dime paid for every service along the way has my sweat on it. Every decision, every bid, every success and failure have my fingerprints on them.\n\nMost importantly, from the beginning until today, if it all falls apart the consequences are all on me. I have never risked anything that wasn't mine to gamble. I never spent a dime of my wife's money, never used our joint accounts, and never dipped in to our household budget.  Nobody besides me loses anything if my business fails.\n\nOf course I've outsourced things. Of course I have employees. Of course they are vital to my business.  But they aren't here to help me grow my business.  They are here because I treat them fairly, have an awesome benefits package, and pay almost double the local rate for this work. Their positions are a result of my business growing from the risks I took to start and grow. I did that part on my own, with no guarantees and no safety nets.",

That’s real, and it matters.\n\n\nWhere I think the “no one is self-made” argument comes in isn’t to dismiss that, it’s to separate financial independence from human independence. None of us operate in a vacuum. \n\n\nPrinciples, work ethic, skills, and even what not to do usually come from somewhere, parents, tradesmen, early bosses, community, or hard lessons learned watching others fail.\nSo when people say “no man is an island,” I hear it less as a financial claim and more as a recognition that execution happens inside systems, cultural, educational, and relational, even when the risk and responsibility are borne by one person.\n\n\nI think both things can be true at the same time without canceling each other out",

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it? Being here in the comments, or with your friends, or even with other entrepreneurs saying, “I built all this with no help” - what is the value? \n\nReal question: is the value the motivation from the dopamine hit of pride/self-esteem? I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it.

What’s usually missing from those “built it alone” stories is the invisible infrastructure: legal systems, stable currencies, internet, prior research, emotional labour from others. Even the ability to take risks often comes from having some form of safety net. Ignoring that doesn’t make the story more inspiring - it just makes people feel broken for needing help. Building things is rarely solo. Credit just tends to be.",

For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money. I rather outsource than spend way too much time on something that I can pay someone to do it better than I can.",

Its not her fault if my business fails, she gets paid regardless.  She's not helping to grow my business, she is performing a service that I pay for.  To me, its like giving credit for growing my business to the cashier at the gas station where my trucks fuel up.

An accountant, if you are not paying attention to what they are doing, they can easily ruin your business. Especially at the early stages of a business. Starting a business is not for the weak. But anybody that has assisted you that you can focus on that business without minor or even huge everyday stress, that is significant help.\nI’m not saying that every single person has to get credit, but claiming self made gives people the illusion that they have to do everything on their own.\n“Because of my great team, I was able to focus on the big picture”\n“Because of my amazing partner who took care of the household, they were able to handle our everyday stressors and I could focus on providing for my family”\n“A family member left me inheritance money and I had enough cushion to focus on solely my business for six months without having to work a full time job”\n\n Nobody talks about the support system that got them there and if they did, I think there would be less failed businesses because they would get the proper channels to be successful.\n\nIt’s like a college football player or basketball player. If they suck at academics, they can’t play if they don’t have gpa right. So they have tutors for their classwork and coaches that help them with their game. How do you know if you’re getting better if someone from the sidelines doesn’t help you fix your game?\nEveryone looks at things different but I understand OPs frustration.

The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users.

The thing is that if you could automate the proces of \"looking for\" the places, and start focusing more on \"how to join\", you'll be doing a better work. The same goes with AI.

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction.

Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice.

You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this.

What helped me eventually was realizing that the uncertainty never really goes away, but you can build systems to contain it. I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing. Also started planning each day the night before and putting everything on my calendar instead of keeping endless to-do lists floating around in my head creating more anxiety.\n\n\n\nThe loneliness part is real too and having someone to bounce ideas off of, even if they can't give you definitive answers, makes a huge difference in staying sane through all the uncertainty.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

      "text": "I have been working in AI/Data Science and startups since 2003 and for the last couple of years I can see the shift is coming, and it is both exciting and very bothering. Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

Why not just start selling it small around $1-$10 in a small website and take it from there? Well, I guess you'd have to do this as a side gig to your day job, where people raising capital may be doing nothing else besides this?\n\n\nWhen you say sell it, you mean sell it like I described or like when instagram sold to Facebook kind of selling?",

A race to the bottom for generic, easily copied offerings, and a smaller group that survives by being closer to real-world constraints, customers, or physical systems. That’s probably why unsexy and physical products feel more attractive right now. They’re harder to fake, harder to clone, and harder to undercut overnight.\n\nIt feels less like the end of entrepreneurship and more like the end of “easy” entrepreneurship.

But for someone like me who is doing a multi country ug programme @ tetr college and actually running a D2C brand, nothing feels passive. You’re constantly dealing with shipments, customers, suppliers, creatives, inventory, and tomorrow’s problems. Even when things look “stable,” your brain is still working in the background. There is no passive. There is only **active now** and **active later**. Most so-called passive income is just income where the hard work happened earlier. During the building phase, it’s never passive. The moment you stop paying attention, something breaks, ads drop, suppliers slip, customers churn, platforms change the rules. Honestly, the only income that comes close to being truly passive is rent from real estate, and even that isn’t fully hands-off unless you outsource everything. So I’m curious.\n\nIs there any other income that’s genuinely passive? Or are we just dressing up delayed effort with a nicer name? What do you think?",

Everyone uses tools like Cursor and Windsurf and our engineering velocity has at-latest doubled if not tripped over the last 1 year without adding new members! So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now.

Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

But none of them are going to teach your team how to isolate objections, do proper discovery, or actually differentiate from competitors. That's what drives revenue.\n\nSo before you go chasing the next tool, ask yourself this: can your team consistently close 30% of qualified leads?

But is it too much to ask for tools that grow as the same pace as we do, or even faster than us, to solve our problems.  I do believe that a good roadmap of how you project the business to look in the future helps with things like this, because you're able to incorporate and use these systems (whichever system you prefer) at a level of \"I'm building this now and I know it is going to grow and I will add these in the future.  Let me make sure I get a system to handle the future vision.\"  Nothing's worse than those hour-long calls, and days wasted transitioning from system to system.",

So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation. It will collapse, and from the rubble will rise the actual consumer usecase... Just like the internet bubble.",

It’s less about which channel is better and more about where your audience already is and how much trust is needed before they buy.

Instead of churning 7 mediocre posts a week, we're seeing better results from brands that post 3-4 times with actual depth and spend the rest on distribution and engagement.\n\nWe've moved away from strict volume metrics. The clients doing best treat each post like it needs to earn its spot, not just fill a calendar. Content to distribution ratio has flipped hard, prolly 40/60 now when it used to be the opposite. AI made baseline content cheaper which means you need a stronger angle or voice to stand out. The brands cutting through use AI for speed but layer in actual perspective that only comes from doing the work. Quality over quantity isn't new advice but it's finally non negotiable tbh.\n\nEdit : Typos",

Repeated payslip errors and slow replies are red flags, not “Spain being Spain.” Same with medical checks falling through the cracks. Someone should clearly own that. Local payroll plus local accounting often breaks down once you’re a foreign company. The two vendors don’t really coordinate, and when something’s wrong, you end up chasing both. That’s usually where the frustration comes from. If you want fewer moving parts, an EOR can help. The main upside is accountability. One provider owns payroll, taxes, compliance, and admin, so you’re not stuck mediating. I haven’t run Spain myself with Remote People, but I’ve heard solid feedback from HR managers who did. Mostly about things being calmer month to month, fewer mistakes, and faster responses. Not perfect, but better than juggling locals. So yes, it makes sense to rethink the setup. Ask any provider very directly how they handle errors and response times. That’ll tell you a lot.",

              "text": "> Hollywood is dying\n\nHollywood has been dying since it started. I would prefer specifics to general statements. The old method of making movies is dying off, I'd say, but only partially. The physical necessity of being on location in California to find actors and make movies is pretty much done. The rise of AI and other 3rd party platforms (Netflick, Youtube, and other internet platforms) does lessen the 'path' through Hollywood.\n\n\nBut people still are making movies, shows, hiring actors, making effects. So maybe starting your own part of the old system is the path forward. An example of this is Reese Witherspoon: she started a book club and has 1st right to book options that can be made into movies, based on her book club's feedback: essentially, crowd-sourcing film scripts. A24 was started in 2012, focused just on interesting films and directors Hollywood seemed to have ignored, and turned into a tour-de-force, putting out interesting projects every year. Maybe something similar for TV shows can be done? Or Youtube? I know Netflix is trying, but they have so much money it's actually causing them to cancel shows earlier in their prime rather than suffer through declining ratings. That's an issue that needs a fix.",

The old gatekeepers have lost their stranglehold on these industries and it’s no longer required to go through them to get your creative work in front of the masses. \n\nI’m a commissioned documentary filmmaker and I was able to get my first direct to audience (self funded) title in front of millions of people across multiple platforms. That previously was impossible under the old system. \n\nThis is occurring as the costs to produce said work have diminished greatly, again, another barrier of entry that’s been unblocked. \n\nThis isn’t unique to just filmmaking, it’s entertainment as a whole. While many of my peers act like the sky is falling because they’re losing comfy gigs on tv shows and movies, I see it as the best opportunity of our lifetime if you’re willing to take the leap and have the chops to entertain, educate, and attract attention.",

You can easily page up and down, and it's obvious what is a reply to what. It's obvious who is saying what and what date/time they said it. It's easy to expand/collapse. And all this is reasonably easy on both a computer and mobile. \n\nNow you imagine this as an email chain. This relatively simple thread becomes a nightmare to navigate. There is no way to keep track of what you are supposed to be reading, who's replying to whom, and if there are multiple replies to one of the emails that branch into their own conversations, it's literally impossible to keep track of. Plus your inbox is flooded, with emails that only contain part of the conversation. Are you looking at the email with the whole conversation? Or only part? You got a reply, but are they replying to an email with the whole conversation? Or are they replying to an incomplete email? Trick question. They are all incomplete because there is no central repository tracking the exchange as a single conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has email. You make a contact all the way across the world? They have email. Random customer who has a product question? Email. Communicating across multiple departments that don't share a Slack/Teams/Basecamp ecosystem? Well they all have email.\n\nGoogle tools and AI won't solve this. No two-word answer will.

Processes meant to impress instead of work. “Good enough” turned out to be a superpower.\n\nYour insight about removal is dead on.

I just have written out to me and deposited into my business account. I didn't get an LLC until about 5 years ago and and I didn't have business insurance until about 3:00 so I kind of dragged my feet on doing this. But I've always been making money with the business but it was always kind of a here or there thing really. The last 3 years was when I took it very seriously and it's really starting to scale and I made a lot of connections and I feel it's very professional but I had a lot of time where I could test stuff, work it out and just go slow with everything. So I would just say the hardest part is getting started and making money and then as that goes you can always refine it tweak it. Adjust it later",
