      "text": "So i started my agency about 2 years ago focused on brand strategy and visual identity, the whole package, deep discovery sessions, custom positioning, the works. That was the vision, thats what i built everything around.\n\nAbout 8 months in i threw in a basic \"brand refresh\" package almost as an afterthought, like a lower entry point for people who werent ready to commit to the full thing. No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week. I genuinely thought it was a filler offer.\n\nFast forward to now and that \"filler\" package accounts for almost 70% of my revenue. The thing i spent months obsessing over barely moves.\n\nHad some money from Stаke saved going into this year which gave me the breathing room to actually sit with this instead of just panicking and restructuring everything. And what i realized is the market doesnt care about what you think your best work is, it cares about what solves their problem fast.\n\nStill not sure if i lean fully into the boring offer and let the premium stuff be a side thing, or if i keep pushing the original vision hoping the positioning catches up.",

Then added a basic alerting integration almost as an afterthought. Guess which one every customer actually used.\n\nThe boring stuff wins because it solves an immediate pain point. Your brand refresh is probably what people are actually searching for when they realize their logo looks dated or their site feels off. The full strategy package is what they think they might need eventually.\n\nIf the cash flow is there, Id just ride it. Keep the premium offer alive for the occasional client who wants it, but optimize around what's working. You can always reposition later when you have more runway.\n\nbtw if you're not already tracking where these brand refresh leads are coming from, worth setting up some kind of monitoring. I use hazelbase to watch reddit and twitter for when people mention needing design work or talk about rebrands. Lot easier than guessing what marketing actually works.",

Most companies have woefully insufficient marketing budgets.  If they do have the budget, time, and energy to pay for a premium package, they will go pay a premium agency to build it.  You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?  That's an offer people will take, even from a market newcomer, because the alternative is to have Joe from Sales try to draw the new logo, and you are definitely better than Joe from Sales.\n\nIn time, with lots of happy customers whose brands are enhanced, some will become very successful and need more from you, and you will also develop a reputation that wins you more of the premium business.",

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Listen to it. Your \"vision\" offer can be the upsell for people who come in through the boring one.

They have high expectations, vague success criteria, and high churn when reality doesn't match the pitch. The boring offer attracts clients who want a specific, measurable outcome. They're easier to retain because you can actually hit the target.\n\nThe economics usually follow: boring offer = lower price but higher volume, faster close, lower CAC, lower churn. Premium offer = higher ticket but longer sales cycle, more scope creep, harder to systematize.\n\nThe uneasy feeling is real though. There's an identity thing where building the interesting offer felt like growth and building the boring offer feels like settling. But operationally the boring offer is usually the better business. You can systematize it, hire around it, build it without being in every engagement.\n\nMost successful agencies eventually realize the boring, repeatable offering IS the business - and the custom high-end work is the loss leader that builds reputation.",

What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

If you're using it as a tactic but still pushing, people feel it. The times it works best is when you genuinely believe your product isn't for everyone and you say so. The prospect self-selects and sells themselves.\n\nI do something similar with my product. The landing page basically says 'this is for small teams with 5+ SaaS tools.'

      "text": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

(Virtually all salespeople do this, I imagine probably because they're trying to qualify me as a prospect.  Trust me, I would _not_ have a 10 minute conversation about toner supply management if I didn't have a real toner supply management problem.  But maybe other people will waste your time like this?  Seems unlikely, but it's a funny old world.)\n\nAlso, unrelated to the current discussion, but I just want to say that if you expect me to tell you a budget before you'll tell me a price, you could be Jesus himself selling literal salvation and I still won't be buying it.",

But even now, cold calls arent highly effective (as tracked close rate percentages always demonstrate) and they will never not be abrasive. I think they key to using calls to generate business requires a clever and effective sales/marketing hybrid approach that qualifies leads and generates consultative, warm-calls. The more of these your firm generates, the more calls your sales team can make. More criticaly, instead of knowing nothing about them, salespeople can act as a guide (and a catalyst) towards finding solutions your firm offers that help with your prospect's challenges. \n\nThe corporate avg is typically stated that around 5% of cold calls generate revenue (or so my last couple employers used to state) Thus, old school mentality was to get your sales to call, call, call!! To me, that just meant 95% of my time (and later, my team's time) was inefficiently spent. Later, as VP of Sales, I arranged to regularly collaborate with marketing and product to ensure our solutions were getting in front of the right eyes, the product regularly evolved to meet or exceed expectations and our sales team was then getting warm leads to follow up as helpful consultants and not high-pressure closers. Getting the process to a place where it became truly effective took time (about 6mo) with much back and forth. Along the way we discovered roadblocks in all areas, marketing, sales and product which we then tweaked and refined. Ultimately we grew flat sales to +35% (Year 1) and +45% (year 2). \n\nCold calling is a blunt-force approach and DOES have its place in the very early days but, this should rather quickly be evolved around a more strategic business plan to capture new customers and revenue. \n\n",

What actually matters is who you're calling.  I've found that calling the right person (owner, decision maker) with a mediocre opener beats calling the wrong person with a perfect opener every time.\n\nThe pattern interrupt works because it's honest.  People respect that.  But honestly, if you're calling a gym owner who books online and you lead with \"I can help you get more customers through Google,\" they're listening regardless of your opener.   \n\nThe LinkedIn follow-up thing, though, that's the real win.  It's not about the call anymore; it's about being persistent without being annoying.  Seeing your name twice in 5 minutes signals you're serious.  \n\n",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

I have to constantly remind myself; especially now that I'm back in university and building a startup simultaneously, that the business is an experiment, not a judgment on my character. :)\n\nIf I tie my self-worth to the MRR graph, I’m on an emotional roller coaster I can’t survive (I feel). Learning to be 'okay' even when the business is broken is the only superpower that keeps me in the game! 🦸‍♂️",

Advisors, peers in founder communities, even competitors you respect.

The difference was speed of decision. First pivot we debated for 6 months. Second pivot we decided in a week.\n\nThe self-care point is underrated. I ignored it for years and paid for it.

I burned out twice before I finally got it.\n\nI'd add a fourth that took me way too long to learn: Build systems, not just hustle. Early on I thought grinding harder was always the answer. But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Better than losing your money to something you don't understand.\n\n\nHere's the easiest investment you can make:\n\n\n- Open up a Roth IRA with Fidelity or Vanguard.\n\n\n- Also open up a regular taxable brokerage account with either.\n\n\n- Add the maximum amount of money for the year to your Roth IRA ($7500 for 2026).\n\n\n- Buy a target date retirement fund for roughly the year you'd like to retire (Vanguard VTTSX-2060 or VFIFX-2050, Fidelity FFFHX-2050 or FDKLX-2060).\n\n\n- Repeat the same with your taxable brokerage account. Put in as much money as you want, buy the same fund.\n\n\n- Keep adding money to the funds as often as you want. For the Roth, you can't put in more than $7500/year, but no limits on the brokerage. Buy nothing else. You can literally just keep adding money to the exact same target date funds and never do anything else.\n\n\n- Target date funds invest everything for you. They buy and sell various stocks and bonds and they rebalance based on how close you are to retirement. When you're young, they'll have more money in stocks and move away from them as you get older. The beauty though is you do nothing, just keep adding money to them.\n\n\nThat's it. Congratulations you will outperform almost all other investors.",

Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, your bank, or whatever preferred platform you want to use. Roth IRAs tax the money when it goes in, not when it comes out at or after age 65. That's best, because it gets taxed before the balance grows, so you pay less. Again, put it into an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nMax out your 401(k) contribution up to the amount that your employer will match, either total or partial. Again, allocate it to an index fund.\n\nAfter that, the easiest thing to do is to put the remaining chunk that you want to invest into an index fund through Fidelity or similar.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't invest in anything other than index funds unless you're really hardcore, and even then, it probably isn't worth it lol",

Then work for for someone for at least 2 years\n\n\nI've spent time at the SBA ( specifically small businesses development association) and you would be surprised at how many businesses fail in under a year because they are undercapitalized or not familiar enough with business operations.\n\n\nMaybe 1/10  of these kind of people succeeded and the rest wiped out their life savings. Having an extra  50-100k would have helped them stay in business just long enough to maybe be successful. That + business knowledge pushes survival to 8/10 over 3 years IME. \n\n\nEdit: I also want to note that depending on the area (I'm assuming 714 is SoCal) rents can be insanely expensive for businesses. \n\n\nFor Esthianians, barbers, accountants, massage, etc... What I've often seen work is people working for someone else, building a client base, \"renting a booth\" (or the equivalent. For music producers it would be a studio space) and THEN starting their own business.\n\n\nThis is especially true for people in the beauty/physical realm, since the large amount of turnover means your meeting future potential employees/co-owners/lesees. \n\n\nThere's a few people I've met who after working in the industry for 5-10 yrs opened there own shop and within 2 years opened a second, because of how deep their rolladex of contacts was. ",

Almost everyone who comes to r/Entrepreneur to ask for advice is asking about something that has been discussed extensively. That's just the bell curve that is real life. Most problems are typical problems.\n\nIn your case, I think you should consider that **your current job is your passive income**. Because if you're saving 75%+ of your income, then you are already halfway there: you just went backwards. The trope of the successful entrepreneur is:\n\n1. Come up with working business idea  \n2. Have plenty of money with little effort\n\n[You did the opposite. ](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-20-2017/_IufW-.gif) Step 2 is done, so now it's on to step 1.\n\nGetting your aesthetician license is a great idea, especially if you can stay full-time. It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans. Hang out in forums like this one. \n\nCongrats! And good luck.",

              "text": "Aww I’m sorry 😞 \nwanna hear something crazy? About a year ago I had one of my maintenance worker quit due to health reasons and his age.. His job title was to clean three properties. He would start at 8 AM and be done by 1 PM latest. Just picking up trash and making sure the property was clean. That’s it. And 80% of the time the properties were always clean because people pick up after themselves. So the dude would get to go home early if he was finished. And since he lived on site at one of the properties, we gave him a huge discount on his rent. About $800 off. And I believe the position paid $19 an hour (not great, but not bad either for the little work you do). Well, my cousin‘s girlfriend was looking for a job and she lives with my cousin at one of the properties I manage. They currently pay about $2000 for a one bedroom one bath.\n\nI told her that he quit and that she should apply immediately with my company. At the time, she wasn’t working and was looking for a job. She could definitely benefit from the rental discount PLUS, she could be done with work at 1 PM and the rest of the day could be spent doing something else or another part-time job... Well, she never took me up on that offer. And now she’s working 12 hour shifts at T-Mobile making minimum wage. I don’t understand how someone could turn down an $800 rental discount plus the decent pay. She never even told me why she didn’t want the job. She would just say “oh okay” any time I’d mention it. I even told her that there was plenty of opportunity for her to move up in the company. And I was right. A couple months later, one of our leasing agents quit and the position was available. I would’ve been able to train her and the job would’ve been hers. Knowing the owner, he would’ve allowed me to train her.",

Since you're starting aesthetician school, consider digital services that complement that path - maybe skincare consulting, beauty content creation, or even a beauty subscription box. Your property management background actually gives you valuable operational skills that most beauty entrepreneurs lack. Start small with something that leverages your existing knowledge while you're in school. The key is picking ONE thing and validating demand before you invest heavily.

Pick ONE problem you understand.\n\nNot 'e-commerce' broadly.Something specific. For me, I noticed developers struggle with resumes so I built a tool for that.\n\n2. Build something small that solves it. Doesn't need to be perfect. Just works.\n\n3. Talk to the people who have that problem. Reddit is great for this actually.\n\n4. Improve based on what they tell you.\n\nThe people travelling the world didn't get there overnight. They just started somewhere and kept going.\n\nAlso, aesthetician school + salon owner is a legit path too. Maybe there's even a way to combine both like a tool for salon owners? Just thinking out loud.\n\nHappy to share more if helpful. Good luck either way",

It sounds like you haven’t been making $9k/month for very long. \n\nIf I had to start over from your position this is what I would do. \n\nKeep your expenses low. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing as long as you can. Save up $150k-$250k or as close to it as you can. It’s gonna take you about 4 years. Based on your line of questioning, you may have shiny object syndrome. The “business” is the shiny object. If you can’t save up that amount in 4 years at $9k/month then take a look at your lifestyle and budget better to save money wherever possible. Live on $50k and invest $50k into the S&P or some index per year. \n\nFor now, don’t try to start a salon business from scratch. Buy one that’s already profitable with the money you save up. But don’t cash out your investments, use it as collateral to buy the business. Go do your own research for buying a business, seller financing is popular these days.\n\nBefore you buy a beauty salon, get a job in one to learn how it works. Buy one that’s been profitable for a good enough time frame, for me that would be 5 years minimum. \n\nThe reason you buy one is because it’s gonna cost you a lot to start up, and a lot of time and risk. If you get into the business and you find out that it’s not for you, you can sell it and get your money back because it was a profitable asset when you bought it.\n\nI was taught this by a former client who buys businesses, holds them, and sells them, for a living. Personally, I wish I took that route. It would’ve saved me a lot of pain and tears. Goodluck.",

I never truly validated the idea with real people. I built something based on my assumptions instead of actual customer needs.\n\nNow running a second business that's profitable, I approach everything differently.\n\nHere are the key changes that saved me:\n\n* Interview at least 30 to 50 potential customers before any serious development.\n* Launch a bare bones MVP as quickly as possible to test demand.\n* Prioritize sales and customer feedback from week one, not perfection.\n\nIf you're just starting or in the early stages, please don't repeat my mistake. Validate early and often.\n\nWhat was the toughest lesson you learned in your entrepreneurial journey?",

Not because the interviews give you a perfect roadmap, but because they reveal assumptions you didn't even know you were making.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: pay attention to what people are currently doing to solve the problem, not just whether they say they'd use your product. If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

Be genuine, not salesy. Something like \"Hey, I'm researching [problem]. Would you be open to a 15 minute chat? No pitch, just trying to understand the space better.\"\n\nLinkedIn works well too, especially for B2B. Filter by job title and industry, then send connection requests with a short note about your research.\n\nThe other underrated move is posting in relevant communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack groups) asking people to share their experience with the problem. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to talk when you frame it as learning, not selling.\n\nStart with 5. Once you get comfortable with the format, the next 25 come much easier.",

I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

So when you show up genuinely and help without pitching, trust builds fast and inbound comes naturally.\n\nForum answers and threads actively looking for solutions.

Not traditional SEO, but making sure your brand shows up when people ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini questions in your space.\n\nMost entrepreneurs are still fighting over Google page one while a growing chunk of their audience is getting answers from AI tools instead. The playbook is different too. It's less about keywords and backlinks, more about being the authoritative source that AI models pull from. That means detailed, well-structured content that actually answers specific questions in your niche.\n\nWe noticed this shift when we started tracking where our inbound leads were coming from. A surprising number said they found us through an AI assistant recommendation, not a Google search. Once we started creating content specifically designed to be cited by LLMs, the organic traffic from that channel grew faster than anything we were doing on traditional search.\n\nThe other one I'd add is community-led content on niche platforms. Not posting your own stuff, but genuinely participating in conversations where your customers already hang out. The trust you build from being helpful in those spaces converts way better than any paid ad.",

You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled.

Clear availability rules. Defined swap policies so employees handle swaps themselves within boundaries.\n\nSecond, delegate ownership. Even one trusted team lead per location who handles first level schedule issues can cut your involvement dramatically.\n\nThird, tighten policies. Last minute chaos often comes from vague rules. Clear deadlines for time off requests and swap approvals reduce back and forth.\n\nThis stage is common, but if you keep absorbing all the coordination yourself, it will only grow heavier as you scale.\n\nYou are not doing something wrong.

          "text": "This isn't a hot take. It's the same cliché flipped upside down.\n\n\"Corporate jobs are safe\" is a myth. Agreed. But \"entrepreneurs control their destiny\" is equally romantic. You don't control the market. You don't control your customers' decisions. You don't control the economy, the timing, or whether someone with more resources builds the same thing faster. You traded one type of uncertainty for another and called it freedom.\n\nThe real question isn't which path is riskier. It's which kind of risk you're equipped to handle, and whether you've thought honestly about why you're choosing it. \"I want control\" sounds empowering until you realize most new businesses don't fail because the founder lacked control. They fail because the founder didn't know what to build, who to build it for, or why it mattered beyond revenue.\n\nAnd the conspiracy angle at the end weakens an otherwise interesting conversation. \"Media wants us to stay employees\" isn't critical thinking. It's just suspicion wearing the costume of insight. The real reason most people stay in corporate jobs isn't brainwashing. It's that entrepreneurship demands a kind of self-knowledge that most people haven't done the work to develop. That's not a media problem. That's a human one.\n\nBoth paths are hard. Both paths are uncertain. The difference isn't control. It's whether you've been honest with yourself about what you actually want and what you're willing to lose to get it.",

If you've been an entrepreneur for several years, your job history will be a mish-mash of every function of a company - you've done some accounting, some legal, some marketing, some sales, some etc etc.  You don't have proven experience at any specific corporate job.  So, yes, it's a lot riskier, because if your business fails you're going to have a hell of a time replacing the income.\n\nAlso, in a corporate job you typically have a benefits plan that includes PTO and short and long term disability.  If you suddenly develop lupus or whatever, as a corporate employee, you have a viable financial path (not that living on 60% of your income is _easy_, but it's at least _possible_).  If you're unable to work as a solo or small company entrepreneur, even in you have disability insurance, the company itself is going to run out of money without you and be unable to pay the premiums.  More likely you just never signed up for this kind of insurance because it was way too expensive, particularly STD.\n\nThe reality is that owning your own business is a great deal more risky than being an employee, even taking layoffs into account.  Nobody actually controls their destiny, but corporate employees are typically way better off when bad things happen.",

Traditional 4-year degree just to have a backup? Probably not worth it if you are already executing.\n\nOne thing I would watch out for: at 19, your network is small.

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators. Otherwise it’s just a nice experience that delays scaling what already works.\n\nIf the agency is growing steadily, I’d push it aggressively for the next 2 to 3 years before pausing momentum.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

After **35 years in business and 15 years mentoring of founders**, I’ve seen that 'faking it until you make it' has mutated into 'faking it to sell how to fake it.'\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this the **Circle of Lust for Round Zero**. It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that the only 'clean' content is a bank statement that matches the tax returns.\n\n**Quick question:** Beyond the technical glitches, what do you think is the biggest 'red flag' in the way these gurus talk about the actual operations of the business?",

Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize.

We always believe our product is so much better than the competition because of feature X or Y that they don’t have.\n\nBut maybe the target customers don’t give a flying fuck about feature X or Y.

In reality, you usually work more than ever at the beginning. You feel pressure instead of freedom. You think about it constantly. The freedom only comes later, if the business actually survives.\n\nAnother big myth is that you need the perfect idea before you start. That stops so many people. The truth is that execution, consistency and the ability to sell matter far more than having a genius idea. Plenty of average ideas win because the founder keeps going.\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of people believe motivation will carry them. It does not. Motivation fades fast. What actually builds something is doing the boring work over and over when nobody is watching. That part never looks good on social media, but that is the real game.",

They were better executions of things that already existed, targeted at underserved niches. The founders who obsessed over being \"first\" usually spent months in stealth mode perfecting something nobody asked for.\n\nThe other big one: thinking you need to have everything figured out before you start. You don't. The best founders I've worked with started with a rough hypothesis, shipped something small, and let real users reshape the product. The plan you write on day one is almost never the plan that works. The willingness to iterate fast matters way more than the initial vision.\n\nAnd honestly, the myth that being your own boss means freedom. Early stage, you're not free at all. You answer to customers, to cash flow, to deadlines that are entirely self-imposed but somehow feel more stressful than any boss ever was. Freedom comes much later, if at all.",

They're already spending money to solve the problem badly.\n\n  \nAnd agree on boring niches. The best businesses I've seen are ones nobody wants to brag about at parties. Compliance stuff, niche scheduling, industry-specific reporting. Zero competition because no developer thinks it's cool enough to build. But the customers are sticky as hell because switching costs in niche workflows are brutal.\n\n  \nThe \"search for anger\" framing is perfect too. I'd also try searching \"I wish\" and \"frustrated with\" on specific industry subreddits. Those phrases tend to surface even more specific pain points than the general ones.",

      "text": "Solo founder here. Built a PDF editor over the past year. Just hit 10k downloads with zero marketing spend.\n\n\n\nNot a unicorn story - making \\~$500/month - but wanted to share what actually worked vs what I thought would work.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PRODUCT\n\n\n\nPDF editor that's:\n\n\\- 20MB (vs Adobe's 300MB)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n\\- No signup/cloud required\n\n\\- Free on desktop, small one-time payment on mobile\n\n\n\nBuilt it because I was tired of bloated PDF tools that force everything through the cloud.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK (Spoiler: Didn't)\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt Launch: Ranked #284\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks preparing\n\n\\- Got 50 upvotes\n\n\\- \\~200 visits\n\n\\- 12 downloads\n\n\\- Felt like a complete failure\n\n\n\nHackerNews (First Attempt): 11 points, 0 comments\n\n\\- Posted at wrong time\n\n\\- Didn't engage in comments fast enough\n\n\\- Buried in /new within an hour\n\n\n\nMy Own X/Twitter: 3-4 likes per post\n\n\\- Tweeted about launches\n\n\\- Crickets\n\n\\- My followers don't care about my product (harsh truth)\n\n\n\nPaid Ads: Didn't even try\n\n\\- No budget as bootstrapped founder\n\n\\- Heard horror stories about burning money\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKED\n\n\n\n1. SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement. Users added my product themselves.\n\n\n\nWhen people search \"Adobe alternative\" or \"lightweight PDF editor\" - they find these directories first, not my website.\n\n\n\nResult: Steady stream of 50-100 downloads per day just from directories.\n\n\n\nLesson: SEO isn't just Google. Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) >>> channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth. But solve a real problem well, and people will talk about it.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCURRENT METRICS (Full Transparency)\n\n\n\nRevenue: \\~$500/month (\\~50 paid users at $10 one-time purchase)\n\nDownloads: 10,000+ total (across all platforms)\n\nTime to build: \\~10 months (nights/weekends while working day job)\n\nMarketing spend: $0\n\nTeam: Just me\n\nFunding: $0 (bootstrapped)\n\n\n\nGeographic breakdown:\n\n\\- 40% Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region)\n\n\\- 35% India\n\n\\- 15% USA\n\n\\- 10% Rest of world\n\n\n\nPlatform breakdown:\n\n\\- 60% Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - completely free\n\n\\- 40% Mobile (iOS/Android) - freemium\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I'M LEARNING\n\n\n\n1. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT > MARKETING\n\n\n\nUsers market products that solve real problems. You don't need to.\n\n\n\n2. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE IS REAL\n\n\n\nBiggest market: Germany\n\nMy location: Not Germany\n\nMy German language skills: Zero\n\n\n\nBuilt for global market with strong principles (privacy, offline-first). Germans loved it. Now I'm learning German and translating the app.\n\n\n\nSometimes your product finds its market before you do.\n\n\n\n3. FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community. You all have been through this before.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

          "text": "@ $10 for a one time purchase, you are going to have to sell a LOT - if you are at 20 support emails pw now, imagine how many you will have if you get to $10K pm - this is the issue with B2C - it doesn't scale. Without code signing, business will not touch your product (they will have policies that would block it). \n\nI would do 3 things right now\n\n1) Code signing - bite the bullet and wear the costs, you are leaving money on the table without it.  \n2) Create excellent documentation, make it easy to find (in app) and search - ie work to keep support emails to a minimum.  \n3) Segment the market - $10 for private, at least $50 for business (they can afford it, and you need to cover your extra overheads).  \n\nJust be prepared for a lot of extra work selling to business - whilst some people can use their credit cards, get ready for dealing with requests for quotes and  purchase orders for $50 which can really suck up your free time (and your will to live).  \n\nGood luck.",

One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads. That's worth calling out.",

Also working on a desktop app solo and the part about Product Hunt ranking #284 made me laugh because I've been treating PH in my head like it's going to be this big moment. Sounds like it really wasn't for you.\n\nThe niche community thing tracks with what I keep seeing too. The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on. I'm still trying to decide between one-time and subscription for my own app. At $10 per user you'd need a LOT of volume to make it work no?",

I am curious if you had any social media community when you started or if you think building one is important? Also, thank you for discussing imposter syndrome.

Sometimes you have to spend money to make money. Consider it your first \"employee\" - it works 24/7 removing friction.\n\nThe Germany discovery is fascinating.
