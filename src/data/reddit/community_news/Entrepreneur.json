      "text": "Was running a generic local marketing agency for about 2 years, doing SEO and Google ads for whoever would pay me. Landscapers, chiropractors, roofing companies, you name it. Revenue was okay but i was constantly context switching and burning out managing 14 completely different industries at once.\n\nThen one of my clients, a pediatric dentist in Scottsdale, referred me to her friend who also owned a pediatric dental practice. I didnt think much of it but after working with both of them for a few months I realized these businesses are basically identical in structure, same ad angles work, same seasonal trends, same parent demographics on Meta, same Google review strategy. I wasnt reinventing the wheel every time.\n\nSo I made the call to niche down completely. Updated my website, killed all other outreach, built out a proper case study from those two clients and just started cold emailing pediatric dental offices.\n\nFirst 60 days were rough ngl. Had some money saved from before I went full time that covered my personal expenses which was the only reason i didnt panic and go back to taking random clients. By month 3 I had 3 new clients purely from outreach. By month 6 referrals started coming in from within the niche itself because these dentists all know each other and talk.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about niching is that your deliverables get so much faster. I can onboard a new pediatric dental client in 2 days now because everything is templated from experience. My margins went up without raising prices just from the efficiency alone.\n\nIf your agency feels chaotic and all over the place this is genuinely worth considering. Pick the niche that already has some proof in your current client list.",

The referral flywheel you described is the REAL moat, dentists talking to other dentists is literally worth more than any cold outreach budget.\n\nThe templating point is underrated too. I see the same thing managing large ecom and lead gen accounts... when you run the same industry repeatedly, your first-week optimizations on a new account are already at month-3 level for a generalist because you already know which ad angles, bidding structures and landing page frameworks work. That efficiency compounds silently into your margins without ever raising prices.\n\nThe one risk nobody talks about though... niche concentration means one industry downturn hits your whole book simultaneously. Worth building a small cash reserve specifically for that scenario.",

You already know which ad angles convert, which landing page structure works, what objections come up in the sales call. That compounds into:\n\n- Faster onboarding = more capacity without hiring\n- Better results = higher retention\n- Speaking their exact language = shorter sales cycle\n- Case studies that resonate = easier to close the next one\n\nThe referral network effect you mentioned is the other thing that's hard to replicate with a generalist model. Pediatric dentists go to the same conferences, are in the same Facebook groups, probably know each other by name in any given metro area. One happy client becomes a referral engine in a way that \"one happy landscaper\" just doesn't.\n\nCurious about one thing - are you seeing any ceiling in terms of market size?

Second, the templating advantage extends beyond onboarding. Your reporting, copy frameworks, upsell timing -- everything becomes more precise because you are comparing apples to apples across your whole client book. Congrats on the growth, and the patience during those first two months was clearly the right call.",

Going from 21M to 250M usually means you stopped selling a product and started selling a category leader with predictable revenue. Recurring revenue, cleaner margins, stronger enterprise contracts, less founder dependency. PE pays for stability and growth mechanics, not just tech.\n\nDeal structure probably leveled up too. Better advisors, tighter metrics, cleaner cap table, knowing what buyers actually value. By exit three you’re not just building, you’re designing the outcome from day one. That’s the real jump.",

It took me a while to get my head around it, but I understand and empathize with people who actually do it. Kuddos to them. Had I learnt about this earlier in my career, I think I would 100% have gone for it.  \n\nOne outcome of that exploration is that I signed several part-times contracts (consulting & advisory types of things) in addition to my main full-time job. None of these contracts are secret to those around me. I can't risk conflicts of interests. If anything, they approve and encourage me to get into more closed circles that way.\n\nDepending on how you look at it, one could consider me as being OE. I have more than 1 job.

I don't really see the world as success/failure, just circumstances and outcomes. But ultimately, it is about people. I am not alone, and my personal involvement has not that much to do with the success/failure of the business. If I am that important, then I fucked up. To use your phraseology, I think I would say it is fine to \"fail\" as a team. It is not fine to \"fail\" alone.\n  \nYou operate as a team. If an outcome hinges on a single person, that person goes it alone without involving others, and doesn't get the outcome we agreed on, then the person is fired. I couldn't fathom operating like that.\n  \nAs a team, if we don’t manage to get the desired outcome together, even though we helped each other, squabbled, sulked, laughed, complained about the weather and how bad the coffee is, but ultimately agreed on a course of action and put in our collective energy and might... then it's just what it is.

It's all about the context and market.   \n  \nAbout fear of failure..   \n  \nA friend told me a few months back that I inspired her. I rejected the praise and told her that from my perspective, it was all bullshit. That fundamentally, I am not good enough, that I am surrounded by people much smarter than I will ever be, and almost never delivering to my own standards. She reckoned I said that because I see how the sausage is made. She doesn't see the process, she just sees the result.\n  \nIt reminded me that there is your inner life and outer life. Feelings are something, as individuals and humans, we all share in our own way. Whatever is happening inside your head will never change. Insecurities, anxiety, fear of failure, etc. It never changed for me, and I accept it will never change. I can't undo my childhood and how it left an print in my mind. We are the same 10 y.o. kids we were then... in an older body.    \n  \nWhat makes a difference is whether you are a slave to your feelings (react to them instinctively) or whether you work \"with\" your feelings. I have lost count of the number of talented people who self-destruct because they are in a bad mental place. Like someone who is frustrated because they don't get a promotion and start acting out. Had they been able to put their frustration to one side and acted appropriately, they would have been promoted 6 months later. But because they were unable to handle their frustration, they de facto disqualified themselves for that promotion. Funny how it works. And by the way, that someone was me.  \n   \nTL/DR. Nevermind your fear of failure. If that's your thing and how your head is wired, chances are you'll probably always have it. It's fine. Nobody will know unless you tell them. Just don't act stupid because of it.",

Instead of thinking about selling it for a small amount, consider what its potential value could be if you added a simple monetization strategy, even something like a discreet banner ad or a 'buy me a coffee' option that's more prominent than just a donation.\n\nThink about the long-term value. If you can get $21 in donations from just one person, imgine what a small, well-placed revenue stream could generate over a year. You've already proven there's a need and an audience. I'd hold onto it and explore ways to generate even a small recurring income before letting it go for a one-time payment that seems quite low for an app with viral potential.",

No one bats an eye.

Pure problem obsession. Ford and Chrysler stole his patent, he spent 30 years fighting them in court, and eventually won $30 million.\n\nTurned out the problem was worth quite a lot.",

You should find a problem that you want to solve not a way that you wanna make money. Because at the end of the day you need to be willing to just solve the problem and get paid nothing for it and that needs to be enough because if it’s not when the money is not coming in, you’re gonna quit. I call it finding your why/purpose. But for example, let’s say I start a business helping people find a retirement home. That’s extremely niche. And very likely would be difficult to get people on board with me effectively planning their retirement helping them get placed, etc. etc. but at the end of the day if I’m not dedicated to that for some of my own reasons if I’m not getting paid to do it eventually I’m just gonna quit rather than finding out. How do I make this work? Everybody talks about pivot, pivot, pivot, and that’s great. But there’s a difference between pivoting and completely changing your business. If you’re pivot means you’re gonna start making money in a different industry or a completely different way targeting a different niche, etc. then you’re probably changing your business. You’re not pivoting. And that does work out in some cases for some people, but in my experience. Figuring out your Y/purpose is more important than anything because if there’s no money, what else do you have to make sure that it keeps working?",

Distribution matters more than product quality at the start â Reddit, App Store SEO, and direct outreach got the first 50 customers\n3. Retention is everything in SaaS.

Multiple small products > one big product early on\n\n**What most people get wrong:**\n\n- Building before validating (10 customer conversations before writing code saves months)\n- Chasing revenue instead of solving real pain\n- Underpricing because they're scared (lower prices attract worse customers who churn faster)\n\nThe honest answer: at $10k/month, recurring revenue businesses (SaaS, subscriptions, retainers) are most sustainable.

          "text": "My business is physical asset based. I do warehousing, trucking, and processing for manufacturers. Everything I do is B2B. AI has done nothing but make things better and easier for me. \n\nI started in 2016 with a big warehouse full of sand and a little bit of money (remnants of an old family business that has been closed for over a decade). The goal was simple: get the facility generating a stable income again. The process? Fuck. \n\nIt took 18 months to get the sand out and get the building back into usable condition. From there I tried a lot. Leasing. Selling. Subdividing. Hell at one point I spent 9 months and $80,000 working with engineers and contractors and lawyers and all sorts of other people to expand the building by 75ksf and move a manufacturer in that would employ over 300 people per shift, only for the project to die at the last minute because of an impasse on capitalization. \n\nOne day, straight up, I got fucking lucky. An old customer rep called and asked if I would be interested in doing warehousing for them. I said yes, but it was still almost two years from that conversation to the commencement date of the service agreement with them. From there, I finally had an actual operation.\n\nBefore, the old assets were generating some rental income, but not all that much; six figures for the entire year collectively. Getting started in warehousing was, admittedly, not exactly a cash cow. Yes getting rent from the warehouse space that was being utilized was good and the little bit of handling income I was getting was definitely better than before, but it wasn't much. I only had 5-6 people working for me then. It wasn't until about a year or so later, after also signing this company's intra-plant neighbor (two companies sharing production lines) as a warehousing customer, that I got the opportunity to get into trucking and toll processing.\n\nThat was huge. I hired an engineer to work for me full time to develop a processing line to meet the customers requirements. I built a 17,000 sf production facility attached to my warehouse to house the tolling equipment. From inquiry to start date, it was three full years of effort. They were only planning to send a small amount of their total required volume to us, but because my line is so much faster, better, and safer than everyone else's, I'm now processing more than half of the total annual volume the customer has. They told me one day that when we first got started that it would be AMAZING if we could get to the point where we could process a million pounds of material a month. We did it in the first month. That's when the money started really coming in. Altogether it was about 6 years of effort to get to that point. \n\nDo I regret it? Kind of. Getting into a family business, even one that is dead and gone that you're just trying to resurrect, comes with some serious challenges. While I am definitely doing well for myself, the strain it put on the most important relationships in my life, in a lot of ways, weren't worth it. There were times where I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. The darkest days I have experience in my life have surrounded this fucking business. I know now that I would have likely been a lot happier over the past decade had I just truly gone out on my own, even if I failed. \n\nFree time? Lol. Between the business, marriage, kids, board positions, other responsibilities, and the desire to have a couple of hobbies so I don't hate my life eats up just about all the free time I have. Basically, if I want free time, I have to schedule it ahead. However, the freedom I have to work when I want/need rather than be beholden to someone else's schedule is enough for me. \n\nSo long as I continue growing and gaining more market share, my business should endure indefinitely. Before the financial crisis of 2007 killed it, my business existed operationally since 1947. I know now that what killed the business in it's last life was a lack of service diversification and lack of scale, both of which have been my primary developmental focuses since day one. \n\nI'm currently nearer the ballpark of a 10k daily than monthly without being too revealing. It is still a very small company. My personal take home is well over 100k without putting any strain at all on the business.",

The exact number fluctuates, but the floor is above the threshold you mentioned.\n\nIf you’re trying to get to $10k+, the biggest unlock isn’t a new tactic, it’s choosing a problem you can solve deeply, packaging it clearly, and positioning yourself where people actually feel the pain.",

Most people try to sell $20 products to thousands of people, which is a marketing nightmare. In sales, you only need to close 2-4 high-value deals a month to exceed that goal.\n\nTwo critical rules I live by:\n\n1. Sell value, not fluff. Work for a company that offers a solution with genuine value.\n\n2. Believe in the product! Only sell something you actually believe in and would be willing to pay for yourself. Authenticity is your biggest asset in high-stakes deals.\n\nEven if you don’t plan on being a \"salesman\" forever, learning how to sell is the most important life skill you can acquire.

Basically I serve as the senior tech and product leader for 3 to 4 companies at the same time, each paying a monthly retainer. I also run a small AI focused investment fund. No course. No ebook. No community with a $49/month paywall.\n\n**How long did it take to get into it?** I started my first company at 18 with no degree and no money. That was over a decade ago. The fractional executive work specifically took about 8 years of building, shipping, failing, and learning before I had enough credibility that companies would trust me with their product and engineering decisions. There was no shortcut. Anyone selling you a 90 day path to this is lying.\n\n**How long to make your first decent income?** My first real company took almost 2 years before I could pay myself consistently. The product I scaled to $20M ARR took about 18 months to hit meaningful revenue. Nothing worthwhile happened fast.\n\n**Do you regret the route?** Not even slightly. But I'd be lying if I said there weren't years where I questioned everything. The path from 18 year old with no credentials to where I am now was not some clean upward curve. It was chaos with a general upward trend if you zoom out far enough.\n\n**How much free time do you have?** More than you'd expect actually. I've built AI agent workflows that handle a massive chunk of what used to eat my day. Content, research, scheduling, first drafts of almost everything. I work hard from about 8 AM to 4 PM, work out, and my evenings are mostly free. Weekends are mine. That said, this took years of deliberately designing my work to be async and systems driven. Early on I had zero free time and that's just the honest reality of building.\n\n**How long will it last?** The fractional model is only growing because startups can't afford full time C suite leaders but desperately need senior thinking. AI makes me more valuable not less because most founders need someone who actually understands how to operationalize AI, not just talk about it. I'd bet on this model for at least the next 5 to 10 years, probably longer.\n\n**How much?** Well above 10k/month. I won't give exact numbers because it varies by quarter and client load, but each retainer client is a meaningful five figure monthly engagement and I run multiple simultaneously.\n\nThe real answer to your actual question though: pick something where the value you provide compounds over time. Courses and dropshipping don't compound. Expertise does. Skills do. Reputation does. It's slower and less sexy and nobody will make a TikTok about it. But it's the thing that actually works.",

Also, the time will go past anyway, so it is better to utilise the time to eventually build. Also, the followers and audience that you do attract organically and start following you - they will be better customers who have chosen to follow you because they like your ideas and content etc and you are more likely to build trust and a sale with them as they can see your thinking and ideas as you post online etc.\n\nThere is another way to get traffic and leads, which is via paid advertising, which will bring you in customers and revenue much quicker(obviously, this all depends on how you position your offer and pricing etc), but that is the only reasonable way to bring in customers quickly with this kind of business.",

And then salt was sold out of barrels in general stores. People would bring their own containers (like ceramic pots or cloth bags) to the store and the merchant would scoop out the desired amount.\n\n In rural areas, a \"saltman\" or peddler would travel door-to-door with a cart or on horseback, carrying blocks of salt. He would chip off pieces for customers right on their doorstep.\n\nThat whole \"You just grab salt at the grocery store\" stuff came *much later.*\n\nThose entrepreneurs identified a new need and served it until it became commoditized by \"the big guys.\" The entrepreneurs made some money along the way, rinse and repeat.",

          "text": "I get where you're coming from, but there's a lot of ignorance inside that sentiment.\n\nFirst, when Google or Notion or one of these big companies add \"a whole product as a button inside their app\", many times it is because they went to the \"salt shop guy\" and bought him out. Unfortunately, there are lots of salt shop guys out there, and its usually either the first to get big enough to get noticed or the guy who is the best connected that gets to sell his salt shop to the big guy. When you see a headline \"BIG COMPANY Acquires COMPARATIVELY TINY COMPANY for X Billion Dollars\", the reason is often so the big company can start offering what the small company came up with. Alternatively, the big company deploys internal resources to create that simple little button and kill every single salt shop guy out there all at once, but that simple little button could cost them MILLIONS in dev and implementation costs that they would rather have someone else take the initial risk on. \n\nSecond is the idea that you aren't running a business because you're just selling salt on someone else's shelf. Guess what? That is EVERY business that has ever existed. Whether you are a one-man-show salt maker, a multinational food retailer, or even a giant holding company that owns 40% of the market, you are still just one item on someone else's \"shelf\". The global market is a big place, and no matter what you do, you're still only one of 8 billion people trying to attract its attention. The only way you could possibly avoid having to sell on someone else's proverbial shelf is if your organization were fully integrated from top to bottom, front to back, and side to side in its supply chain. There isn't, nor has their ever been, a business on Earth fully capable of that. Hell, there aren't a lot of GOVERNMENTS capable of something like that. \n\nThird is the idea that a niche is somehow the incorrect approach to a business when, in reality, it is quite literally the only way to start a business from scratch. Unless you have millions of dollars, a full business development team, government backing, and a lot of luck, the chances that you start your business as some multi-faceted organization that produces lots of different products/services are slim to none. Furthermore, businesses that are already well established in a market are going to have the economies of scale to offer literally anything you can on your own far cheaper and better than you. Therefore, the only way to actually succeed IS to start with a niche and develop it into a high-quality offering that people/businesses are willing to pay a premium for. Some little tiny hole in the marketplace that's too small for the big players to take notice or take advantage of, but big enough for an individual to build out a business process to start growing with that niche as their base is what entrepreneurs look for. Sometimes the niche is a truly unique offering to the world, but more often than not it is simply a product/service offering that does not exist in a particular localized marketplace. \n\nAltogether, I think the sentiment that you're talking about here is less an identification of an actual problem and more of you just organically identifying one of the ways the global market functions.",

That it seems to be like the only way to make money now.\n\nI was listening to the Mel Robbins podcast today about how to live a meaningful life, and design the future you want. It's really fantastic. I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it.\n\nAnd then after some deep thinking, I was just wondering, is there anybody building any type of business anymore, or like starting something up now which has nothing to do with AI or tech?! 🤔\n\nIs there no going back from having to share one's 5 winning tips in a LinkedIn post, or downloadable pdf if one writes X in the comments? 🫣",

      "text": "My father started giving walking tours in new york back in the 90s. He knows every hidden spot from greenwich village alleys to forgotten plaques in midtown that no app mentions. For years he averaged 6 tours a week at $35 a head, 8 to 12 people each time. That kept us afloat through tough years.\n\nTwo years ago cancer hit and he had to stop. He handed it to me with stories about groups who came back year after year because he made the city feel alive. Now I run the tours but bookings dropped to 2 a week max. summer was okay with 10 person groups but winter is brutal, down to 4 or 5 people paying $140 total some days.\n\nThe problem is visibility. he relied on word of mouth and flyers at hotels. I tried a basic website and posting on local facebook groups but it barely moves the needle. overhead is low, just permits and transit at $200 a month, but without steady groups we cant cover basics. people loved his personal touch, the way hed stop for coffee at a spot with history or adjust for kids in the group.\n\nI want to honor what he built without turning it into some generic bus thing. for anyone whos scaled small tours or personal guides: what got you past the word of mouth phase, did you find platforms that connect groups without high fees? \n\nThank you everyone.",

It’s discoverability.\n\nA few practical ideas that don’t turn it into a bus-tour machine:\n\n1. Lean into the legacy. Most tours sell “see NYC.” You can sell “30 years of hidden NYC stories passed from father to son.” That angle alone is powerful. Put that front and center on your site and listings.\n2. Get on high-intent platforms. Airbnb Experiences, Viator, GetYourGuide. Yes, they take a cut. But they solve visibility instantly. You can always upsell direct repeat bookings later.\n3. Raise your price slightly. $35 feels underpriced for NYC walking tours in 2026. Higher price can actually signal quality and attract better groups.\n4. Collect emails every single tour. Offer a “hidden NYC spots” PDF or short story recap and build a list. Repeat business compounds.\n5. Encourage Google reviews aggressively. If he ran it 30 years, there must be past customers who’d happily leave a review. 100+ strong Google reviews alone can change local discovery.\n6. Winter pivot. Offer themed tours: “NYC Crime Stories,” “Historic Speakeasies,” “Love Stories of Manhattan.” Give people a reason beyond sightseeing.\n\nYou don’t need scale. You need positioning + distribution.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact that you care about keeping it personal is already your advantage over the big operators.",

      "text": "This whole story has been largely condensed as per the mods recommendations. I will post the full story in the comments for added context for those who are interested... I'm not even totally sure what I'm looking for advice maybe? If you've been in business for a while, have a similar story, any advice, tips, or just help would be appreciated tbh.\n\nI am a 25M my wife is 26F been together since we were 16. My wife has mostly stayed home with the kids, working part-time occasionally, which saved us from massive childcare costs while I focused on building my career/business.\n\nI started working young and come from a poor family so I have always had a \"work harder than everyone else\" mindset. I started at minimum wage in my industry (not tech/software... Important later). Working multiple jobs at once. I took on extra responsibilities at work and \"Job Hopped\" as needed to advance in my field. By 20, I was hired as a store manager and instead of working 90 hours a week (several jobs) I was working 70 hours a week (single job).\n\nWhen I was 21 I went on my first vacation ever and it changed my life. I realized my then 2 year old son barely knew me, he knew I was dad but didnt have a relationship with me. I missed every milestone working several jobs, finishing college, etc. I remember thinking what even is success and at what cost am i willing to achieve it... On the flight home, I decided I needed a remote career so I could actually be present in my life.\n\nLong story short I was in a position to do this because we had savings. But I stupidly quit my job before buying a house and essentially ruined our plans to do so. I then set out to find a remote job in my industry just to find out that remote and good pay didnt exist in my industry. So i decided if the job I needed didn't exist I would create it. \n\nI tried several business ideas that all failed because I was chasing money and not solving someones problem but eventually I found a problem and locked in. We served customers nationwide using mail carriers as part of fulfillment. Revenue came in, but not enough to live on. I reinvested everything. By the end the savings was basically gone, I had 20k in credit card debt, and I had 7k left in my business account. But I kept pushing forward, I'll figure it out later mentality.\n\nA few weeks later, a competitor approached me about merging. After a month of discussions, we combined companies. They were interested because I had built and operated everything myself. I taught myself software development and had already automated large portions of the business. I had real traction without funding.\n\nUnder the merger, I became head of my department, responsible for all technology and process development. My compensation was 25% equity (making me the second-largest shareholder), a $2,500/month salary, and a 5.5% monthly profit share. Based on EBITDA and projections, the company was valued around $9M. I treated the equity as my retirement plan, so I never pushed for higher pay and instead reinvested everything into growth even relocating my family to a lower cost-of-living state just to keep building.\n\nAfter the merger, the company exploded. We scaled nationwide using a franchise-style model, bringing in regional investors who shared in local profits. At our peak we were doing roughly $5M per quarter, opening locations weekly. I led multiple departments, built the operational infrastructure, automated processes, and spoke at events across the country. I even collaborated with Kathy Ireland on a NYT bestselling book about the company’s story.\n\nBut while the business grew, I neglected to protect myself. I didn’t build my personal brand, negotiate compensation, or insist on stronger legal and financial transparency. I assumed my equity would take care of me and focused entirely on execution... Building systems, documentation, and automation that made the company run.\n\nAs we scaled, expenses kept rising. The majority partner justified everything as “necessary for growth,” and because revenue was strong, I didn’t push back when I should have. Then things started unraveling. The COO abruptly left, surrendering his stake. Investors began asking questions I couldn’t answer because I didn’t have access to the financials. Franchisees started leaving, citing lack of support and ROI.\n\nAfter the CFO resigned, we finally forced access to the books.\n\nThat’s when we discovered the truth: the majority partner had been embezzling money, funding personal travel, diverting funds to unrelated businesses, and draining the company from the inside out. Operationally, the systems I built kept things running, but financially the business had already been gutted.\n\nTo avoid lawsuits and repay investors, we dismantled the company selling off profitable divisions and liquidating assets. When everything was gone, the remaining shell of what had once been a multi-million-dollar company sold for $10,000 and shares in a newly public entity.\n\nIn the end all said and done I walked away with 2.5k and 1M shares of a company I dont care about that were then valued at 500k but realistically are illiquid and could be worth 50k or less. We explored suing majority partner but first of all we all stupidly signed the documents and second of all he has nothing no house, no money, no investments, he works a dead-end job now. Pretty much every other partner besides him and I have gone on to start their own own semi-successful business after the fact. \n\nI had 2 kids when this all happened and needed to pay my bills so I went back to my industry (not tech/software) got rehired as a store manager and shortly after I was approached by a new company in our industry and they hired me into a remote position making a little less than 100k a year. This is probably the best job I've ever had and ironically was the goal all those years ago. But I don't feel like I did when I was running the company.\n\nIm more aware than my younger self, i have people who depend on me and Im now in a state with no support system to fall back on. I have a stable income, 401k, life insurance etc. My son has responsibilities, friends, sports etc. Worst of all were still renting and never bought a house. I want to start a new business but i cant justify gambling my families security like this all over again. \n\nHas anyone here experienced this or rebuilt after something like this? How can I justify starting over, not being present, investing in my company instead of a home etc. Should I just walk away from business, keep my stable job and hopefully climb the corporate ladder? Try to build another company but in a smarter, more controlled way? I don’t miss the chaos. But I do miss building something that was mine... Specifically the phase 2 version of past the startup phase.   \n\n\nWould really value advice from people who’ve navigated this stage of life/business.",

Due to the nature of other business collapse pretty much all of our investors don’t have trust in me and tarnish my reputation because they believe I knew all along, which is not true.

Almost exactly this.\n\nI worked in restaurant ops and major events management throughout my 20’s and when the pandemic hit and they all shut down, i co-founded a grocery distribution and parcel-rate cold-chain delivery company. My partner was the fundraiser and money manager and I oversaw literally everything else. The only other thing I didn’t do was write code but I still managed the tech team before we promoted one of them to CTO.\n\nI grew the operations to $3m ARR in 10 months. Two temp-controlled warehouses (total of 60k sqft), 23 reefer trucks, 55 employees, ~250 vendors, and thousands of customers, all exclusively within southern Ontario.\n\nI’m American and a college dropout out, so I was also arguing with Canadian immigration at the time, and after 3 years they came back and said they felt a Canadian could do my job and refused to renew my work permit. I wasn’t deported but it was heavily implied I would be if I didn’t leave myself or find a new way to qualify. \n\nThat’s when I found out that my co-founder had been mismanaging our funds and not paying our bills because the company wasn’t in a position to sponsor my employment anymore.\n\nI tried to pivot quickly because legally I wasn’t even allowed to work for the company anymore. I told him we needed to liquidate our physical inventory and convert all vendors to sell online and leverage our existing delivery platform so we don’t have to purchase inventory, but could instead rent out space in the warehouses to store their products if they preferred for us to pick and ship the product for them. It would have saved the company and all the vendors were on board because then they got far better sales insights and better inventory and production control.\n\nMy dipshit co-founder ignored my plans and kept trying to push the semi-traditional distribution model and within 3 months of my work permit renewal being denied he bankrupted the company to the tune of $3m CAD. All of our employees lost their jobs overnight with zero warning. All of our vendors and customers lost a pivotal distro partner that changed the whole game for them. \n\nI still cry about it to this day. I’m furious at him for what he did. To add insult to injury, once the dust settled, he restarted the business under a new name but using the model I suggested to save our company and it’s actually become very successful.\n\nAnd I have applied for many many jobs in the CPG industry and cannot even get an interview. It’s been almost 4 years. I have zero money. Zero debt too but zero money. Part of me believes that he somehow blacklisted me because I told people the truth when they asked me what happened.\n\nHe’s only operating in Canada though. If anyone here ever wanted to hear more about the business/would be interested in disrupting CPG distribution in the USA and has funding for it, holler. I can absolutely repeat what I did in Canada with the right partner and resources.",

Learn to mitigate the downside risk for you and your family then swing for the fences. You ignored a bunch of red flags legally, operationally and financially. Never count on illiquid equity being a retirement plan until it becomes liquid. Don't quit jobs until you actually have something else coming in. Do your job and if you want to build something else do it until it replaces your existing income.

They were all making six plus figures back in the 1990s and especially during peak war, on terror years Iraq and Afghanistan. The way the DoD worked back then they would have these huge contracts that would have cost Plus built in. So no matter what the taxpayers were on the hook to subsidize this, it led to a lot of interesting innovations like the GPS was refined by this defense contractor and there was a lot of really cool innovative technology that came out of it. But in the end you're making war and weapon systems. But from my perspective that's kind of what the core economy of America is. There's a huge manufacturing facility in in our town. It's the largest employer in the state. Basically in a rural conservative area we had it really diversified beyond war profiteering and if you look at the original development of the internet it was DARPA. It was designed to be a post-apocalyptic communication Network for universities, military bases in the government. So in some ways the above is just a continuation of what it always has been and what it was built. As I'm not saying it's right or wrong. I'm just saying this is what the society we are in has valued.",

El cliente recibe lo mismo (o mejor), la agencia cobra igual pero con un margen mucho más alto.\n\n\n\nOtros modelos que funcionan bien en la práctica:\n\n\\- Servicios de link building donde la IA identifica oportunidades y redacta los outreach emails, reduciendo el tiempo operativo un 60-70%\n\n\\- Generación de contenido localizado para e-commerce (descripciones de productos, meta tags en masa)\n\n\\- Automatización de reportes mensuales para clientes de Google Ads/Analytics\n\n\n\nLo que más funciona es empaquetarlo como un servicio, no como un producto SaaS. Menos riesgo técnico, cash flow desde el primer cliente, y validas el mercado rápido. El SaaS viene después si ves escala real.",

From what I'm observing, the most successful AI businesses right now fall into a few categories: companies automating specific, repetitive tasks (like document processing or customer service routing), those creating AI-powered features within existing products rather than standalone AI tools, and consultants helping traditional businesses identify where AI can actually solve real problems they're already paying to solve manually.\n\n\n\nThe key seems to be starting with a genuine business problem that costs time or money, then seeing if AI can address it more efficiently - rather than starting with \"how can I use AI?\" and working backwards.\n\n\n\nThis approach is exactly what led me to develop Bobos.ai. Having been on both sides of the marketing equation - running small businesses that couldn't afford $10K+ agency fees and working inside agencies watching small clients pay premium rates for junior talent - I saw a broken system. Small businesses needed real marketing help (strategy AND execution) at prices that actually made sense, with transparency instead of black boxes.\n\n\n\nSo we built Bobos around a simple premise: give away the marketing strategy for free, and only charge when businesses want help executing it. We use AI to streamline our strategy development and project management, but pair it with real marketing professionals - strategists, designers, ad specialists, content creators, and PMs who are accountable to you.\n\n\n\nAnd ironically, I'm using an AI social coach right now to help refine this very response, which is a perfect example of AI solving a real problem (helping me communicate more effectively) rather than being AI for AI's sake.\n\n\n\nWhat specific business challenges are you seeing in your industry that feel like they might benefit from this kind of hybrid approach - where AI handles the repetitive work but humans drive the strategy and relationships? Sometimes the best opportunities are hiding in the mundane tasks we take for granted.\"",

For example a small brand owner spending thousands on product photography and ads making, while AI and CGI do it fast, efficient and high quality.\n\nNothing magical, just a faster execution.\n\nAI become a real business when we stop selling AI and start selling its outcomes like more leads, better visuals, lower cost.\n\nI experienced most business owners don't even bother to see what systems you use they simply care if it makes money for them or save their time\nWhat I am sharing is my own experience, being an AI artist.",

You’re burnt with any legal route, and if you don’t have any contacts or family members and you suck at making friends or connections that can potentially help you with a ride to a job. 🤷 a lot of people won’t understand the struggle some people go through, some people who go through the struggle have no interest in actually bettering themselves. \n\nInvest in yourself and get an education anyway you can. If you’re in college reach out to your admin and ask for resources, apply to grants, find food pantries. If you’re blessed with a job, save as much as you can, if you don’t. Spend all that free time dreaming of the business you want too build. \n\nKeep your credit clean. Take financial education classes or learn how to be financially responsible, even if you have no finances to manage. As long as you’re not stagnant nothing stays the same. \n\nThe one way to always make money is by having hope, determination, and a hustler mentality. Real hustlers get it how they live. Be it selling drugs, working a 9-5, selling $0.70 soups and spice, detailing cars, collecting change, sucking dick. Hell u get the point. Ditch the poverty mindset and don’t sell your soul.",

If you can continue to focus on it when it gets boring, you will make even more money.\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say almost nobody will truly believe in you, tell you you’re right, or follow what you’re doing. Do it anyway. Know that almost everybody is wrong, that’s why almost everybody has an average life.\n\nIf you ignore everything i said and only read one sentence this is it:\n\nTo get what the 1% have, you have to do what 1% of people do.\n\nOr if you like Kanye:\n\n“Everyone will call you crazy if you run in the street alone wearing trousers, but if everybody does it together, it’s a marathon”",

You have a mortgage.\n\nBut huge companies have a massive weakness: they are deaf. They rely on automated bots, generic marketing emails, and customer support teams that take three days to reply. We realized that if we couldn't outspend them, we could out-listen them.\n\nOver the last 60 days, we’ve been stealing customers from our biggest competitors by showing up at the exact moment they fail.\n\n# Finding Places Where Your Competitors Fail\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people vent their frustrations about big name software on Reddit and X.\n\n* \"Why did \\[Giant Competitor\\] just double their prices?\"\n* \"Is it just me, or is \\[Giant Competitor\\] down again?\"\n* \"Does anyone have a better alternative for \\[Competitor\\]? Their support is non-existent.\"\n\nMost companies don't see these posts until they’ve been live for two days. By then, the user has already moved on or just given up. We decided to make our response time our primary competitive advantage.\n\n# The Workflow\n\nWe built a \"Strike Team\" workflow (which is literally just me and one assistant) to catch these signals in real time.\n\n1. **The Trigger:** We monitor specific \"vulnerability\" keywords for our top five competitors. We don't just track their brand names. We track their names plus words like \"alternative,\" \"broken,\" \"slow,\" or \"overpriced.\"\n2. **The Contextual Reply:** When a signal hits, we don't send a sales pitch. We jump into the thread and offer immediate, specific help.\n   * **Example:** \"I saw you're struggling with that API integration. We actually built our tool specifically to solve that because we had the same issue. Happy to give you a free 3 month trial to help you migrate over today.\"\n3. **The Closing:** We offer a \"Concierge Migration.\" If they are leaving a big player, they are usually terrified of the data move. We tell them we’ll do the heavy lifting for them.\n\n# Our Results\n\n|**Metric**|**Google Ads (Old Way)**|**Social Intent (The New Way)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Budget**|$2,000/mo minimum|$0 in Ad Spend|\n|**Conversion Rate**|2-3%|15-20%|\n|**Lead Quality**|Just browsing|Ready to switch NOW|\n|**Customer Vibe**|Just another ad|You guys are a lifesaver|\n\nThe giants in your industry are moving too fast to care about a single frustrated tweet or Reddit thread. That frustration is your market opportunity.\n\nIn 60 days, we messaged 42 accounts for nearly $0 CAC (just software), and we closed 8 of those leads, adding over $1.5k MRR.",

Big companies almost never do this, and users feel like they're shouting into the void with their requests. Even just saying \"feature requests are open, and here's what we're prioritizing this month\" creates a sense of buy-in you can't really fake.\n\n\n\nWe built a product in the Chrome extension space around this idea, and it’s wild how much goodwill comes from actually listening, shipping fast, and letting users steer the ship.

If I worked hard enough, things would click.\n\nThey don’t.\n\nThe biggest thing I wish I had known is this:  \nBusiness is less about working hard and more about working on the right thing.\n\nMarketing isn’t magic. It’s clarity.  \nIf people are “interested” but not paying, it usually means one of three things:\n\nThe problem isn’t painful enough\n\nThe value isn’t clear enough\n\nThe trust isn’t strong enough\n\nEarly on, I wasted time trying to convince people. Later I realized, if you have to push too hard, you’re either targeting the wrong audience or solving a weak problem.\n\nAnother lesson: revenue is truth.  \nLikes, followers, compliments - none of that matters. If someone pays you, that’s validation. If they don’t, that’s feedback.\n\nAlso, don’t romanticize starting from scratch. I used to think building from zero was the only “real” way. Over time I learned that smart entrepreneurs look for leverage partnerships, acquisitions, existing demand, distribution channels. Starting is good. Entering wisely is better.\n\nAnd lastly, confusion is normal.  \nEvery founder feels like they don’t know what they’re doing. The difference is successful ones keep moving anyway. They test, adjust, simplify, repeat.\n\nYou don’t need to know everything.\n\nYou just need to:  \nSolve a real problem.  \nCharge early.  \nListen carefully.  \nAnd stay in the game longer than most people.\n\nClarity comes from action, not overthinking.",

Distribution matters more than the idea.  \na mediocre product with strong distribution beats a great product nobody sees.\n\n2. Talk to users early and often.  \nDon't guess what people want. Sell before you build whenever possible.\n\n3. Focus beats intensity.  \nMost beginners pivot too fast. Give one angle enough time to actually test it.\n\n4. marketing is a skill, not a magic.  \nIt's positioning, clarity, and repetition. if people don't convert, it's usually a messaging problem before it's a product problem.\n\n5. Failure is data.  \nEvery failed attempt narrows the field. The only real mistake is not extracting the lesson.\n\nYou're not behind. You're just early in the reps.",

For what it takes, they’re really easy to make, just give yourself plenty of time because people take ages to reply to your emails, every fix up on paperwork takes like a week to amend, even if it’s small, it’s annoying. The biggest problem is getting up front money, so when you’re starting and scaling I’m take huge financial risk as I’m working on loans and a lot of hope that I can make enough money to pay off huge lump sums of money in deadlines so I don’t lose thousand and thousands in deposits, start small with a proof of concept and then go big",

Here are the ones that gets mentioned often inside our company\n\n* Generating Presentations: After every client meeting, Zooms AI Summary, is auto routed to Gamma. Gamma then generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n* A/B testing ads: Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n* Content Based on Google Data: Again, we used to constantly manually look at our Google search console data and publish weekly content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those on Google! Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every Monday! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n* Meeting Notes & Followups: Granola has been great for recording meetings, summarizing, generating follow-up emails, and just making sure that we don't miss any context. \n\nFollowing to see what others have it going :)",

People change jobs all the time. Your email list from 6 months ago is probably 30% wrong, but you just aren't seeing it until you don't get any responses.\n\n\\- Leverage multiple data sources. One source will miss people a second source will catch. Sending in sequence, using free sources and paid ones only as a last resort, will save you a ton of money without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nSo, what are you finding is taking the most manual time in your outreach efforts right now?",

          "text": "Start with the boring stuff. That’s where you save the most time. Here are some of the repeatable tasks u can start with (depending upon ur business and priority) \n\n\\- For lead capture to CRM and follow ups, stop adding people manually. When someone fills a form or books a call, they should go straight into your CRM, get tagged and receive a follow-up email right away. Zapier and Make are great for connecting your forms to your CRM. HubSpot or ActiveCampaign are good if you want forms, CRM, and email sequences in one place.\n\n\\- For calendar booking and reminders, reduce no shows with simple automation. When someone books a call, they should get automatic reminders and a followups after the meeting. Calendly is very easy to set up.\n\n\\- For writing and brainstorming, sometimes typing slows you down. Being able to speak your first draft helps you get ideas out quickly, then clean them up after. Voibe also works well here since it lets you dictate into writing tools and AI apps. Other options include tools like Otter for transcription, Notion AI for cleaning up rough drafts.\n\n\\- For content repurposing, create once and reuse it everywhere. Record a video or podcast, then turn it into posts, emails, and blogs. Descript helps with transcripts and editing. Opus Clip turns long videos into short clips. ChatGPT can turn transcripts into posts or blog drafts. Buffer helps you schedule everything so you’re not posting manually every day.\n\n\\- For email sorting and replies, let your inbox organize itself. Instead of reading everything one by one, use tools that sort and draft replies for you. Superhuman is fast and clean. SaneBox auto-sorts emails. Marblism can manage your inbox, draft replies, and handle follow-ups so you just review and send.\n\nKeep in mind: automate clear(tasks for which u have SOPs), repeatable tasks first. If something already works well, automate it. If it’s messy, make a process/SOP before using or trying new tools.",

Your girlfriend walked into the middle of a movie that's been playing for years and you're expecting her to care about the plot twists the same way someone who's been watching from the start does.\n\nThe other thing is that \"sounds busy\" might be her honest response. If she's not an entrepreneur and her job doesn't consume her the same way, she might genuinely not know what to do with the information. She's not being dismissive, she just doesn't have a frame for it. That can feel like the same thing but it isn't.\n\nIt helped me ask myself what I actually needed from the conversation. If it was processing, I started calling a friend who runs a business. If it was connection with her, I stopped leading with work and found something else to talk about that we were both actually in.

When your partner shows no real interest in what is happening in your life or how your day went, it is a serious problem. It does not matter whether the details are big or small. A healthy relationship requires that both people care about each other’s experiences and emotions.\n\nIf taking an interest in your partner’s life does not spark curiosity in you, not about the topic itself but about how it affects you and your connection, then that is a sign of a deeper mismatch. Over time, this lack of engagement always creates frustration and emotional distance. You do not want to waste years in a relationship where your partner cannot or will not be present for you. In those situations, the healthiest choice is to walk away and find someone who genuinely values and participates in your life. If your siblings and parents can show that kind of interest, and probably your friends too, but your partner cannot, then you already know what you have to do.",

He will ask questions and I will answer he asks more questions and then I'm like \"hey babe you make me feel like I need to write a business plan and show you a powerpoint and it's 6 pm right now and I just want to cook dinner.\" Yes I enjoy his enthusiasm but I was not having a business meeting while I make butter chicken. I have hard boundaries when I'm working and when I'm not.

He once asked me why I don't ask questions like you did, my answer \"Because I'd like to keep work at work as much as possible.\" I much rather talk about fall out, or gardening, or whatever hobbies he is into. I value work life balance a lot. \n\nIAlso, I'm exhausted. LOL.  I am working from the moment I get up till I come home. My car ride home I am making plans in my head.

But at some point I started experimenting with a few approaches that most people would probably consider “bad advice,” and weirdly enough, some of those ended up moving the needle way more than the textbook strategies.\n\nIt made me realize that a lot of business advice is context-dependent, and sometimes what sounds wrong on paper works because it fits your market, timing, or strengths better. Now I’m a lot more open to testing ideas that go against the grain instead of just defaulting to what everyone says you’re supposed to do.\n\nSo curious, what’s an unpopular strategy that ended up driving the biggest growth for your business?",

I’m a non-technical founder who has never written a line of code.\n\nGoing from ceo of a 500-person company to a small startup was a shock. Suddenly, I had no one to delegate to. Hiring for marketing or sales would burn through runway, and pulling my small engineering team off the core product to build internal tools felt like a huge waste.\n\nSo I started feeding prompts to claude. I honestly thought it was a joke at first, but it's like becoming a spell-casting wizard without going to wizarding school. In the past month, I've built AI agents that manage my social media engagement, an app that writes my investor updates by pulling from slack and email, and I even rebuilt our entire marketing site in a day.\n\nThe result is my five engineers stay 100% focused on the core product, which has massively increased our velocity. And I can run all founder-led growth myself without hiring, which makes us incredibly capital efficient. It completely changed the trajectory of the business.",

Email marketing can deliver a high ROI if you use it properly.\n\nHow would I start? Just keep it simple.\n\nStart with one automation. The KNOW-LIKE-TRUST email funnel. You can also set up one newsletter if you want.\n\nI have personally worked a lot with ActiveCampaign. There are also many YouTube videos that can help you along the way.\n\nSomething that will save you a lot of time is working with two lists. One for leads and one for customers. For segmentation, work with different tags. Start simple and only then look at how you can segment further.\n\nAbout how often you should email: research has been done on this by Neil Patel. He shows how you can improve your open rate. But it is important that you always test this within your own audience. Also create a content plan. That helps you keep an overview. In this research, they recommend emailing 4 times per week.  \n  \n(NP Digital. (2024, November). *Email marketing insights: Key factors to a 30% email list open rate*. NP Digital.).\n\nAccording to this research, key factors that contribute to a 30% open rate are:\n\n\\- Using a scrubbed email list  \n\\- Applying segmentation  \n\\- Sending fewer than 4 emails per week  \n\\- Sending educational emails  \n\\- Sending emails in the morning  \n\\- Using plain emails  \n\\- Using casual subject lines  \n\\- Personalizing the subject line  \n\\- Resending emails to non-openers  \n\\- Asking questions in the subject line  \n\\- Using urgency in the subject line\n\nEmail marketing is powerful because you manage your own customer database. You are not dependent on social media. You have direct contact with your audience.\n\nThe fact that you delete your emails or don’t open them does not mean your audience does the same. Try to put yourself in their position and think about what your audience would want and need.",

A brand that’s offered me real value before or provided an answer to a problem, preferably in a unique way, without any investment from me. Other than time.\n\n3. A brand that I know has something fresh to say and doesn’t repeat what everyone in their industry is doing, especially as it pertains to selling. When selling feels desperate or there’s fear mongering, that’s when I unsubscribe. \n\nMain takeaway: I think the key word is brand and brands tell stories. Good brands tell good stories that I, the customer can relate to or just am generally interested to hear. When it’s obvious you’re following a trend, why should I listen when Im already getting bombarded with sameness?",

If you can show up with screenshots of actual leads you generated in a test run, even for a fake business or a friend's business, the sales conversation gets ten times easier. Right now you're asking someone to pay you based on a theory.\n\nThe other thing I'd think about is what happens when the Facebook groups catch on. Most community groups have rules against commercial posting and the moderators eventually crack down. So your whole delivery method has a shelf life unless you've figured out a way to post that doesn't look like lead gen.

If necessary offer \"free\" services to get them to talk about you and now you have built a little bit of a reputation and people will trust you a LOT more when you have proof.\n\nFor pricing I would personally suggest doing it commission based but that totally depends on how much money you can bring them per month. If you're happy with your price and they are, go for it!!\n\n Good luck! 🐝",

Local service businesses don’t care about “Facebook strategy,” they care about: “Did this turn into booked jobs this month?” If you can tie your fee directly to revenue (even loosely), your close rate will go way up.\n\nAlso, small positioning tweak: you’re not selling leads. You’re selling **predictable deal flow without them touching marketing.** That framing hits harder.\n\nOne thing I noticed while browsing StartupIdeasDB on Google, a lot of sustainable local-service plays win not because of clever growth hacks, but because they own a repeatable acquisition channel and productize it. If you can turn this into a system instead of a hustle (clear niche, templated posts, standardized response scripts), you’ll have something scalable.\n\nDocument everything. Your first 3 clients are your real product.\n\nRooting for you, building in public like this already puts you ahead.",
