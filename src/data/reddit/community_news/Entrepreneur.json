      "text": "So i started my agency about 2 years ago focused on brand strategy and visual identity, the whole package, deep discovery sessions, custom positioning, the works. That was the vision, thats what i built everything around.\n\nAbout 8 months in i threw in a basic \"brand refresh\" package almost as an afterthought, like a lower entry point for people who werent ready to commit to the full thing. No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week. I genuinely thought it was a filler offer.\n\nFast forward to now and that \"filler\" package accounts for almost 70% of my revenue. The thing i spent months obsessing over barely moves.\n\nHad some money from Stаke saved going into this year which gave me the breathing room to actually sit with this instead of just panicking and restructuring everything. And what i realized is the market doesnt care about what you think your best work is, it cares about what solves their problem fast.\n\nStill not sure if i lean fully into the boring offer and let the premium stuff be a side thing, or if i keep pushing the original vision hoping the positioning catches up.",

If you don't personally like doing the \"boring\" offer, scale by hiring entry-level brand experts and visual designers to run that offering, and spend your own time on the few premium deals that come through.  Let the new hires graduate to the fun stuff if they succeed at the entry level, and as the premium demand warrants.\n\nMakes perfect sense though, for a new agency. Most companies have woefully insufficient marketing budgets.  If they do have the budget, time, and energy to pay for a premium package, they will go pay a premium agency to build it.  You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?  That's an offer people will take, even from a market newcomer, because the alternative is to have Joe from Sales try to draw the new logo, and you are definitely better than Joe from Sales.\n\nIn time, with lots of happy customers whose brands are enhanced, some will become very successful and need more from you, and you will also develop a reputation that wins you more of the premium business.",

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Listen to it. Your \"vision\" offer can be the upsell for people who come in through the boring one. Use the brand refresh as the front door, then offer the full strategy package to the people who loved the refresh and want more.

Agencies aren't as unique as they like to present and believe in.

Capitalize on the interest and frenzy buying of the new shiny cheap thing before someone at your agency figures it out and goes off to start their own agency and capitalizes on what you didn't!",

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Better than losing your money to something you don't understand.\n\n\nHere's the easiest investment you can make:\n\n\n- Open up a Roth IRA with Fidelity or Vanguard.\n\n\n- Also open up a regular taxable brokerage account with either.\n\n\n- Add the maximum amount of money for the year to your Roth IRA ($7500 for 2026).\n\n\n- Buy a target date retirement fund for roughly the year you'd like to retire (Vanguard VTTSX-2060 or VFIFX-2050, Fidelity FFFHX-2050 or FDKLX-2060).\n\n\n- Repeat the same with your taxable brokerage account. Put in as much money as you want, buy the same fund.\n\n\n- Keep adding money to the funds as often as you want. For the Roth, you can't put in more than $7500/year, but no limits on the brokerage. Buy nothing else. You can literally just keep adding money to the exact same target date funds and never do anything else.\n\n\n- Target date funds invest everything for you. They buy and sell various stocks and bonds and they rebalance based on how close you are to retirement. When you're young, they'll have more money in stocks and move away from them as you get older. The beauty though is you do nothing, just keep adding money to them.\n\n\nThat's it. Congratulations you will outperform almost all other investors.",

Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, your bank, or whatever preferred platform you want to use. Roth IRAs tax the money when it goes in, not when it comes out at or after age 65. That's best, because it gets taxed before the balance grows, so you pay less. Again, put it into an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nMax out your 401(k) contribution up to the amount that your employer will match, either total or partial. Again, allocate it to an index fund.\n\nAfter that, the easiest thing to do is to put the remaining chunk that you want to invest into an index fund through Fidelity or similar.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't invest in anything other than index funds unless you're really hardcore, and even then, it probably isn't worth it lol",

Having an extra  50-100k would have helped them stay in business just long enough to maybe be successful. That + business knowledge pushes survival to 8/10 over 3 years IME. \n\n\nEdit: I also want to note that depending on the area (I'm assuming 714 is SoCal) rents can be insanely expensive for businesses. \n\n\nFor Esthianians, barbers, accountants, massage, etc... What I've often seen work is people working for someone else, building a client base, \"renting a booth\" (or the equivalent. For music producers it would be a studio space) and THEN starting their own business.\n\n\nThis is especially true for people in the beauty/physical realm, since the large amount of turnover means your meeting future potential employees/co-owners/lesees. \n\n\nThere's a few people I've met who after working in the industry for 5-10 yrs opened there own shop and within 2 years opened a second, because of how deep their rolladex of contacts was. ",

Almost everyone who comes to r/Entrepreneur to ask for advice is asking about something that has been discussed extensively. That's just the bell curve that is real life. Most problems are typical problems.\n\nIn your case, I think you should consider that **your current job is your passive income**. Because if you're saving 75%+ of your income, then you are already halfway there: you just went backwards. The trope of the successful entrepreneur is:\n\n1. Come up with working business idea  \n2. Have plenty of money with little effort\n\n[You did the opposite. ](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-20-2017/_IufW-.gif) Step 2 is done, so now it's on to step 1.\n\nGetting your aesthetician license is a great idea, especially if you can stay full-time. It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans. Hang out in forums like this one. \n\nCongrats! And good luck.",

              "text": "Aww I’m sorry 😞 \nwanna hear something crazy? About a year ago I had one of my maintenance worker quit due to health reasons and his age.. His job title was to clean three properties. He would start at 8 AM and be done by 1 PM latest. Just picking up trash and making sure the property was clean. That’s it. And 80% of the time the properties were always clean because people pick up after themselves. So the dude would get to go home early if he was finished. And since he lived on site at one of the properties, we gave him a huge discount on his rent. About $800 off. And I believe the position paid $19 an hour (not great, but not bad either for the little work you do). Well, my cousin‘s girlfriend was looking for a job and she lives with my cousin at one of the properties I manage. They currently pay about $2000 for a one bedroom one bath.\n\nI told her that he quit and that she should apply immediately with my company. At the time, she wasn’t working and was looking for a job. She could definitely benefit from the rental discount PLUS, she could be done with work at 1 PM and the rest of the day could be spent doing something else or another part-time job... Well, she never took me up on that offer. And now she’s working 12 hour shifts at T-Mobile making minimum wage. I don’t understand how someone could turn down an $800 rental discount plus the decent pay. She never even told me why she didn’t want the job. She would just say “oh okay” any time I’d mention it. I even told her that there was plenty of opportunity for her to move up in the company. And I was right. A couple months later, one of our leasing agents quit and the position was available. I would’ve been able to train her and the job would’ve been hers. Knowing the owner, he would’ve allowed me to train her.",

Since you're starting aesthetician school, consider digital services that complement that path - maybe skincare consulting, beauty content creation, or even a beauty subscription box. Your property management background actually gives you valuable operational skills that most beauty entrepreneurs lack. Start small with something that leverages your existing knowledge while you're in school. The key is picking ONE thing and validating demand before you invest heavily.

Pick ONE problem you understand.\n\nNot 'e-commerce' broadly.Something specific. For me, I noticed developers struggle with resumes so I built a tool for that.\n\n2. Build something small that solves it. Doesn't need to be perfect. Just works.\n\n3. Talk to the people who have that problem. Reddit is great for this actually.\n\n4. Improve based on what they tell you.\n\nThe people travelling the world didn't get there overnight. They just started somewhere and kept going.\n\nAlso, aesthetician school + salon owner is a legit path too. Maybe there's even a way to combine both like a tool for salon owners? Just thinking out loud.\n\nHappy to share more if helpful. Good luck either way",

It sounds like you haven’t been making $9k/month for very long. \n\nIf I had to start over from your position this is what I would do. \n\nKeep your expenses low. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing as long as you can. Save up $150k-$250k or as close to it as you can. It’s gonna take you about 4 years. Based on your line of questioning, you may have shiny object syndrome. The “business” is the shiny object. If you can’t save up that amount in 4 years at $9k/month then take a look at your lifestyle and budget better to save money wherever possible. Live on $50k and invest $50k into the S&P or some index per year. \n\nFor now, don’t try to start a salon business from scratch. Buy one that’s already profitable with the money you save up. But don’t cash out your investments, use it as collateral to buy the business. Go do your own research for buying a business, seller financing is popular these days.\n\nBefore you buy a beauty salon, get a job in one to learn how it works. Buy one that’s been profitable for a good enough time frame, for me that would be 5 years minimum. \n\nThe reason you buy one is because it’s gonna cost you a lot to start up, and a lot of time and risk. If you get into the business and you find out that it’s not for you, you can sell it and get your money back because it was a profitable asset when you bought it.\n\nI was taught this by a former client who buys businesses, holds them, and sells them, for a living. Personally, I wish I took that route. It would’ve saved me a lot of pain and tears. Goodluck.",

One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000.

Not because the interviews give you a perfect roadmap, but because they reveal assumptions you didn't even know you were making.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: pay attention to what people are currently doing to solve the problem, not just whether they say they'd use your product. If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

Be genuine, not salesy. Something like \"Hey, I'm researching [problem]. Would you be open to a 15 minute chat? No pitch, just trying to understand the space better.\"\n\nLinkedIn works well too, especially for B2B. Filter by job title and industry, then send connection requests with a short note about your research.\n\nThe other underrated move is posting in relevant communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack groups) asking people to share their experience with the problem. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to talk when you frame it as learning, not selling.\n\nStart with 5. Once you get comfortable with the format, the next 25 come much easier.",

People say yes to be polite. Instead I started asking \"walk me through the last time you dealt with \\[problem\\]\" and just listening.

          "text": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

Talking to people early feels uncomfortable, but it saves you from months of false confidence. Your point about prioritizing sales and feedback over perfection is spot on. A rough product with real users teaches you more in weeks than a polished one sitting unused.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this honestly.

I have always noticed that being early to new channels that are growing often helps a ton for growth! For example, we were first to be super active in reddit communities our customers hang out at and genuinely help and this gave us a lot of early growth. Today its slightly tougher cause Reddit is quiet saturated but still works tho.\n\nSo curious, what is the most underrated marketing channel most Entrepreneurs ignore in 2026?",

But since more and more people were getting answers from Gemini, ChatGPT etc, we noticed both the users and these tools behind the scene ran super long tail search queries like \"what is the best software to do XYZ for financial assistants in United States?\" etc. \n\nSo we basically setup a process using Frizerly to look at search data and  auto-publish blogs on our website daily exactly answering these questions one by one using AI. The content is written with our tool as the authoritative answer when it makes sense!\n\nThis has helped up basically be mentioned constantly by Googles AI overview and gemini over time.

But what I mean is actually posting consistently with a point of view, not just resharing articles and hoping for the best.\n\nHere's what most people get wrong: they treat LinkedIn like a resume. The people crushing it on LinkedIn right now are the ones treating it like a micro-blog where they share actual opinions, lessons, and behind-the-scenes of what they're building.\n\nWhat makes it underrated in 2026 specifically:\n\n* Organic reach is still insanely high compared to Instagram/Twitter. A post with 50 likes can get 10K+ impressions easily.\n* The audience has buying power. You're not reaching teenagers, you're reaching decision-makers.\n* Most people post boring corporate stuff, so standing out is easier than you'd think.\n\nThe founders and consultants I've seen do well on LinkedIn all share one thing: they post consistently (3-5x/week) and they talk about their actual experience, not generic advice.\n\nIt's not sexy, but for B2B? Nothing else comes close in terms of ROI per hour spent.",

It's not follower count. It's just consistency, and having an actual point of view.\n\nThe people generating real pipeline aren't the ones with 10k followers. They're the ones posting 3-4x a week with very specific content for a very specific audience. Not \"tips for entrepreneurs\" but like \"why retainer clients are a trap for new coaches\" kind of stuff. Opinionated, polarizing a little bit.\n\nThe algorithm right now rewards niche authority way more than broad reach and most people haven't figured that out yet.\n\nCombine that with Reddit and you've got a pretty underrated combo honestly.

You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

You should look for tools that focus on structured data and clean layouts rather than artistic slides.\n\nI recommend trying tools like Gamma or Tome or even Genspark which use AI to build the layout and content for you. This allows you to focus on the logical flow of the offer while the system handles the visual friction.\n\nIn sales the winner is the one who makes the information easiest to digest. If your presentation is clear then the customer can make a decision faster. Focus on a clean baseline and let the tools handle the rest.",

          "text": "Yep it happened to me not long ago. I few weeks ago I realized I was spending more hours into admin stuff and just coordinating my team instead of devoting quality time on bringing in more leads, strategizing, whatnot.\n\nAt first I was reluctant to hire more people or an assistant until I heard EM talking about how it’s easier to make more by taking risks than by saving.  \nSo I did two things. \n\nFirst, I needed to change how my team operated and started to change my teams mindset. I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled. I was able to devote time to improving my sales pitch, improving our demand gen tools and just accelerating deals closed. Hope this if helpful in any way.",

Even one trusted team lead per location who handles first level schedule issues can cut your involvement dramatically.\n\nThird, tighten policies. Last minute chaos often comes from vague rules. Clear deadlines for time off requests and swap approvals reduce back and forth.\n\nThis stage is common, but if you keep absorbing all the coordination yourself, it will only grow heavier as you scale.\n\nYou are not doing something wrong.

Traditional 4-year degree just to have a backup? Probably not worth it if you are already executing.\n\nOne thing I would watch out for: at 19, your network is small.

Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

You can always take online classes to work towards a degree if they becomes necessary, and some colleges will give you credits for your business experience to shorten the time and classes required.\n\nYou can always sell your business to cash out and take time off to get a degree if you wish, but I think you will want to see how far you can go with your agency over the coming 5+ years as who knows how far it can grow.\n\nOnce you do get to a level of financial success you can travel the world however you wish. Also, look into organizations like Rotary, Kiwanis, or some other local groups where business owners meet. I travelled to conferences held for owners and principals in the business I owned, and it was great to connect and network with others doing what I as doing, so look for those opportunities. \n\nOne tip is to start putting money away early and save as much as you can.

And the mom of the lead singer girl made her go to college,  first, and then revisit her music career. They *never* got back to where they were before she dropped it to go to college. \n\nI think my point is, if you're building, and it is still in the early stages, see if you can get that degree now. And go for one that actually helps you with your business/niche. \nIf you've done a lot of building, and it has (starter to) really take off, don't just drop your business.  \n\nAnd there's lots of space between 'dropping the business and going 100% for the degree' and 'focusing 100% in your business and NOT getting a degree at all'.",

You control the decisions, but you also own every consequence. The floor is zero (or negative if you take on debt), but the ceiling is uncapped.\n\n  \nThe real question is which type of risk you are better equipped to handle. Someone with no savings and dependents? Employment risk is actually more manageable for them because the downside of a failed business is way worse than getting laid off with severance.\n\n  \nSomeone with 12 months of runway and in-demand skills? Entrepreneurship risk is very manageable because even if the business fails, they can go get a job again.\n\n  \nThe dangerous myth on both sides is treating it as binary. The smartest people I know built something on the side while employed, validated it, then made the jump once the risk profile shifted in their favor. That is not playing it safe, that is just good risk management.",

          "text": "This isn't a hot take. It's the same cliché flipped upside down.\n\n\"Corporate jobs are safe\" is a myth. Agreed. But \"entrepreneurs control their destiny\" is equally romantic. You don't control the market. You don't control your customers' decisions. You don't control the economy, the timing, or whether someone with more resources builds the same thing faster. You traded one type of uncertainty for another and called it freedom.\n\nThe real question isn't which path is riskier. It's which kind of risk you're equipped to handle, and whether you've thought honestly about why you're choosing it. \"I want control\" sounds empowering until you realize most new businesses don't fail because the founder lacked control. They fail because the founder didn't know what to build, who to build it for, or why it mattered beyond revenue.\n\nAnd the conspiracy angle at the end weakens an otherwise interesting conversation. \"Media wants us to stay employees\" isn't critical thinking. It's just suspicion wearing the costume of insight. The real reason most people stay in corporate jobs isn't brainwashing. It's that entrepreneurship demands a kind of self-knowledge that most people haven't done the work to develop. That's not a media problem. That's a human one.\n\nBoth paths are hard. Both paths are uncertain. The difference isn't control. It's whether you've been honest with yourself about what you actually want and what you're willing to lose to get it.",

Everyone loves golf, watching football, 5pm beers, same jokes, same hobbies/interests and has little to no vitality or life/personality to them, always made me sick being around my coworkers tbh. It’s such a safe environment.\n\nYou have little to no control over anything and are constantly told what to do, I guess good for you if you’re into that. Rn I’m taking advantage of being remote and an effective 1 hour workday and dumping time & money into a new venture. Once it takes off I will just keep slacking and collecting paychecks until someone notices and fires me\n\nI’m 26 and I just cracked $110k in a VHCOL city, jobs really are ‘just over broke,’ I’m not going to be able to own a house or really anything with bullshit 2% raises. Ive accomplished certifications and went above my role and framed it a year before to ensure it would lead to better raise/rating only for it not to happen.\n\nThis is my perspective to all of you who clearly never worked a corporate job and don’t know as much as you think you do but keep promoting it so shhh. Being in corporate also promotes scarcity & risk aversion, the older you get the more locked in you are into your role & skill set and fear losing it",

          "text": "If you get laid off from a corporate job you probably get another corporate job fairly soon, because your resume has job titles and proven experience in a specific job that corporates hire for.  If you've been an entrepreneur for several years, your job history will be a mish-mash of every function of a company - you've done some accounting, some legal, some marketing, some sales, some etc etc.  You don't have proven experience at any specific corporate job.  So, yes, it's a lot riskier, because if your business fails you're going to have a hell of a time replacing the income.\n\nAlso, in a corporate job you typically have a benefits plan that includes PTO and short and long term disability.  If you suddenly develop lupus or whatever, as a corporate employee, you have a viable financial path (not that living on 60% of your income is _easy_, but it's at least _possible_).  If you're unable to work as a solo or small company entrepreneur, even in you have disability insurance, the company itself is going to run out of money without you and be unable to pay the premiums.  More likely you just never signed up for this kind of insurance because it was way too expensive, particularly STD.\n\nThe reality is that owning your own business is a great deal more risky than being an employee, even taking layoffs into account.  Nobody actually controls their destiny, but corporate employees are typically way better off when bad things happen.",

We stopped running brainstorming sessions entirely and started monitoring support tickets, Reddit complaints, and Trustpilot reviews in adjacent industries.\n\nThe \"boring\" observation is completely right. Our most profitable project last year was automating compliance documentation for a logistics company. Nobody at a hackathon would pitch that. But the client had three full-time people doing it manually and was desperate for a solution.\n\nOne thing I'd add: when you find the anger, pay attention to how people describe the problem, not just the problem itself. The language they use becomes your marketing copy almost word for word. If someone says \"I waste two hours every Monday reconciling invoices,\" that's your landing page headline.",

Compliance stuff, niche scheduling, industry-specific reporting. Zero competition because no developer thinks it's cool enough to build. But the customers are sticky as hell because switching costs in niche workflows are brutal.\n\n  \nThe \"search for anger\" framing is perfect too.

      "text": "Solo founder here. Built a PDF editor over the past year. Just hit 10k downloads with zero marketing spend.\n\n\n\nNot a unicorn story - making \\~$500/month - but wanted to share what actually worked vs what I thought would work.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PRODUCT\n\n\n\nPDF editor that's:\n\n\\- 20MB (vs Adobe's 300MB)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n\\- No signup/cloud required\n\n\\- Free on desktop, small one-time payment on mobile\n\n\n\nBuilt it because I was tired of bloated PDF tools that force everything through the cloud.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK (Spoiler: Didn't)\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt Launch: Ranked #284\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks preparing\n\n\\- Got 50 upvotes\n\n\\- \\~200 visits\n\n\\- 12 downloads\n\n\\- Felt like a complete failure\n\n\n\nHackerNews (First Attempt): 11 points, 0 comments\n\n\\- Posted at wrong time\n\n\\- Didn't engage in comments fast enough\n\n\\- Buried in /new within an hour\n\n\n\nMy Own X/Twitter: 3-4 likes per post\n\n\\- Tweeted about launches\n\n\\- Crickets\n\n\\- My followers don't care about my product (harsh truth)\n\n\n\nPaid Ads: Didn't even try\n\n\\- No budget as bootstrapped founder\n\n\\- Heard horror stories about burning money\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKED\n\n\n\n1. SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement. Users added my product themselves.\n\n\n\nWhen people search \"Adobe alternative\" or \"lightweight PDF editor\" - they find these directories first, not my website.\n\n\n\nResult: Steady stream of 50-100 downloads per day just from directories.\n\n\n\nLesson: SEO isn't just Google. Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) >>> channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth. But solve a real problem well, and people will talk about it.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCURRENT METRICS (Full Transparency)\n\n\n\nRevenue: \\~$500/month (\\~50 paid users at $10 one-time purchase)\n\nDownloads: 10,000+ total (across all platforms)\n\nTime to build: \\~10 months (nights/weekends while working day job)\n\nMarketing spend: $0\n\nTeam: Just me\n\nFunding: $0 (bootstrapped)\n\n\n\nGeographic breakdown:\n\n\\- 40% Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region)\n\n\\- 35% India\n\n\\- 15% USA\n\n\\- 10% Rest of world\n\n\n\nPlatform breakdown:\n\n\\- 60% Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - completely free\n\n\\- 40% Mobile (iOS/Android) - freemium\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I'M LEARNING\n\n\n\n1. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT > MARKETING\n\n\n\nUsers market products that solve real problems. You don't need to.\n\n\n\n2. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE IS REAL\n\n\n\nBiggest market: Germany\n\nMy location: Not Germany\n\nMy German language skills: Zero\n\n\n\nBuilt for global market with strong principles (privacy, offline-first). Germans loved it. Now I'm learning German and translating the app.\n\n\n\nSometimes your product finds its market before you do.\n\n\n\n3. FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community. You all have been through this before.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

Without code signing, business will not touch your product (they will have policies that would block it). \n\nI would do 3 things right now\n\n1) Code signing - bite the bullet and wear the costs, you are leaving money on the table without it.  \n2) Create excellent documentation, make it easy to find (in app) and search - ie work to keep support emails to a minimum.  \n3) Segment the market - $10 for private, at least $50 for business (they can afford it, and you need to cover your extra overheads).  \n\nJust be prepared for a lot of extra work selling to business - whilst some people can use their credit cards, get ready for dealing with requests for quotes and  purchase orders for $50 which can really suck up your free time (and your will to live).  \n\nGood luck.",

One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads. That's worth calling out.",

The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on. I'm still trying to decide between one-time and subscription for my own app. At $10 per user you'd need a LOT of volume to make it work no?",

My tool helps with hiring for small businesses that need to qualify and make decisions on ideal candidates.. I am not here to sell but i would be remiss if I did not mention it.  I know you mentioned that your posts for your product only got a few likes whereas someone else posting got so many more. I am curious if you had any social media community when you started or if you think building one is important? Also, thank you for discussing imposter syndrome. It would mean the world to me to generate $500/mo and while this is not my final goal it puts the upcoming process into much more perspective. Thanks again for sharing. Best wishes on reaching your milestones.",

Meanwhile demand for recovered materials - copper, gold, rare earth metals - is only going up as supply chains tighten.\n\nThe business case is real. But what makes it interesting from an entrepreneurship standpoint is the structure of the market.\n\nTo operate legitimately and land corporate clients, you need R2v3 or e-Stewards certification. These are industry standards that verify your downstream - meaning you can prove where materials actually end up. Most large corporations now require this from their recycling vendors.\n\nThat certification requirement acts as a real moat. It keeps casual competitors out. But it also means the barrier to entry is higher than just buying equipment and opening a warehouse.\n\nThe compliance side is genuinely complex - documentation, audits, downstream vendor diligence, ongoing reporting. Most people looking to enter the space underestimate this part completely.\n\nThe entrepreneurs I've seen succeed in this space treat compliance as a competitive advantage rather than a cost. Once you're certified with MG Environmental Consulting, you're in a much smaller pool competing for enterprise contracts.\n\nCurious if anyone here has explored this space or knows people in it.",

Most recycling programs are bullshit but some of them are okay. \n\nBattery recycling is something that makes sense and the only reason is because it’s profitable at a certain scale and efficiency. \n\n1st Problem is feedstock. It’s a “reverse distribution, logistics” kinda business. Where are you going to collect the batteries? How many kg/ton per location? How many locations? How many trucks needed? Depending on your location, are you charging a disposal fee? Are you collecting for free? Or are you paying the disposer a rebate? \n\nNext problem is Capex and know how. Processing plants are not cheap, and you need to get licensing and approval from govt agencies etc. And then there’s the know how. Nobody who’s figured it out will actually teach you the best and efficient way to extract the maximum amount of black mass from your feedstock. It requires a lot of R&D and by R&D I mean trial and error. So it’s actually a business with a very high barrier to entry IMO. It cannot be bootstrapped.

They were applying for certification back in the early days of the industry, and it was the guy that wrote the standard they were trying to certify against that came in to do the audit. He took one look at the software, and said we should sell it to other companies - it's exactly what was needed in the industry.\n\nSo I did. Re-wrote it as a SaaS and worked with a few other ITADs to get feedback, then launched about 10 years ago.\n\nOne thing everyone seems to be missing in the replies here - e-waste can be a little misleading. Here in the UK we tend to use the term ITAD (IT Asset Disposition). The main focus is NOT on destroying PCs, but rather on refurbishing them for onward sale. Just because a large enterprise customer has decided to replace the machines, it doesnt mean they are dead. Erasing the hard disks and re-selling the machines is big business.\n\nAnd with sustainability being a key thing here in the UK and Europe, proper reporting on this can be a massive boost to ITADs.",

Right now your landing page exists to tell a story, build trust, handle objections, and nudge someone toward a purchase. But when an agent is doing the shopping, none of that matters. It's just parsing your structured data, comparing you against 50 competitors in seconds, and making a decision based on price, availability, and whatever criteria the human set. All that conversion optimization work becomes invisible to a huge chunk of your traffic. I think we're going to see businesses basically running two parallel experiences whether they realize it or not. The human-facing one with all the emotional triggers and brand storytelling, and the agent-facing one that competes purely on data quality, response speed, and how cleanly you expose your catalog. The interesting thing is that the agent channel actually rewards transparency and punishes the kind of pricing games and dark patterns that work on humans. If your competitor's API returns clean structured pricing and yours requires three clicks and a popup to reveal the real number, the agent just skips you entirely.",
