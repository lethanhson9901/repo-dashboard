      "text": "So here’s the story.\n\nI was looking at some car accessories and kept seeing the same products priced at what felt like a crazy markup. Out of curiosity, I started digging into Alibaba to see what the actual manufacturing cost looked like. After a decent amount of research into suppliers, reviews, and verifying the manufacturer, I pulled the trigger on one unit.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was honestly expecting stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff quality. But it wasn’t. The build quality was on par with the name-brand US versions I’d been comparing it to.\n\nJust for fun, I threw it up on Facebook Marketplace to see if there was any interest. The response surprised me. My all-in cost including shipping was around $1,200. Comparable products were selling locally for $2,500+. I had multiple inquiries within days.\n\nSo now I’m testing it for real. Bought a few more units, planning to flip them. If it works, I’ll open an LLC and do everything above board.\nHere’s where my background helps: I work in logistics, so I’ve been able to optimize shipping and cut some costs that I think most people wouldn’t know how to avoid. I’m wondering if that gives me a legitimate edge, or if this whole space is so saturated that margins get crushed the moment you try to scale.\n\nMy questions for this community:\n\n\t∙\tIs the “Alibaba to local resale” model played out, or are there still niches where this works?\n\t∙\tDid I just get lucky with this particular product category, or is there a repeatable process here?\n\t∙\tFor those who’ve done this: what’s the capital requirement to actually make it a real business vs. a side hustle?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s tried this, whether it worked or didn’t. Not looking for validation; just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing seriously or if I should just enjoy the quick wins and move on.",

It's information gap plus supply chain superpowers plus those cool localization bonuses. And this model? It's like a classic that never gets old, always in style! It's all about finding those niche tracks.\n\n\n\nYour success isn't just some random luck. It's as easy to copy - paste as it can be! You've made three really important moves. One, pick high - profit auto parts. There's hardly any competition there, like hens' teeth, and the local price - markup space is huge. Two, be a pro at factory - checking. This way, you can avoid those annoying pitfalls and get quality as good as big - name brands. Three, use the perks of logistics to cut costs.\n\n\n\nThe blue ocean is still out there, waiting for you! Focus on parts for those rare car models and those less popular modified parts. Stay away from those overcrowded, red - ocean commodities. How much money do you need to turn a side gig into a full - time main business? Start with 30,000 - 50,000 US dollars. That can cover 3 - 4 batches of stock, local storage, and some Facebook promotion. Planning to expand? Make exclusive deals with suppliers in advance to keep making those profits.\n\n\n\nMost people have problems because of the headaches of bulk - goods quality inspection. But here's the solution: get a reliable Chinese agent! They'll be your factory - checking partner, manufacturing supervisor, logistics optimizer, and help you keep your core advantages.\n\n\n\nThis business has a lot of growth potential! Don't just go for a quick profit. Systematize it right away! Come on, guys, let's do this!",

A hot tub in your primary residence is one thing, in a rental as a business is totally different. They look and sound cool, esp the though of getting off the slopes into a hot tub right there on the property. However, my insurance went way up with them in and it was difficult to find solid people to maintain and clean them as needed. I have a solid cleaning service for the properties as I do rent them, but they don't do hot tubs. I ended up remodeling the bathrooms and putting jetted tubs in. Same experience indoors and no insurance issues.\n\nAgain, just my personal experience. I have a home in Dillon (non rental) and rentals in Breck, ABasin and Copper. \n\nI post this as something to think about before spending a bunch on inventory, etc. Here is a good example of what i mean insurance wise - [https://legalclarity.org/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-a-hot-tub/](https://legalclarity.org/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-a-hot-tub/)",

          "text": "I do a ton of sourcing and importing as a service. I work with basically the future version of you, companies who already have sales to justify volume. Just for context anyway.\n\n\\- Is Alibaba to local played out?\n\nNo. But it's less about the business structure and more about what type of product actually sells locally, is there used versions available locally, and how to play it off. For some products, yes, it's played out. Maybe not having anything to do with it coming from Alibaba, vs maybe just there is a lot of competition on Marketplace with just used ones. Or, there just isn't the demand. Be careful with just getting interest. Marketplace is natorious for tons of people asking if it's still available, but not ultimately selling it. I don't know why, just how people behave on the platform.\n\n\n\n\\- Did you get lucky?\n\nI guess I wouldn't know. I don't know that luck has much to do with business. You took a chance and it paid off (Assuming it sold, I didn't catch if it did or not)\n\n\n\n\\- Is there a repeatable process?\n\nI'm assuming you mean, can you repeat this with other products? The answer is basically the first question. It depends on your local dynamics. \n\n  \n\\- Is there a real business here?\n\nNo, it's a side hustle. It won't scale. Meaning, to make more money, you have to work harder. There is very little you can do to change that. And you will have to continue essentially finding entirely new products to take that chance on as the old ones get local market saturation.\n\n That's not to say it's  not worth pursuing for the fun, experience and maybe side cash. But what this does do is ties your time and money up on something with limited potential. If you don't have a lot of entrepreneurial dreams, this is fine. But if you do have those dreams, aside from this being a good learning experience, it's what will keep you from those dreams. It absolutely will hold your entrepreurial dreams back if you ever wanted to have something less side hustle and more full on scalable business.\n\n\n\n\\- Does your logistics background help?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of people that get into reselling, regardless of the platform. They have cost prohibitive freight costs. If you have solved that problem, you are ahead of the curve no matter what you do. It essentially adds a layer of competitive advantage on landed cost. At least as far as you can have with shipping so few. But judging by the price point, I am assuming the CBM is relatively large. Meaning shipping just a few can still be above the first tier of economies of scale. Of course if you ship a whole container at once, or at least the more CBM the lower the cost. But if your outlet is marketplace, that probably isn't a possibility. Then it becomes filling that CBM with multiple different products. But honestly, I don't see that being a good business if your outlet is just market place. You might be better off actually starting a brand where you have a site and try to get distribution. Just the larger the item, the harder that gets because of the then shippng cost to the end user. But, still maybe worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\\- LLC?\n\nNo, don't do this until you have proven there is enough sales to justify. You are selling on a platform known for buying used things. You are selling them as an individual. You don't have nearly the level of reason to protect yourself as someone really needing that LLC or whatever structure. Of course you still report the income as pass-through, so you are legit enough. If you go into selling serious volume, then yes. But at this level, it's a hard not-worth-it.",

Really depends on the product.\n\nIf you’re in logistics, can be helpful, but really only if you’re selling a volume product. I suspect your item has a pretty limited TAM.\n\nThe BEST part is that there are Chinese firms who have entire business units set up to find and “knock off” resellers doing this. So you might find a niche for a quarter or so, but don’t think you’ll be alone for long. And then you’ll be left holding the bag when the bottom drops out. Really squeezes the margins too.",

You know how many people never start because “SEO is played out,” “affiliate marketing is played out,” “email marketing is played out”?? A fuck ton. The answer is no, it’s not played out.\n2. Did you get lucky? You probably did, yes. But this is also essentially business 101. You’re asking “is there a repeatable process for finding market opportunities?” Of course there is. But also don’t worry about that question either for now. If you’re asking these questions, you’re not ready to think about, much less execute on multiple products. Start with the thing that’s working and learn from there.\n3. Capital requirements? You’ll have to ask a better question to get a better answer. How could we answer this without at least understanding your definition of “real business vs side hustle?”\n\nIf you’d only pursue this if you could make $1M/year in profit, for example, the answers to your questions are very different than if you define success as making $10k/mo profit",

MOQ, tooling, QC, shipping, customs, returns, storage, platform fees, and customer support will easily double or triple costs.\n\nFalse differentiation:\n“Unique” car accessories are easy to clone.

If so, it will justify the higher cost the consumer is paying, and make it more difficult for local competitors to just cut-and-paste your business model.\n\nFinding the right manufacturer is key.  Manufacturers in China are structured very differently than in the US or Europe.  Our companies design products from the ground up, which results in a lot of replication of effort, whereas the Chinese might have one company that makes the really hard part of something, like an engine for an excavator, and then all the companies making excavators buy that one engine.  A bit of a simplistic example but you get the idea.  This model results in many, many manufacturers of excavators so you need to find the ones who really know what they are doing.  A trip to China would help.  They have shows there where you can talk to them all for a given industry.",

In other words, how do you make people buy the things you want, and how do you maximize your product purchases so they turnover quickly?\n\nIf you think about how to build a business like that, for the long term, you need some sort of moat or defense. It could be coming up with your own brand, figuring out a website/direct marketing that gives you access to more customers, et cetera.\n\nOne idea I really like here, is that you find some sort of product where you can offer a value add, like the hot tubs. You sell \"one stop hot tub solutions\", sell high margin add ones like installation that make it a complete product, and hire out labor to help. You could do saunas, outdoor pizza ovens, home gyms, home battery backup, e-bikes, smart breakers, bathroom vanities, design walls. This is less a product business, and more a services company powered by low costs, so don't disregard concerns like warranties, reputation, or operations.\n\nSo many options, but the basic play is buy cheap overseas -> have reliable lead geneartion through branding + web + social -> provide a product with complete services you can heavily mark up.\n\nFor next steps, I'd just keep small, try a few things out, then see how you could scale something after it works a few times! You're basically closer to success than like 50% of startups I've worked at!",

It works for sure, but the real question is how long you gonna stay ahead.\n\nThis thing is super saturated, so finding a niche is something you hold close to your chest. There’s a ton of VA’s  and full time resellers who literally spend all day scrolling Facebook Marketplace looking for the exact same deals you’re chasing.\n\nHere’s what usually happens. You’ll knock out five units quick at $2,500 each and feel like you just discovered fire. Then all of a sudden nothing moves. Next thing you know, the same item shows up from somebody else at $2,300. You drop yours to $2,200 to keep selling. They go lower. You go lower again.\n\nPretty soon you’re in a full on race to the bottom and eating your own profits.\n\nSo your real edge is gonna be that logistical experience on the import side. Mind if I ask you some questions regarding logistics? \n\nWhen ordering from Alibaba and scaling up, what are some of the specific tricks you’re using to keep shipping and import costs low that most beginners totally miss? Like smarter freight choices, consolidation, duty stuff, or anything else that’s actually saving you money and helping protect those margins?\n\nInterested in learning more. I had a product idea on a small niche plastic product but hesitant because I need to order 5000 min units. I work in AI first Digital marketing, happy to trade info if you need anything :)",

But honestly I feel really sad because I keep feeling like I’m “missing something” and maybe I don’t have a real future And I’m actually a failure because my standardized testing scores are all bad.\nI opened the car wash after borrowing 53k$ from my dad (he’s not rich he just believed in me) It took me 3 months to convince him I went to him every day until he finally agreed.\nRight now the business makes around 13k/month in revenue, and about 4000$/month net profit (because it’s Manuel car wash with workers) (even while paying back the loan).\nBut despite that, I feel like something is missing in my life I can’t even explain it properly\nI don’t have stories. I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

Most of the times the feeling passes but if it lingers you may need to think inward and explore what your true passions are in life and pursue them. \n\nI went from climbing and cutting to management lately and grew very unhappy and complacent in work and life. Always feeling like something was missing. I found out that went away when I actually got out and did tree work which is my passion. I did more exploring within myself and realized I love helping others so I started another tree service (non-profit) that helps people at subsidized or no cost. \n\nIn conclusion, find out what you have a true passion for whether it’s in work or a hobby and let that bring you fulfillment and joy. The car wash may just be income but don’t give up on it. If you can find joy in other parts of your life the negative feelings about the car wash will go away. From one stranger to another I am incredibly proud of you for starting a business and I wish you success!\n\nYou need to travel. This will help some of the feelings you have but don’t lose sight of your business. Also, consider getting a mentor or a psychologist/therapist. This can help sort through your thoughts and come to your own conclusions. See the car wash through, scale it, hire employees that can run it without you but don’t stop managing the business. You’ve made a commitment to your dad and yourself. See it through.",

So don't lose track of that you took a risk and it's working right now but that isn't a given forever.  I would think there's some pretty costly stuff in a carwash so planning/implementing how your going to set aside capital for that maintenance and pay all your other liabilities should be a big goal.  Work on building a solid foundation and systemetising everything. So you can eventually step away and your company will self perpetuate. Then you can put your energy into the next big thing\n\nStay hungry,  most teenagers are actual capable of this kind of thing but their friends and what not are the reason they don't.  Not that you can't have fun and hang out. But the best way to kill a dream is to introduce someone to a person with a smaller mind/vision. They tend to drag you down to their level \"whatever that is\" more than lift you up. \n\nSo be careful with that. Live your life, have fun but what you have right now is really hard to get so don't take that for granted.",

You will meet others in the same place in life, although you'll most likely be the youngest. I think you could, from this point, begin a journey of accumulating assets, which will help get you separated out in a good way, to a place of financial independence. Learn about real estate, for example, and all of the different ways to make money with residential properties. Read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. There's this woman, Codie Sanchez, who has a PhD, worked on Wall Street, and now owns a portfolio of businesses. This video is about doing exactly that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM), and she teaches you how to approach owners to buy their business, using their money.

If people are waiting for their car to get washed, you have a captive audience so you might be able to add retail like coffee, juice, snacks, car accessories, etc.  \n\nAlso, I don't know how it is in Saudi, but in the US as a business owner your are part of a special club of business owners.  Other business owners will likely talk to you and treat you as an equal.  Go around to the businesses near you (and any others you are interested in) and ask for the owner and introduce yourself.  Say \"My name is Joe Bob and I own the car wash down the street and I just wanted to introduce myself.\"  You will probably be surprised that they will likely be happy to show you around their business and talk business with you, even direct competitors.  You can make a lot of friends this way and do a lot of business networking.  Also, try to get to know the owners of your suppliers if they are local or find local suppliers whose owners you can know personally.\n\nAnd you can hang out with your employees, just try to keep business separate.

There’s lots of good advice here like finding ways to help others and they are definitely all things to try. The thing that struck me about your post when I was reading it was that I sensed a lack of direction and goals. It felt almost like you had arrived at your destination and now what? And you are at a young age to have done that. It sounds like you have amazing talent to have got this business into such a great place so now set yourself the challenge of how to free yourself from it. Use that keen mind of yours to work on this problem, how can I have this business run without me needing to be there, or only there a few hours a week? I think once you have solved that you will be “free” to think about what you want to do next, whatever that is. Good luck with everything, you are going to have a great life, I can tell already!",

You want to hang out where other business owners hang out. You may be the youngest in the circle for a while, but eventually you’ll be able to find some people that you don’t mind hanging out with.

I see people that I know going on trips overseas and seeing these places I dream about. \n\nI think the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that once I have achieved my goals in the business, I will get to do all of that and more.

I took notes for myself and figured I’d drop them here to save you guys the time.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**On Mindset & Psychology**\n\n* **Fear lives in the vague.** If you’re scared, write down the absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Usually, it’s just \"sleeping on a friend's couch,\" not dying. Once it’s on paper, it’s not scary.\n* **Mental Toughness > Motivation.** He breaks toughness down into: How much bad stuff can you take? How low do you get? How fast do you bounce back? And do you come back better?\n* **The \"Heavyweight Champion\" move is doing nothing.** When someone insults you or triggers you, your gut wants to punish them. But usually, doing nothing is the only move that actually gets you what you want (them going away).\n* **Think for yourself.** Most people are just picking \"identity packages\" off the shelf (Hipster, Redneck, etc) and adopting those beliefs. If you can't explain why you believe something, it's not your thought.\n* **It's okay to just make money.** Don't fall for the \"Third Marshmallow\" trap where you delay gratification until you're dead. At some point, you have to reap what you sowed.\n\n**On Business Strategy & Growth**\n\n* **No \"New\" Stuff.** New is risky. The hierarchy is: Do **More** of what works > Do it **Better** \\> Do something **New** (only as a last resort). He only allows himself one new big project a year.\n* **Plan life first.** Once you have money, you’re paid for judgment, not hours. So prioritize sleep and an empty calendar. Let business fill the cracks, not the other way around.\n* **Ignorance isn't a defense.** Learn the laws and contracts. \"Lawyer stuff\" eats your brainpower if you don't understand the rules of the game.\n* **The Founder's Will.** The biggest risk isn't running out of cash, it's the founder just not wanting to do it anymore. You need a \"why\" that survives past the point where the money is \"enough.\"\n\n**On Team & Leadership (The harsh truths)**\n\n* **The Leader is always the problem.** If a department sucks, the leader sucks. Period.\n* **A-Players or nothing.** You know if someone is an A-Player in the first 14 days. If you don't know by then, they aren't one. Cut them.\n* **A-Players hate B-Players.** If you keep mediocre people, your stars will leave.\n* **Hard conversations save millions.** If you can't have a tough talk when stakes are low (contracts), you guarantee a lawsuit when stakes are high.\n* **Delegation is painful.** The spiritual path of entrepreneurship is constantly giving up control. \"Scale Zero\" means if a task requires you, it’s broken.\n\n**On Marketing & Brand**\n\n* **The Offer is King.** You can't out-market a bad offer. A good offer makes people feel stupid saying no. (Razor: Can you pitch it in a text message and get a \"yes\"? If not, it's too complex).\n* **Clear > Clever.** No one is listening. You have to repeat yourself until you die.\n* **Brand is the Moat.** In an AI world, execution is commoditized. Who people trust is the only defense. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.\n* **Volume wins.** You need thousands of ad creatives. He used like 5,000 variations for his book launch.\n\nP.S. Add yours - let's make a mega thread which is packed with value for all.",

We cleaned up one YC company's codebase and suddenly had 3 more reaching out within weeks.\n\n\n\nFew things that helped us scale this:\n\n\\- Document everything you fix (we use notion to track all the anti-patterns we find)\n\n\\- Get testimonials immediately while the pain is fresh\n\n\\- Focus on specific tech stacks - we only do React/Node shops now\n\n\n\nThe demand is insane right now. So many teams rushed to ship with AI tools and now they're paying the price. We're using Cloudastra Technologies for our cloud infrastructure since we need to spin up test environments quickly for each client cleanup.\n\n\n\nKeep pushing on the YC angle - that network effect is real.",

Like, Walmart or Target are unwilling to carry a wall charger that is likely to melt and catch fire within 3 months, but Temu and Amazon don't care.  Retailers also obtain their name brand stuff through authorized resellers or authorized distributors.  \n\nAside: Some years ago, I used to handle reseller accounts for major electronic brands.  I found out that many major brands like Netgear outright forbid their resellers from listing on Amazon because it encouraged shady price-falling practices and pitted their resellers against each other, which is actually bad for business.  So when you see certain electronics on Amazon and the seller is not listed as an \"Authorized Dealer\" by that brand, 9 times out of 10 it's stolen, bought from overstock, or being sold in breach of contract and therefore does not actually have a manufacturer's warranty.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

Another huge chunk of the shrink in Walmart is their own Admin and computer issues. Also , have you ever seen how they unload trucks at those places?\n\nYeah, you would actually have to be way more precise because are you talking about pure theft that's provable , or are you talking about shrink? Because shrink is a conglomerate of loss, and most of that does not have to do with the consumer. It has everything to do with the bad practices of the business, employee theft, damages and lazy write offs.",

Once while on a road trip we stopped in for deodorant and left with “cute” ramen bowls which finished out our road trip and were transported all the way home with us.

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

      "text": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

          "text": "Great list. As a VC, there are 3 critical slides that are either missing or weak in almost every deck I see right now.\n\n1. The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -> Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution > Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" < \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

If you don't have to say anything different, just remove it and show problem validation, team's expertise, market is shifting etc... It fits naturally already.\n\nAnd about problem, you're 100% right. Problem slide shouldn't be statement. It should be validation with data. How many people face this problem?

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

I'm giving 3 versions:\n1) Trailer (3-5 slides) or one-pager: For the first cold emails only\n2) Longer email decks with more texts\n3) Meeting decks with less texts more visual\n\nI found this approach better to use same deck everywhere BUT it'll probably change because of AI.

      "text": "Ive been freelancing as a web designer for about 2 years and I just finished a pretty big project for a client ,small ecommerce site, it took me like 6 weeks total. We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup. Apparently its needed for some verification stuff. Anyway, any advice on the scope creep situation would be helpful cause im getting real tired of quick favors.",

I make it clear that any additional changes from this point forward will come with a charge.\n\nI then send two things:\n\n1.      A completion email thanking them for their business and confirming the contract scope has been fulfilled\n\n2.      A request for a review, giving them 1-2 days to submit it (with a gentle reminder if needed)\n\nWhen they ask for changes, I thank them for their business again, then remind them that the scope of work has been completed and tell them what the \"quick changes\" will cost.\n\n**One exception:** For new clients building the relationship, I may do one minor change for free.

From their side, they’re not being difficult, they’re just continuing a conversation you never ended. The fix isn’t emotional or confrontational, it’s structural. Everything you shipped is v1.0. Clear scope, clear milestones, done. Anything after that is v1.1 or v1.2, new scope, new estimate, new timeline. \n\nThat framing removes guilt and replaces it with clarity. You’re not saying no, you’re saying yes, just not inside this version. Stop doing unpaid work while you wait for a decision. Minutes add up, and businesses are built on precedent. \n\nGood clients respect clarity. \n\nBad clients only respect boundaries once they feel them. \n\nEither way, you win by acting like a professional who finishes projects, not someone who can be nudged forever.",

Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified.

AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter.

          "text": "What did help us a lot;  \n\\- Translation in a true local tone of voice got much easier. We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong. It worked well as a context to JSON query converter, but it was lacking the actual intelligence part.",

          "text": "We used in our restaurant chain AI assistant which was specifically developed for restaurants. It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

      "text": "If you are in your late teens or early twenties, chances are you have felt it: a quiet but persistent sense that life is slipping by without real direction. You have ambitions like achieving financial freedom, building a family one day, giving back through charity, or simply having deep, reliable friendships. But somehow, the drive to make those things happen fades quickly. Motivation comes in waves, and the only time you feel truly alive and excited is during short escapes that leave you emptier afterward. You know you should get serious, start building habits, and chase what matters, but purpose feels out of reach. You are not alone in this. Millions of young people today wrestle with the same emptiness, and there is a clear reason why it has become so common.\n\nSomething fundamental changed around the early 2000s. Before that time, most people discovered their interests through living. You would go out into the world, experience something directly, feel a spark of curiosity, and then actively seek out more information using whatever tools existed. Schools, conversations with mentors, libraries, trial and error. Your path felt self-directed because it grew naturally from your own encounters and choices. You ended up where you were because you chose to go there.\n\nToday the flow runs in the opposite direction. Information floods toward you constantly through phones and screens, carefully selected and pushed by algorithms, companies, and hidden agendas. Interests are handed to you ready-made instead of discovered through experience. Attention gets captured before you even decide what you care about. Over time, this reverses the natural order: curated content shapes your desires, pulls your focus outward, and leaves you in a life that often feels like it belongs to someone else. The constant noise drowns out your own voice, making it hard to know what you truly want or why anything matters.\n\nThis reversal explains the widespread feeling of being stuck. When everything competes for your attention, nothing feels worth giving it to. Quick dopamine hits from scrolling, gaming, or other escapes become the only reliable source of excitement because they are designed to deliver instant reward. Meanwhile, the slower rewards of building skills, relationships, or long-term goals feel distant and uncertain. Purpose requires space, reflection, and ownership, but the modern environment leaves little room for any of those.\n\nThe way out starts with reclaiming control, one small step at a time. Begin by creating quiet moments each day to listen to yourself. Ask basic questions: What activities absorb me completely? What kind of person do I respect and want to become? Write the answers down honestly. This simple habit cuts through the external chatter and helps you reconnect with your inner direction.\n\nFrom there, pick one small action that moves you toward a goal you care about and do it daily. Ten minutes of reading about money management if financial freedom matters to you. A short walk or workout if you want to feel stronger. Consistency builds momentum far better than occasional bursts of effort. When distractions pull you away, notice it without harsh judgment and gently return to what you chose.\n\nSeek real-world connections that support growth. Join groups, clubs, or online communities built around shared interests. Show up as yourself, contribute, and listen. Authentic friendships and mentors appear when you engage steadily over time, not when you chase quick bonds.\n\nIf excitement only shows up in unhealthy ways right now, experiment with healthier sources. Try physical challenges, creative outlets, volunteering, or time in nature. These activities can awaken the same energy in sustainable forms.\n\nHelpful starting points include books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear for building reliable routines, or Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for understanding purpose in difficult seasons. Free courses on platforms like Coursera or Khan Academy let you explore skills without pressure. Mindfulness apps can train your mind to stay present amid the noise.\n\nProgress will feel slow at first, and that is normal. Be patient as you rebuild the habit of directing your own life. By stepping away from endless feeds and toward deliberate choices, you create space for genuine meaning to emerge. Many have walked this path before you and found their way forward. You can too. The life you actually want is still within reach, waiting for you to start choosing it.",

That disconnect alone can make motivation feel hollow, even me, i also think many young people are not lazy or unambitious, they are however overstimulated and underexposed to boredom which is usually where direction starts forming. Quiet and repetition sound unglamorous but honestly  they are often what rebuilds a sense of agency. The lost feeling makes sense in an environment that rarely lets you sit long enough to hear yourself think.",

          "text": "This describes something I have felt for a long time but never really had words for.\n\nFor me the “lost” feeling did not come from a lack of information. If anything I had too much of it. I knew what I should be doing, saving money, building skills, working on something meaningful. The problem was I never turned any of that into real action.\n\nWhat helped was not a big mindset shift but doing small things in the real world and sticking with them longer than the initial excitement. Building something tiny. Testing an idea. Even failing at it. That process gave me more clarity than months of thinking or consuming content ever did.\n\nAt some point I realised purpose does not show up first and then action follows. It is usually the other way around. You act first and meaning slowly forms around it.\n\nOne small thing that helped me move from vague ambition to actual doing was looking at real problems instead of abstract goals. I came across **StartupIdeasDB** while browsing ideas and what stood out was how specific and grounded the problems were. It made starting feel less overwhelming.\n\nYour point about algorithms shaping desire is very real. When everything is constantly pushed at you, it is hard to know what you actually care about. Doing something on your own, even if it is boring or imperfect, gives that sense of ownership back.\n\nThanks for writing this. Posts like this are rare and needed.",

Less consumption, more friction, fewer options, longer timelines. That’s where direction starts to form.",

Today it’s reversed. Interests, goals, and even identities are presented to us constantly before we’ve had the chance to experience them ourselves.\n\nWhen everything competes for attention, nothing feels worth committing to. Quick dopamine becomes the only thing that reliably “works,” while long-term goals feel vague and distant.\n\nReclaiming purpose often begins with small steps: creating a quiet space, choosing one thing you care about, and acting on it consistently without waiting to feel fully motivated. Direction doesn’t usually appear first. It emerges *after* you start moving.\n\nIt feels like a lot of people aren’t broken; they’re just living in an environment that makes it hard for them to hear their own voice.",

I figured it'd be easier than hunting thrift stores every weekend. Half the sellers dont even have accurate inventory counts. I placed an order for 50 phone cases last month and the guy messages me 3 days later saying he only has 38 left. Then I had to wait another week for a partial refund because apparently thats just how it works. Second issue is quality control is basically nonexistent when buying in bulk. I ordered what was supposed to be brand new chargers and when I got them half had scratches and looked like returns.  Theres no way to see all the variants side by side or check all the product photos in one view so Im literally opening like 15 tabs trying to figure out which supplier has the best deal. Sometimes items are already sold out by the time I decide and I cant even buy directly through any kind of bulk ordering system, its just regular checkout which is annoying when youre trying to move fast. Would love to hear if anyone cracked this.",

A couple “language” points to clarify what I think you’re saying.\n\nJobs are usually many different tasks. AI may automate or expedite some tasks, but the job itself becomes more about higher level thinking, more critical creative work. Honestly probably less rote, mindless work, and more about like, almost supervising the robot and understanding the “why” behind the work it is doing.\n\nLike you mentioned, the calculator didn’t impede our ability to do math; we actually just started working on much harder problems once we stopped wasting our time on manual calculations. We just need to know how to employ the calculator so we can tackle HARDER problems.\n\nIs that kind of where you’re thinking?",

I’m saying the value inside the job shifts:\n- AI eats the repeatable “how”.\n- Humans get paid for judgment, sequencing, and accountability.\n\nAnd I like your “employ the calculator” framing. The new skill is:\n1. define the problem and constraints (what matters, what doesn’t)\n2. supervise + verify outputs (because the robot is confidently wrong sometimes)\n3. turn results into decisions (trade-offs, timing, incentives)\n\nOne nuance: for a while, a lot of roles become “hybrid”. You still need enough “how” to catch failures and steer the tool.\n\nCurious: in the trainings you’ve run, what’s the #1 thing people struggle with most. Asking better questions, verifying outputs, or deciding what to do next?",

Many of us in the industry are pushing for updated roles that supervise the “AI intern” instead of mass automation of roles. \n\nYour question: Most people need real practice using paid AI tools (40-100 hours) and a strong belief that their employers aren’t going to outsource their job. If they really fear losing their jobs, they need to start learning to be an entrepreneur. It’s never been easier than right now.\n\nIf you haven’t already, check out Ethan Mollick’s blog at OneUsefulThing.org - he is one of the biggest experts in the field that combines practical entrepreneur/business sense with no joke scientific/academic reasoning. He’s a trusted voice, as far as I’m concerned. Everyone else is just repackaging the same garbage content.\n\n***Long Response***\n\nLike you mentioned, the real, long-term game now is strategically prioritizing which tasks add the most value and then consistently leveraging these tools to deliver quality products or services faster than the competition. The companies that empower their people to use these tools and mitigate the risk will have a compounding competitive advantage in the next couple years. All future knowledge worker jobs should have an AI supervisor component.\n\nAs for your question: it depends largely on the industry.\n\nGenerally: \n\n1. Many people don’t fully grasp the full range of what LLMs are capable of. They do surface level tasks and don’t realize they can go much deeper. Or they think AI can’t do what they can, so they don’t bother to put it through its paces. They hear the hype but haven’t seen or internalized the earth-shattering magic yet.\n\n2. There is a hands-on component that many lack, they don’t have 20, 40, 100+ of practice with PAID LLMs, so they don’t quite know how to get AI to give them what they want yet. This is easily remedied with practice and coaching. This practice also usually fixes problem 1.\n\n3. The last piece I see the most, and the one I struggle with the most is: many think of AI as an automation tool, not an enhancement tool for existing employees. People think all their jobs are going to be automated away and they are going to lose their jobs. This is a real possibility. So people resist any and all AI trainings, change efforts, etc. They resist because they fear their livelihoods depend on it. The only thing we can do for this one is share a vision of a positive AI enhanced future and actively lead people towards it.\n\nSome people will lose their jobs, but my company REALLY pushes the, “re-define your current roles, put your current employees on harder, more meaningful and valuable work, automate the bullshit busywork that no one wants to do” kind of track. I won’t work with organizations trying to do mass automation and layoffs.\n\n\n***More specific examples of problems and questions from specific industries, if you’re interested:***\n\n-Solopreneurs and small businesses just want to know how they can use these tools to scale their business.\n\n-Higher Education is a mixed bag, many still see using AI as cheating and want to try to ban it or find ways to catch students red-handed. Other academics see it as the future and want to know how to use AI to help them produce better research, faster.\n\n-Medical field: mostly how they can automate the insurance eligibility verification. Or use AI to transcribe appointment notes without violating HIPPA. Most providers want to actually focus on their patients, but have to spend most of their time documenting the whole ordeal that it feels like the Dr is on the computer the whole time. Many of the providers I’ve met know this is a problem and hate it, but they need to make sure your chart is as accurate as possible so they miss out on the actual helping the patient thing.\n\nIs there a specific industry you’re looking for?\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for coming to my TED talk!",

Something more unorthodox, not meat-and-potatoes.\n\nFor me it's Huberman's morning light routine. Not sure how well-known he's here, but that shit's a blessing. Since i started getting sunlight (or staring at a lamp) my overall capacity and stability levels have increased dramatically.  \n\nAlso, 1 hour \"buffer\" time - my time, first thing in the morning. Walk alone in silence with my own thoughts, meditate, journal a bit. Clear my head, reorient on what matters the most, while trying to avoid obsessing about it (yeah, I know). If I start skipping this or cutting it short, my performance and quality of life start inching down. 100%.\n\nNo gadgets, obviously, but if I were you I'd push gadgets at least until noon, if not even past 1-2pm. If there's something truly critical or urgent they will get a hold of, don't worry. Shield your damn energy and focus, that's the only things you've truly got. Time has no value if you have attention span of a toddler.\n\nShare your experience.\n\n",

He was doing it for ~10-12 months by that time, but then a bunch of personal and work-related issues happened at once, he ended up with a 1/4oz of pure coke, using it all overnight with some random folks. \n\n\nHe called me the next day, crying. I thought I'd check on him. When I got to his place I saw him in his underpants, wearing a fur coat, drinking champagne straight from the bottle. Covered in blood from head to toes, his left hand split open in like 5-6 places. \n\n\n\nThis motherfucker lost 2+ liters of blood, but instead of falling over he was mocking me while trying to light a cigar. Turned out the artery stopped bleeding, probably because of all the stimulants, and he changed his mind. He refused to go with the medics because he felt \"good\" and was fully coherent and present, so cops pepper-spayed him and he landed in a mental asylum for a month. Docs said another few hundred milliliters lost and he'd be dead.\n\n\nDopaminergic drugs are fucking dangerous. I don't know if there's a \"wise\" way to use them. I hope there is, but I've seen too many people crumble under their pressure. \n\n\nI hope you are keeping a good eye on yourself, bro. Be smart, there's shit in this world that only you can do.",

A day or two of business/product a week, 3-4 days of development, with 30-60 minute admin blocks here and there when needed.\n\n\nI can easily do 8+ hours of deep technical work a day - fully-focused high-quality hours, with occasional break here and there to sustain it better. Some weeks I'm pulling 50+ such hours, but sustaining this over years is probably unrealistic, I agree. \n\n\nI did many 400hr+ months and 7-day-work-week sprints in this current project and in the past, and yeah - it doesn't seem to be possible to sustain this long-term. By month four I generally start feeling like shit, no matter how \"balanced\" the rest of my life is. \n\n\nLately I've been aiming for <12 hours a day with at least a 3-hour evening buffer to wind down - do something simple and fun.\n\n\nNowadays I'm playing around with 9 to 12 hours on weekdays and 4 to 8 on weekends - feels like something much more sustainable on a very long-term scale.",

And I slowed down by choice, not by force.\n\nBurnout being a function of hours is a myth; its a function of alignment. \n\nYou dont have to love what you. Hell, you dont even have to have a passion for it, per se. You just need to deeply understand why youre doing it.\n\nTheres no magic bullet for drive, but here's what I've learned after building an 8 figure business as a result:\n\n1. Routines aren't enough. Rituals are everything. Routines can be broken, rituals cannot be compromised. For 12 years I wore essentially the same outfit every day, went to sleep at the same time, got up at the same time, ate the same things, etc. This wasnt because I enjoyed it, it was because it spared the energy thinking about shit like that, and allowed me to focus on building, working, creating.\n\n2. Health is key. The healthier you are, the more you can sustain. In the early years I drank a lot (part of my ritual 😬) but as the years went on and I began to get more intentional about my health, the days got easier. \n\n3. Have a goal (or goals). Affirmations, vision boards, mission statements, etc... I dont care what medium works best for you just understand why youre busting your ass so hard. And remind yourself every day.\n\n4. Finally, measure progress by months or years, never by days. If you try to measure progress by the day working like that you'll get discouraged, overwhelmed, and just shut down. But if you can look back on the years to see how far you've come, tomorrow has more purpose.\n\nIm sure theres more but thats what I can think off the top of my head. \n\nAt the end of the day you must answer:\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nAnd what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?\n\nBonus: Whats *really* important to you? \n\nMy two cents.",

This is also the case in the winter, but I go for half a block. Adjust timing as it suits you, some people do really well using a pomodoro cycle.\n\n- Context switch. This is super important. Never wear clothes that you would normally wear around the house. At least wear jeans and a decent shirt/hoodie. Don’t wear joggers, sweatpants, etc. Save that for when you’re done with your work. \n\n- If you listen to some kind of content, use headphones that are tethered to your desk. I consider this part of my context switch. In ear monitors work especially well for me because they’re sort of annoying to take off/on. This adds another barrier to just getting up and going to do something else. You can get really good ones that sound better than all of the expensive wireless buds/phones I’ve ever used for like $50. Simgot ew200.\n\n- I’ve caught flack for this, but it works, and there’s nothing that suggests that this will produce problems long-term. When I’m making a big push, I work in an entirely dark environment except for my screens. Doing this makes it hard to even want to do anything else that day. I don’t know if this applies for other people, but I heard about it first from Alex Hormozi, and he seems to have similar things to say. But if it gives you headaches or you can feel eye strain, don’t be an idiot. Use other strategies.\n\n\nAdditionally, have bipolar disorder, medicated to the point that it’s manageable. Mood swings are not nearly as intense and debilitating as they once were. Through mood tracking and watchings signs of swings, I can harness the good parts of hypomanic swings and get an obscene amount of work done, so that’s part of my strategy. These overall strategies can apply to all phases of my mood, and their effectiveness generally follows suit. Depressive episodes are possible to do this with, but I usually get less done and I am more easily distracted.",

And not in the trivial “i need to recharge for a few days” sense. You will develop serious issues.\n\nAnyone who says they are doing this is lying. Some are very consciously lying. Dipshits peddling the hustle culture crap make others feel like they’re failures if they aren’t always working, so they say they are. \n\nOthers actually believe they work that much. They don’t. Again, it’s just not possible to put in 12+ hours of active work every single day. Most of these so called “maniacs” work 6-8 hour days but since they’re obsessed with work or trying to appease the hustle culture gurus they’re constantly thinking about work. So to the, they’re “always” working.\n\nLast thing: OP you may not realize it but you’re perpetuating the bullshit too. “What’s your secret” implies working this much is impressive. That it’s aspirational. \n\nIt’s not. And if baffles me how many of you drink the kool aid. Most of you got into entrepreneurship to achieve freedom. To not “have a boss.” To not be controlled. Yet you celebrate those who work nonstop? That’s insane. That’s the opposite of freedom. \n\nA better question would be: for those of you who have successful companies/entrepreneurial careers, and did it WITHOUT killing yourself, what’s your secret?",

      "text": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

Then comes the guilt stage where you feel like you *should* want that Tesla or mansion, but honestly? I just wanted restaurants without checking prices and being able to say yes to friends without doing math in my head.\n\nThe real plot twist is when you stop viewing money as something to spend and start seeing it as freedom capital instead. Invest in time, health, and skills that made you money in the first place. The successful people I know all seem to hit the same point: the money doesn't matter as much as having choices.\n\nWhat stage are you in - still figuring out what 'rich spending' even looks like, or past that?\"",

It's such a small moment but it changes the entire social dynamic.\n\nWhat's resonating with me is the *intentionality* in your spending. You're not chasing the status symbols, you're actually investing in things that compound - freedom with friends, stability with a forever home, better travel experiences. That's not consumption, that's *lifestyle design*.\n\nThe fact that you naturally gravitated away from boats and jets without even trying tells me you figured something out early that most people take years (or never) to learn: the real wealth is in what you *don't* have to stress about anymore.\n\nHow long did it take before you stopped second-guessing every purchase? Like, is that anxiety still lingering or has it fully clicked that the money is real and stable now?",

Perhaps God is gifting me this, idk why He would be I can’t explain it otherwise. \n- I validate / evaluate all my ideas with ChatGPT. To make them viable and actionable. To see if there’s any way to improve. To get feedback whether it will be received well with my market.\n- I post and put myself out there without self-judgement. I’ve been consistent posting 1-2x daily and only taking days off for “creative expansion” days where I recalibrate and make room for even better ideas\n- I evaluate every single piece of content / sales page / offer I make by sharing my performance stats with ChatGPT. It shows me whats effective and where people are falling off. I take this info and reiterate and repost without worrying if people notice.”\n- I am constantly feeding my brain with expert ideas strategies and ways of thinking via low ticket info products. I feed what’s relevant to me into ChatGPT to help me expand on my current ideas and way of writing and working.\n\nSo far I’ve grown my Facebook platform from 0 to 8000 daily views and engagement has increased similarly too.\n\nI’ve got two different offers in the works - low ticket books and courses for my mom audience where I help them mitigate meltdowns\n\nAnd a mid-ticket group consulting offer for high level biz owners / marketers who want to reach more of their followers on Facebook like I have.\n\nI suppose I’m a mix of excited / curious :)\n\nAnd I keep myself in check asking myself “am I striving? Or letting my momentum carry me” \n\nWhen it’s the latter I know I’m on the right track.",

I know the title sounds a little dramatic but I could genuinely use some advice especially if you're a bit older and a business owner. I married my husband a year and a half ago, left my country and moved to his, literally into his childhood bedroom. We're together 24/7, working 24/7. No weekends off. I haven't seen my family/friend for like 6 months and they don't even know what we're doing because we don't like to talk about it before we're successful. Actually, I didn't even talk to my dad in around 6 months but thats a different story. As you can probably imagine at this point, our social life is basically dead. \nTime really flies so I don't even really get the time to think about all the things I don't have time for, all I get is exactly 2,5 hours of break at night and that's barely enough to watch some show just to get my mind to stop thinking about work. \n\nWhen my family calls me at random times I almost get annoyed at them for thinking I have time to talk when all I can think of is how to get stuff done. I'm not sure if anyone can relate but my family history is quite diffcult. Addiction and depression, money issues and all of that stuff so running away from that to actually build something that could potentially solve my families problems is what gives everything I do a meaning. Is this something anyone else experiences? And if so, how the f do you deal with it? I don't really wanna make time for anything else but at the same time I feel like people are starting to build resentment because I make them feel like I don't care when it's the opposite. \n\n\nEdit: A lot if you are basically saying \"just talk to them\" which yeah ofc makes sense lol it's family. But I guess not everyone comes from my background so I'll elaborate. I got two bipolar brothers that are both thousands in depth and a bipolar alcoholic unemployed dad with a god complex that was absent for 15 years of my life and lives in a \"third world\" country with another family which means I have another brother thats 14 years old that I feel responsible for. My mom is probably the most normal but even she used to be gone travelling around the world with strange men when I was 14. So talking to my family isn't just a quick nice chat it's usually stressful. It's not even that we argue, but there's always a problem. Money, mental health or someone's about to become homeless LOL. It's not that easy to focus on work and be in contact with them without getting dragged into some Bs. I hope that helps to understand my situation. ",

Honestly? I smoked a lot of weed. been self regulating with it a lot over the years. \n\nI dated around a lot. Nothing seemed to last. Most women dislike being secondary to my work. \n\nI try to play games. Can’t keep my focus as they did in my teen years. \n\nDid a lot of body building one year and was healthy. That was nice at least it helped with anxiety and sleep a bit. But ultimately work made that hard and I ended up smoking again.  \n\n3. Family? Well yeah.  This was first year as a non entrepreneur. So I was able to disconnect more than in the past. But as I have gotten older my mental health has gotten worse. I have been doing absolute minimum. I can at least throw money at any of their problems. \n\nMy rest of family. Well. Tbh they were never close to me. And I don’t feel much of an urge to fix that. But maybe had I stayed in my home country with ease of access to them that would have been different. \n\nFor new years I am staying with my mother because I have no where else to be. For my birthday I’ll probably spend it alone. \n\n___\n\nAlso. Massive side note. My story is not yours. Your experience is gonna be unique as was mine. \n\nDo not give up just because I had it tough and wish I would’ve done things differently. My reasons for ending up with all of this is due to me not being an entrepreneur. \n\nChildhood trauma, avoidance, chronic depression, anxiety and untreated ADHD is a recipe for disaster for anyone, entrepreneur or not 🙂 \n\nI decided to share my story so bluntly and open because i felt that you were describing what I felt that first 6 months. I pushed that feeling away to chase after that one big breakthrough that was just around the corner.  \n\nMay I ask you. What does your partner say about all of this? Have you told him?",

Replace this with walks or healthy meal prep or reading a book. \n\n2. As soon as you can, hire staff to help reduce the burden. Even before you start making “a good amount of money”. \n\n3. You and your partner should both go out one night a week. Together or even better apart. You don’t have to spend much. But that bedroom will do you in. \n\n4. Remember that your doing today what other people won’t so that you can have tomorrow what other people can’t. I sacrificed much of my 20s into\nmy businesses, but today I have it better than most. \nThere is no balance in the beginning. Don’t listen to the part time “life coaches” that tell you there should be. But try to squeeze in a little bit of personal time. This is where your aha moments come from. Kind of like finding your keys when you stop looking so hard for them. \n\n5. Eat as healthy as you can. Bad food leads to low energy and less than ideal states of mind. \n\n6. Your why is VERY powerful. Print it out and put it up on your wall along with anything else you want. Your partner could do the same. Smile every time you look at it and imbue it with emotion. \n\n7. Talk to your family during your 2.5hrs. You can combine this with walking or meal prepping. When they ask what you’re doing, just let them know you’ll tell them when the time is right.\n\nAnd in the words of Tim Ferris: “Find joy and delight in everything you do”\n\nYou’ve got this!!",

Holding everything in, not sharing wins or struggles, and carrying the weight alone for too long.\n\nYou're not broken. You're not selfish. You're in a very intense chapter.

Ofc they can’t do that so much, that you can’t focus on it. But yes you do need to talk to them, when they need it and maybe even you too. For some people that have a shitty family situation, it’s easier to just cut it and become obsessed with work and success. Eventually they’ll either come around or not. They’ll eventually understand, maybe. But you do need to understand it’s your life, so do you. If they try to stop you by time draining then that’s another story then they aren’t your family they are an enemy. But if they care about you, they want to spend time with you and support you. Also it will help make your journey a tiny better. It’s just money and work. For some it’s a way out, for others it’s a way of supporting or other situations, we all have our motivations for why. But you could end up building bad feelings as a byproduct if they feel like they are a burden to your work. But again it depends on the situation, from an visionary perspective. Do you, but don’t ruin your family if they care and love you. That’s stupid. But also practically some people actually don’t need that much time if we boil it down. But you do need to enjoy each other’s company when together and make quality time. And remember money have ruined a lot of families. Don’t say it will, but be careful.

Send texts to let them know you’re thinking about them and schedule calls to catch up if you want to. There are probably good books on communication/relationships that have good tools for this situation. You’re doing something hard that a lot of people wouldn’t attempt. Focus on that.

I think therapy will definetely be something I'll have to do to figure this out. Glad to hear your family's healthy I hope it's gonna be ok.",

I'm a father of two and see the effects of poor/under-employed centers first hand, so I built[ SproutCare](https://trysproutcare.com) to help centers by providing them an all-in-one platform for parent communications,  center administration, compliance and reporting, and marketing. It's been a rough few months getting everything spun up since I'm employed full-time, but I'm happy to say that I'm live and have some real interest from centers around me.\n\nI have three centers at $100/mo using it in my area - which compared to the other platforms I've tried to spin up is significant :)\n\nThe best way I found to get people involved is to;\n\na.) Know people (I know that's not really applicable to many, but the game is who you know, not what you know)\n\nb.) Lead with the problem you're trying to solve and why. I literally cold-called daycares around me and about 50% of the time had people sympathizing with me about my struggles, and interested in learning more.\n\nMy goal is to have 50 centers by the end of 2026. I'm investing heavily in this by sponsoring local childcare groups, going to conferences and talking with local center administrators about their struggles, and actively building/demoing what a solution could be in the technical space.\n\nI'd love to talk more and hear about other people's experiences with starting a business like this - I have no body in my social circle that I can relate to.

I called it a fuel mule when I was developing it (originally just for my own use fueling my boat up at my dock so I didn't have to overpay at the marina), it was innovative and is now patented, and solves a problem in a new and unique way that really benefits people that have the right use case-- hence 'Smart'.  I've always been a bit of a smart aleck...   And well...  Smart Ass Fuel Mule it is!\n\nThis was our second full year of selling the product, and sales are up about 60% over year one.  That's a step in the right direction, but we've got plenty of room to grow.  I expect 2026 to do really well, especially with how much we're hearing from, and selling to, people starting fuel delivery businesses.  Turns out a motorized fuel caddy is inspiring a lot of new fuel delivery startups, and helping one larger franchise company to expand their offerings.\n\nWe're working hard to reach new markets in addition to the marine market which is our bread and butter (and what this was originally designed around).  We're now reaching the general aviation market better, and even beginning to get some government interest/sales which is exciting.\n\nThis year we continue to press forward into these and other verticals, and we're expanding our product offerings too.  People keep asking for bigger capacity, we've responded and now have a 70gallon unit, and we're working on a 110gal unit with full off-road capabilities.  It's gonna be a good year.",

We borrowed money from our siblings and had 150 custom energy drinks with 3 flavors.\n\nIt didn't do too good so we added add on items like collectibles, plushies, kids toys that related to the gamer niche and it sold really good from average $150 from the energy drinks to making 4-5k a month just from collectibles and toys. The last 3 months, we sold 0 energy drinks but all the kids collectibles kept being sold out. Our brand name has the word energy in it and we don't know if we should rebrand OR keep the site and just keep selling collectibles, plushies and kids toys. Should we throw our main brand energy drinks and tailor to collectibles and the kids market instead? We have passion in our energy drinks and we are worried that it might kill our future passion as we wanted to keep being in the gamer and fitness niche. This is our first business together and we are stuck on what to do. ",

They found out people were more interested in having a website act as an apparatus for their own live streaming purposes, and so they pivoted to provide that service and turn the business into what we now know as Twitch.\n\nSo, maybe you do need to change the name. If you do, it's probably better to bite the bullet and do that now, before you become to big. But the important moral of the story here is to provide your core customer base with what they want. You already know who your market is. Gamers. And now they're screaming at you exactly what they want. I think you should make the full pivot and focus on the collectibles.",

Not at Lan parties, not at eSports events, not on your clan or guild website and especially not with your face on it because you are a famous streamer. Unless you have big boobs maybe. But even then it will not justify the effort. Best outcome will be you have free drinks on your next clan lan party and everyone gives 20 bucks to get rid of your inventory. Concentrate on your collectibles. Cheap worthless crap people don't need always sells well and has huge margins. Especially if you have famous promoters. If you don't want to rebrand, just duplicate your existing sales infrastructure with different branding and without energy drinks. You can keep the invoicing company the same and only have it appear on impressum and invoices.",

I wouldn’t kill the energy drink idea, but I also wouldn’t force it.\n\nWhat I’d do is treat collectibles as the main brand for now and park the energy drink as a future product. You can always spin it back later as a limited drop or a separate sub brand once you have money, audience, and leverage. Right now the toys are funding your learning and growth.\n\nRebranding isn’t failure, it’s alignment. Tons of successful companies started as one thing and became another because customers pulled them there. Follow demand first, ego and passion second. You’re young enough to come back to energy drinks later with way more power.\n\nIf you try to revive energy drinks while ignoring what’s selling, you risk killing both.

You don't have product-market fit for the energy drinks. Something is off in who you're selling it to, what you're selling, how you're selling it, or why your target audience would want to buy it. This business needs it's foundations looked at, starting with the ideal customer you want to serve, what is their name, what do they care about, and why they make energy-drink buying decisons.\n\n\n\nBusiness Two is a plushie/collectible biz, which so far, you HAVE got the hang of. You know who you're selling to. They clearly want the product (plushie-collectibles). They know why they're buying it, at least subconsciously, and you can clearly see the demand. This business could be scaled up if you want to earn some solid income, or it can be closed/sold if it's not a business you're interested in being in.\n\n\n\nIf the businesses are meant to work as one, ie: two-sides-of-one-business, similar to red bull's sports-media branch + red bull's energy drink branch, then you'll either need to find a way to make both profitable, or accept one will always be a loss-leader, not meant to generte income, but instead to found a culture/movement. This is ambitious though, and usually something that is done AFTEr you have a successful product, as the culture will build around it. Technically still doable, but like I said, ambitious if you don't already understand biz basics.\n\n\n\nThe \"name\" issue is irrelevant until you understand the businesses, and who the businesses will be serving, because whatever name you choose must resonate with, and appeal to, the target market (as opposed to turning them off.)\n\n\n\nUltimately the seemingly money-obsessed (or at least money-focused) people in the comments likely aren't worth listening to.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to make important life decisions such as what you're gonna do as your career for the next little while based off of \"money.\"\n\n\n\nThe truth is that consumers will flow dollars to you for *all sorts of things,* when marketed and sold to in ways that resonate with them. This means you can absolutely succeed with energy drinks, or you can succeed with plushies. The only difference is, you stumbled on product-market-fit with one of those already, but not the other.\n\n\n\nThis means plushies will feel \"easier\" for now, since you've got past one of the hardest parts of business, but it doesn't mean you can't do similar with energy drinks.\n\n\n\nIn any case, understanding business deeply, and approaching the situation with calm, maturity, and inner-peace while looking objectively at the facts of the matter, will empower you to make a decision that will serve all involved to the highest level possible.",

The market fit you found with your brand and the collectibles is what you want (maybe not what you did expect 😅). \n\nNow the next step is to find is energy drinks drive traffic / are bundled up with the high selling products (to see if they helped your website). Considering you sold 0 in the last periods you have your answer. Maybe this changes. Don’t chase paid, but keep investing time in organic if you believe in the project (have reason to believe ..)\n\nAlso keep in mind that energy drinks are an 18+ product (morally it’s not ok selling to kids), while maybe your audience also includes children. It’s a relevant dynamic. I can’t say more without knowing more.\n\nI don’t know why you think you can’t have “energy” in a toy’s name 🧸 🤣 energy bear would rock 🤘🏻",

Handles everything (payroll, time, taxes) and has clean integrations with QuickBooks/Xero. Decent UI and solid support.\n\nRippling (US) - A step up if you want serious automation. Accurate time tracking, native integrations. Bit pricier but scales well.\n\nFactorial/Sesame HR (Europe) - If you need the full HR package beyond time tracking. Well-made but can be overkill for just payroll + time.\n\nSomething I've noticed almost nobody solves well is the connection between hours worked → projects → actual profitability. Most tools give you the data but you have to manually crunch numbers to know if a project is actually making money or bleeding it. There are some newer options (like [Regist.es](http://Regist.es) in the European market) specifically focused on that: seeing real-time margin per project while the team clocks in/out. For teams with field workers or multiple simultaneous projects, that visibility changes management quite a bit. (Still in development but they let me check out a demo - the approach is interesting.)\n\nMy advice: If you just need basic payroll + hour tracking, QuickBooks Payroll integrated might be enough. If you need profitability visibility per project on top of time tracking, look for something that connects those dots automatically.\n\nAre your workers office-based or in the field? Do you manage multiple projects at once or is it more continuous operations?",

Cleaning, trades, removals, clinics, pet services. Demand is constant. The opportunity is not inventing something new, it is doing marketing, systems, and customer experience better than owners who are stuck in the past.\n\nContent alone barely pays anymore, but it still works as leverage. Newsletters, YouTube, TikTok are not the business. They are the attention layer that feeds into something else like consulting, services, products, communities, or software.\n\nB2B is still strong because businesses pay faster and complain less than consumers. If you help save time or money through automation, operations, compliance, or simple systems, you do not need massive reach to make real income.\n\nNiche info products still work when they are extremely specific. One clear problem, one clear outcome, for one type of person. Distribution matters more than polish.\n\nCrypto is not dead, but the easy phase is over. The money now is around tools, services, audiences, and infrastructure, not blind buying and hoping.\n\nThe real shift is that the internet stopped rewarding copy paste ideas. It still rewards people who understand a small group of people better than anyone else.",

An entrepreneur's brain wants everything to move fast, they want things to happen now, but they are limited by people, shipping, delays etc...\n\n  \nIn my case I recently started going into the reselling business. I buy stuff on vinted and ebay and resell it. I ordered many items and some of them arrived already. I listed them on ebay, but ebay is slow. It's been days and I still have no views on my products nor any sales. My business is stalling and ebay is probably processing my new account or something before I appear in the search results, but that wait is the worst. I want things to happen now, but they ain't happening. \n\nI try to watch animes that I enjoy and make myself busy, but there's a limit. Honestly all I want and care about in life right now is just to have my first sale, and things are just moving so slowly, it is the worst. \n\nHow do you guys deal with that ?",

So the brand name may actually be part of the draw for people to understand why it’s different.

Your brain wants dopamine now, but markets don’t work on your timeline. eBay is slow by design, new accounts even more so. The trick is to shift what you measure. Stop waiting on sales as the only win. Track controllables: number of listings, pricing tests, photos improved, titles rewritten, comps researched, cross-posting, outreach to watchers. If you don’t manufacture progress, your mind will eat you alive. Do your damnest to NOT emotionally anchor on “first sale.” It’ll come, and then you’ll immediately want the second, then the tenth. The waiting never goes away, you just get better at filling it with useful motion. If you really can’t sit still, stack parallel bets. While eBay warms up, source more inventory, test another platform, or start learning a second business line. \n\nEntrepreneurs don’t slow down, they redirect.\n35+ platforms you could be visible on if you want it bad enough.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot lately about early idea validation, especially before committing real time or money to building something.\n\nEvery time I have a new idea (app, SaaS, website, tool, whatever), I try the usual things: asking on Reddit, posting in communities, sending quick surveys, talking to people I know. I’ve also tried some of the newer AI-based idea validators and market analysis tools. They’re interesting and useful for brainstorming, but I keep feeling like they don’t fully answer the most important questions.\n\nWhat I struggle with is getting **clear, honest feedback from people who actually resemble the target user**, and feedback that goes beyond “sounds cool” or generic opinions. Most of the time it’s hard to tell if the idea truly makes sense, if the problem is painful enough, or if someone would realistically pay for it. A lot of existing solutions seem to focus either on technical testing, metrics, or simulated feedback, but not so much on validating the business side early on.\n\nThat’s why I’ve been wondering if there’s room for a more structured way to validate ideas *before* building, by getting thoughtful, business-focused feedback from real people instead of just relying on intuition, AI opinions, or random comments.\n\nSo I’m curious: how do you personally validate ideas at this stage? What has actually worked for you, and what hasn’t? I’m genuinely interested in learning how others approach this problem.",

This you will validate later \n\n3) create a hypothesis on who will be your idea customer profile. In this part create a several different personas who you will validate \n\n4) approach those personas and conduct in-depth interviews for them. Don’t ask them if they like the idea, rather focus on discovering their pain points and need, and use it to validate your initial hypothesis. Once you have very unbiased conversations with them about their pain points, mention at the end the solution, and see how they respond\n\n5) during interviews you will validate personas, problems and needs, and often completely remove from the table some of personas in case your hypothesis was not correct (maybe they have the pain point, but they are not willing to pay) \n\nMy experience working with my clients was that if we did steps 1-3 correctly, already during the discovery interviews we would generate first paying clients - they were willing to commit very early on. \n\nHope this helps.",

People lie to be nice. The only honest feedback comes from a stranger pulling out their credit card or giving you their email for a specific promise.\n\nStop asking and start selling before you build. Here is the framework:\n\nBuild a simple Landing Page (Carrd/Webflow) promising the specific outcome.\n\nSet a Price/Call to Action. Put a \"Buy Now,\" \"Pre-Order,\" or \"Join Waitlist\" button.\n\nDrive Cold Traffic. Spend $50-100 on ads targeting your specific persona. Do NOT target friends.\n\nIf they click the button, you have validation.

Not in a “hustle at 18 or you’re late” way, but in a more realistic sense.\n\nStarting early doesn’t always mean instant success, but it does give you time. Time to make mistakes, learn what you’re actually good at, and figure out how business really works. You can try things, fail quietly, and adjust without as much pressure.\n\nThat said, starting later has advantages too. More experience, clearer priorities, and sometimes more capital. So it’s not really about age. It’s about when you’re willing to start learning by doing.\n\nI want to hear from others here. Did starting early help you? Or did starting later actually work better for you?",

If you want to be good at business, you have to put yourself in situations that develop those skills. That does not necessarily mean putting yourself at undue risk, but if you take a structured approach and have real business mentors (not social media hustle culture) starting earlier can give you certain advantages. \n\nLike others said, all choices make some things harder, and some things easier. If you accept the consequences, feel free to commit.\n\nI don’t want to say experience is overrated. But I’ve met a few entrepreneurs who were exceptional at finding problems and selling solutions, even way outside of their scope of knowledge. They were just good at business.\n\nI’ve also met many experts who started later and weren’t good at business, but were good at their niche service. Ended up closing up shop cause they treated it like a job and it didn’t scale, they were too used to supervisors keeping them on track etc.\n\nYour mileage may vary. Luck plays a part for sure, but the more you roll the dice, the better your chances at succeeding at least once. You can succeed without risking financial ruin. Don’t put yourself at risk for financial ruin.\n\nGood luck!",

But looking back, definitely.  I learned a lot.  Got a fast food job at 14.  Sold 'other things' in my later teens and then God called me out of that life and back to a better one.  Again, I was an entrepreneur and didn't know it yet.  \n\nGot into IT in the late 90's and did that for nearly a decade.  Ran a side-hustle in the middle of that selling computer parts and other tech items I could buy and resell.  That did ok, but never huge.  I was able to hire my mom and help take care of her for a while.\n\nThen in 2004 I started a small business, with years of IT experience and years of entrepreneurial exploits in my background, and we did well.  We built race car parts, ECUs to be specific, and shipped them all over the world.  I sold that business 19 years later in 2023, and I started Smart Ass Products which is my new baby.  I figured out while running that last biz that I really enjoy making the baby, but eventually I get tired of changing the diapers.  I needed to create a new baby, and I'm working full time at that now and working to bring others up with me.  My new son-in-law is my #2 and is running more and more of the show day to day, learning a lot, having fun, and growing.  \n\nMy goal is to continue to play the creative role, creating new products, and to raise him and others up to run the operations.  So I get to keep making babies, and I have others that are gifted, and enjoy, doing the day to day operations that I get to help to grow up with us, hopefully taking care of all of us well.\n\nI learned a lot from those early years, and the skill stacking in IT was huge in helping me to be able to run ecommerce businesses and be able to do a lot of the website/IT/ecommerce marketing related stuff for myself.\n\nAll of that helped a LOT.  \n\nAnd man... looking back....  those 7th grade candy margins were pretty darn good.  ;)",

I had done contracting work, along the line developing a new, powerful computer architecture for the German space agency (DLR).   Now I was in the U.S., looking to start something. By random chance I met the CEO of a small tech company, and he offered me a job on the spot.  Months thereafter, a customer of that company inquired about a powerful real-time computer, and I proposed the architecture I had developed for DLR.  My boss thought it a great idea.\n\nWell, now suddenly I was not only chief architect for that system, but I got an excellent business exposure as well. Went to trade shows. Met with customers. Learned about the finances, about government contracting,  about how my boss was running his business in many ways!\n\nIt was a win for both of us. Ultimately this system and what grew from it made for something like 80% of the revenue of this company. And I got a heck of a business education.\n\nUltimately I dabbled in my own thing (underwater sensors and systems for various ocean applications), my boss again being very supportive. It was a side thing but my boss even let me use the company facility and lab, and the address as my first business address.\n\nAt age 29 and making good progress, he 'fired' me.  Told me it was time to go full-time on my venture somewhere else. Kicked me out of the nest, so to speak.   \n\nAnd that was 33 years ago. And I am still 'running' that underwater tech company... with really the next generation doing most of the running and business learning.",

Then I asked myself, I have 5 years left, as they kick you out early at the top, do I want to keep doing this or have a new challenge? I opted for the challenge. I paid off the mortgage, which gives flexibility. We are in a tech-meets-regulation area, so it's challenging & requires funding. After 3 years of trying this + that we now have a large corporate who wants to JV with us. That's 50% dilution, but no ceiling on growth/valuation. I'm happy with the opportunity, but want to exit in 3 years. Now that I've learned I can do things outside a large organisation I am in a hurry & want to try again (but, havibg responsibilities, with the cushion of exit cash in bank). The net point is, you start from the point you are at when you decide to start a business. For me it was later in life, after career No1. I must be a late starter, but career No1 allowed for financial security & without that I couldn't have embarked on No2.",

You can try with Google trends with 'keywords' related to your agent to check if that specific app/agent is actually people are discussing about, if not then you can drop it, market will tell you hints. Reddit- should have users talking about problem that you are stating. Same thing you can try with X in entrepreneur groups. This involves little experimentation, and you can never be 100% sure but this is what i am learning from other people as well. Regarding Replacing ads - You can start creating YT videos which are trending in your niche. Repurpose videos with multiple keywords, make multiple repurposed videos with different keywords, in those videos, subtly add your agent related or any idea which you want to sell- it shouldnt look like you are selling. it should be something like you are giving some benefit or solving problem with that product you are trying to sell. Another is to make SEO optimized landing pages/websites to attract traffic. These strategies could replace ads in medium to long term. Again i am not an expert but i am learning these following different videos and doing bit of experimentation myself.",

I ran a yoga studio before getting into software and felt the same overwhelming number of moving parts.\n\nWhat helped us most was being strategic about where to automate vs. where to stay hands-on:\n\n**Automate the repetitive stuff:** Lead follow-up, payment recovery, class reminders - anything that happens the same way every time. These are huge time sucks that don't need your personal touch and honestly get done more consistently by automation.\n\n**Use AI for the time-consuming but low-value tasks:** Answering the same FAQs over and over, writing newsletters, basic customer communications. Frees you up for the stuff that actually matters.\n\n**Empower your instructors:** Give them tools to communicate directly with their clients pre/post class, manage their own schedules and appointments. Reduces the bottleneck of everything flowing through you.\n\nThe challenge is most platforms force you to piece this together across multiple tools, which creates its own operational headache.\n\nWe're building Zipper to bring all of this into one place - happy to show you a demo if you're curious how it works. But even if you stick with WellnessLiving, focusing automation on those specific areas should help reduce the operational load you're feeling.",

Idk if you have gotten to farmers? These individuals would love to get a map of their boundaries you could use that need for profit as you already have most of the equipments. Moreover, the systems I am describing that I like have two parts: 1. Company system automation and 2. Company to Company system automation. \n1 is self explanatory but I would like to tell you about 2 which is building a company that makes building your next one easier. So basically my advise would be of course if you want to expand find a idea or product that compliments your existing company in which your existing company can help in some way to build your new product.\n\nPs please take this as face value as everything I wrote is my theoretical understanding of your business",

      "text": "Edited to add: thank you everyone who commented.. the first thing i did in the morning was read these and I actually cried because of all of the hope that everybody had for me. ❤️\n\n\nHi everybody. Im a 29 year old female in a very rural area of the US. I currently have FOUR JOBS!! 1 Terrible life circumstances led to a tornado of destruction in my life and I just cant get caught up. \n\nMy jobs pay terrible. 3 of them are retail merchandising and 1 of them is in a factory as a machine operator. Im mentally and physically exhausted from everything this last year has dealt me. But im still TRYING. Not really succeeding, but trying. \n\nI do a lot of online microtasks and gig work but it just doesnt pay well. I dont expect to get rich quick by all means but even an extra $500 a month, would literally be absolutely life changing. It would get my bills caught up, and then start my savings for a house that I desperately need.\n\nI sell things locally and on mercari. Iv attempted digital products but its hard to build a following. I do bits of AI training. I have every microtask/gig/merchandising/passive app on my phone i know of.\n\nBut I want to do something more specific and steady. I have a ton of skills, but not really online skills. \n\nI wish I could get into sales but I just dont have the knowledge of specific businesses and products to be able to do that (and my telecommunications job gave me phone anxiety 🫣) I love organizing things and researching things but all the job descriptions have big words that scare me away 😅.\n\nI have my AA but a lot of jobs want a bachelor's or years of experience. \n\nGiven the resources, im pretty savvy. Im a super quick learner if somebody is willing to point me in the right direction. I can do sooo many things but its a very wide and sporadic range. \n\nHonestly after the last year of trying to make changes for the better and get my life on track all while life was throwing curveballs at me at the same time, iv almost lost every bit of motivation I have. Im a shell of who I was and I still have a lot of aftermath that I will be dealing with for who knows how long. One of these curveballs left me with PTSD and I absolutely lose myself every day. Im ready to let my car get repossessed. Im ready to just stop paying my credit card bills. I ready to say F@*¡ it and just give everything up.\n\nI have tried a ton of things but maybe because of, well everything, maybe I feel overwhelmed and like iv tried everything and i haven't? Maybe the lack of motivation is pulling me back? \n\nI need to stay strong for my mom and my dad is gone now and I just want to be the hardworking honest daughter he was so proud of. I want to give my dog a better life with a yard to run in and I want to stabilize my life while im still young enough to start a family.\n\nI just feel totally (recklessly scribbles on a whole piece of paper) diminished to say the least. 😔\n\nI dont have start up costs for anything so stuff like that is out. Weather its advise, a little motivation, an opinion, an option. Its all welcome and appreciated. Please save the hate, my \"curveballs\" would be complete sink holes for a lot of people. Like I said im still trying. ",

After 2 years of Christmas bonuses, great stock picking and saving diligently, I have amassed \\~$170k. I just turned 24. I grew up middle class, went to state school and flipped burgers in college. I drive an old Toyota and rent a studio with my girlfriend.\n\nThe point of this post - I am dying for a sports car and a submariner. Basic? I know. Half of my monthly income covers living expenses. The rest is free to go to the market. The issue, I refuse to buy them because I know I will regret it once the cool factor wears off.\n\nI feel like I have amounted enough to start some kind of business. The issue - I really don’t have any ideas.\n\nI could buy a Peterbilt and put a driver in there. The issue, I can probably make the same $ by investing in fixed income.\n\nI could look to open a barber shop and rent out the chairs. The issue, I could probably earn the same in dividends/total return in a well constructed portfolio.\n\nI am your typical finance bro. I need help. I love working and want to work for myself. I put so much time in for some Managing Director at work just for him to profit off my ideas multiples higher than I will for the time being.\n\nLet’s hear ideas!",

Use SBA loans (10-15% down), so your $170k actually gets you a $500k-$2M revenue business.\n\n* You already have the financial analysis skills to find deals\n* Tons of boomer owners retiring with profitable businesses running on ancient systems\n* You get cashflow from day one + equity upside\n* Way better than being a landlord or truck dispatcher\n\nFind some boring but profitable local business: HVAC company, manufacturing distributor, pest control, whatever. Owner is 65 and tired. Systems are stuck in 2005. You buy it, add basic tech/marketing, modernize operations, and print money.\n\nTakes 6-12 months to find and close the right deal. It's work, but you're building actual equity in something you control.\n\nLook up search funds and SBA 7(a) loans. There's even programs/accelerators for this if you want structure.\n\nWay better ROI than a Rolex you'll get bored of in 3 months.",

The site [Searchfunder.com](http://Searchfunder.com) is also a great resource to learn more.  Searchfunding is just another name for ETA.\n\nIf you were to find a good business to purchase, would you quit your current job and operate the new one fulltime?  One of the biggest mistakes I see from people entering ETA these days is that they all want to be a mini-PE shop but don't want to operate the day to day.  For the size of business you'd be looking at, I just don't think that works.  But if you want to roll up your sleaves and work in the business, there can be opportunity.\n\nOne other point of caution.  Multiples are really high right now, and there is a lot of competition for even small businesses in some of the hotter spaces that involve recurring revenue.  I've been seeing PE and strategic buyers move downstream and compete with searchfunders for small businesses that they wouldn't have touched 3-4 years ago. \n\nIn terms of finding companies, I think your best bet is to pick a few industries you like, learn a lot about them, and then start networking.  It is a slower way to go then using AI and unpaid interns to pump out letters and emails to hundreds of candidates, but I think the saturation of the market makes a personal connection more valuable than ever.  Especially since, as another commenter mentioned, you will be risking your own money on due diligence, so that better connection will hopefully give you a higher chance to close.",

(some of the \"Sweaty startups\" come to mind there.)\n\nBut it does make a substantial difference. Especially if you aren't limiting yourself to your own resources, but actively seeking capital from investors. Likewise, with professional services that are client facing - clients will need to trust you and for that trust to be established, it's important that you can evidence previous experience providing XYZ. Especially as these services become more complicated.\n\nEven when a business is accessible to someone with less experience - It's also a matter of scale and complexity. As the business grows, expectations also grow.  If I had a lawn and a guy knocked on my door offering to tend to it, I'm not going to grill him on his background/qualification. I ain't care. But if he wants to rework my entire garden and exterior of the property, that's another story all together.\n\nCan drag that example into e-commerce, software, doesn't matter. Real domain experience is valuable and important. It doesn't completely remove risk, nothing does, but it does indicate someone is proven, at least in some relevant aspect. Not a perfect metric, but it's still a differentiator. I don't think many people are starting logistics companies with no logistics experience, and somehow outperforming the competition.",

You need to decide if that 30 minute call with a potential vendor or partner that will cost you money is worth the time not working on the client that will give you money.\n\n>I’ve been experimenting with softer filters that still require effort and context before a meeting exists.\n\nBe blunt. Not rude, but not couched in corporate politespeak. Tell them flatly 'I'm in a startup phase where I still am involved in day to day operations. I review things like this when it is not impacting billable hours that are the reason I am open. Please send me a proposal or outline via email that I can review when I am available.'\n\nAlso, if you in a niche industry or an industry with very known deadlines or busy periods, I will flatly tell a sales rep that if they don't know the industry they are trying to serve well enough that they would make a sales call now, then I won't do business with them. \n\nFor example, I am in a tax-related industry. We have hard, legal deadlines and all work must be completed by that deadline or there are legal and potentially criminal repercussions.  If a vendor or sales rep called me for a sales pitch during that runup, I would drop them. But I am also a jerk, so there's that.\n\n>Did you start charging once demand crossed a threshold, or was it always your default?\n\nI was years in before I figured it out. Money is a motivator for some and impediment to others, and it has no bias or agenda. It's the best gatekeeper out there.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable adding a deposit requirement to your calendar, perhaps get an assistant or a virtual assistant who can be your gatekeeper. I have at least three clients who use a Filipino firm to act as their front office. They answer calls, take messages, handle basic email inquiries, and schedule appointments, all for a third of what paying a receptionist would cost. And because of the time difference, they have extended phone hours. \n\nPerhaps an alternative is to follow Tony Stark's method when Phil Coulson tried to pitch him on The Avengers Iniiative:\n\n>\"Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.\"\n\nSet up a 2 to 3 hour block once a week that is solely for these calls.\n\nThere are several ways to deal with the issue. You need not choose just one, and each may be better suited for different phases of growth. \n\nBut the bottom line is you need to set boundaries now or you'll have far more difficulty getting where you want to be.",

We pivoted to a different idea and had one investor interested in the product but my co-founder rejected it because he \"didn't want to loose control\".  \n  \nHe doesn't want to grow the project further he's happy with a few customs he keeps jumping from projects to projects because he loves the idea of building but doesn't want to take any responsibility. Its weird because he had some experience in startups already so i thought he would be a responsible person. but he only joined startups when they were already doing well so he only had to manage people.\n\nThe only reason i joined that project is because i wanted to learn how to build stuff and i have some health issues and i can't really get a proper job, meanwhile he already have a job and don't really need the project to succeed.  \n  \nAs much as i learned from this I'm quitting this project he doesn't take it seriously i just feel like i have been exploited.  \n  \nI'm thinking of going back to school for product design but I'm not sure its a good industry i would love to join a real startup with ambitious people.

Get matched for a real-time call/video chat (like “someone’s available right now”)\n2. Get matched for async messaging (like this, but more structured/private)\n3. And honestly, what would make you actually use it vs just signing up and forgetting about it?\n\nI’m trying to validate whether this is a real solution or just me projecting my own loneliness onto others.

(A very good thing :-)  )\n\nFirst thing I'd ask is: Is the real issue you're facing A) the absence of helpful business advice and guidance, or B) the feeling of loneliness itself?\n\nIf it's just the business advice, you can bounce a lot of business dilemmas off of AI tools like ChatGPT (or whatever you use) and get some pretty decent ideas. Often times just getting a handle on the problem (quickly) removes the initial blockage or indecision, gets you in the flow, and suddenly you're off and running. And other times you'll find a good solution right there in the chat.\n\nBut if it's the feeling of loneliness itself, then that's another story.\n\nIn that case, finding new sources of company and camaraderie is one way to deal with it, but...\n\nI would say a far more empowering--and long-lasting--solution is to work at understanding the internal dynamics that create the feeling of loneliness. Most people think that loneliness is created by external circumstances--like having no one to talk things over with. But that's a great misunderstanding.\n\nA great starting point is to first realize that loneliness isn't an objective condition that you suddenly run in to due to circumstances (even if you're 100% alone), but rather is a subjective experience that bubbles up \\*\\*from within you.\\*\\* It's the result of an \\*\\*unnecessary\\*\\* activity of our minds that often goes unexamined for years... sometimes even an entire lifetime.\n\nStart investigating that dynamic. As you work to get to the bottom of it, and catch your mind in the act of creating that sense of loneliness, you'll see that loneliness fade away.",

Where it really helps is flexibility and control:\n\n* Auto attendants can greet callers, route them to the right place, and filter out a lot of business spam before it ever reaches you. That alone saves more mental energy than people expect.\n* Business hours rules for calls and texts mean late night messages get an automatic response instead of pulling you back into work mode. Some folks even use keywords like EMERGENCY to override that when something truly matters.\n* Separate voicemail and call history keeps business out of your personal inbox, which makes it easier to mentally shut off.\n* If you ever loop in contractors or a VA, calls can go directly to them without you acting as the middleman, and you can add or remove people as projects change.\n* Time zone handling is huge. Auto replies plus routing give you a system that sets expectations even when clients are scattered everywhere.\n\nGoogle Voice works fine for some people starting out. A dedicated VoIP business line just gives you more control around hours, routing, and boundaries without adding another phone. That separation can make a real difference for burnout without needing to juggle multiple SIM cards.",

(We have built mutiple homes before so we know what we like)\n\n1. We took this design, almost like a second opinion to another architect, which after 5 iterations was able to understand our wants better. But at a lower cost since the design had been made. \n\n2. Apart from this, much like solar or any construction, you can look into being the person to consult on site. Have the right materials been used, timelines followed, design laws followed, no compromise. I know its not proper architect and design based. But maybe on the go, while on the field something clmes up. The onsite expert that is not from an existing construction team is a boon, since construction is an expensive affair and timeline oriented. \n\n3. Also. You can definitely look into super innovative ideas for people with empty plots of land where temporary construction can be done to reach the goal of some mode of revenue generation or utilization of that land for a purpose, no idea in this personally, but seems like so many sleeping bare lands are owned but nothing is done, and its a niche. \n\nLet me know what all you guys think. I am not an architect not remotely from this field. Just a human.",

Short, specific queries convert much better than broad “category” terms, even if volume is lower.\n\nThen we layer efficient remarketing on Meta/LinkedIn to people who’ve hit pricing, demo or high-intent pages in the last 30 days. That combo (capture demand with search, warm people up with social) beats broad cold ads almost every time for us.\n\nHope this helps.....!",

Social was mostly a money pit unless I had strong proof (testimonials, before/after, clear outcome) and a retargeting loop to catch people later. Biggest unlock was treating it like a math problem: start with what you can afford to pay per customer, then work backwards into CPC and conversion rate targets before spending real money.

The 50k debt sucks, but it’s not some forever number if you stop the winter bleed and create even a small off-season lane.\n\nA few things that actually move the needle:\n\n\t1.\tGet the numbers brutally clear\nWhat’s your monthly burn in winter? What’s the minimum you need to bring in each month to not go backwards? That number becomes the target, not some vague “grow sales” idea.\n\n\t2.\tBuild an off-season offer that makes sense for your business\nEven if you “don’t operate,” you can often sell something like: deposits for next season, gift cards, maintenance plans, consults, winter-ready packages, pre-orders, bundles, or a B2B/partner deal that brings steady work. You don’t need to match peak months, you just need to stop the free fall.\n\n\t3.\tDebt strategy matters more than motivation Call the lenders. Refinance, consolidate, negotiate, whatever you can do to lower the monthly payment so winter doesn’t feel like drowning. Cashflow buys you sanity.\n\n\t4.\tAbout the partner breakup\nThat’s the part that hits like a divorce because it is. But don’t make big business decisions while you’re still emotionally bleeding from it. Replace the support system on purpose: one peer group, one weekly call with another owner, one person who keeps you accountable. Isolation will mess with your judgment.\n\n\t5.\tGetting a job isn’t a loss if it stabilizes the business If a part-time or seasonal job covers winter basics and keeps you from panic decisions, that can be a power move. Pride is expensive.\n\nIf you’re open to it, what kind of business is it? And what’s the biggest winter expense that keeps crushing you? I bet there’s a clean off-season offer you can launch.",

Made it way easier to see when something wasn't working and cut it fast instead of bleeding money for months.\n\nFor building a business specifically you need to understand unit economics (what does it actually cost to acquire and serve a customer), know your runway (how long can you survive at current burn rate), and be able to read a P&L without your eyes glazing over.\n\nThe copywriting and web dev skills are good but they won't matter if you can't figure out whether your business is actually making money or just looking busy.\n\nAlso learn to say no to expenses. Every SaaS tool, every course, every \"investment\" in your business - ask if you actually need it right now or if you're just procrastinating on harder problems.",
