      "text": "As an entrepreneur when I hear other people, W2 workers and other entrepreneurs, constantly say the rich did it for a tax write off. I automatically think this person is just dumb. Who in the world wants to spend a dollar to save 35 cents. It makes sense if you were going to do it because it’s a necessary thing for your business to grow but it’s just an expense, of course it’s not going to count towards your taxable basis. Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense. Any expense necessary for a business to improve of course should be deducted as an expense",

If it's bought through your business, you have to declare the benefit to you as an income inclusion. In practice, no one will care if you get a free ticket to a cheap game once in a while and don't declare it. But doing it year over year with season tickets is courting trouble.

If you’re spending money just because “it’s deductible,” that’s just lighting cash on fire a little more slowly.\n\nWhere write-offs actually matter is timing and cash flow, not magic savings. Depreciation, cost segs, spreading losses across years, that’s where tax planning can move the needle.

That’s not how it works, but TikTok finance and half understood advice made it feel that way.\n\nA write off just means the expense reduces your taxable profit. If you spend 1000 on something and your tax rate is 30 percent, you didn’t save 1000. You saved 300 and you’re still down 700 in real cash. You only win if that expense actually helps the business make more money later.\n\nWhere people get confused is seeing rich people do it at scale. If you’re already making a lot, then necessary expenses plus depreciation plus timing can make a big difference. But that’s optimisation after you already have profits, not some hack to buy random stuff you don’t need.\n\nSo when someone says just write it off about a laptop, a car, travel, whatever, they’re skipping the most important part. Would you still buy this if there was no tax benefit at all. If the answer is no, it’s probably a bad expense.\n\nTax write offs are boring accounting, not a cheat code. They soften the cost of things you already needed, they don’t turn spending money into saving money.",

Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

It was after COVID, I had money in the bank. I went out to live my dream - I travelled/surfed full-time. Did not give a fuck about anything.\n\nIt was the dream life. Now, 5 years later, I get hit with a huuuuge tax bill ($100k+) from a previous transaction (real estate). It's gonna wipe out a lot of my net worth, so I can't survive on SP500/BTC anymore as I did before. \n\nI now live in Mauritius (world-class surf/kitesurf spot) but I can't legally work here. Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost. I have no network....I'm a surfer dude who just came back into the Matrix after a 5-year hiatus. ",

A lot of people are giving advice about the taxes and hopefully some of that works out. If you are truly broke, then of course find a job that will sustain you. You started businesses and sold them so you have some skills. If nothing else anyone can work in customer service/account management and make enough money to live on. If you are trying to make a little more money, sales is a great way to go. Sales of anything, companies are always looking for sales people and your experience starting businesses, traveling the world by yourself and fun adventures is going to make you a magnet to sale anything. Plus most businesses don't care too much about experience and qualifications when it comes to sales. If you have some money set aside, you could do more independent sales like real estate, insurance, etc.\n\nHowever, if you and when you can think out of the box, you have what few people have. Experience starting a business and selling it for enough money to temporarily retire. Adventures traveling the world in wonderful exotic places. Surfing skills. You can do so much with that. I don't have the exact answer and you might not either until you just do something with it. Consult with people who want to find the best places to surf. Start travel trips for landlocked urbanites who want to go to warm places and learn to surf while they are there. Teach surfing online. Teach surfing in person. Create a product online (book, course, instagram, youtube, blog) that gives info on travel requirements (visas, passports, money exchange, etc.) best places to stay, best surfing spots, how to find quiet spots not covered with tourists, best places to get surfboards, etc. Create you own travel related company by contacting places you frequented while surfing and set up referral fees for travelers who you refer to their place of business. Write a book about your experiences from building businesses, travel, learning to surf, all the way to getting hit with tax bill. The options are endless and just doing one thing will lead to another, but there are a million guys out there working as laborers or in offices but very few who did what you did, so make the most of that.",

It serves as a monthly income generator, with payment amounts fluctuating significantly based on market conditions, proving reliable in choppy tech environments but capping upside gains. ",

              "text": "Mauritius is world-class. Top 1 in the world. I've seen YT .videos from Cabo Verde that is also good, but never been there. Check out this video - it shows One Eye on a small day (tiny day). Waves here get big, but they are relatively glassy. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VszdTnC\\_s0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VszdTnC_s0)\n\nThe wind is consistent, and the weather is warm. For waves, you don't need strong wind. I only use 1 size kite - 8M. I have different kites, but they are all 8M.\n\nIn Mauritius, the kite spot is called Le Morne. At this spot, there are 3 waves, all launching from the same beach/parking lot.\n\nFor beginners - Little Reef. This wave is basically 1.5M tall at most. There is no consequences for any crash. It's close to the beach. It's long and frequent. You don't have to time the wave. It's a closeout wave, which means it doesn't barrel or break down the line. It's more like a hack-and-slash wave. All beginners start here.\n\nFor Intermediates - Manawa. This wave is usually 2-3M tall. It's very slow and a big roller. It doesn't really break/tube. It is like a rolling hill, it won't ever crash onto you. The water is also deep, that's why it doesn't barrel. It's far away from the beach. People who ride this wave should go with a friend or carry their phone. There are rescue boats on call in case you are in trouble.\n\nFor Advanced - One Eye. As seen in the video above. It's shallow, about 0.5M deep at most. It breaks directly onto sharp reef. That's why it's the perfect wave. It breaks perfectly clean on a good day. If you drop your kite, expect to get pounded. If you don't relaunch your kite quickly enough, expect to get dragged underwater and/or have your kite sliced up. There is a rescue boat that can see you from the beach, so you don't have to call them. They'll come get you.\n\nMauritius is #1 wavekiting spot in the world. It's just fricking far and not cheap (due to government controls on Airbnb, etc.)\n\nMauritius has proper waves for kiting. You use the kite as your transportation tool to position yourself. Then you just drop in on the wave and use the power of the wave. This is a very rare situation. Most \"waves\" in the world, you have to use the kite for power because it's mushy waves. You can't surf the wave properly; you're basically hacking and slashing with a strapless board. Whereas with One Eye, you're able to drop down the face and slack the kite, giving you this crazy free surf feel.\n\n  \nIf you are a beginner, Mauritius will spoil you. Everywhere else is a joke for wavekiting. Come to Mauritius for 2 months. You will be super spoiled.",

It's totally possible.\n\n\n\nMauritius is a very attractive paradise for a whole generation who want to escape the big city lifestyle. Many go to live or visit in Southeast Asia and Mauritius is not viral yet.\n\n\n\nYou will already know every last stone there, what activities you can do, the best surfing areas, the best spots to take pictures, the best local places to rent equipment, the best local places to eat, where to sleep, etc..\n\n\n\nYou can reach agreements with local businesses and promote trips with closed packages and paid guides to see the islands and enjoy them from the local experience (what people want nowadays).\n\n\n\nYou could start creating good content generating a small audience and before summer (in April/May) you could be generating income online.\n\n\n\nI've explained it all quickly. You would have to learn about social media and so on, but I have raised communities to 30,000 followers on instagram and tiktok a few times (not promotion), so it is possible if you know how to show what the specific audience wants and they will end up buying from you because you will play the role of a trusted person at the destination. Another option is to do the same, but focused on luxury, which would totally change the type of content you should share.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople still underestimate the power of generating a community interested in something specific and you can see what content works just by watching.\n\n\n\nIt can be worth the effort by leveraging your experience and good life over the past 5 years.",

It's really just about getting back on my feet after a \"breakup\" with the beach life.\n\n***The geography part*** is a mind fuck. Mauritius is a very uphill battle when it comes to doing business. When I first arrived, it was natural for me to seek business opportunities. I tried a couple of things. I actually became a paid photographer and had repeat clients. They are happy with my work and even refer me. It's shocking at times but my customer service is excellent. I learned it from dealing with high end customers in Canada through my previous business. Plus I have a finance degree from good university in Canada. \n\nI'm not a street dude.\n\nBut now I need to scale myself up - things got extremely fucked up (excuse my language).\n\nIt's a mind fuck because I'm **not allowed** to work here from a visa perspective, despite me wanting to do real estate marketing (recording those high-end property tour videos and writing scripts for the agent) or general marketing for any business looking to grow. \n\nThe island is so small, we all know each other. Locals will rat me out to the police almost immediately. Mauritians are very protective. It is a tribal culture here. \n\nResources are extremely limited on the island since history, and Mauritius has been colonized by 3 European countries one after another. The locals are independent now and want to stay that way. That's why getting a work permit here is a bitch - they are not an immigrant-friendly country, despite having expats (ie. need specialized skill or high investment).\n\nTo be frank, I'm chill. I'm flexible. I can do a lot of things, move around, or just chill in my underwear.\n\nBut I also have a **GF in Mauritius who is planning to marry me (read: have kids)** before I got this huge tax bill (with potentially more coming). We were planning to build a little farm and all types of shit. That is no longer feasible. \n\n***That is the salt to injury.***\n\nBy myself, I'm chill. I got my motorbike and surfboard. Shoes are optional.\n\n***I told her - I want to work.*** But the country won't let me. For good reason, though. If foreigners are easily allowed into the country to work, the locals will become extinct. The skills difference is night and day. That's why the locals vote for the government to close borders. Or else it's colonization all over again - 2026.\n\n*TL:DR* \\- I have skills and already have multiple business plans for Mauritius. Government does not approve work permits easily - very difficult in fact. There's no work around. Locals will report me to immigration police the minute they see me operating under the table. Plus I have a GF waiting for me to give her a baby.",

They don't cruise the streets.\n\nThe CRA has the same authority as the police, though. Once you have committed a \"financial crime,\" aka not paying your taxes, the CRA can get a court order easily to start seizing your assets. Your bank account will be frozen and the bank willl funnel any incoming money directly to the CRA, by court order. TD, CIBC, whatever, have a court order to seize your bank account.\n\nThe guy who fled the country, yes I know people in this situation too. But that's not an option for me. My mom lives here, I come visit twice a year.\n\nI don't know how serious not paying the CRA can get, but there is no way I'm forfeiting my Canadian passport. If I do, I will not have any passport. I'm not trying to be Mel Gibson in Castaway.\n\nYour guy who fled the country, he most likely was just a permanent resident or temp worker without being Canadian.\n\nHis strategy was to max out all his debt such as credit card, line of credit, and take it back to his home country in cash.

You just grant permissions as per your terms and conditions to let people build on it and if you need to pull it back, you do. It's like at-will franchising...part fan club and part franchise. I have two I'm offering right now but they are largely untested and I can't devote the time to them I need to and also launch the platform that supports the FanChising concept at the same time. It's rough and I might have to reevaluate my launch startegy. One is called ReCardable - in which we're trying to normalize regifting greeting cards and one is called Phutzball, in which I'm offering a design and branding for a cottage manufactured ping pong ball trick shot game. I won't explain them in detail but you can check them out at goat-pen.com. \n\nIt's a shame that all the remote job platforms are basically crap and extraction platforms. Freelancing is tough because of international competition now. I'm in the SF Bay area. I get the sense that the labor market is really cooling off and it just hasn't shown up in the data yet.

Came back when his funds were depleting. Started a house painting business. Took about 2 years to be considered pretty successful. But now he’s got a bunch of crews, basically does all the admin stuff and doesn’t have to do manual labor. He still grinds working 12hr days from April-October, then goes surfing for 5 or 6 months. Pretty chill guy if you ask me. Understands what he’s working for, which is freedom and surf. I don’t think you’re too old to start something new, you already know exactly what you’re working for, just find your fire again. \n\nLong winded way of saying, are you my uncle?",

With your limited experience in marketing you can get right back on track. But, dont think of a business at this time, or a flip, etc it will set you back. You can absolutely find a job, online, remote. It might not be easy to get it. But you certainly can. And once things stabilizes, you re think your next course of action again.

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent. Many of the old business greats I had one thing in common.And that is, they sat on a mountain of cash.",

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

Start with things that fit into gaps in your schedule. The dividend income grows automatically while I can dial the active stuff up or down based on work demands.  \nFor anyone starting out:  \n  \nBegin with one truly passive income source (investments)  \nAdd flexible side hustles that don't require set hours  \nAutomate everything possible  \nBe patient - took me 2+ years to see real momentum  \n  \nWhat side hustles are you all running alongside your day jobs?

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Nothing viral. Just showing up.\n\n2) He kept his online presence extremely simple One page that made it clear who it was for and what problem it solved. No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out. No automation.\n\n4) He didn’t judge results quickly He mentioned that most of the benefits only showed up after sticking with it longer than felt comfortable.\n\nI’m curious if others here have seen similar patterns, or if this breaks down at some point.",

Scale and automation only helps once you have a manual workflow that is nailed down really well.\n\nIf you are getting started, assuming you have a product that actually solved a problem, first identify your ideal customer persona! Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage. Ideally you will find one that outperforms rest! Once you have this channel you can essentially scale up till it breaks. Once it breaks, you kinda have to repeat the process all over again. But that doesn't usually happen until you cross $1M in revenue etc!\n\nHope this helps :)",

Seemed like overkill when I was the only person doing everything. But when I needed to bring on help later, I had SOPs ready to go. Saved weeks of training time.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Curious to hear from other entrepreneurs:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- What early decision saved you headaches down the road?\n\n\\- What did you do differently that you'd recommend to someone just starting?\n\n\\- What would you change if you could go back?\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Some areas I'm curious about:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Financial decisions (pricing, cash flow management, early investments)\n\n2. Customer decisions (who to work with, contracts, payment terms)\n\n3. Product decisions (features, scope, MVP approach)\n\n4. Team decisions (hiring, partnerships, outsourcing)\n\n\n\nNot looking for generic advice - interested in real stories and specific decisions that made a difference.\n\n\n\nWhat's yours?",

          "text": "I started a Montessori preschool. I didn't know what I was doing, had zero experience but wanted a better place for my son. I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

I'm just glad I didn't lean into that.

Once a few days pass, context disappears and you start guessing - both with decisions and with numbers.  Having things written and financials recorded in real time made the real friction visible instead of hidden. \n\nIt wasn't about being organized for the sake of it.

Rent looked manageable, but commute and other fixed costs hurt way more when revenue was still shaky. I overestimated my network. People were supportive but lacked authority or budget. Later learned to qualify leads properly (BANT), which saved a ton of wasted time. Started with service-based pitch templates. Eventually realized clients don’t care about services, they care about their problems. Switched to question-based discovery instead.  \nGood things also happened that i got freelancers on board instead of full time employees. It helped me a lot to save on cost as well as avoid liabilities. For scaling up i outsourced to third party companies, it doesn't always helps to cut costs (sometimes margins are too narrow to make any profits) but it does helps to acquire big or multiple projects at a time or to open new channels.",

I should also mention I am married with 2 kids. \n\n  \nI exercise 3 days a week, I eat healthy, I do take a low dose SSRI to manage anxiety, and I sleep well for the most part. I take a vacation once, or sometimes twice, a year to recharge.\n\n  \nHowever, with all of this I still feel exhausted at work, and my threshold for lashing out is quite low. I don't know what else to do to manage my burn out! I truly love what I do, but I feel so low energy...my social battery is also taking a big hit.

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack. Many hours worked does not necessarily equate to many dollars earned. Life is so short, and work is far from the most important thing we can do with the little time that we have.",

Take an example of an athlete working and training his all life for one race which he needs to win or at least complete, but all of a sudden he loses the race because of an injury, what do you think about the athlete is he gonna sit there and feel very happy about losing the race or is he gonna learn from the injury and failure, train much more hard even after striving every single day and trying to overcome the failure.

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

For example: salt is cheap. Salt collected by hand from the salt pans of a small European island by Mr. XYZ whose family has been living across the street from the sea for generations. Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply. But I don't know what I'll need to assemble a bed or fix the doorframe. Create a package. Assembly kit for product X. I'm happy to pay a small premium if you make my life easier.",

You build a great business by experiencing other people's problems and understanding the situation they are in, then adding your unique insights based on experiences that only you've had. \n\nDon't try to find an idea for a business. Try to just get out there, meet as many different people as you can, get yourself into as many different situations as you can, and eventually you'll come across a problem that needs to be solved and you'll see it with a unique insight that only you can see.\n\nAnd remember - even if other people can see the problem as you see it, very few people can actually build the business to solve it. So while you're out there experiencing the real world, simultaneously spend time to learn about business, marketing, sales, market economics etc etc so that you're prepared when the moment arises. \n\nGood luck.

Those conversations were eye-opening, they told me what they disliked about the tools they use every day.\n\nIn this case, it was Clay. Even though it’s one of the biggest GTM tools out there, there was still a major pain point: pricing for HTTP API enrichment which is a feature many teams rely on. That feedback made me pivot completely and build a cheaper alternative for teams that don’t have large budgets or don’t need the full product just to use one or two features.\n\nNow I have a few paying clients and I’m focused on marketing it.\n\nThe takeaway for me is that ideas don’t come fully formed.

On your path, being the owner of a building management operation is dead ahead, and you'll have learned everything about business along the way.\n\nThis is entrepreneurism people, not sitting in front of your little laptop all night.\n\nHere's hoping I get as many negative comments as you.",

Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

Longtime Members of an industry usually know what’s going on, it’s part of the job. If you don’t have such knowledge, learn. Read up and ask questions about everything related to the job. \n\n2. You can certainly buy a small and stable business, but that’s expensive, and you are already locked in to what it is. Both have their places.\n\n3. It’s not a deal breaker, but having industry experience already lets you get started faster and less learning curve. \n\n4. Going too big too fast, having big dreams and ideas. You don’t need 10 tools or AI this or optimization workflow that. I have 3: CRM, Inventory, Accounting. It’s boring for a reason, business comes in and business goes out, no fancy projects. \n\n5. That’s called sales. These boring business are the hunting ground of the sales team. In person meeting, networking events, and a lot of cold market (90% in person for me) \n\n6. It means you could take an entire month of work, and you wouldn’t be able to tell what you did on any given day. Clients appear, you do your thing, the end. No stressful projects to get done or new features. My business hasn’t fundamentally changed what it does in 7 years. I have no plans to add any features to what I do for the next decade.",

Just pick any business that already exists, and do it slightly better,  show up on time,  offer good service,  be consistent.   That's really all it takes to run a good business.   You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Think garbage removal,  window cleaning, roofing company, landscaping, moving company etc.\n\nDon't buy an existing business or take on a huge loan.  You find something that you can start out small at.  Ideally something you don't need to to to school for like learning a trade (pumber, electrician).  Let's say garbage removal.   You start by working a traditional job,  getting your expenses really lean and saving up enough money to buy a big, cheap pickup truck.   You register a business, make a website, learn everything you can online from YouTube,  reddit,  books from the library about garbage removal and starting a small business.   You start social media accounts, hire a friend or someone on fiver to make you a logo.   You post ads on kijiji, craigslist, Facebook marketplace.   You get your first few jobs and get paid cash.   They leave you a good review.   You find a local business center that offers grants to small businesses and offers free classes and resources for local entrepreneurs.  You get a few more jobs.  You learn about how collecting and paying sales tax works and you get setup with quickbooks.  You design and print up door knockers and leave them on 1000 doors.  You try more sales and marketing things.   You get more work.   Eventually,  you have enough jobs that you can finance a big truck with a bin that you leave in their driveway.  You get bigger invoices.  Eventually you quit your full time job.   You keep working hard and growing.   You get so busy that you need to hire your first employee.  You get a 2nd truck etc etc etc.\n\nI studied business in school but it really doesn't translate to actually starting your own business.   You mostly learn by doing the thing. \n\nI am a self employed real estate photographer and i also run an online community for photographers to learn and grow.   All in,  i earn low 6 figures.  If i wanted to put the effort in,  i could do more sales, hire employees,  and build a small real estate media agency. \n\nYou just gotta start and take it one step at a time.",

Even if you follow your passion,  most of the work required to run and grow a business around that passion is still work that no one really wants to do.  Sales, accounting/bookkeeping, hiring, sending emails, putting out fires, etc etc.  Also doing what you love can often become less fun when you have to do it even when you don't feel like doing it.  For example,  professional athletes.  Some days you just don't feel like training and the pressure to constantly be improving and performing at the highest level is exhausting.   Professional gamers and content creators.   Some days you're just not gonna be in a great mood but you gotta fake it and be entertaining.  \n\nNothing wrong with having your job or business and then having your passions and hobbies outside of work.",

Spend time talking to that customer, watch where they hesitate, and notice what they ask that your product or onboarding did not answer.

Trust me while building this so many different ideas came to my mind and it’s so tempting to jump on another idea.

          "text": "so you have to have something you are good at doing. It super duper helps if you enjoy doing that thing. Then you need to figure out a way to have you doing that thing make money.\n\nThe easiest way to imagine this is to make a product and sell it. For example, let's say you like making muffins. You can make muffins and sell them to people who like to eat muffins. To figure out the route from making muffins to to making money on muffins, you can use various marketing frameworks to give you a starting route. My favorite is the 5 Ps of Marketing first developed by E. Jerome McCarthy in the 1960s. Originally he had 4Ps but I like the model where there are 5. \n\n1. Product: We know it is muffins. Now... what kind of muffins? What are your favorites? What are your friends favorites? What are easiest to make? What are hardest to make. As we get into the other Ps of Marketing, this answer might change. Also, what do you call the name of the company and what do you call the muffins? \n\n2. Place: This is really important for a muffin start up because it is a two part question: where are we selling the muffins and where are we making the muffins. If you go with a bakery model where the place you bake and sell are the same place, then cool. But if we don't have the money to pay for commercial rent then we need to think about other solutions. Many states have cottage kitchen laws that allow people to make commercial foods in their own home as long as a state regulator comes to their home and inspects the kitchen to ensure everything is commercial grade and up to state standards. Then you need to figure out where to sell them separately. This might be a weekend farmers market type deal where you sell on weekends. But selling at these farmer markets will incur material costs (we need a tent, tables, signs, cases to display muffins, bags, boxes, a point of sale system, etc.) and fees (pay for a spot in the market).\n\n3. Price: How much do we charge per muffin? How much do ingredients cost? If we buy ingredients in bulk; we can make more muffins cheaper but we have to make a lot of muffins. How many muffins per hour can we make?  If we are doing the farmers market, then we have to take into consideration all of the costs of manning a booth for a weekend and consider how many muffins we need to sell to cover those costs and ingredient costs and have a little left over for ourselves. \n\n4. People: Two parts to this question. Who is making and selling the muffins and who is buying the muffins. If you are hypothetically the muffin maker in question, great. But if you need help setting up and running the booth at the farmers market, you need to take into account how much their time is worth. This is also the time to think about your customers. If I were advising your business, I would take a field trip to the farmers market and check out the crowd. Are there a lot of people or are there not that many people. Do people skew younger or older? Are people buying lots of stuff or not a lot of stuff? Are they buying lots of baked goods or not a lot of baked goods?\n\n5. Promotion: This is the part I leave last because I think there is not a lot of point to executing on this part if the other parts above aren't figured out. But now that you know how much you should sell each muffin for, maybe you can do a special sampler muffin tray to let people try one of each of your muffins. You can hand out coupons for the next week so they can get 20% off a muffin order of 6 or more muffins if they come back. You can ask people at your booth to tag you on social media for a 10% discount on a muffin order. If sales are doing well you can allocate some of your revenue to advertisements and do a targeted tiktok ad in your 30 mile area to let people know that you sell muffins at the farmers market. If you make friends with another vendor, you can talk about splitting the costs of your tiktok ad budget and make one video advertising both you and the other vendor. It helps if you are neighboring stalls. \n\nThis is a lot of thinking for a \"simple\" business like selling muffins. That is because it is hard. People on YouTube who make videos detailing out how \"simple\" it might be are glazing over nuances that actually make the business engine go. Like I said earlier, as you make adjustments to one part of the marketing mix, other parts of the marketing mix will be adjusted. You have to keep doing these adjustments until it comes to an equilibrium. Then you can extract these findings and turn them into a plan. \n\nThe difference between a plan and a marketing mix outline like what was ideated above is an order of which thing you need to do first to get going down the path toward creating a sustainable business. \n\nIf there are specific questions you have based around a product/service you are investigating you should probably post about that and we can be of more help.",

I think it might have been produced by some government economic development committee.  Anyway, almost 15 years later I'm in my 3rd year of a business degree and I attended a seminar about entrepreneurship and they showed us the exact same video! \n\nI can boil it down for you. \nThere are three ways to get money to start your business. Number one save up. Number two borrow money from family/investors. Number three borrow money from the bank. \nThere are three types of businesses. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. \nI feel like that video was equally valuable to me in the fourth grade as I was to me in university\n\n\nIt is shocking how closely your example of buying candy in bulk and selling it on the train illustrates how to start a business. It will blow your mind to find out that almost everyone at all ages is making it up as they go along. For example if you wanted to start a candy store instead of selling it on the train, you rent a space, set up utilities, buy the candy and start selling it in the store. It's almost exactly the same except you are paying rent for a store. \n\nI mean depending where you live there might be licenses and permits that you have to buy. But you do sort of make it up as you go along.\n\nFormalizing the way you do business by writing procedures and policies down, will allow you to grow your business by hiring staff. It will allow you to move from being the salesman on the train to being the guy that organizes the salesmen.",

This particular idea was launched on January 1, 2021 and has resulted in just under $100k in revenue in 2025. You have to be able to articulate an idea into a written plan that defines the objectives of the business. Once you have a clear picture of how the business will make money it becomes necessary to define every process within your business that will result in you meeting your objectives of the business. So far I have two businesses running successfully. I stopped working for other people in 2018 and never looked back. \n\nOne of the most important things that I learned was that the business needs time to develop and mature. You must have a way to earn money while you allow the necessary time to develop, grow, and nurture your business. Most people will spend years and years punching a clock to help someone else realize their dreams, but then when they start a business and build a dream they give up in a year or two because the business has not gotten the proper traction that it needs. Plus there are a whole bunch of people in my life that did not support me having a business during the stages where it wasn't making money and I could not sustain living expenses. The thing is that I had to tell all the clock punchers to fuck off and stop projecting their working class views on me. I mean shit, they are not gonna give me the money or resources I need to live anyway so why the fuck would I listen to them? Punch that clock for 40 years and leave me alone. I got plans. \n\nMy second business that I started in 2024 just crossed $15k in sales in 2025. It is passive income for me versus my other company which provides a service that I am present for in order to make the money. The passive company will continue to grow over time and earn me a nice passive income while I play, work, sleep, and just live. If the sales continue to increase and the overhead remains low, this company will surpass my other one and earn me a nice living.\n\nGo for it. You have nothing to lose.",

And I honestly believe one of the winning factors in this day and age is having an online presence. And that goes all the way on whatever you are selling, whether services or digital products or physical products. If you don't have an online presence, your business doesn't exist.\nIt has come to an extreme where you don't need to fully develop your company or product to get your first customer or client or user.\nSo, you don't need to overthink it or even need funding. It just requires you to notice a problem. Understand the opportunity within the problem and understand how the market speaks and addresses that problem and then just emulate them.\nThen, it then narrows down to building a system for the business you want to start. This gives you leverage that rewards you for less effort but with directed action and focus. So what it looks like is that you set one goal, you want to achieve in accordance to the business long-term priority. \nThen, you divide the actions that need to be taken to reach the goal. And categorise these into quarterly projects. Then, they also break the projects into monthly and weekly goals, then those goals again to 3 daily tasks,and then one metric to track as this will kill the need to seek motivation and the more clear you make it, the more leverage you get from the system.\nSo I would truly want to show you what the system looks like as it will be the biggest needle mover in your journey.

En la práctica suele ser mucho menos épico y mucho más torpe: hablar con gente, probar algo pequeño, darse cuenta de que no era eso, ajustar, repetir. No empieza con “la idea correcta”. Empieza con fricción real. La mayoría de negocios no arrancan porque alguien “supo cómo hacerlo”, sino porque alguien estuvo dispuesto a hacer cosas incómodas y poco glamur durante más tiempo del que parece razonable. YouTube y Shark Tank enseñan el resultado. La realidad es una secuencia de pruebas pequeñas que nadie graba.",

And I'm not American, in my country you can't just make a lemonide stand without actually getting permission to sell food, clearance from the government agency and upon all you need to register as a business and that means you'll have to pay taxes ( yes from the start). That's why it makes it more risky to start anything without an actual business plan.
