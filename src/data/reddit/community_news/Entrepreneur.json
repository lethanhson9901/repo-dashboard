      "text": "Hi everyone. Please excuse any mistakes; English isn't my first language.\n\nI've been learning Python on my own for a few months now (i recently finished CS50P). My dad told me to stop programming simple games and create something useful, so i took his advice.\n\nI contacted a local clothing brand that was having trouble with their catalog photos. They wanted professional-looking photos of models but didn't have the budget for a photoshoot.\n\nWhat i built:\n\nI wrote a Python script that takes the flat images of their products and runs them through an AI workflow (generating variations, scaling to 4K, removing watermarks). It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business. He mentioned things like:\n\n\\- Formatting messy Excel inventory files.\n\n\\- Automating basic SEO tasks.\n\n\\- Logistics data entry.\n\nI said yes, but honestly, I'm scared. i know basic Python, but I've never handled \"mission-critical\" business data before. My questions for experienced entrepreneurs:\n\n1. Is it a bad idea to accept an advance when I'm still learning?\n2. For those automating businesses: What are the safest and lowest-risk automations\n\ni\n\n1. should propose first so\n\ni\n\n1. don't accidentally ruin their business?\n2. How do you deal with \"imposter syndrome\"? I feel like I got lucky with the first question.\n\nThanks for reading.",

You were paid $500 for a script, job done. Now they will ask you ad-hoc to create other scripts for them. That's it. Their business doesn't rely on you and if it does that's their problem. You are just 1 kid who can script a bit. Remember to ask for help if you need it, from the business and others.\n\nGood luck!",

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

          "text": "Hi, as a software engineer working at a big company for way more money than what I feel I'm worth - you've got a skill. Just because it doesn't feel like \"so difficult it's worth 500$\" doesn't mean that's the case: it's \"easy\" because you've got a skill, one which your CEO wasn't able to fill until now. That has value.\n\nBy the way, people learn by doing first and foremost, if there was no struggle in it you wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nDon't accept an advance in my opinion - there's nothing worse than trying to retroactively meet an objective just because they already paid you and you owe it to them; start working, and if after a month or two it's too difficult foor you, just explain it and part ways. But I think you have talent and this is a great opportunity.\n\n--------\n\nTo not negatively affect mission critical business data, **it's very important you research best practices**. Always back up data before you modify it for your tests; even afterwards keep the backups in case you sneak in an error you didn't notice. Learn about proper testing methodology to detect errors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, test driven development.\n\nI could go on forever, but really learn what are the best practices in whatever you do, they are your friend and they exist for a good reason.\n\nFor workflow automation software, I used make.com in the past and it was nice, and also recently n8n has gotten lots of hype.",

You don't know security infrastructure, you will not be doing anything that could compromise customer/company data.  This is for senior level coders, and they screw it up all the time.\n\nYou will be over your head at times, but your luck you will be able to use AI to help you, reddit, stackoverflow, etc..    \nYou should also try to find a mentor who knows a lot more than you.    \n  \nCongratulations on the script that did that for them.

They like you.  They want to see you succeed for years to come.  The retainer offer may be too much for the work you actually do, but then the owner may like you, and want you do even more, like expand your services for their website into other areas than product representation.\n\nIt is up to you to come up with those ideas.  And bounce them off the owner.\n\nWhat I would not do yet, is go to his direct competition and offer the same.  Why?

If you're this nervous, what I would do is come up with a plan for the business owner to pay for Terms-of-Work:  Negotiate \"I will automate X process for Y dollars\" and then only get paid when you are done.  He sees you as a much cheaper solution than an adult, and he's right about that, you also need to set his expectations as a gifted teenager who is still in the learning process.\n\nGood luck, and pursue this!

Depending on the service, having ACH as on option could save you some money, too. ACH should be a flat fee - no percentage. If it's in person, get hardware or tap to pay on your phone/tablet to get card-present rates.",

The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users. Maybe the answer isn't a better tool. Maybe is just doing the work we are trying to avoid. ",

That converts way better than 500 automated messages.\n\nOne tip: when you find those manual wins, ask them where else people like them hang out. You're not automating the outreach, you're learning where to focus your manual effort. Still human, just smarter about where you spend the time.\n\nTrust is expensive to build and cheap to destroy.

The thing is that if you could automate the proces of \"looking for\" the places, and start focusing more on \"how to join\", you'll be doing a better work. The same goes with AI.

But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nWas on my couch last night playing grizzly's quest while reading another \"self-made\" success story on my laptop. Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help.

In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

          "text": "I think this hits on something deeper about how we frame success versus how we experience it. The “I built this alone” narrative often resonates because it simplifies complexity into a story that’s easy to tell. It doesn’t reflect reality. Most successes are built on networks of support, systems, mentors, community infrastructure, and the ecosystem that makes opportunity possible.\n\n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said for the personal agency in execution. Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate? Is it about resource constraints? Autonomy of decision? Ego? Or something else?",

First off, I grew up relatively poor on a farm.  We weren't starving, but there was no financial help from my parents at any point in my adult life. As a matter of fact, it was me who was paying my parents bills when they got older. Couldn't afford college, so none of those connections. I went to work in the trades and spent 20 years learning the business and  living well below my means to save money \n\nWhen I say I built this alone, what I mean is that every step along the way the bucked stopped with me.  There were no loans, no partners, no backing, every dime was my money that I spent 20 years working and doing  without to raise.  Every piece of equipment, every stick of material, every dime paid for every service along the way has my sweat on it. Every decision, every bid, every success and failure have my fingerprints on them.\n\nMost importantly, from the beginning until today, if it all falls apart the consequences are all on me. I have never risked anything that wasn't mine to gamble. I never spent a dime of my wife's money, never used our joint accounts, and never dipped in to our household budget.  Nobody besides me loses anything if my business fails.\n\nOf course I've outsourced things. Of course I have employees. Of course they are vital to my business.  But they aren't here to help me grow my business.  They are here because I treat them fairly, have an awesome benefits package, and pay almost double the local rate for this work. Their positions are a result of my business growing from the risks I took to start and grow. I did that part on my own, with no guarantees and no safety nets.",

That’s real, and it matters.\n\n\nWhere I think the “no one is self-made” argument comes in isn’t to dismiss that, it’s to separate financial independence from human independence. None of us operate in a vacuum. \n\n\nPrinciples, work ethic, skills, and even what not to do usually come from somewhere, parents, tradesmen, early bosses, community, or hard lessons learned watching others fail.\nSo when people say “no man is an island,” I hear it less as a financial claim and more as a recognition that execution happens inside systems, cultural, educational, and relational, even when the risk and responsibility are borne by one person.\n\n\nI think both things can be true at the same time without canceling each other out",

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it? Being here in the comments, or with your friends, or even with other entrepreneurs saying, “I built all this with no help” - what is the value? \n\nReal question: is the value the motivation from the dopamine hit of pride/self-esteem? I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it. None of this is meant to be rude or condescending - genuinely curious about perspectives.",

          "text": "The reason why I don’t agree with people claiming that they are self made is because nobody ever talks about the help. For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money. I rather outsource than spend way too much time on something that I can pay someone to do it better than I can.",

In my mind, if Im paying anyone for a service related to my business, they dont get credit for my business growing unless they also share the blame if it fails.  \n\nFor example, I outsource my accounting. Its not her fault if my business fails, she gets paid regardless.  She's not helping to grow my business, she is performing a service that I pay for.  To me, its like giving credit for growing my business to the cashier at the gas station where my trucks fuel up.

An accountant, if you are not paying attention to what they are doing, they can easily ruin your business. Especially at the early stages of a business. Starting a business is not for the weak. But anybody that has assisted you that you can focus on that business without minor or even huge everyday stress, that is significant help.\nI’m not saying that every single person has to get credit, but claiming self made gives people the illusion that they have to do everything on their own.\n“Because of my great team, I was able to focus on the big picture”\n“Because of my amazing partner who took care of the household, they were able to handle our everyday stressors and I could focus on providing for my family”\n“A family member left me inheritance money and I had enough cushion to focus on solely my business for six months without having to work a full time job”\n\n Nobody talks about the support system that got them there and if they did, I think there would be less failed businesses because they would get the proper channels to be successful.\n\nIt’s like a college football player or basketball player. If they suck at academics, they can’t play if they don’t have gpa right. So they have tutors for their classwork and coaches that help them with their game. How do you know if you’re getting better if someone from the sidelines doesn’t help you fix your game?\nEveryone looks at things different but I understand OPs frustration.

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction. What seems to change over time is not the doubt disappearing, but your relationship to it. You start recognizing which decisions are reversible and which ones are not, and that alone lightens the pressure. Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice.

There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this. People like Steve Blank / Harvard have cracked a lot of it. Alexander Osterwaldwer / IMD as well. Anyone can learn from these leading educators on how it’s done.",

What helped me eventually was realizing that the uncertainty never really goes away, but you can build systems to contain it. I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing. Also started planning each day the night before and putting everything on my calendar instead of keeping endless to-do lists floating around in my head creating more anxiety.\n\n\n\nThe loneliness part is real too and having someone to bounce ideas off of, even if they can't give you definitive answers, makes a huge difference in staying sane through all the uncertainty.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

I tried and did get accepted to things like EO and such, but didnt like the group kind of therapy mentality. However this was many years ago, and maybe its changed.... Thank you for your input, I super appreciate it",

If your goal is to help people, and not get boring or money hungry pitches all day, I feel like your best bet for fulfillment would be mentorship. Or helping people who aren't even at the investment stage. Watch something grow from just the idea, helping with budgeting and gov docs, taxes etc. Might not be exciting, but if you believe in the person or in the idea, you could scratch that itch without needing to sink all your time and energy into it. Then again, if things not being under your full control is a problem area, that may need to be addressed prior. Alternatively, create. Seems to me a lot of broke creators are really happy, and a lot of rich people tend to lack that outlet.

Take the family on vacay to some island.  Go to one of those Tony Robbins seminars in Fiji.  Or just listen to the audio of his programs.  The personal development programs in your case, not the business programs. Trust me it will really help to find out what you want. It sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are now and what you want.\n\nWhat problems in teh world could you solve? If you have that amazing business ability, can you put it toward creating charitable organizations that would truly help people? Here and in other parts of hte world? A spiritual search maybe might aid this.\n\nBut before doing anything it sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are at this stage of your life and what that looks like without this or that business. Is that all you are?  If they all went south tomorrow, and you were left with nothing, no businesses, no cars, no fancy house, no fancy clothes, who would you be?  Would you give back?  To who? Would you pick up a long ago abandoned interest or hobby?  What type of person would you be?  What really matters?  Who in your life really matters? What would you notice that previously got lost in the whirlwind. Are you missing things in  life that are right in front of you? Material things come and go, and in the end you can't take them with you. Some major event could happen tomorrow that affects all of it. What's important is the people around us, relationships and what we give back.\n\nOne of the good clarity exercises Robbins talks about is the Rocking Chair test -where you imagine yourself at the end of your days, sitting in a rocking chair, and imagine what you are glad you did and what you regret, and what you regret NOT doing. My paraphrase.\n\nSome therapy is a very good suggestion if you have the right therapist.  Good luck to you.",

We judge ourselves and others by what they do, how much they have, what status they hold etc. Size them up, evaluate them, respect or disrespect them based on that. But is that a real measure of someone?  In some other cultures outside the US, it's considered offensive to ask what someone does for a living.  It's considered more appropriate to ask what someone likes to do or what their interests are.\n\nOne life event, one major disaster that disrupts the economy, one environmental disaster, then none of that matters. For perspective, imagine someone who might have owned a store in Ukraine, or owned an apartment building, or who's been a big shot in this or that. Now those same people are fighting on the front lines together in a town that is unrecognizable.  No one cares if the person next to them was a big shot or an ordinary guy, a saint or a sinner.  Zombie apocalypse, indeed.\n\nHave fun doing the Robbins seminar.  Cheers",

I feel like we are right at the tipping point, but not sure we have the capital to make it through. Insurance reimbursements can take a long time to pay out, so while we just had a good month, we are struggling to pay expenses because we are probably 4-6 weeks from actually getting the payments. At the same time we’re reconciling a lower revenue per patient (the reason our revenue isn’t matching our projections). So it seems like the solution is additional locations so we can have a higher patient count, but I might be stuck putting up the capital myself, which I really don’t want to do since I might have to reach into my own pockets to cover expenses while we wait for payment anyway. What do you think we should do to solve current cash flow problems? Try for an AR based loan or something? And what should I do as far as the future of the business? Wait until it can support additional locations on its own? Or fund it myself?",

Tackle hard questions and help contribute to scientific progress where there is a legacy and purpose beyond just profit.\n\nSame with charitable giving in general. Sustainable charity work is hard to come by - supporting charities building systems that benefit their communities and help their members improve their situation is very similar to your Dave Ramsey idea, because those folks aren’t looking to sell a startup for a specific ROI they’re just looking to create a living that improves their life. And mentorship in those spaces is entirely possible. \n\nSimilarly, helping non-profits build a non-donation based revenue stream is something that can feed your need for building while also having a higher purpose than profit. Meaning helping charities be less reliant on donations - as global giving can fluctuate and it helps ensure their long term survival. (They can’t make a profit of course but they can do activities that generate revenue).",

Knowing the mistakes you made, your approach to leadership and where your mental health is, are you really ready to offer mentorship or to start something that is focussed on impact and not income and growth?\n\nThis is a similar story to an acquaintance of mine. He built a business over a number of years and sold it last year. He pocketed millions and stills gets a residual income off the business.\n\nAfter he transitoned out staff moral and employee satisfaction went up, churn went down, quality went up. Despite being a big and busy business he was never able to let the people he hired do the job...he was an angry, overbearing micromanager.\n\nOn the outside he became unbearable to be around. He has spent years working insane hours and only thinking about and talking about business and money. He forgot how to have a day off and keep himself entertained or mentally nourished.\n\nHis kids are now grown up, starting university and absolutely do not need him trying to help...they got this far without dad being a reliable, supportive presence so why now.\n\nHis wife has her own life, hobbies, friends and a job and will probably move out soon.\n\nThey don't have any real memories of being a family together. Family vacations were actually his wife taking the kids on her own while he stayed buried in the business.\n\nOf course he thinks he is the one that has sacrificed so much to give his family a 'life' but I think they would have been fine without the trappings of...things...if they had a better family life.\n\nSo anyway this is a long way of saying to literally go for a walk in nature every day, turn your phone and emails off, play with the kids, do housework, see your friends, have lazy days on the couch, go on a trip...for a year...you are burnt out and have trained yourself to only think one way.

Have you taken the time to wind down from years of cortisol filled days and accepting that is time to fully close a chapter? It seems to me that it will be good to start with Journaling your self reflections and starting to vocalize or in this case write down these feelings. I can tell you are a problem solver by how successful you have been with your business for the past decades. Writing things down may help you to not just get it out but materializing these feelings into something physical may in a way kick in your problem solving skills on solving the big problem of inadequacy that you are currently facing.

Build that person up, build your business up, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis might allow you the ability to get back in the trenches with small teams, build people back up and mentor them again, and build a portfolio of assets that will cash flow for you.\n\nAs for the team at your current business, one of the greatest lessons I learned from a CEO from a large company, was don’t try and be involved in everything. You hired these people because they are talented, capable, and you have to get out of their way and let them do what they do best.

Hopefully one day i can take less on, have a good team to depend on. I do everything myself. From intake calls, strategies, solutions, UW convos, presentations, and work is on my mind 24/7.\n\nIts the challenges of my industry and the rewards are great.

I spiraled into drugs and booze and sort of nonproductive lifestyle and when outside factors threatened my business, I lacked the confidence and creativity at that moment to pivot. Honestly, I really wish that I would have just kept doing what I loved which I now come to realize 10 years later is company building. I should’ve just picked another project. Let those checks come trooping on in, but then picked something else and did what I loved before learned everything I count about something new figure out how to make it happen , execute..

So for me i have to work a day job to pay for my buisness. Im 2 years in now and its been a grind. If i had a pile of capital I could be so much further ahead, but im not in that position yet, but im getting there slowly. Most people would love to be in your position, but i definitely get it, we all need purpose no matter where in the wealth scale you are. So you could Give yourself a challenge and imagine your starting off from scratch again with $10k in the bank to start a buisness. I imagine someone with your knowledge could scale that pretty fast to a $100k or more, but it could be a fun project for you and its you doing all the work.\nGood luck with it all man, ive been through my fair share of depression and it sucks, but it does get better, just remember to keep your family close, love them and dont lose them, there the most important",

Soon after her memorial service the startup I worked at ran out of money and couldn’t pay me (I am still waiting for that payment). I ended my contract with them with immediate effect (they ghosted me for weeks) and put so much focus into finding a new job.\n\nSitting around and not doing what you are used to doing is a killer and the breakdown was quicker than I expected. Your routine starts to feel pointless really quickly.\n\nThe only way I could solve this was to give myself a different outlet. I chose to look at my weak points in my career and learn more. With my strong points I spent some tome collecting my thoughts and understanding where my value is. It slowly started to make sense to me.\n\nFrom what you mentioned, you are an amazing person with amazing skills but toning down like that can be a major hit. I think writing about what you have learnt would be an amazing start. Heck, if you do sign me up. I would bloody love to learn how you managed to reach this point. The beautiful part is that you could potentially build a community that you could collaborate with and that may just give you what you are looking for.\n\nThere will definitely be haters though but I feel that maybe readers will be a little more receptive to your advice.",

          "text": "I’m going through a similar problem. I have a large portfolio of real estate that brings in enough money for me not to have to work. And if I do get a job, the pay will amount to the rent of one of my assets. So a job won’t make sense. So I am stuck in this situation that if I got a job, I will not be able to take care of my assets (some are overseas so I need to travel). But sitting at home drives me nuts. I’ve managed to find a way to survive though.\n\nI go to the gym in the morning. Or I go for a swim. Exercise helps expel all that energy that’s irritating you; all the energy you were using for business. So vacant days are for exercise. Then you will have days where you need to run some errands, like checking up on your businesses. Or you can decide to travel somewhere. Or you can write a book. I’m writing a book addressed to my daughter, for example; and I’m pouring in all my life experiences and giving her advice on life. Even if it never gets published, I can gift it to her. Plus it’s very therapeutic. \nAnd also there’s other things you can get into. I’m in real estate, and I’m itching to try a business. You’ve tried business; why not get into real\nestate? Build something. Buy a building and rent it out. Real estate is great for the kids. It’s easier for them to run a building than a business. And it’s more difficult for your kids to squander a building or real estate assets; very easy for them to squander cash or sell stocks.\n\nYou just need to fill up the first half of the day with something like exercise, or a side project, or writing. Or maybe take yoga classes. Then after lunch, spend some time with family. Or take them out. My father, a retired lawyer, goes to a poetry club every morning, then goes back home for lunch, then brings his friends over for a card game, or he goes to one of his friends and plays cards. He has a driver, and a cook. So his driver takes him everywhere. He has managed to keep himself busy.\nAnyway, good luck. And be sure that the whole busyness phenomenon is a modern thing. Ancient Romans and Greeks used to spend much time in leisure. That’s how philosophy was invented 😂 No need to keep running around. Enjoy life!!!",

And no private equity isn’t just for billionaires. \nBut most billionaires have done it through private equity, also you build long term aswell, you talk business day in and day out and do that? Basically make your empire bigger, instead of consolidating.\nWould get assets for yourself instead of gambling on “markets” you’re a business owner/founder/ceo/entrepreneur, not anything else. \nYou invest in markets that’s basically modern day gambling or secure 10% at most. Unless you’re in that game and have an edge then it’s more iknow. Investing in markets for founders and ceos, should only be done with an edge or capital gains. Stop going for fking 10% at most. Also it’s not an asset in reality. \n\nPrivate equity or a subsidiary company of the current company and build an empire? \n\nInvesting in markets for people like you it’s stupid, iknow we all get the advice and iknow most want you to go through this. But the actuality unless you’re an employee or professional in the markets or have an edge. You should NOT do it. \n\nAssets also that’s gonna make the family happy and yourself in the process, they all want you to be happy and they want to be secure, right now? You need a purpose and stop gambling cause that’s how the women see it. They do not understand it, it’s gambling and they hate you see gambling away your success. \n\nAssets > normal advice (matrix shit)",

I have been struggling with moving from idea to producing because of doubt and wanting to do everything myself and make it perfect. I over analyze my decisions and cause delays, mainly because of my fear of failure and its possible impact on my family.  I have a lot of people depending on me and have been teetering on pushing my startup back a bit and getting a \"real job\" as has been mentioned by some family members.  But all of the people in this thread have been so empathetic and encouraging with great ideas. It makes me want to keep going! \nTo @BOWLeader- you are an inspiration! To hear your passion and what it has done for you is awesome. I'm sorry you've found yourself in a challenging spot. And it sounds like you've already conquered the hardest part which is being aware. And then taking the step towards fixing it. That's a place many never make it to. \nIf you do decide to mentor-my hand is raised :) But I also think self care is most important now.  I always wondered why there weren't more therapists that specialized in specifically helping people impacted by their career, in some way or another. Because when it's your passion-it affects your soul, that cannot be helped. \nI don't have any better advice than the more experienced people have given.  I'm a 50 yr old newborn entrepreneur. So I will just throw as much luck and blessing towards you as I can!",

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

A race to the bottom for generic, easily copied offerings, and a smaller group that survives by being closer to real-world constraints, customers, or physical systems. That’s probably why unsexy and physical products feel more attractive right now. They’re harder to fake, harder to clone, and harder to undercut overnight.\n\nIt feels less like the end of entrepreneurship and more like the end of “easy” entrepreneurship.

Everyone uses tools like Cursor and Windsurf and our engineering velocity has at-latest doubled if not tripped over the last 1 year without adding new members! So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

Biggest wins: code review assistance (catches things humans miss at 2am), documentation generation (nobody likes writing docs), and customer support automation for common issues. The real impact wasn't cost savings though - it was speed. Shipping features that used to take a week now takes 2-3 days because the boilerplate work is faster. The catch: prompt engineering is a skill. Our team spent weeks figuring out how to actually get useful output consistently. It's not plug-and-play like the marketing suggests. Still worth it, but required real investment to make work.",

The real ROI came when I stopped looking at tools and started building a **Custom Strategic Framework** for my operations.\n\nInstead of hiring AI as a 'writer,' I integrated it as a **Tactical System** that follows my specific business DNA. It moved me from manual micromanagement to a state of high-level operational freedom. If you don't have the internal structure mapped out first, AI is just an expensive toy.

We built a triage system that now handles about 60% of incoming volume autonomously. Our team went from drowning in repetitive questions to actually solving complex problems and building relationships with customers.\n\nOrder tracking automation saved our ops team around 5 hours every single day. Just eliminated all the manual status lookups and update requests. Sounds boring but the time savings compounded fast.\n\nLead generation might be the wildest ROI shift. We went from $200/month on traditional tools to like $10/month with AI workflows doing better work. The targeting got more precise because we could iterate and test way faster.\n\nThe bigger shift has been cultural though. Once people on the team see AI handle the grunt work well, they start spotting more opportunities themselves. That momentum is probably worth more than any single automation.\n\nWe've had plenty of things fail too. Not everything works. But the stuff that does work has become essential to how we operate now.

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

You're just making it more complicated.\n\nKeep it stupid simple early on. A CRM to track leads. A way to call people. A way to email. That's it. You don't need orchestration and enrichment and all this other stuff until you're doing real volume.\n\nThe real question isn't \"what tools\". it's \"what's the bottleneck?\" Most of the time when people are switching tools, they're avoiding the real problem. their sales process sucks or their reps can't sell.\n\nApollo, Clay, Zapier... all fine tools. But none of them are going to teach your team how to isolate objections, do proper discovery, or actually differentiate from competitors. That's what drives revenue.\n\nSo before you go chasing the next tool, ask yourself this: can your team consistently close 30% of qualified leads?

AI detatches the human from the creativity of consumed media in any form.\n\nPersonally I go out of my way to avoid content that is generated by AI because it feels inauthentic. So do a lot of others, and it's not a great look when consumers actively go out of their way to consume your products.\n\nI expect AI to thrive in areas where complex static computing often fails. Recognition, manufacturing, decision making, and tooling. I expect AI to fail on anything media related. Unfortunately an absolute shitload of investment and usage is in media generation. It will collapse, and from the rubble will rise the actual consumer usecase... Just like the internet bubble.",

The second I see or hear \"this one change/this one product/I was never the same after x) I swipe past it.

It’s less about which channel is better and more about where your audience already is and how much trust is needed before they buy.

Access to your business Facebook page is connected to your personal Facebook account. It's against the TOS to maintain more than one personal Facebook account. When you say \"have separate emails\" for all your accounts... how does that work? They've specifically designed their systems to require a business owner to link all their accounts to a single personal profile. You're potentially more at risk of being flagged if you try to maintain several personal FB accounts each attached to a unique business page.",

We already launched in Europe (starting with Spain) and our current setup is this: \n\n\\-We already have a local payroll provider\n\n\\-We have a local accounting firm\n\nBUT, it is becoming too hard to continue this way and I will list the reasons below: \n\n1. We are concerned that we are overpayng some taxes \n\n2. We’ve noticed many frequent mistakes from both payroll and accounting providers\n\n3. Salary miscalculations and Incorrect payslips every other month\n\n4. Some issues managing employee medical checks\n\n5. And on top of this, VERY slow replies and poor English support (I guess, you get what you pay for- and in Spain apparently, English is not so used). But we learned the lesson the hard way so we are now looking for alternative local providers in Spain.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any good EOR companies in mind that could help us fix the above. Ideally a provider that provides both the payroll and accounting services in Spain, but any suggestions are welcome!! Thank you! ",

I see some other redditors are suggesting you global EOR providers, but honestly, if you are worried about overpaying taxes, these big providers won't help you optimise absolutely anything. Plus, they won’t offer you the support you need. I'd go with local providers (that speak English though!) because they will actually allow you to legally save some money on taxes and mandatory contributions. I would recommend Bridge in (recently seen posts of them on Linkedin that they’ve launched in Spain). I’ll ask some contacts as well, and comment later with more suggestions once I find any.",

Repeated payslip errors and slow replies are red flags, not “Spain being Spain.” Same with medical checks falling through the cracks. Someone should clearly own that. Local payroll plus local accounting often breaks down once you’re a foreign company. The two vendors don’t really coordinate, and when something’s wrong, you end up chasing both. That’s usually where the frustration comes from. If you want fewer moving parts, an EOR can help. The main upside is accountability. One provider owns payroll, taxes, compliance, and admin, so you’re not stuck mediating. I haven’t run Spain myself with Remote People, but I’ve heard solid feedback from HR managers who did. Mostly about things being calmer month to month, fewer mistakes, and faster responses. Not perfect, but better than juggling locals. So yes, it makes sense to rethink the setup. Ask any provider very directly how they handle errors and response times. That’ll tell you a lot.",

The old method of making movies is dying off, I'd say, but only partially. The physical necessity of being on location in California to find actors and make movies is pretty much done. The rise of AI and other 3rd party platforms (Netflick, Youtube, and other internet platforms) does lessen the 'path' through Hollywood.\n\n\nBut people still are making movies, shows, hiring actors, making effects. So maybe starting your own part of the old system is the path forward. An example of this is Reese Witherspoon: she started a book club and has 1st right to book options that can be made into movies, based on her book club's feedback: essentially, crowd-sourcing film scripts. A24 was started in 2012, focused just on interesting films and directors Hollywood seemed to have ignored, and turned into a tour-de-force, putting out interesting projects every year. Maybe something similar for TV shows can be done? Or Youtube? I know Netflix is trying, but they have so much money it's actually causing them to cancel shows earlier in their prime rather than suffer through declining ratings. That's an issue that needs a fix.",

That previously was impossible under the old system. \n\nThis is occurring as the costs to produce said work have diminished greatly, again, another barrier of entry that’s been unblocked. \n\nThis isn’t unique to just filmmaking, it’s entertainment as a whole. While many of my peers act like the sky is falling because they’re losing comfy gigs on tv shows and movies, I see it as the best opportunity of our lifetime if you’re willing to take the leap and have the chops to entertain, educate, and attract attention.",

You can easily page up and down, and it's obvious what is a reply to what. It's obvious who is saying what and what date/time they said it. It's easy to expand/collapse. And all this is reasonably easy on both a computer and mobile. \n\nNow you imagine this as an email chain. This relatively simple thread becomes a nightmare to navigate. There is no way to keep track of what you are supposed to be reading, who's replying to whom, and if there are multiple replies to one of the emails that branch into their own conversations, it's literally impossible to keep track of. Plus your inbox is flooded, with emails that only contain part of the conversation. Are you looking at the email with the whole conversation? Or only part? You got a reply, but are they replying to an email with the whole conversation? Or are they replying to an incomplete email? Trick question. They are all incomplete because there is no central repository tracking the exchange as a single conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has email. You make a contact all the way across the world? They have email. Random customer who has a product question? Email. Communicating across multiple departments that don't share a Slack/Teams/Basecamp ecosystem? Well they all have email.\n\nGoogle tools and AI won't solve this. No two-word answer will.

I just have written out to me and deposited into my business account. I didn't get an LLC until about 5 years ago and and I didn't have business insurance until about 3:00 so I kind of dragged my feet on doing this. But I've always been making money with the business but it was always kind of a here or there thing really. The last 3 years was when I took it very seriously and it's really starting to scale and I made a lot of connections and I feel it's very professional but I had a lot of time where I could test stuff, work it out and just go slow with everything. So I would just say the hardest part is getting started and making money and then as that goes you can always refine it tweak it. Adjust it later",
