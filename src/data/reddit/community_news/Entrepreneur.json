Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

You’ve conquered the hardest part: the Internal Validation.\n\nHowever, coming from my book 'Startup Inferno,' I must give you a word of caution as you scale.

You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.'

      "text": "I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

How much risk am I willing to take in the supply chain? If I over produce, then I create slack in the chain which may be costly, or may force me to lower price to move the inventory.\n\nGood luck in data collection across huge CPC market area for competitive responses, especially for perishable food products.

      "text": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice & clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

They make you feel busy without making progress on anything that matters. When you only have 3 things, you cant hide behind \"oh ill do the hard one after these quick wins\" because there are no quick wins to hide behind.\n\n  \nThe physical aspect is key too. Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign. It means the system is visible enough to actually hold you accountable. Thats the whole point. The flip mechanism sounds like a clean solution to that.\n\n  \nCurious how many prototypes you went through before landing on the magnetic fixation. Hardware iteration cycles are brutal compared to software where you can ship a fix in minutes.",

Max 5 applications per day but make them count. Customize each one.\n\n2. Use tools that remove the busywork. I use Sprout which autofills applications and tailors resumes with AI but lets me review everything before submitting. Saves like 30 min per app.\n\n3. Track what gets responses, not what you send. If a role type never replies, stop applying there.\n\n4. Keep it simple. I used a basic spreadsheet with just company, role, status. No fancy automations.\n\nOrganizing = productivity is a trap.

Sprint planning sessions that took half a day, Jira boards with 200 tickets, elaborate story point systems. We stripped it back to a simple rule: every morning, each person writes down the one thing that moves the project forward today. Not three things. One. If they finish early, great, pick another. But the first thing on the list is the thing that actually matters.\n\nOutput went up noticeably within the first two weeks.

You set a deletion timer for a thought/task and have to refresh it each day if it stays important to your goals. For me it'd be about 7 days. I'd dump my ideas into the journal, rank them by importance, then recall them using auto fill (app would keep record of 7 days of blurbs). If I didn't think about it again for 7 days, it would be deleted and gone forever. Naturally, important tasks and ideas would rise to the top and enter working memory, and I wouldn't have the latent anxiety that I was forgetting something important. ",

      "text": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

I said no and she hung up with a simple goodbye. After the call, I was convinced it was a bot. I also realised it didn’t annoy me like a sales call usually does but that might have been due to the fact that it was new and surprised me. I’m sure getting 10 of these calls a day would be annoying. I need to make cold calls for my business and I avoid it like the plague. I know it’s the game but when I know how much it annoys me, I can’t do it to others. I think I might have to look more into the AI bot thing for my own business.",

I'd keep pivoting until I find a product market fit, then I'd scale on it. Without treasury management, I'd end up chasing investors, and running out of cash before reaching a product market fit like I've done many times in the past.

It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

I spend countless hours researching seemingly mundane industries. I try to find the corners that need to be thought around. A lot of people assume that these big billion dollar corporations have everything tied up tightly.\n\nWhat I seem to find is that there are tons of crumbs. These opportunities that I find look like severe risk. Usually, there is a lot of risk. Just in the fact that the companies that you're competing against can crush you by giving the parts away for free, if they really wanted to. Especially in the first few years, getting traction.\n\nThat's why my channel to market is direct.Calling the customers and bypassing distribution channels traditionally established. I don't do online advertising or online sales or any marketing.Because that shines a light on me.And I don't want the biggest players to see what i'm doing until it's too late. Once I control the market share, I can do anything I want.But by then, marketing doesn't really help me gain customers.Because I already control the market.\n\nIt's a long slow process. It's full of dead ends. To me, it's the ultimate game, though better than any video game better than my passions for rock, climbing or sailing or surfing. To me it's the last life or death game.That man has that we can play with.\n\nThe goal is to find the value to bring to the market place. That might be by rewriting the traditional distribution chain in an industry. Combined with revamping the channels to market. Or it might be bringing the first import version, always of higher quality. At half the price. It might be taking a part that's been used one way for decades and finding a new life for it.\n\nThere's so many ways to build wealth out there through opportunities. But everyone's looking for the shortcut. When it's hidden in the work that they're trying to avoid. There's never a guarantee in any of the research of the searches. It's just like playing with puzzle pieces.\n\nThat's what i'm passionate about. I would sell dirty diapers if it was moral, legal and ethical. And it fit my principles, and I could find a way to bring more value to the marketplace.\n\nMy next ten year goal is a billion dollars in revenue. We fire surpass the need for money ourselves. But we have a lot of charitable giving that we feed, and that'll be never ending. So my wife and I have decided that we will never stop.And we will work until the day we die.",

Most people do not start with a clear business idea that feels meant for them, that usually comes after doing something boring or messy first. The internet makes it look like everyone woke up with a genius concept, but in reality most ideas are discovered through action, not thinking.\n\nGiven your situation, unemployed, low capital, not technical, working from home, you are actually in a good spot for service based things rather than products or SaaS. Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind. It usually just means you have not done enough experiments yet.",

          "text": "First of all, you should be thankful, grateful for yourself that you are taking the first step to asking the question. Okay, so basically, I was in the same scenarios where you are right now. And like I was struggling with almost seven years. I was, I have been confusion while choosing what should I do? Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief. Because your beliefs are not your beliefs, okay, right now. Your beliefs are from The world that shaped  you from the people around you that you. So what pattern I have noticed in myself and I think you should also notice in yourself, maybe you can relate with me. So I'm just honestly sharing my journey a little bit.\n\nSo maybe it will help you out. First of all, taking validation, yeah. What do i mean by taking validation? If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes. And whatever the thoughts coming in your mind, maybe related to your business or anything, you will get the answer. Just do it for at least 7 days and you will maybe get the idea that you are looking right now.",

Most real businesses start as “this kinda sucks, I’ll try to make it slightly better.” Boring > brilliant. Don’t pre-optimize problems you don’t have. Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced. Product businesses are harder, slower, and riskier early on. You don’t need to be an expert yet. Pick something you’re slightly better at than average or willing to learn fast.\n\nAlso: SaaS being “trendy” doesn’t mean it’s the path. I didn’t code when I started either. Most people learn after committing, not before.\n\nThe biggest trap is waiting until you feel “ready” or confident. That day never comes. Start tiny, embarrassingly tiny. A $100/month win beats a perfect idea that never launches.\n\nIf you take one thing from this: clarity comes from action, not thinking.",

You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

I ran a furniture making business (still running... kind of) I loved it, but I learnt that I'm not in the right location for it. I ran a side hustle of programming websites for people, I never really ran it like a business, but I loved it... I ran a side of designing logos, I kinda liked it, I actually wanted to go deep into it. But I stopped. I'm currently running a tutoring business I want to dedicate my soul and heart to.\n\nMy passion is everything engineering. I did Electrical Engineering at college.\n\nMy point is, you don't have to solve a unique problem. Just choose one thing and do it wholeheartedly. It could be as simple as being a video designer or hobby electrician. Just get started.\n\nAn important eye opener is that, big businesses changed their business products/services a lot of times. Some started as a simple washing machine business but now they're car manufacturers. Get started.",

Before that I spent a decade working at other peoples companies, convinced I was \"learning\" when really I was just comfortable.\n\nThe kids building things at 16 have one advantage: they dont know what failure looks like so they arent afraid of it. Thats it. Everything else favors you. You have context for real problems. You have savings (or at least a credit history). You have professional relationships. You know how businesses actually operate from the inside.\n\nMy first company flopped. Built it in stealth for 8 months because I was paranoid someone would steal the idea. Nobody cared. Not because it was bad, but because nobody knew it existed. I was 33 and felt like a complete idiot.\n\nStarted again at 34. This time I talked to 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code. Within 6 weeks I had my first paying user. The difference wasnt talent or timing. It was that I finally had the maturity to do the uncomfortable thing first instead of hiding behind the fun stuff.\n\nThe honest truth about starting at 35: your biggest enemy isnt age. Its the voice in your head that says you should have figured this out by now. That voice is lying. Most successful founders I know started their winning company after 30. The ones who started younger just failed more times before they found the thing that worked.\n\nYou have maybe 30+ working years ahead of you. That is an absurd amount of time. Start now and stop comparing your beginning to someone elses middle.",

Has been for 6 years. And I am absolutely paralyzed into inaction from 100% mental nonsense.\n\nI'm the doer of the year behind closed doors. I happily spend buku hours buried in my laptop developing ideas, having new ones, building, learning, going crazy on projects, and so much AI. I can \"do\" very seriously in this sense. From that, I have more than a few business routes I could take right now.\n\nI just simply can't pull myself to make it known to the world. If it's a service, I can't bring myself to try and sell it to a business. If I want to meet others working toward goals like mine, I can't post the social media.\n\nI could use some collaboration, pretty tough, even just a chat or email.

We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

It's hard to build momentum in your space, I did it for a decade.\n\nI'd focus on referrals for now.

Sure you’d be taking another risk and probably have to pony up but the risk would be way less rather than just hoping a good commission structure will attract top salesmen. That strategy will attract any salesman looking to job hop / leave where they’re at because they’re already in a similar position they’ll be in with you in 6 months.",

So if you plan to pay 100K as salary and 10% commission and average sale value is 1 million then till 100K earned the commission payout is zero and then after that it can be a graded scale so say 500K to 1 min you pay 3% on revenue collected( not down payment). And then you can increase the scale. Alternatively you can choose to pay 35K bonus from 500K to 1 million sale and then give 10% of 35000 as extra from 1 million to 2 million capped to 2X base salary.",

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "text": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

Bad sales people who can't want a base salary and are constantly getting fired (why would you want to work on commission if you can't close any deals).\n\nGood sales people are like 10X developers. They are rare, but they are there. In a world where a good sales person works the same job for 5-10 years and bad sales people work a job for 5-10 months and in a world where there are 10 times as many good sales people as bad sales people the number of good sales people looking for work is 12 X 10 = 120 times greater than the number of bad sales people looking for a job.\n\nYou need to look for those diamonds in the rough to get a good sales person.\n\nYou then also need to train them on your product. Set up a marketing funnel for them to give them a constant stream of business, etc.\n\nSome people hire a bunch of young, hungry, commission only sales people - fire 90% of them in 6 months because they aren't even worth the time being spent on developing them and build their sales force that way. But you really need to be able to develop sales people in order to be able to do that. Our model has been to hire a bunch of young hungry technical people, start them on technical projects, and develop them, over time, to start to work with clients and write deal proposals, with a lot of supervision at first.",

The buyer is not purchasing a product - they are buying confidence that your team can actually deliver. That kind of trust transfer takes years to build, not months.\n\nThe commission-only or hybrid model is the right direction, but the pool of people who can sell $100K+ technical services AND are willing to work on commission is extremely small. The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

Let them go after 3 months and $15k in lost salary payments and had a serious think about why it didn’t work. Here’s my thoughts.\n\n1. I was expecting a sales person to build out sales infrastructure when they were expecting just to close deals. We didn’t have a big enough pipeline to have a sales person so the bulk of their work would have been just building that and that wasn’t their skill.\n\n2. I didn’t have a clear enough offer / product. Well this one is a bit challenging because I do, and we are bringing in close to 1M each year in business so it’s obviously working. But we don’t run ads / have a fixed price list / etc etc so it was difficult for the sales person to articulate.\n\n3. They didn’t know very much about the service that we offered and so couldn’t really understand the need for it. That made them fail when it came to explaining basic concepts.\n\nEven at 1M a year we’re not big enough for that. I’m closing business now and doing a good job. We’re working on building out the pipeline infrastructure and are not looking for sales at the moment at all.",

Customers like \"experts\" far better than a vaporwave person.  How to do this easily?  Take one of your staffers along with you on a sales call.  Let them see how it works.  Then have them answer some of the customer's questions, and let the staff member \"snow\" the customer with technical jargon, as that is GOOD thing.  The staff member just PROVED to the customer they are technical, not good at talking with normal people, and literally will have a valuable opinion of the do-ability of the task, and even define the stages and algorithms needed to solve the task. \n\nThus,  the customer now knows your firm has experts who are well qualified to COMPLETE the job, instead of getting just half way, taking half the budget, before telling the customer, the job can not be done.\n\nHope this helps.",

The right guidance could save you from repeating the same expensive lesson. You’ve built momentum; now it’s about building leverage.",

In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

          "text": "Been through this exact transition. Few thoughts from the other side.\n\n  \nOn the co-founder question: at $321k ARR you honestly dont need a co-founder, you need a strong first hire. A co-founder at this stage means giving up equity for something you could solve with a good ops person or senior engineer. The mental load sharing you want is real but a trusted #2 employee can provide that without the complications of a late-stage co-founder relationship.\n\n  \nOn YC: great network and signal, but going through a program primarily to find a partner is an expensive way to network. You already have a working product with real revenue. YC is designed more for pre-product or early-traction companies. If networking is the goal, founder communities like OnDeck or even just being active in niche Slack groups for your vertical would get you there faster.\n\n  \nOn the burnout itself: the biggest unlock for me was realizing that not everything needs to be done well. Some things just need to be done. I was spending energy trying to be excellent at support, sales AND engineering simultaneously. The moment I hired someone for support (even part-time contract) and let them handle it at 80% of my quality level, I got 40% of my mental bandwidth back. That 80% was more than good enough for customers.\n\n  \nPractical next step I would suggest: before you look for a co-founder or apply to YC, try hiring a part-time contractor for your biggest time sink (probably support or sales). Run it for 60 days. You will either realize that was all you needed, or you will have a much clearer picture of what kind of partner you actually want.",

Not because sales was the hardest part, but because it was the only one that could be systematized without needing someone as smart as the founder.\n\nHere's what worked:\n\nDocument every single call for two weeks. Every objection, every demo flow, every discovery question. Then hire someone decent, not exceptional, and have them shadow for 30 days. They take over setters first, then closers.

We worked together as partners just like co-founders for many years, even though there was only one \"founder\" in the usual sense of the word.\n\nDo you think that's a model that could work for you?

A co-founder would want equity but you've already de-risked the business - they'd be joining something that works, not building from zero. That's an employee not a co-founder.\n\nWhat you actually need is to hire your first 2-3 people and delegate the stuff that drains you most. Figure out which of support/dev/sales exhausts you the most and hire for that first. Most solo founders try to hire for everything at once and end up with mediocre generalists. Hire one specialist who can own an entire function.\n\nThe YC thing is backwards. You don't need a co-founder to share the mental load, you need to stop being precious about who touches your product. YC wants companies that can scale and you can't scale if you're the bottleneck. They'd probably tell you to hire anyway.\n\nFor burnout - the only thing that worked for me was accepting that slower growth while building a team is better than fast growth that kills you. Your revenue will flatline for 6 months while you train people and that's fine. You're playing a long game not a sprint.\n\nOne practical thing - before you hire anyone, document every process you do repeatedly. Takes 2 weeks of painful work but then you can hand someone a manual instead of training them from scratch every time.",

Like marketing teams need different prompts/agents than finance or ops. If you're not already doing department-specific use cases, that's where the magic happens.\n\nAlso curious - are you setting up any custom GPTs or API integrations for their specific workflows?

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this. Just don't forget to breathe during the first session 😅",

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone.

It cuts out a ton of guesswork and wasted spend, so your team can focus on growth without endless tweaking.

Great for strategy work.\n\n📋 Outreach & follow-up agents : they draft personalized outreach, reminders, and sequences based on brief inputs rather than manual writing.\n\n🧠 Knowledge assistants : manage internal docs, product specs, meeting notes, and make them searchable via natural language.\n\n🪄 Content co-creation agents: help turn an idea into a structure, then into actionable drafts (not just fluff). The best ones give you *framework + context*, not just words.\n\n🤖 Workflow orchestrators:  agents that can chain tasks (e.g., scan email → summarize → propose actions → send replies) are still emerging, but super powerful when configured right.\n\nFor many teams, the ROI isn’t a single tool:  it’s how you *embed* an agent into a real workflow (e.g., weekly competitor summary + task suggestions, or automated status updates).\n\nCurious: what’s the biggest bott your team wants to remove first :  research, writing, communication, or execution?\n\n",

Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era?

Even I was proficient with Blender, Substance painter and many more complex software people had budget like 20$ but what they expected was like $5000 work. \n\nSince I'm really early in crypto also 2012 as I'm jumping every earn online bandwagon since I'm 13 I found out about crypto too I tried to focus on that. Helped few project to grow but nobody serious company hired me, rather they hires someone younger with much less experience.\n\nThen I was interested in programming and during covid I started to learn more seriously and building things so slowly I got like 5 years experience of Rust, Python and JavaScript (not to mention Solidity, SQL etc you know the stack is deep and almost every work need different toolset). And now yeah there is AI 🤣\n\nAt this point I should be hirer if someone want to kill and industry I will just learning to have profession there and it will collapse.

It commoditized the lowest-value layer of my skills. The typing-code-into-editor part. The part I was never really selling anyway. What I was selling was judgment, architectural thinking, and scar tissue from production failures.\n\nSo now I use AI to move 10x faster on the commodity layer, and I compete on the layer the weekend builders don’t even know exists yet.\n\nBut I’d rather be a 15-year veteran with AI tools than a beginner with the same AI tools.\n\nYou’re not late.

          "text": "For many engineers it’s tempting to start building something on their own and better than anything on the market. However, software engineering is craft. Making business is another craft. It’s not enough to be able to build, but you need to build what people need and know how to find those people and how to sell it to them. It’s not goong to happen just because you build something useful and well-crafted.\n\nI see this as an opportunity. AI will never build what people want and need, and will never sell it. It’s people that will do that. You just need to focus on the business aspect, even more than on building. If you want to turn build stuff into business, you have to be building solutions and company around them, not only tools. \n\nIf you feel like doing so, then do all you can to do it. Finger’s crossed!\n\nI know what I’m talking about. I founded my small company a while ago and am still in red numbers.

      "text": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

She will fuck up a big client eventually.

I uncovered a year of theft because my partner hadn't stayed on top of inventory for a year, even though he said he did.

You don't need to mention anything about how she disappears or her work quality drops after their fights. You can bring up specific times when she went dark and you had to scramble to finish your deliverables, and ask if she needs support to make sure things don't fall off her radar. Alternatively, next time she drops the ball let her husband figure it out. As the finance and new biz guy you should not be responsible for communicating about BAU tasks with existing clients or covering for her. \n\nIf none of the above works, I'd think about exiting and looking for new cofounders that you can work with.",

If you already have one, check if it covers any of this.\n\n  \n2. Frame the conversation around protecting the business, not blaming her.

Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now.

When you signal \"this might not be for you,\" their brain flips from evaluating to wanting.\n\n  \nWhen it works best: prospects who are comparison shopping or skeptical. The more options they have, the more powerful this is. Also great with higher-ticket deals where the buyer expects to be sold hard.\n\n  \nWhen to skip it: early stage prospects who barely know what they need yet. If someone is still figuring out the problem, telling them they might not be a fit just gives them permission to leave. They need education first, not a challenge.\n\n  \nThe balance question is the right one to ask. What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

Sometimes i know i need a day off just to take care of myself play a little football, read, go for a walk even just sit around but even then i feel restless like i’m wasting time instead of recharging the problem is if i don’t take breaks i burn out quick but when i do take them i feel lazy. kinda feels like i can’t win either way.

But now that I'm building something of my own every day I'm not working feels like I'm falling behind or wasting an opportunity. It's like the pressure is worse when it's your own thing.\n\nWhat's helped me a bit is realizing that burnout makes you less productive for weeks, but a day off just costs you one day. The math actually makes sense to rest. But yeah I still feel restless when I do it. I'll take a day off and spend half of it thinking about work instead of actually recharging which defeats the purpose.\n\nI don't think the guilt ever fully goes away honestly. I just try to remind myself that this is a long game and burning out isn't an option. Easier said than done though.",

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely. But you can get to a point where you feel it and take the day anyway, because you know the version of you that comes back rested is worth more than the version that pushed through.",

          "text": "The guilt is real and it's one of the hardest parts of running your own business. Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

The business didn't just survive while I was gone, it actually thrived.\n\nIf your business can’t handle you taking a day off to play football or read, you haven’t built a company, you’ve just built a really high-pressure job for yourself. taking a break is basically a \"stress test\" for your business. If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder. You're no good to the company if you're burnt out and making \"tired\" decisions.",

Whether that problem is fulfilling a need for landscaping in your area, or designing a new SaaS software for a niche industry, it needs to solve a problem.\n\nIf you’re just wanting to start a business doing something, start small and do what others have done. Start a landscaping or pressure washing business, you can do all the work yourself and the tools can be found cheap on Facebook marketplace. Knock on doors and get a few customers. One thing leads to another and you learn a lot along the way.\n\nOther ideas are usually found by just observation. I have a friend who started a software company to help solve a problem in recycling that he saw on an internship he had in college. He turned that into the multi-million dollar business that he runs today. He was already studying software engineering, so he was able to build it all himself with a couple friends. Same concept as the landscaping, just a larger scale. Sometimes you just need to be exposed to things in order to find the hole you need to fill in a market.",

There can be a lot more to business than just coming up with a product or service people want and will pay for and which you can make a profit from. While this is important, there are other factors \n\nHere are some of the topics I had to learn the \"hard way\" and wish I had learned prior to opening my first business:\n\n* Financial management: Understand your costs, but be prepared for many more costs than you expect! There will be fees and taxes you can't always plan for. \n   * Understand what the bottom line profit is as it can often be less than estimated to begin with.\n   * Recognize cash flow is critical and many profitable businesses fail when they run out of cash.\n   * Bookkeeping and accounting is hard to learn and time consuming, but is required to know where your business is at to make good decesions.\n   * Taxes are both required and can ruin a business if not paid. Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

It started with learning how businesses actually work day to day.\n\nif you’re at zero, I’d focus on three things before worrying about what to build:\n\n1. learn how people sell , talking to customers, understanding why they buy, why they don’t, and what problems feel urgent to them.\n2. get close to an existing business, even if it’s small. Freelance, intern, help someone sell, market, or operate. You’ll see real problems fast.\n3. build the habit of execution.

Do not send it to China. Make sure that you understand the cost for a batch from that vendor if the prototype sells. Plug that number back into the projection to determine the price you should charge for the item. \n\nThe prototype is what you take pictures of and put on a Shopify website to gauge demand.

In my **35 years in business** and **15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen that the best businesses don't start with a 'lightbulb moment', but with a 'this is annoying' moment.\n\nIf you have no background and no idea, here is exactly where you start:\n\n1. **Skill Acquisition:** before you 'do business', you need a craft. Learn sales, basic digital marketing, or how to build something (code, design, or a physical trade). You can't lead a team if you don't understand the work.\n2. **The Friction List:** for one week, write down every time you (or people around you) say 'I wish this was easier' or 'Why does this take so long?'. Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it. That is the only real 'Step One'.\n\nWhat is one skill you already have that someone might pay $20 for right now?",

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date & time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

I started using a billing persona (basically acting like I had a billing department) so that I could stay the helpful partner while \"the system\" or \"the department\" handled the awkward stuff.

Very intuitive for teams that want simplicity over feature depth.\n\n3. Less Annoying CRM - Specifically designed for small businesses, straightforward pricing, and low learning curve. No bloat.\n\n4. Streak - If you're already living in Gmail, this is a game changer. Tracks deals right in your email thread.\n\n5. Zoho CRM - Budget-friendly with solid features. Takes a bit more setup but powerful once configured.\n\nQuick clarification questions that would help narrow it down:\n\n- B2B or B2C (or both)?\n- Team size?\n- Any specific integrations you need (email, accounting, e-commerce)?\n- Monthly budget range?\n\nThe \"right\" CRM is the one your team will actually use consistently.

How many people will touch the CRM daily?** Under 5 users? You don't need enterprise anything. Most small teams end up paying for 40 features and using 4. That gap is where \"admin work and complexity\" creeps in.  \n  \n**2. What broke first when your spreadsheets fell apart?** Usually one of two things: either follow-ups stopped happening because no one could track where a lead was in the process, or you lost visibility because info lived in three different places. Knowing which one broke first tells you what to prioritize.  \n  \n**3. Do you need a CRM or a CRM + marketing platform?** If you need email sequences, landing pages, ad tracking: look at HubSpot or ActiveCampaign. If you need clean pipeline visibility, follow-up automation, and a tool your team will actually open every morning: that's where we built Bigin. We deliberately left out the marketing suite because cramming everything in is how \"simple\" CRMs stop being simple.  \n  \nWe're obviously biased, but the honest answer is: the best CRM for your team in 2026 is the one with the shortest gap between signup and \"oh, this actually helps.\" If that's us, great. If not, at least the framework above saves you from wasting three months on the wrong tool.  \n  \nHappy to answer specifics if you want to compare options",

No CRM required - just discipline and a notification system.\n\nThe spreadsheet-to-CRM transition fails most often when people try to replicate their spreadsheet inside the CRM. Don’t.

Klaviyo or Drip will do more for you than HubSpot ever will because they're built around purchase behavior, not sales pipelines.\n\n**for service businesses (contractors, cleaning, field teams):** this is where most generic CRMs fail because you need scheduling + dispatch + customer tracking together, not just a contact database. Jobber is the standard here (~$39-267 CAD/mo depending on tier) but newer options like FieldCamp are doing the AI-first thing where setup takes 30 minutes instead of weeks and it handles scheduling/invoicing/CRM together. free tier to start.\n\nthe biggest mistake i see is picking based on features instead of asking \"will my team actually open this every day?\" the fanciest CRM in the world is useless if everyone goes back to texting customers from their personal phone by week 3.\n\nwhat type of business are you running? that'll narrow it down fast.",

L'idée, c'est vraiment de viser un outil qui propose une détection proactive des tâches plutôt qu'une simple base de données statique.\n\nD'ailleurs, au-delà de l'outil, avez-vous déjà listé les 2 ou 3 points de friction précis qui ont fait capoter vos fichiers Excel ?
