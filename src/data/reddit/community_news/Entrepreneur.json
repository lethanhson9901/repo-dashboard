I landed a job at large asset management firm (> $1 trillion aum) and was promoted after my first year for creating a tool that saved the funds 300-400k per year. I left after 2.5 years and now run the finance division for a billionaire who has a family office.\n\nI’ve learnt coding, financial statement analysis and modelling, but want to create something that’s mine.\n\nEveryone’s trying to make it, those that were able to do it early in their lives, why do you think that is? What was it that you did, that was different?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I shared a bathroom with 2 other tenants. Woke up in the morning with the cops running around the house because one of the tenants died in the shared bathroom. I barely had enough money to eat. Found a second job. Worked 70-80 hours a week. Luckily the local state university opened an extension school in our local HS. I could take a couple classes a semester in the evening. Still worked the 2 jobs and >70 hours. Eventually graduated. Saw the movie Wall Street. Figured, if you want to make money go to where the money is. Took my 1 week vacation to NYC. Called, dropped off and sent out resumes to anyone I could. Within the week I had a few interviews. Late ‘90s NYC was a great job market. Took a chance, called in and quit my job back home and stayed another week. Got an entry level job at a premiere wealth management company. Went back home, sold, dumped, packed up everything I had. Found a roommate from a classified in the Village Voice (newspaper). Worked as many hours as I could. Kept getting promoted. After almost 20 years of working harder than everyone else in the office I was making over $1 million a year. But Wall Street is a feast or famine business. Eventually the company I worked for made some bad decisions and went under. Now I’m in my mid 50s and unemployed. But at least I wasn’t a crazy spender and I have a few million in saving.",

I got an opportunity to purchase some land (32 acres) and just like the others was just going to hold it until the value increased, I received a call from a company saying they'd like to purchase the 32 acres and we agreed on a price where I would have profited about 200k which I was excited for but then they said they wanted to pay me in installments and I almost did I was going back n forth on my decision and that's when they told me they really only needed about 2 acres of it, if I didn't want to sell would I be willing to rent them the 2 acres after some informative digging we agreed on a price. I still own that property and as of today there is 8 companies currently that rent some portion of it. The beauty of it is they maintain their own rented space and a lot of them have built something on their rented portion which has increased the property value. I make 1.2 million a year off of those 32 acres and yes I've repeated the same thing in surrounding cities and continue to look for more and different opportunities. I owe alot to the first company who reached out(a fence company) for actually coming up with the idea for me.",

I was raised on one of the last homesteads in my state with no electricity, no phone and 5 miles to the nearest neighbor, I was a high school dropout, but by age 30 had made my first million doing what no one from my neck of the woods could imagine doing, operating a private hedge fund as a private class trader. The point is I’ve never been to Wall St, but I hired people away from there on occasion.  I owe all of my success to others who were already successful and were willing to share their wisdom.

Got a free PC with a cheap internet plan my mom got back in the early 2000's and started doing entrepreneur things. Farmed gold on RuneScape and things like that and sold it and earned more than my mom. This gave me a good amount of knowledge about computers. Did some other shady things like some hacking here and there but never for profit, I didn't know hacking is a job. Didn't like school so I didn't even get a high school diploma.\n\nAt 18 moved to the UK by myself with £20 in my pocket and slept on a friend's sofa.\n\nGot a job as a junior chef, worked there for a few years. Then I found out Police is recruiting without a high school diploma so I applied and got in. Within 3 years became a detective, then joined a cybercrime unit. Got into crypto and cybersecurity pretty heavily, then around when I was 24 I got a job in Cybersecurity where I got a ton of certificates. I really got into tech BIG time at this age. I started learning how to code and probably launched like 20 failed startups.\n\nAround 28 I started doing crypto and built a project in the space that went super viral and made me $1.5m within 3 months then died out. Not going to say what it was but it was a platform where I earned fees, similar to a DEX. This made me a millionaire at 28, I went from negative balance to millionaire overnight. I was working 9-5 then 5-3am 7 days a week from ages 24-28. \n\nLife was extremely difficult, I cried when I had my lucky break but was super sad it only lasted a short time. I took the money and invested it and now living off the investment income and building another startup, in cybersecurity. I really hope this can be a long term project now that I got proper funding and have a goal to exit this business for at least $100m then hopefully retire around 40.",

Instead of only working harder at a job, they build assets, equity, skills, or distribution that scale beyond their time. A lot of them get obsessive about one high-value skill early (tech, sales, finance, content, etc.), live way below their means even after earning more, and take calculated asymmetric bets where the downside is survivable but the upside is huge. Another big difference is speed, they ship faster, learn faster, and tolerate uncertainty way better than average. Also, environment matters more than people admit; being close to capital, networks, or high-growth industries compounds everything. And honestly, luck and timing play a role too, but the common thread is they put themselves in positions where luck could actually hit, instead of just playing safe for stability their whole life. ",

Stocks can help you get richer, but not make you rich in and of themselves.  The overall best return is starting a successful business.  This, over time, can be a return on investment 1000x.  But, it’s really fucking hard.  From my own sucesss and meeting and talking with other people, I have distilled success down to three traits.  It is these traits that matter, and will make or break you.\n\nPrimary is risk.  You have to be able to risk, to put something on the line for possible failure and loss.  You have to be able to sacrifice time and labor for nothing in the hopes of something.  This is fundamental.  A lot of people cannot do this and are essentially born to be employees.  Doesn’t mean they aren’t smart or competent.  They just can’t risk.\n\nSecondary trait 1 is conscientiousness.  Hard work.  Pride.  Quality first.  Working long hours without reward.  Speed is accuracy.  This is a trait that can be honed.  If someone has this and the ability to risk, they are probably at a 60% chance of success.  \n\nSecondary rest to is competence.  High IQ, creativity.  Critical thinking quickly, problem solving.  Learning fast and adapting.  This is essentially always having the right answer, the best idea.  This is more of something you are born with.  If you have this, and the ability to risk, you probably have an 80% chance at success.  \n\nIf you have all three you are a guaranteed millionaire.  But, to have all three traits probably puts you in maybe 2% of the population.  A lot of people can’t risk, and some that can’t risk either aren’t intelligent or are lazy or both.  \n\nSo the thing to do is sit down and figure out what your traits are.  Starting with risk.  If you can honestly determine that you truly cannot risk, then your time is best served finding the highest position you can to serve someone who can risk.  And one thing I would conjecture, and it isn’t a judgment, but the type of person who truly has trait 3 isn’t the type that would need to ask anyone how to do x or become y.  They would intuitively figure it out on their own.  They are the type to ask a specific question maybe from a lack of knowledge, like where on a website is the contact button or something like that.  They wouldn’t ask “how do I become rich.”  And for that person, if they can risk, they just need to find a high IQ creative individual who can’t risk and hire them.",

          "text": "That is a very tough loaded question. It would be as hard as pushing a mountain through a pin hole but let me give it a shot. Let me see how I could help you:\n\n\\* Hunt for \"New money\", or combine with \"old money\" knowledge you've gathered and try to carve a path in old money from the systems usual go to path i.e. study or absorb high value knowledge and applying them. Learn the avenues of money and how to mine it. Keep at it and make it your game (like Robert Kiyosaki said his game is making money and the points or high scores are the numbers). Watch motivating things and keep grinding, grinding, grinding. Enjoy the breaks and time with members important to you 100% (the little time you have with them) as much as you go with your 100% grinding. (forgive me for the lingo I am just trying to connect). Update, analyze, envision the possibilities and prepare a backup plan if things go sour. Engage in hobbies.\n\n\\* Follow advice and find the right mentor as it would save you a lot of time (they'd guide you or simply tell you the way forward as you carve your path). Listen to wise time tested advice and you will see patterns. Do the money thing early in your age and learn it as early as possible (finances and such).\n\n\\* The other one is time and experience in the field of \"hunting for money with your skillset\". Plan well, run numbers, look ahead at the high hitting ones that you can work well into accomplishing.\n\n\\* Basically you have kind of done it in your field. Now you just have to maintain it and move higher or sideways strategically (or if you go down then at least know you will bounce back up because you have the know how or do like the ones that call it a day and retire as their goal was simply to get up and build a nest egg and retire comfortably)\n\n\\* Figure out what works for you and do it like you love it. When you hit it big, everything else will follow.\n\n\\* Learn value and value extraction and learn conversion rates (like making a sale or something). Basically businesses are things that solve a problem (if you plan to go that route). As for work, it is how useful you are and what you offer society. It was like that show I watched a long time ago, the kid didn't know how to use ninja tricks or magic but he maxed out it physical ability he became so good they considered him a legend (a legend on top of the world considered him a walking legend). You don't have to be that good but been stable is good enough to pass the bar.\n\n\\* Wealth and Riches will simply at times multiply your behavior so keep some things in check. (there is the occasional leak out but at least keep it in check, you could look into Stoicism). Not a must but also wealth kind of has an effect on those around you so keep that in mind too and try to help where you could or mentor where you can (you can pick everyone along the way like motivational speakers if you want too).\n\n\\* Look at the power of compounding and disciplined steps.\n\n\\* Perseverance but also knowing when to rest and enjoy the view. You'll appreciate your efforts as you look for a 'save point' or nest egg so when you fall you don't have to start from ground 0 (well you can definitely bounce back from ground 0 but if you say have a family or something you wouldn't want that though if you must go through it then you must).\n\n***TL:DR;*** *\"Have a mentor, have a vision and work at it like a savage. If you failed, learn from it, get back up and bounce back\"*\n\nThing is this thing needs you to have a lot of life experiences that is why I hang out with older gens and also see how newer gens do things because they have very interesting questions.\n\nSchool, re-learn (deprogram and program again what works), be good but smart enough to eat the good and spit out the bad. Once you finish the schooling and intense training apply the the knowledge and skills you having been cumulating as you also built a hobby on the side with sort of a final goal as you also had fun with it.\n\n(but do some calculations and apply safety nets and know when to pivot if you should because sometimes people will doubt you even if you are right and it has happened a lot of times. Also be autocorrecting and know when you are messing up, be critical to yourself but try to understand other people when they mess up and how to better manage them to let their skill shine beside yours. As I said it is a loaded question).\n\nHope this helps. (Also it seems you did well for yourself in your field, the best game that I think best explains this is The Sims - the first game. You could see almost everything in a human lifecycle there)",

Addicts become resilient because they wake up every morning and they have to come up with money to feed their addiction. They do this everyday for years. They’re in survival mode all the time. You have to come up with multiple ways to make money every single day without holding down a job.\n\nI know that many people who start a business who give up because they’re told no, hit a roadblock, lose a client, etc. I tried helping several people and the moment they hit a roadblock they don’t have the capacity to think their way out of the problem. Even worse is when you give them the solution and they just sit there and do nothing.",

In fact, I worked less in a top 10 engineering school where I graduated with high honors than I did in Pakistan.\n\n2. I did not feel the pressure to support my family back in Pakistan.\n\n3.

Money was financial aid, scholarships, work, and student loans. The student loans themselves were tiny because I went to a state school and were very easy to pay off because I am cheap so I saved a lot and went to a state school so they were small. I did not have any network I could lean on other than the network I built for myself by performing very well in school.

Saving had been harder since we had kids, and COVID kind of screwed up the cost of living problem even faster.",

The fast movers reverse it: they build an audience or reputation in a specific niche first, then figure out what to sell. Your coding + financial modeling background is already a rare combination. The question isn't what to build - it's who has an acute problem you can solve with that exact stack.\n\nOne practical thing: the move from \"employee who created value\" to \"owner of that value\" is mostly a positioning shift, not a skills gap. You've already proven you can identify and build high-ROI solutions. The next step is finding that problem before someone hands it to you.",

That was the vision, thats what i built everything around.\n\nAbout 8 months in i threw in a basic \"brand refresh\" package almost as an afterthought, like a lower entry point for people who werent ready to commit to the full thing. No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week. I genuinely thought it was a filler offer.\n\nFast forward to now and that \"filler\" package accounts for almost 70% of my revenue. The thing i spent months obsessing over barely moves.\n\nHad some money from Stаke saved going into this year which gave me the breathing room to actually sit with this instead of just panicking and restructuring everything. And what i realized is the market doesnt care about what you think your best work is, it cares about what solves their problem fast.\n\nStill not sure if i lean fully into the boring offer and let the premium stuff be a side thing, or if i keep pushing the original vision hoping the positioning catches up.",

Most companies have woefully insufficient marketing budgets.  If they do have the budget, time, and energy to pay for a premium package, they will go pay a premium agency to build it.  You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?  That's an offer people will take, even from a market newcomer, because the alternative is to have Joe from Sales try to draw the new logo, and you are definitely better than Joe from Sales.\n\nIn time, with lots of happy customers whose brands are enhanced, some will become very successful and need more from you, and you will also develop a reputation that wins you more of the premium business.",

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Listen to it. Your \"vision\" offer can be the upsell for people who come in through the boring one.

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.",

I asked who they were and he said they were his friends. I then asked if he understood why investors would think that’s a problem. He looked at me like I was stupid. \n\nI know many founders who were told by people they know that they’d buy after it was built. Then when it came time to pay, crickets. Don’t get us wrong. Warm sales are a great way to start. But they’re only the beginning. \n\nGreat post.",

But the \"just ship it and charge\" crowd sometimes swings too far the other way where they ship garbage and then conclude theres no market because nobody bought their half baked thing.\n\nThe sweet spot Ive found is talking to potential customers before building anything. Not surveys, actual conversations. \"Tell me about the last time you dealt with X problem. What did you do? How much did it cost you?\" If people cant articulate the pain without you leading them, the pain probably isnt that deep.\n\nThe founders Ive seen succeed the fastest are the ones who pre-sold before writing a single line of code. Like literally got a commitment (or even payment) based on a mockup or a detailed description. If you can get someone to say \"yes I would pay for that\" with their wallet and not just their words, you know youve got something.\n\nBut youre 100% right that the building phase is often just hiding. Ive been guilty of that myself. Its way more comfortable to tinker with code than to put yourself out there and hear \"no thanks.\"",

I bootstrapped from 0→30K users building an SaaS AI voice automation tool for my local country thailand, but learned a harsh lesson: I was targeting the wrong customers.\n\n**The mistake: I** Spent 10 months chasing viral TikTok traffic (1M+ views, $0 revenue). \n\nFree users don't convert when you're bootstrapped (The Biggest mistakes is sell too cheap instead of selling higher pricing and delivery better for a few customers).\n\n**The pivot:** Switched to organic content for micro-niche B2B audiences (create deep break-down video tutorial / explains). Also, I decided to avoid ANY physical product businesses - pure digital/service only for maximize profit.\n\nThe real shift happened when I stopped posting and started post and having a conversations with my exist audience from my social media. Booked calls, asked about pain points, then closed $300-800 deals. Hit $10K profit in 2 months.\n\n**What I learned:** Right audience > volume. 1,000 true fans / engaged B2B followers beats 1M random TikTok views.\n\nNow I'm building my second SaaS - a workflow builder that analyzes winning content formats youtube/tiktok/ig/twitter any form and helps you replicate what already works. \n\nBasically solving problems for my past self🙏: \n\n\"How do I create winning organic content that actually converts?\"\n\nThe compounding effect is real.

      "text": "Been studying ad patterns lately. Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out.\n\n  \nEdit: Subreddit doesn't allow screenshots, however i got the data metrics from shophunter and no it does not mean that these numbers are true to the core but it aims for an accurate level. Also this is not a self promotion, i just found this while studying on other digital products and thought this was crazy. ",

          "text": "It’s interesting that American Christianity is such a heavily commercial enterprise. It’s like the ultimate expression of American capitalism. Since religions form to propagate the norms of the society they form in, you can use the primary religion of an area, and its most popular priests and figures, as a way to gauge what that society values.\n\nTraditional European Catholicism valued humility and charity, even if individuals didn’t always practice that. It was the “good” that people strived for, or respected in others. It also valued poverty (sometimes - there were huge debates and even wars about whether Christians should practice poverty even in the Middle Ages) and simplicity. Of course, cardinals and popes eschewed poverty and were caught up in vicious intrigues over absurd levels of wealth and power, but the priests and saints who were worshipped by regular people were largely poor, humble, and simple. Few people worshipped the flamboyant and corrupt cardinals. \n\nWhen you look at American Christianity, the popular versions largely created in the US are Evangelism and Mormonism.  Catholicism is practiced by immigrants and their children for the most part, and is not a very American religion. If you look at Evangelicals and Mormons, at their churches and the popular preaching style, you get the sense of a for-profit business, one very focused on marketing and PR and branding. \n\nEverything in these religions revolves around money and consumption. You can go on any random Evangelical church’s website and find the pastor has posted a video where he prays for money and success for himself and his congregation. The most respectable members have huge houses and cars, big white fake veneers and bleached hair and still openly and blatantly pray for even more money and success. It’s the ultimate expression of American values. There is even a sense that if one is poor, or has had struggles in life. it’s because one is not favored by God, and hence must be evil. \n\nThe American church feels more like a multi-level marketing scheme than anything else. Get suckered in, then sell to other suckers. Recruitment is aggressive, much like in an MLM, and practitioners put immense effort into displaying the appearance of success. You even kick back 10% of your profits up the chain, much like an MLM.\n\nThe American conman preacher and evangelist is not even a recent thing stemming from the acceleration of consumerism in recent faces. Nearly 200 years ago, religious grifters were a fixture in the rush to the West, and the American scamming preacher is as classic as Thanksgiving. \n\nI can’t think of any other religion that is so focused on wealth, success, and image. Buddhism is obviously actively against it. Hinduism a little less so, but still actively focuses on spiritual rather than material wealth. Judaism preaches education, knowledge, curiosity and learning, and Islam values poverty and tribulations as a test before God. Other non-American forms of Christianity also actively preach poverty. \n\nIt says a lot about the US that the primary religions invented in the country are so financially- and image-oriented. I have been to services for every major religion and some more obscure one, but Evangelicals and Mormon services are the only ones I’ve ever been to where the sermon was focused on asking God for wealth and material success. \n\nThis is why American Christianity can be such a successful business proposition. The those belief system focuses on wealth and consumption, the religion itself is effectively a brand, and it’s natural for a brand to have lots of product tie-ins. \n\nNote: Obviously humans are humans, and people can often be materialistic and selfish, but religion is meant to espouse the perfection of character and spirit, and thus be somewhat out of reach to inspire people.",

I go looking for the source expecting some spam. \n\nNope. It’s The New York Times!\n\nThey did a story on the topic, found our little blog, and tossed us a contextual do-follow link. No outreach, no PR, just pure luck and having the right content sitting there waiting to be found.\n\nI'm still so happy. I thought you had to pay huge amounts or endlessly hustle for these kinds of tier-1 links. Just a reminder that the big fish are out there looking for the exact weird, niche stuff you're writing about.\n\nIt might not be a big deal to some of you but to me it's a massive win and I am very proud of this.

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Better than losing your money to something you don't understand.\n\n\nHere's the easiest investment you can make:\n\n\n- Open up a Roth IRA with Fidelity or Vanguard.\n\n\n- Also open up a regular taxable brokerage account with either.\n\n\n- Add the maximum amount of money for the year to your Roth IRA ($7500 for 2026).\n\n\n- Buy a target date retirement fund for roughly the year you'd like to retire (Vanguard VTTSX-2060 or VFIFX-2050, Fidelity FFFHX-2050 or FDKLX-2060).\n\n\n- Repeat the same with your taxable brokerage account. Put in as much money as you want, buy the same fund.\n\n\n- Keep adding money to the funds as often as you want. For the Roth, you can't put in more than $7500/year, but no limits on the brokerage. Buy nothing else. You can literally just keep adding money to the exact same target date funds and never do anything else.\n\n\n- Target date funds invest everything for you. They buy and sell various stocks and bonds and they rebalance based on how close you are to retirement. When you're young, they'll have more money in stocks and move away from them as you get older. The beauty though is you do nothing, just keep adding money to them.\n\n\nThat's it. Congratulations you will outperform almost all other investors.",

Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, your bank, or whatever preferred platform you want to use. Roth IRAs tax the money when it goes in, not when it comes out at or after age 65. That's best, because it gets taxed before the balance grows, so you pay less. Again, put it into an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nMax out your 401(k) contribution up to the amount that your employer will match, either total or partial. Again, allocate it to an index fund.\n\nAfter that, the easiest thing to do is to put the remaining chunk that you want to invest into an index fund through Fidelity or similar.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't invest in anything other than index funds unless you're really hardcore, and even then, it probably isn't worth it lol",

Almost everyone who comes to r/Entrepreneur to ask for advice is asking about something that has been discussed extensively. That's just the bell curve that is real life. Most problems are typical problems.\n\nIn your case, I think you should consider that **your current job is your passive income**. Because if you're saving 75%+ of your income, then you are already halfway there: you just went backwards. The trope of the successful entrepreneur is:\n\n1. Come up with working business idea  \n2. Have plenty of money with little effort\n\n[You did the opposite. ](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-20-2017/_IufW-.gif) Step 2 is done, so now it's on to step 1.\n\nGetting your aesthetician license is a great idea, especially if you can stay full-time. It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans. Hang out in forums like this one. \n\nCongrats! And good luck.",

              "text": "Aww I’m sorry 😞 \nwanna hear something crazy? About a year ago I had one of my maintenance worker quit due to health reasons and his age.. His job title was to clean three properties. He would start at 8 AM and be done by 1 PM latest. Just picking up trash and making sure the property was clean. That’s it. And 80% of the time the properties were always clean because people pick up after themselves. So the dude would get to go home early if he was finished. And since he lived on site at one of the properties, we gave him a huge discount on his rent. About $800 off. And I believe the position paid $19 an hour (not great, but not bad either for the little work you do). Well, my cousin‘s girlfriend was looking for a job and she lives with my cousin at one of the properties I manage. They currently pay about $2000 for a one bedroom one bath.\n\nI told her that he quit and that she should apply immediately with my company. At the time, she wasn’t working and was looking for a job. She could definitely benefit from the rental discount PLUS, she could be done with work at 1 PM and the rest of the day could be spent doing something else or another part-time job... Well, she never took me up on that offer. And now she’s working 12 hour shifts at T-Mobile making minimum wage. I don’t understand how someone could turn down an $800 rental discount plus the decent pay. She never even told me why she didn’t want the job. She would just say “oh okay” any time I’d mention it. I even told her that there was plenty of opportunity for her to move up in the company. And I was right. A couple months later, one of our leasing agents quit and the position was available. I would’ve been able to train her and the job would’ve been hers. Knowing the owner, he would’ve allowed me to train her.",

Your property management background actually gives you valuable operational skills that most beauty entrepreneurs lack.

Build something small that solves it. Doesn't need to be perfect. Just works.\n\n3. Talk to the people who have that problem. Reddit is great for this actually.\n\n4. Improve based on what they tell you.\n\nThe people travelling the world didn't get there overnight. They just started somewhere and kept going.\n\nAlso, aesthetician school + salon owner is a legit path too. Maybe there's even a way to combine both like a tool for salon owners?

It sounds like you haven’t been making $9k/month for very long. \n\nIf I had to start over from your position this is what I would do. \n\nKeep your expenses low. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing as long as you can. Save up $150k-$250k or as close to it as you can. It’s gonna take you about 4 years. Based on your line of questioning, you may have shiny object syndrome. The “business” is the shiny object. If you can’t save up that amount in 4 years at $9k/month then take a look at your lifestyle and budget better to save money wherever possible. Live on $50k and invest $50k into the S&P or some index per year. \n\nFor now, don’t try to start a salon business from scratch. Buy one that’s already profitable with the money you save up. But don’t cash out your investments, use it as collateral to buy the business. Go do your own research for buying a business, seller financing is popular these days.\n\nBefore you buy a beauty salon, get a job in one to learn how it works. Buy one that’s been profitable for a good enough time frame, for me that would be 5 years minimum. \n\nThe reason you buy one is because it’s gonna cost you a lot to start up, and a lot of time and risk. If you get into the business and you find out that it’s not for you, you can sell it and get your money back because it was a profitable asset when you bought it.\n\nI was taught this by a former client who buys businesses, holds them, and sells them, for a living. Personally, I wish I took that route. It would’ve saved me a lot of pain and tears. Goodluck.",

To power the platform, our backend scrapes Upwork job posts on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of this, I happen to have a database of 3.2M+ jobs just sitting on my server, showing exactly what problems businesses are actively spending money to solve right now.\n\nDrop your SaaS idea, niche, or target audience below. I will pick the right keywords, query the database, and reply with the real numbers.\n\n(Side note: if you want to run your own queries or download the raw data, I made the dataset available directly on the UpHunt website).\n\nLet's see what the market says. Drop your ideas below 👇\n\nHere is the format I will use to reply (Example for a LinkedIn tool):\n\n=== SAMPLE RESPONSE ===\n\n    Keywords Searched: [\"linkedin automation\", \"linkedin outreach\", \"automate linkedin\"]\n    Total Demand: 0.1989% of all jobs (6467 clients)\n    Average Hourly Rate: $19/hr\n    Average Fixed Budget: $1051\n\n[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1ra8v93)",

Today its slightly tougher cause Reddit is quiet saturated but still works tho.\n\nSo curious, what is the most underrated marketing channel most Entrepreneurs ignore in 2026?",

But since more and more people were getting answers from Gemini, ChatGPT etc, we noticed both the users and these tools behind the scene ran super long tail search queries like \"what is the best software to do XYZ for financial assistants in United States?\" etc. \n\nSo we basically setup a process using Frizerly to look at search data and  auto-publish blogs on our website daily exactly answering these questions one by one using AI. The content is written with our tool as the authoritative answer when it makes sense!\n\nThis has helped up basically be mentioned constantly by Googles AI overview and gemini over time. However I am little scared typing this because if my competitors do the same thing, it's probably going to get trickier! I really hope they won't read this post haha!",

People end up checking your profile, see what you’re building, and reach out on their own.\n\nThe ROI beats paid channels for one reason. You build trust and content at the same time. A solid Reddit comment can get indexed by Google, show up in AI summaries, and stay discoverable for years.\n\nThe real moat is patience. Most founders post once, get ignored, then quit. If you stick around for 3 to 6 months as a real community member, it starts to compound.\n\nAnother underrated channel is niche newsletters under 10K subs in a tight vertical.

Gamma and Canva get mentioned a lot for a reason, you can dump your content in and they handle most of the layout so you’re not fighting fonts for 3 hours.  \n  \nAnother angle that actually works well for sales stuff (especially insurance where you’re basically walking people through info step-by-step) is turning your material into a flipbook style presentation with Flipsnack. You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

But with a box your best bet is to spend some time looking around at local businesses. Most if not all are going to have some kind of regular delivery. Avoid chains because they’re using sisco, etc. Get together a list of a good 20+ local businesses. See if you can figure out anything they’d need regularly that you’d be able to get. I’ve not done it on that level so the only example I can think of is I had a guy locally that would deliver our buns. We didn’t go through enough where I was to do bulk orders because it’d go bad. But he’d pull up in his box full of bread and hit I can’t remember how many businesses. He did his runs in the morning then went home. But with the time and effort you could definitely(again, location will play in for sure) find a lane paying you $500 a day running 5 days a week. Obviously you know there’s gunna be overhead but with a box and driving it yourself it’s as low as it can be. You wouldn’t even need the MC if nothings changed. DOT is enough to run a box inside state lines.",

There are large dispatching companies, and people who do it themselves, get an LLC and work independently(what I did). When you do that you kinda fall into “driver manager” as well. Helping out with their routes, avoiding local roads that have low bridges or places a semi can’t get to. Getting in contact with shippers/receivers when an issue arrives or the driver is having a problem getting on site, etc. As well as factoring their payments and keeping necessary paperwork on file for x amount of time. When I always explained it to friends I’d say “I’m basically the assistant who handles the day to day work for people who own their own trucks so they can just drive, make money, and go to bed knowing I’ll have more work for them when they wake up.”",

Compliance stuff, niche scheduling, industry-specific reporting. Zero competition because no developer thinks it's cool enough to build. But the customers are sticky as hell because switching costs in niche workflows are brutal.\n\n  \nThe \"search for anger\" framing is perfect too.

Meanwhile demand for recovered materials - copper, gold, rare earth metals - is only going up as supply chains tighten.\n\nThe business case is real. But what makes it interesting from an entrepreneurship standpoint is the structure of the market.\n\nTo operate legitimately and land corporate clients, you need R2v3 or e-Stewards certification. These are industry standards that verify your downstream - meaning you can prove where materials actually end up. Most large corporations now require this from their recycling vendors.\n\nThat certification requirement acts as a real moat. It keeps casual competitors out. But it also means the barrier to entry is higher than just buying equipment and opening a warehouse.\n\nThe compliance side is genuinely complex - documentation, audits, downstream vendor diligence, ongoing reporting. Most people looking to enter the space underestimate this part completely.\n\nThe entrepreneurs I've seen succeed in this space treat compliance as a competitive advantage rather than a cost. Once you're certified with MG Environmental Consulting, you're in a much smaller pool competing for enterprise contracts.\n\nCurious if anyone here has explored this space or knows people in it.",

Most recycling programs are bullshit but some of them are okay. \n\nBattery recycling is something that makes sense and the only reason is because it’s profitable at a certain scale and efficiency. \n\n1st Problem is feedstock. It’s a “reverse distribution, logistics” kinda business. Where are you going to collect the batteries? How many kg/ton per location? How many locations? How many trucks needed? Depending on your location, are you charging a disposal fee? Are you collecting for free? Or are you paying the disposer a rebate? \n\nNext problem is Capex and know how. Processing plants are not cheap, and you need to get licensing and approval from govt agencies etc. And then there’s the know how. Nobody who’s figured it out will actually teach you the best and efficient way to extract the maximum amount of black mass from your feedstock. It requires a lot of R&D and by R&D I mean trial and error. So it’s actually a business with a very high barrier to entry IMO. It cannot be bootstrapped. Literally need a few million just to start up (at least in my country)",

They were applying for certification back in the early days of the industry, and it was the guy that wrote the standard they were trying to certify against that came in to do the audit. He took one look at the software, and said we should sell it to other companies - it's exactly what was needed in the industry.\n\nSo I did. Re-wrote it as a SaaS and worked with a few other ITADs to get feedback, then launched about 10 years ago.\n\nOne thing everyone seems to be missing in the replies here - e-waste can be a little misleading. Here in the UK we tend to use the term ITAD (IT Asset Disposition). The main focus is NOT on destroying PCs, but rather on refurbishing them for onward sale. Just because a large enterprise customer has decided to replace the machines, it doesnt mean they are dead. Erasing the hard disks and re-selling the machines is big business.\n\nAnd with sustainability being a key thing here in the UK and Europe, proper reporting on this can be a massive boost to ITADs.",

Right now your landing page exists to tell a story, build trust, handle objections, and nudge someone toward a purchase. But when an agent is doing the shopping, none of that matters. It's just parsing your structured data, comparing you against 50 competitors in seconds, and making a decision based on price, availability, and whatever criteria the human set. All that conversion optimization work becomes invisible to a huge chunk of your traffic. I think we're going to see businesses basically running two parallel experiences whether they realize it or not. The human-facing one with all the emotional triggers and brand storytelling, and the agent-facing one that competes purely on data quality, response speed, and how cleanly you expose your catalog. The interesting thing is that the agent channel actually rewards transparency and punishes the kind of pricing games and dark patterns that work on humans. If your competitor's API returns clean structured pricing and yours requires three clicks and a popup to reveal the real number, the agent just skips you entirely.",

Figma is very popular but I also like balsamiq a lot because it's so simple and easy to use. \n\nNext start learning about full stack web development and differences between front and back end and how they meet.  You don't need to know it all, but the basics of how data is stored in databases, rest API, etc are fundamentals of mobile apps.  I remember there was a website that helps you set everything up without even writing too many lines of code. \n\nThere are probably a ton of AI tools that will get you pretty far once you understand the basics.

Make a figma or even a google slides mockup of the app and walk them through it. Ask them blunt questions. \"Would you pay $10/month for this? If not, why?\" If you can't get 10 people to pre-commit to paying for it, your idea has problems.\n\nHere's the real unlock though. The game completely changed about a month ago for people like us. I've never written code in my life but I've spent the last few weeks building entire products using ai like claude. I just tell it what I want, in plain english, and it writes the code. I rebuilt my company's entire website in 24 hours. You don't need a fiverr freelancer to build a v1 anymore. You can build it yourself, right now, and save that money for when you have real traction.

      "text": "I spent 9 years building businesses and I had no idea why I was doing any of it\n\nok so this might sound dumb but I uploaded a book into an AI and it helped me understand something about myself that 9 years of running businesses never did. and I keep thinking about it so figured I'd write it out.\n\nI'm 36. sold a company that had 60 employees. built multiple things since then. made good money lost good money. on paper everything looked fine. in reality after I sold I spent close to three years just... doing nothing that worked. launched a community, made like 10K and quit. took on a client I couldnt deliver for and had to refund them. tried helping a friend sell his course over the phone, we both gave up after few weeks. made some impulsive investments im not proud of.\n\nand the whole time I kept thinking something was wrong with me because I'd already proven I could build things. 60 employees. millions in revenue. and now I couldnt even commit to finishing a landing page without overthinking it for a week.\n\nanyway. few weeks ago I was using AI for work stuff like I always do. ads, competitor research, cold email sequences the usual. and I had this random thought like what if I actually used this thing for something personal. not business personal. like actually about me.\n\nso I took Simon Sineks Find Your Why book, the actual PDF, uploaded it into Claude and basically said ok treat me like a coaching client. go through the exercises with me. ask me the questions from the book but dont let me give you surface level bullshit answers.\n\nand man. it went places I wasnt expecting.\n\nit started asking me about specific moments. not like \"what are your values\" garbage. real stuff. tell me about a time you felt most alive what were you doing who was around you. and everytime I gave a vague answer it pushed back. like no be more specific what exactly happened what did it feel like.\n\nso im sitting there telling it about this time in Australia when I was 22 and broke, and I connected a friend who was an investor type with a DJ who needed funding for something. and I remember watching them talk and feeling this thing in my chest like THIS. this is it. not the money not the deal just the fact that I put two people in a room who would never have met without me and something was happening.\n\nand then it asked me ok what else. and I realized every single story I was telling had the same thread. connecting people. putting the right humans together. making things happen that wouldnt exist if I wasnt the bridge.\n\nafter like two hours of going back and forth it pulled everything into one sentence and I literally stared at my screen for a while.\n\n\"To transform ideas into reality by connecting the right people so that everyone can build what they envision.\"\n\nnow I know reading someone elses purpose statement feels like nothing. its just words. but arriving at it through your own stories is a completly different experience. it wasnt generated by the AI. it was extracted from stuff I actually lived. the AI just asked better questions than I would have asked myself and didnt let me dodge anything.\n\nand suddenly three years of feeling lost made sense. I have a studio in Lisbon that literally loses money every month but the network I built through it is worth more than anything ive ever invested in. I never understood why I kept it. now I do. its the thing. connecting people around ideas. thats just me.\n\nthe three years of failed solo projects? I wasnt missing a company. I was missing people to connect.\n\nlook I use AI every day for work. funnels, prospecting, creative, research. but using it to actually understand myself felt almost too simple and it was probably the most valueable two hours I've spent with it ever.\n\nim not saying go do exactly this. but if you've been building for years and your answer to \"why do you do what you do\" is still \"freedom\" or \"money\" then idk man. maybe thats worth looking at. the book is free to find and the AI part costs like 20 bucks a month.\n\nand if you actually try it id genuinely love to see your why statement in the comments. not to judge just curious what other people come up with when they actually sit with it. mine surprised the hell out of me so id bet yours would too\n\nEdit : I learned the lesson I wrote it myself for the haters that think it's AI. LOL\n\n",

              "text": "ok since a few of you asked heres what I did. gonna try to be as clear as possible so you can just do it tonight if you want\nfirst thing, the book you need is \"Find Your Why\" by Simon Sinek. NOT Start With Why. Start With Why is the concept, Find Your Why is the one with the actual exercises and questions. theres PDFs around or just grab it on kindle its like 10 bucks.\nthen you upload it into Claude. I use the pro version but pretty sure free works too. and you tell it something like:\n\"I want you to read this book and act as my personal coach to help me discover my WHY using the methodology in it. Ask me one question at a time. Wait for my answer before moving to the next. Push back when my answers are too vague or generic. Look for patterns between my stories. At the end, synthesize everything into a WHY statement using Sineks format: To ______ so that ______.\"\nthats literally the prompt. nothing fancy.\nthen you just talk to it. its going to ask you about specific moments in your life. times you felt most alive, most proud, most like yourself. and heres the important part, dont give it clean answers. dont say \"I value helping people.\" say \"I was at a bar in Sydney at 22 and I introduced my friend to this guy and watched them start working on something together and I felt this thing in my chest.\" the more specific and messy the better. thats where the real patterns show up.\nwhen I did it the first 30 minutes felt kind of whatever. almost stopped honestly. really glad I didnt because after that is when I started pulling up stories I hadnt thought about in years and the AI started connecting dots I never saw.\ncouple things that helped me:\n- talk in moments not concepts. stories not adjectives\n- if it gives you a WHY statement that feels too corporate or generic just tell it \"that doesnt feel right, try again using more of my actual words\"\n- dont try to do it in 20 minutes. give it at least an hour. I did two and thats when it really clicked\n- youll know when its right. it sounds dumb but you feel it. mine made me stare at my screen because suddenly like 10 years of random decisions all made sense at once\nanyway hope this helps. and if you actually do it drop your WHY statement in the comments im genuinely curious to see what people come up with. mine caught me off guard so im betting yours will too",
