      "text": "Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

The vast majority of them have a layer of dust on them so thick that it’s clear she hasn’t worn them in a long time.  Some are in piles. I asked her to start small by throwing away five pairs, thinking this was a manageable goal that could lead to momentum in cleaning up the rest of their home. \n\nWrong.  She has made every excuse under the sun for why she couldn’t spare any time to this task.  I remind her every time we speak. That was two years ago. \n\nNow consider they have a 3500 sq ft home.  Every room has its storage depleted with her stuff that she doesn’t use.  \n\nUnfortunately I believe nothing will be cleared until after she passes.",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n> Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

      "text": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

Especially the discipline to keep going after early setbacks.\n\n\nOne thing that jumped out to me is how you treat idle capital as an opportunity cost. \n\n\nYou’d rather flip at a mild loss than let money sit, because the next deal could outperform. That’s a process mindset, and it’s something a lot of people overlook.\n\n\nIn other words, you’re managing decision velocity as much as margin. Faster, clean decisions with imperfect info often beat waiting for the perfect price. I think that’s a big part of why you’re hitting consistent volume now.\n\n\nCurious, do you ever formalize that into a rule? For example max 6 weeks inventory or 30% time-based discount on offers, or is it still mostly intuition that’s developed over time?",

Since youre just reinvesting the rest into more watches, you aren't actually benefiting from the whole business besides your $8K 'salary.'\n\n$1,200,000 in sales on $10-$15K watches (but that's not even the actual profit margin, thats how much the rolex costs), you have to sell at least 80 watches a year. \n\nWhat is the most expensive watch you commonly work with (you mention mostly Rolex $15k). Maybe try higher margin watches such as AP, Patek, etc. Work smart not hard. Even if you sit a bit longer (expected), you can clear $5K on a watch instead of $500.",

I hate to sound like this but sometimes I can’t believe how easy/fast it is. \n\nThat’s an interesting perspective. I think I’m benefitting from the whole business. The money and business and all of its inventory/assets are still mine, regardless if it’s reinvested into more inventory or not. The money is still growing as opposed to sitting in my savings account (what it was doing before). \n\nAlso, im learning Sales, Marketing, Operations, Shipping/handling, inventory management, asset tracking, accounting, etc, etc. so I get all of the benefits of just learning how to run a business. \n\nI’ve sold some day-dates and royal oaks in the 50-60k range. Made some good profit on those (3k+ each) but those deals are hard to come by. \n\nBut keep in mind there’s also times where you hit big on a much cheaper watch. For example, I made 1500$ earlier this month off of a watch I bought for $2200.",

You had a supportive partner who handled domestic labor so you could work 80 hour weeks. You had unpaid interns. You used infrastructure others built. You benefited from an education system. You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nI was on my laptop last night reading another \"self-made\" success story and every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

With the fake narrative of self made, I am a very rigid thinker and everyone just keeps saying, try harder.\nIt took three years of struggling for me to realize that, instead of buying more equipment so I can do the job faster, I can outsource, pay someone to handle the website. Someone can do my bookkeeping. Let me pay an assistant for my personal life. Boom, that’s three stressors I don’t have to worry about.

Two people can have the same resources, but only one might put in the sweat, iteration, and discipline needed to move an idea forward.\n\n\nI think the record should show both elements: acknowledge the support that made a thing possible AND the individual choices that drove it over the finish line.\n\n\nCurious, for people here who do talk about having built something “alone,” what do you think that phrase is trying to communicate?

First off, I grew up relatively poor on a farm.  We weren't starving, but there was no financial help from my parents at any point in my adult life. As a matter of fact, it was me who was paying my parents bills when they got older. Couldn't afford college, so none of those connections. I went to work in the trades and spent 20 years learning the business and  living well below my means to save money \n\nWhen I say I built this alone, what I mean is that every step along the way the bucked stopped with me.  There were no loans, no partners, no backing, every dime was my money that I spent 20 years working and doing  without to raise.  Every piece of equipment, every stick of material, every dime paid for every service along the way has my sweat on it. Every decision, every bid, every success and failure have my fingerprints on them.\n\nMost importantly, from the beginning until today, if it all falls apart the consequences are all on me. I have never risked anything that wasn't mine to gamble. I never spent a dime of my wife's money, never used our joint accounts, and never dipped in to our household budget.  Nobody besides me loses anything if my business fails.\n\nOf course I've outsourced things. Of course I have employees. Of course they are vital to my business.  But they aren't here to help me grow my business.  They are here because I treat them fairly, have an awesome benefits package, and pay almost double the local rate for this work. Their positions are a result of my business growing from the risks I took to start and grow. I did that part on my own, with no guarantees and no safety nets.",

Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money.

      "text": "I started working on a small side project a few months ago with the idea that I’d slowly grow it and see where it goes. Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

          "text": "I started in the late 90’s. Built many companies since then, mostly around software & tech. You get better with it over time. There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this. People like Steve Blank / Harvard have cracked a lot of it. Alexander Osterwaldwer / IMD as well. Anyone can learn from these leading educators on how it’s done.",

I went through this exact same thing when I started my first business back in 2018 and it completely destroyed me because I had no idea it was coming. Like you, I had the money part figured out but the constant second-guessing and mental noise made me change directions every other week, miss meetings, and basically become unreliable to everyone including myself. What helped me eventually was realizing that the uncertainty never really goes away, but you can build systems to contain it. I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing. Also started planning each day the night before and putting everything on my calendar instead of keeping endless to-do lists floating around in my head creating more anxiety.\n\n\n\nThe loneliness part is real too and having someone to bounce ideas off of, even if they can't give you definitive answers, makes a huge difference in staying sane through all the uncertainty.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

A car salesman for instance, will have a much harder time coming across as sincere with small talk pleasantries because the general public don’t trust them and don’t really want or need their middle-man services. But a personal care service worker selling products to go with their skilled labor is a whole different story. The client has to spend time with this person and trust them, etc. Here it pays to make genuine connections in order to bring immediate testimonial value to your products and services.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -> mediation -> arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

Ask it for advice. Generally speaking, it gives good initial advice.\n\nThen, if it does think you have a case (your equity already vested, you have vote for equity changes, etc.), I would contact a lawyer. But your first tasks should be to throw it all in there and see what it thinks. I just recently went through a cofounder split and it was spot on for legal advice and identical to what my lawyers said/did. This might not be the case for everyone so take that with a grain of salt. It also gives you a bit of peace of mind with an idea of what to expect moving forward. GL OP!",

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

I am more inclined to offer a discount to a long term client, not someone who this is my first interaction with.\n\nThere are times when taking a small hit are worth it, mostly if the prestige of having this client, or being able to use them as a powerful reference, is something you can leverage to get more business.  Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.  Obviously, depends on the business.\n\nThat said, if they come in promising to pay more later, that's a pretty big red flag.  I very likely would also walk away.  Even if they could bring you in steady work in the future, they likely will always push to give you minimal margins, so you'll be working a lot for them, but not really profiting.

Back when I was starting out, I took every \"this will lead to bigger things\" deal and got burned multiple times - clients who genuinely can't afford your rate now rarely magically find budget later.\n\n\n\nThe ones who are serious about long term partnerships prove it upfront by paying your worth, not by asking for discounts. If they truly valued what you bring and saw the ROI potential, they'd find the budget or wait until they could afford you properly.\n\n\n\n$50k hurts to walk away from but you just saved yourself from potentially months of undervalued work and the resentment that comes with it. Plus you kept your positioning strong for clients who will actually pay what you're worth.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Absolutely. \n\nThe good;\n\n- 17% compounding revenue growth while maintaining margins over 3 years. \n- Built new systems, hired successfully. \n- Scale and reputation moving in the right direction. \n\nThe bad;\n\n- AR running months behind. Cash on paper, revenue, profits looking great, but cash in bank accounts in the red. Collecting is a job onto itself. Especially when dealing with clients with infinitely more resources in lands far away. \n- Constant accounting problems. Bad accounting advice from major firms costing tens of thousands to resolve and unimaginable second orders issues. \n- Getting intimate with employment law as a necessity has ensured I will never have a business with employees in my location. Endless liability and requirements. Truly insane being forced to honour “verbal contracts” aka conversations during reviews where nothing was promised other than a review of circumstances and a decision back turning into arbitration situations that wasted tons of time and money despite being provably in the right. Thank god for diligence in writing meeting memos and circulating those for approval and comment \n- Complete inability to separate my life and create space. It’s all encompassing. And it’s too much. \n- But really to summarize, core business is amazing. Still love it. But the regulatory and second orders management requirements have completely sucked the joy out of operating. \n\nLooking for an exit this year, or next, even if it means a loss.",

I go without paying myself because the money just isn't there. The EBITDA numbers in the FDD didn't reflect real world operating conditions.\n\nAnother issue that doesn't get talked about enough is how much the business depends on a corporate website & booking system & how unreliable that system actually is.\n\nAs a franchisee you have no control over that system & are required to use it but your still the one dealing with the customer fallout when it fails.",

I got my bachelors degree in Business Admin but always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur, specifically in real estate. The only good thing I truly got out of going to college was meeting my real estate mentor. He had put up an ad for a marketing intern and I went for it and the rest is history. \n\nI was on the real estate team shadowing the hell out of everyone, learning a lot at every meeting we had, even translated for an agent when I shouldn’t have because technically that’s illegal (non-real estate agent being part of a legally binding contract). \n\nThe hardest part of everything right now is the last part you mention. My friends and family all think I’m not amounting to much or that I need a full time job because it’s important to have health insurance, a steady paycheck, and blah blah blah. I have learned SO MUCH these last 9 years of my life and I’m at the point where I’m finally ready to put it all together and create actions. I’m so thankful that I fully believe in myself and my dreams because I could have easily given up many years ago but momma ain’t raise no damn quitter! I’m excited to see myself put everything together this year but it’s tough. I live paycheck to paycheck but I know I’ll make it out soon like I did before. I did have a few successful years financially but I blew through it all for quitting a good part time job on the spot that kept me afloat while I looked for more deals lol",

You need to transition from being the 'operator' to the 'owner' by refining your systems. I've been studying these kinds of business frameworks lately for a project I'm building, and it's clear that clarity in your exit strategy is what determines the price.

It could be a larger property management company writes you a big check and you walk away immediately or in the very short term.  It could be a private equity leveraged buyout where you get a decent sized check but still own some of the company and work with your new lords and masters toward some bigger multi-year goals and a second payoff down the the road.  It could be a large corporate entity where you get a big check and become a middle manager employee doing essentially the same job you've been doing but now for a salary+bonus structure (contract or at will) under the umbrella of the corporation.\n\nI would start by asking one or more of those who have approached you.  Pick one who is actually in your business, not a broker or middleman type, and just have a chit chat about it.  But certainly don't just dance with one fella.  If you decide to get serious about working a deal, engage experienced help such as brokers and lawyers.  Cast a wide net and find the right deal for you.  I don't like to pay big bucks to brokers and lawyers any more than the next guy, but this is an area where professional help is a must.

This will be **very** expensive (not least because of VAT), so looking for ways to save every penny.   \n  \nThe essence of the question is in the title: should I count on the option of a partial VAT refund and put that money into the budget for the future, or is this option far from guaranteed and more of a pleasant surprise? I am a US resident, if that matters. This is the first time I've ever shipped anything to Europe.  \n  \nAnd in general: how are you handling international tax compliance right now? Are you using any tools or tax filing services that actually make this easier? Or does it make sense to do everything yourself?\n\nAny tips are welcome!",

People dont churn because they didnt learn everything. They churn because they never felt the payoff. If someone hits the core value once they usually forgive rough edges and missing features. So the real metric isnt time spent onboarding. \n\nIts time to first meaningful action. Shorten that and churn drops without touching the roadmap. Most founders over explain instead of over guiding. Some teams use in app prompts or flows for this. Hopscotch comes up a lot. Ive also seen userflow mentioned when people want something lightweight.",

This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary & Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs & Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri.

          "text": "Yeah, AI is genuinely a really useful tool for business right now. When it’s used correctly, it can bring a lot of value. Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

Salary miscalculations and Incorrect payslips every other month\n\n4. Some issues managing employee medical checks\n\n5. And on top of this, VERY slow replies and poor English support (I guess, you get what you pay for- and in Spain apparently, English is not so used). But we learned the lesson the hard way so we are now looking for alternative local providers in Spain.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any good EOR companies in mind that could help us fix the above.

My dad is a CS major, saw lots of people coming from oversees to fill in  roles alongside himself and he ended up working on government contracts where you needed a security clearance. That is a solid option (and may need to relocate to the dc area). Accounting has a pipeline issue and it’s two fold: the job has not been attractive for young people because it’s not glamorous, lots of hours and not as well paid as other finance type and CS roles. I say do an externship to learn more about what the roles look like and what they are trending to be in the future. CS has broader applicability in my mind but accounting is a fundamental set of concepts. If there is an IT type of major offering in your program do that with accounting. My school was starting to add some data analysis and IT adjacent majors when I was in undergrad which was about 10 years ago. Good luck!!",

Access to your business Facebook page is connected to your personal Facebook account. It's against the TOS to maintain more than one personal Facebook account. When you say \"have separate emails\" for all your accounts... how does that work? They've specifically designed their systems to require a business owner to link all their accounts to a single personal profile. You're potentially more at risk of being flagged if you try to maintain several personal FB accounts each attached to a unique business page.",

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",
