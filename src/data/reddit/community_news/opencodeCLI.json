It’s honestly one of the first coding agents I’ve trusted enough for real production tasks.\n\nThat said, once you start using it *a lot*, some tradeoffs show up.\n\nCost becomes noticeable. Model choice matters more than you expect. And because it’s a managed tool, you don’t really get to see or change how the agent works under the hood. You mostly adapt your workflow to it.\n\nOut of curiosity, I started testing OpenCode (Got Hyped up from X & reddit TBH). Didn’t realize how big it had gotten until recently. The vibe is very different.\n\nClaude Code feels guarded and structured. It plans carefully, asks before doing risky stuff, and generally prioritizes safety and predictability.\n\nOpenCode feels more like raw infrastructure. You pick the model per task. It runs commands, edits files, and you validate by actually running the code. More control, less hand-holding.\n\nBoth got the job done when I tried real tasks (multi-file refactors, debugging from logs). Neither “failed.” The difference was *how* they worked, not whether they could.\n\nIf you want something managed and predictable, Claude Code is great. If you care about flexibility, cost visibility, and owning the workflow, OpenCode is interesting.\n\nI wrote up a longer comparison [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/opencode-the-best-claude-code-alternative) if anyone wants the details.",

The math flips depending on what you're actually doing.\n\nFor agentic work with lots of tool calls and iterations, K2.5 handles the volume. For single-shot complex reasoning where you need one good answer, GPT 5.2 pays for itself in fewer retries.\n\nSo rather than Black 20 + another sub, you could route at the task level: classify incoming requests by complexity and let a cheap router model decide. OpenRouter and similar services support this natively. Cuts costs 30-40% without degrading quality on the tasks that matter.",

After some back and forth with claude and a little reverse engineering, the coordination layer turns out to be a clever mix of tmux + file locks and undocumented cli arguments.\n\nSo I pulled it apart and reimplemented it as a standalone MCP server. Any MCP client can use it now, including\n\nopencode as seen in the demo video.\n\nHere's what the server exposes:\n\n\\- Team + spawning: create teams, spawn Claude Code teammates into tmux panes, graceful and forced shutdown.\n\n\\- Task coordination: ownership, status tracking, dependency graphs with cycle detection.\n\n\\- Messaging: DMs, broadcast, long-polling inbox, shutdown/plan-approval protocol.\n\n\\- Concurrency safety: file locks on inboxes and tasks, atomic config writes.\n\nRepo: [github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp](http://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp)\n\nIt's early (v0.1.0) and I'd love as much feedback as possible specifically around tighter opencode integrations.",

Is that not the idea with this?\n\nIdeally, you'd spawn an opencode server associated with a project/directory if there already isn't one available when starting up opencode since that avoids any mcp server duplication and your plugin can interact with any sessions, events, etc. You want a plugin that hooks into all the relevant events for making sure all the expected interactions work as expected and you can recover from any odd states.\n\nIf trying to have this work outside of the opencode server process, it's possible but i think it'll be more difficult. There are some other projects doing something similar and there is a ton of adapter work. Gastown, for example is one of those. ",

A proper agent team can't occur without multi-caller support.\n\nThis is because currently, when an agent that isn't the Parent persists a session with a subagent, the subagent thinks the calling agent is the Parent.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\nPrimary A tasks subagent A. Subagent A tasks Subagent B. Primary A tries to communicate with Subagent B, and Subagent B thinks it's talking to Subagent A.\n\nTo coordinate a team of agents, which are communicating, and orchestrating each others actions, you need them to be able to identify who they're talking to/with.\n\nI have a workaround system where agents write relay-files, where a sub-skill helps them know the relay-file protocol. It's part of a larger Agentic Collaboration Framework.\n\nI think a proper OpenCode implementation for Agent Teams needs first, to merge my PR, second to revamp the caller system so that it supports multi-callers.\n\nIt is getting tiresome that Anthropic releases something, and people think it's innovative, say they should copy it, but something better is already available for OpenCode, but the community just isn't paying attention or pitching in.\n\nI have a complete roadmap for agentic collaboration in development for OpenCode. The PR is just one small part of it. A critical part, but a small part. There's so much more that needs doing, and I'm just one newbie vibe coder who develops purely to build the tools that I need for litigation.\n\nEdit: decided to turn this comment into a GitHub Issue.

It’s structured, but flexible enough that I can reshape the whole plan whenever I get stuck or suddenly decide to deep-dive ownership at 2am.\n\nIt uses a pyramid-style method where each layer builds on the last, and I can expand it as I go. The repo basically becomes a living skill tree. Also, I get to ask all the “dumb” questions I’d never ask a human. No judgment. Just explanations until it finally clicks.\n\nLearning at my own pace, on my own time, has been way more comfortable, and honestly the speed is kind of wild. Rust went from intimidating to fun way faster than I expected.\n\nEdit:   \ntook down the link before, but happy to share it again, thanks for the support y'all!  \n[https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust](https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust)",

Github link is below but all you have to do is add the plugin to your OpenCode config and NPM will download the latest package for you automatically.\n\n[https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm](https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm)  \n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm)\n\nGeneral idea is that of perspective management. When you code with the traditional Plan/Build method in OpenCode, you are forcing a slightly different perspective on the LLM but in the end it is still a perspective borne of the same exact training set. My intent was to collate genuinely different data sets by calling different models for each agent.\n\nA single architect guides the entire process. This is your most capable LLM be it local or remote. Its job is to plan the project, collate all intake, and ensure the project proceeds as planned. The architect knows to break the task down into domains and then solicit Subject Matter Expert input from up to 3 domains it has detected. So if you are working on a python app, it would ask for input from a Python SME. This input is then collated, plan adjusted, and implementation instructions are sent to the coding agent one task at a time. The architect knows that it is the most capable LLM and writes all instructions for the lowest common denominator. All code changes are sent to an independent auditor and security agent for review. Lastly, the Test Engineer writes robust testing frameworks and scripts and runs them against the code base.\n\nIf there are any issues with any of these phases they will be sent back to the architect who will interpret and adjust fire. The max number of iterations the architect is allowed to roll through is configurable, I usually leave it at 5.\n\nClaude put together a pretty good readme on the github so take a look at that for more in depth information. Welcoming all feedback. Thanks!",

I actually built the swarm as a full on application before I ever knew about OpenCode. When I saw what you could do with plugins I decided to just move the entire idea to OpenCode instead. Following your project readme's instruction to just ask an LLM about it, I put both our project readmes in GPT 5.2 and this was the TLDR.\n\n**Choose OpenCode Swarm when you care about correctness, control, and repeatability.**  \nIt enforces an architect-planned, phase-gated workflow with mandatory QA before code merges and persists project state to disk so work can be resumed deterministically. Best for complex tasks where you want traceability, predictable outcomes, and protection against agent drift or context loss.\n\n**Choose Oh-My-OpenCode when you care about speed, tooling breadth, and ecosystem power.**  \nIt provides a rich library of prebuilt agents, LSP/AST tooling, and strong community support to accelerate development workflows. Best when you want maximum productivity and flexibility and are comfortable trading strict process control for capability and convenience.\n\nAs an aside, one of my constraints was that I needed to use entirely local resources, which limited how many agents I could call. Parallel agents drastically slow down inference on consumer hardware. I needed to build in hard requires for serial operation.",

I haven't seen anything that's doing a 1 for 1 copy. joelhooks has a single coordinator that can spawn multiple parallel workers to decompose a project and allow for parallelization. Along with project memory. Mine has project memory as well, but the point is quality, not speed. Swarm-tools doesn't elicit perspectives from other models and it doesn't give the sub agents different roles. So in the end, the quality will be whatever your coordinator is capable of outputting.\n\nWith opencode-swarm, every agent can be a truly different outlook born of vastly different training data and methods. This more closely replicates actual software development methodologies, where you have team members with different jobs and very different backgrounds all working together.   \n  \nHeterogeneous perspectives on a problem are almost always better than homogeneous. In my opinion anyway, all of this is up for interpretation and at the end of the day whatever fits your needs is the best option regardless of how it does it.",

They're absolutely not fake.\n\nRegarding the errors and slowness of K2.5, this is a temporary thing, due to the huge influx of new users they've had, plus the fact that K2.5 was just released. They're actively working on securing more compute, and communicating very actively in their Discord with users about the state of things and listening to complaints (when they're not sleeping, or pulling all-nighters). I've used K2T (K2.5's predecessor) with them since I joined and it has been rock solid. K2.5 will get there eventually too.\n\nI don't think it's fair to call this fake.",

I think the most important thing  is to fine-tune the interaction with the agent(s), to have a smooth experience when you iteratively build your shell command on the command line.\n\nI am also considering supporting not just single-shot calls to the agent but a per-shell chat with the agent. Possibly introducing some extra magic commands to start a new session. Maybe also to open the current session with opencode. I imagine the situation when one starts a dummy exchange, and then it develops into something interesting and worth preserving.\n\nBut coming back to your question: I don't have Windows. I will at some point test it on Windows too, but I cannot promise this will happen in the next few days. Did you try to run it with WSL or WSL2? It should work, but I did not test it myself.",

They’re on discord, issues get acknowledged and you can see what they’re working on instead of guessing why a model suddenly feels worse.\n\nOnce the promo is over, I’ll probably reassess again, especially if other Kimi or GLM providers improve.

Even on trivial 4-node problems it tops out around 80%.\n\nThe benchmarks that made it look Sonnet-tier are heavily weighted toward code generation and agentic tool use, not abstract reasoning. For date comparisons and arithmetic, you're basically hitting its weakest surface.\n\naeroumbria's multi-model approach in the comments is the pragmatic fix. Route logic-heavy tasks to a model that doesn't fumble basic orderings.",

Some pretty obvious things that I have explicitly asked both Sonnet and Opus to fix, they've said they did, but they actually didn't. GLM was able to identify the problem, and fix it on the first time, and it **actually** fixed the problem, didn't just say \"hey, I fixed this.\"\n\nIt's a **different** tool, made in a **different** way and people expect it to perform well in the **same metrics** you use to classify another tool. It's just plain stupid.\n\nPeople want to throw \"do this thing\" at an LLM agent and expect it to extrapolate extremely detailed context and perform that task perfectly, and you just can't do that with GLM.\n\nIt's the difference between automatic (Anthropic) and manual (GLM) engines. People are going to fight ad infinitum about which is better. Some people prefer the convenience of the Anthropic model and will generally **never** be able to use a manual transmission because they learned on automatic, and it just is what it is.\n\nIf you're willing to take the time to learn how to respond appropriately to the model, and to learn what it needs and expects, GLM is a great model, most especially at the price point it's being offered for.",
