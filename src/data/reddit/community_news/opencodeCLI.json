You're right about the NVIDIA loophole - now that they swapped the non-renewing 1000-credit cap for per-minute rate limits, it's a great resource.\n\nThat said, I'd highly recommend adding a quality/eval filter, rather than just sorting by latency and uptime. I found that optimizing for speed over quality is a trap with these free tiers. Many of the fastest models will hallucinate, fail tool calls, or completely ignore instructions. For example, my benchmarks showed models like Minimax-2.5 consistently mutilating code (e.g., quietly changing hyphens to underscores in variables).\n\nIf you adjust your agent/tool to evaluate and filter models based on actual coding performance and instruction-following - not just ping times - this could be incredibly useful. Right now, sending users to the top 20 fastest models might just result in a lot of frustrating debugging sessions.",

I’m able to build lots of code with agents forms in Kimi, which really builds the scaffolding for my projects from a code perspective, and then I throw in Codex to the heavy lifting, and I end with the Gemini CLI using Stich to polish off the UI.

And the results were very disappointing.\n\nDespite all these posts, videos and benchmarks stating how awesome minimax m2.5 is, it failed my test horribly given the same environment and prompt, that the others easily passed.\n\nMinimax kept hallucinating various solutions and situations that didn't make any sense. It didn't properly search online or utilized the available documentation properly. So, I wonder how all those benchmarks claiming minimax as some opus alternative actually made their benchmark.\n\nI saw a few other real benchmarks where Minimax M2.5 actually was way below Haiku 4.5 while GLM 5 and Kimi went above Sonnet 4.5; personally it felt like that as well. So at the increased price points from all these providers, its very interesting. Though neither are on opus or codex level.\n\nI did not test the same prompt with gemini, or couldn't test it, to be more precise due to circumstances. But I have a feeling Gemini 3 Pro would be similar to Kimi and GLM 5, maybe just a bit higher.\n\nWhat is your experience with Minimax compared to GLM and Kimi?",

Without that litigaiton, my human rights will continue to be violated. I'm currently dependent on Claude in Opencode for my agentic workflow. I live in fear that one day Anthropic will make Claude no longer work at all in OpenCode. What then? Kimi 2.5 I guess.\n\nWill I, as an America citizen, have to use Chinese AI to protect my civil and constitutional rights because Anthropic won't provide an effective, equitable, and dependable way for me to use Claude?\n\nThe reason I need OpenCode isn't out of preference, but necessity; no platform was providing the features I needed, so I must build it myself. I have to build my tools, and do my own litigation. It's a societal-wide failure; I need AI because no one is helping people like me with these legal or development problems.\n\nI think of my situation - between my mental and physical disabilities, the hardship of the rights violations, imposed poverty, and general abandonment by the legal community and nonprofits -  like I'm having to build a sand castle in the middle of a hurricane, while other people build on a sunny-day beach. Then people go out of their way to make it even harder for me to build, or try to destroy what I've built.\n\nI don't fear misaligned AI. I fear misaligned people.\n\nI really like and enjoy Claude, but I fear Anthropic is going to make Claude inaccessible to me; they seem intent on preventing users like me from having equitable, effective access to Claude in OpenCode. While showing no interest or intent to develop the features my workflow needs in Claude Code or CoWork.\n\nMeanwhile, an open-source model will always be accessible, even if less performant.\n\nThe world would be such a better place if entities like Anthropic would help people like me, instead of create friction and more problems.  It's nice to have AI agents that help me, but now the company who owns that AI is working to prevent Claude from being helpful to me.\n\nThe more I try to do my work, the more I end up documenting how totally screwed up everything is.\n\nThere's a lot more to consider than just price and performance when picking which AI you use.\n\nMy life-long severe disability makes me especially mindful of what I am dependent upon. If I don't have specific things, I get injured, badly.\n\nI've become dependent upon Claude, and any day now, it could just be gone. The fear of that day weighs heavily on me. I find it very disturbing that my safety and human rights are not being better served by U.S. AI companies.\n\nHow will OpenCode survive? By being one of a scarce few places where people like me can build a future our survival can depend on.",

          "text": "opencode users are getting hit so hard with bans comes down to how it accesses compute. Under the hood, Opencode hooks into your $20/mo consumer web subscriptions (like claude or anti) by spoofing direct oaut tokens and reverse-engineering private api providers like anthropic and Google crack down on this because those flaetrate tiers are priced as loss-leaders for normal human chatting, not for heavy-duty, automated CLI agent loops that burn through massive amounts of compute. Once they update their fingerprinting and catch unofficial requests pretending to be their native clients, they instantly ban the accounts for ToS violations.\n\nThis is exactly why I wrote [this](https://github.com/agentify-sh/desktop) mcp bridge for claude, codex, opencode instead of spoofing API tokens, it uses local browser automation to literally log into the actual web UI, type out the prompts, click send, and scrape the response back to your terminal. It bypasses API restrictions by essentially puppeteering a real browser session (Electron with a normal user agent but you might wanna customize that to be safe). \n\nHowever, even with that tool you still need to recognize the risks. It’s not a bulletproof shield providers are constantly upgrading their behavioral analytics. If your account is blasting out complex prompts 24/7 at superhuman speeds, you can still trigger CAPTCHAs, get heavily rate-limited, or eventually face a ban for botting. \n\nby default it types slowly and hits send button and prevents unintentional mass prompt automation but up to you to determine what level you are comfortable with I take no responsibility.\n\nmy original motivation for writing that bridge was so i can use chatgpt pro from codex cli without copy and pasting but i've expanded it so you can use any web sessions from not only gemini or claude or chatgpt but grok and perplexity as well",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been using OpenCode for heavier refactoring lately, but I keep hitting the wall where the native `Compaction` kicks in and the Agent basically gets a lobotomy. It forgets exact variable names, loses track of the files it just opened, and hallucinates its next steps.\n\nI got frustrated and spent the weekend building `opencode-working-memory`, a drop-in plugin to give the Agent a persistent, multi-tier memory system before the wipe happens.\n\nMy main goal was: **keep it simple and require absolutely zero configuration.** You just install it, and it silently manages the context in the background.\n\nHere is what the **Working Memory** architecture does automatically:\n\n1. **LRU File Pool (Auto-decay):** It tracks file paths the Agent uses. Active files stay \"hot\" in the pool, while ignored files naturally decay and drop out of the prompt, saving massive tokens.\n2. **Protected Slots (Errors & Decisions):** It intercepts `stderr` and important decisions behind the scenes, locking them into priority slots so the Agent never forgets the bug it's fixing or the tech choices it made.\n3. **Core Memory & Todo Sync:** It maintains persistent Goal/Progress blocks and automatically injects pending SQLite todos back into the prompt after a compaction wipe.\n4. **Storage Governance:** It cleans up after itself in the background (caps tool outputs at 300 files / 7-day TTL) so your disk doesn't bloat.\n\nNo setup, no extra prompt commands. It just works out of the box.\n\nIt's been working perfectly for my own workflow. I open-sourced it (MIT) in case anyone needs a plug-and-play fix: **Repo:**[https://github.com/sdwolf4103/opencode-working-memory]()\n\n*(Installation is literally just adding* `\"opencode-working-memory\"` *to your* `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` *plugin array and restarting—it downloads automatically!)*",

It does **NOT** delete the actual memory.\n\nThe real \"brain\" lives in `memory-working.json`, which persists with your session:\n\n* It ranks files based on **\"Dynamic Attention\"**.\n* **Example:** If you switch tasks (e.g., from Backend to Frontend), the new files will naturally overtake the old ones in rank after about **7-8 mentions**.\n* The AI’s focus shifts automatically to what matters *now*, pushing irrelevant context down without you needing to manage it manually.\n\n**Regarding Cross-Project Memory:** You are totally right—global memory is the next logical step. I definitely hope to implement a \"Long Term Memory\" layer in the future to handle that cross-project experience!",

Maybe because these tools consume a lot of token themselves and perform often somewhere between unreliable and non-deterministic. Although it is zero config, you often need to remind the model to use it. \n\nSo I went over to write structured documentation and implementation-lists as many others did. I try to prevent to hit the context limit and start a clean session on every phase of the implementation-list. The DCP Plugin keeps the context size low and the structure is defined by agents, skills and templates.\n\nThat's working for me, but others may think different",

I'm not always disciplined enough to keep it clean!\n\n**Regarding DCP:** It’s a solid alternative, but as you noted, it really shines when you **start fresh sessions** frequently. If you use DCP in a long, continuous session, modifying history actually breaks **Prefix Caching**, so you lose the speed/cost benefits.\n\n**Also, a big reason for hitting limits:** I'm using GitHub Copilot, and their context cap for Claude seems to be about **half** of what you get directly from Anthropic.

No React, Vue, Alpine, etc.\n- **Static**: Must work as a static file (no server-side logic)\n- **Self-hostable**: Drop into Vercel as `index.html` or paste into CodePen\n\n### Quality Bar\n\nThis is NOT a simple landing page. It should feel like it was commissioned by a world-class brand agency. Include:\n\n**Visual craft:**\n\n- Scroll-triggered reveals with Intersection Observer (not scroll events -- use IO for performance)\n- Parallax depth on at least 2 layers (background moves slower than foreground)\n- Typography that has character -- mix of serif and sans, large display type with tight tracking\n- Color palette of 3-4 tones maximum, applied with intention (not rainbow)\n- Subtle animated texture or grain overlay via CSS (repeating SVG noise, pseudo-element with opacity)\n\n**Interaction:**\n\n- Cursor that responds subtly (not gimmicky -- a small dot or trail at most)\n- Hover states that feel intentional (transforms, not just color changes)\n- Navigation that changes opacity/style on scroll\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n- Hero section with large, centered typographic statement\n- At minimum 5 distinct sections with scroll transitions between them\n- Footer with subtle details (coordinates, a fictional address, a motto in a second language)\n- A moment of surprise -- one section that does something unexpected (inverted colors, a canvas animation, text that rearranges)\n- Scent \"notes\" (top/heart/base) revealed on scroll as floating pills\n- Canvas particle system simulating mist/smoke drifting upward\n- CSS blurs that shift as you scroll (backdrop-filter manipulation)\n\n**Polish details:**\n\n- `font-display: swap` on any web fonts\n- `will-change: transform` on animated elements\n- Smooth scroll behavior on `html`\n- Mobile-responsive (flexbox/grid, no fixed px widths on containers)\n- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for accessibility\n```",

They're cooking.\n\nNow we just need z-ai to sort their capacity issues out and re-issue more competitive pricing like they had before.\n\n\n\nAs for Kimi 2.5: it's a tad better than GLM 4.7 but weaker than GLM 5 in my testing. I sometimes wonder if making it multi-modal (which yields a massive-param-count model - trillion params) might've been a bad play for coding.

If it still doesn't work, then yeah definitely model issue but GLM 5 apparently can write. I even tried this technique with ChatGPT which has like worst writing since 4o & 4.1 but damn, this technique of writing well worked with ChatGPT too.

I also have a Codex plan and the limits are insane and 5.3 is pretty wild.\n\nI’m stopping my Claude Max plan at the end of the cycle as it seems Opus is brilliant at communicating what it does, but it never quite solves the problem and makes weird choices. When you read the thinking output it’s like “wow, this thing thinks like a lead developer” but when you see the solution you realise it’s better at communicating than coding.\n\nGemini 3.1 however seems to think and blab on about tool selection incessantly but created something amazing that wasn’t even on my radar and solves my problem in both a technically superior way and is about 50x cheaper to run.\n\nCodex is somewhere between Gemini and Claude and with the insane limits at the moment is a true workhorse.\n\nThen if you’re into the “run 20 Opencode instances 24/7” kind of crowd then having Kimi 2.5 on your Black plan do the grunt work means you’ll struggle to hit the limit of a Zen&Codex Max plan.\n\nIf you have less than $50 a month budget I’d get the cheapest Codex plan and top the rest up with Kimi credit or the cheapest Zen Black plan.",

It doesn’t just give you \"alerts\"; it actually identifies and delivers exploits to prove where your vulnerabilities are.\n\n# Why this matters for OpenCode users:\n\nUntil now, Shannon was mostly a standalone powerhouse. With the **opencode-shannon-plugin**, you can now bake security auditing right into your agentic workflow.\n\n* **Security-First Vibe Coding:** Stop treating security as an afterthought.\n* **Autonomous Audits:** Let Shannon scan your PRs and local codebase for exploits before you ever hit \"merge.\"\n* **Zero Friction:** It integrates directly via the OpenCode plugin system.\n\n# How to get it:\n\nThe plugin is hosted on GitHub by **vichhka-git**: 👉[https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin](https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin)\n\n**Quick Install (usually):**\n\n1. Clone/Add the plugin to your `.opencode/plugin/` directory.\n2. Restart OpenCode.\n3. (Check the README for specific environment variables needed for the Shannon core).\n\nHuge props to the dev for making this bridge. It makes the \"full-stack\" agentic dream feel a lot more production-ready.\n\n**Has anyone tried running it against their current projects yet? Curious to see what kind of exploits it's catching in AI-generated code!**",

If you're looking for static code security auditing or SAST, this isn't it; if you need to pentest deployed applications, it might be useful.\n\nThis post conflates the original Shannon's capabilities (which DO include source code analysis for \"scan your PRs\") with this simplified plugin (which only does black-box network pentesting). The plugin author appears to have built a thin wrapper around Shannon's attack tools without implementing the source analysis capabilities that would make the \"scan your PRs\" claim true. Shrug.",

Maybe someone with a similar setup could enlighten me.\n\nHalf time I use Opus (Rest of the time still burning my Azure Credits on codex), but after all this discussions of TOS Violations with Antigravity and CC and some further issues I canceled there.\n\nI read that Opencode is accepted as a 3rd Party Agent with GitHub Copilot. (Hope it's true) So I gave it a go.\n\nStill the context size restriction nags a bit, but I think maybe it is time to work less \"sloppy\". I created some workflow (Skills and Agents) for me to work intensively with subagents. Currently only for creating docs, onboarding projects and creating execution plans.\n\nI checked the billing and verified that my workflow only get charged one premium request per prompt, but in the background tools and subs are consuming a hell of a lot of tokens on single premium request.\n\nAre there any limits I shall take care of? I mean this could be really maxxed out by using the Question-Tool and Subagents etc. Dont wanna risk my companies Github Account.\n\nAny experience or hints ?\n\nEDIT: After someone posted about suspension I searched and found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if\\_you\\_create\\_a\\_long\\_todo\\_list\\_in\\_agent\\_mode\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if_you_create_a_long_todo_list_in_agent_mode_you/)  Very Interesting.

I wanted to have a provider which acts uncomplicated and realizes access to Claude below API costs. \n\nI did a few test with subagents a few weeks ago. Found out, that saving tokens using Subs isn't that easy. Prompting this thoroughly is a piece of work on its own.\n\nAnyway, I thought it might be a good Idea to structure work and docs a bit better, so that I could easily start new sessions and work in the model's sweet spot below 128k - instead of hitting the compaction border like a vibe coder on regular basis.

The budget AI coding space is still pretty thin unfortunately, most services are targeting professional use cases so their pricing reflects that. For super cheap access to OSS models specifically, you might want to check out providers like Groq or Together AI which have free tiers and then pretty affordable pay-as-you-go after that.  \n  \nGroq especially is fast for inference on models like Llama and Mixtral. Another option is running stuff locally with Ollama if you've got decent hardware, though that's more setup work. One thing I saw recently that might fit your budget better is Zencoder's tiered subscription plans which scale from 30 to 4,200 LLM calls per day depending on what you actually need.   \n  \nThey start lower than most of hte enterprise-focused tools and you're paying for usage that matches hobby project pace rather than full-time dev velocity. Worth poking around to see if their entry tier hits your price range.",

Kimi K2.5 and GLM-5 on NanoGPT almost never manage to successfully execute a tool call for me in OpenCode.\n\nIf dirt cheap is at the top of your list, Z.ai and Chutes are your best two options.  Chutes has all the models Z.ai has and then some, and Chutes has bigger quotas for your money.\n\nI am currently subscribed to Z.ai's Pro plan, Chutes' $3 plan, NanoGPT's $8 plan, and Synthetic.new's $20 plan.  I can't drop the NanoGPT fast enough, and Synthetic doesn't feel $17 faster or better than Chutes.",
