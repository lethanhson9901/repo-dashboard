Cowork is still in its infancy but I urgently need a tool for a dispute I’m handling with the other owners in the complex I live in, reason being that Claude’s interface is much too basic. No proper filing in projects (unlabelled thumbnails just don’t cut it when you have over 50 documents), no tabs (needed with how buggy things get when switching between conversations - messages disappearing for example). Cowork has been much better as it works directly with the files on the system but yeah, it’s very new and there’s room for improvement.",

The most useful part of it is more in regard to some of the tooling that is added to help keep an agent running. Ralph loop, todo continuation, etc. I also noticed that it doesn't seem to spawn subagents very often and when it does it seems to not handle it that well.\n\nPersonally, I think there isn't a ton to get out of an orchestrating agent being the orchestrator because the orchestrator is inherently error prone and likely to suffer the same issues as using an agent regularly. Eventually as the context grows, the agent is less likely to do the things you tell are important. It just isn't ever going to happen consistently when the agent is managing everything. It starts great, but eventually will break down.\n\nI've been working with various orchestrators that leverage beads and deterministic state to execute workflows around centrally planned and broken down work and get much better results from this approach. I've also been working on my own state-machine based orchestration layer as well that is getting close to being usable. Basically, the idea is to have a state machine based orchestration layer that orchestrates the agents and when needed can leverage an agent to recover from bad states, etc.",

Just my two cents, based on my experience and the config - you seems to be using ollama. If you would like to try with llama.cpp, it might give an edge over ollama. It seems much better optimized in using system resources, and also gets support for newer models much sooner than ollama.",

I personally still handle pull requests, the implementation, and try to keep them as small as possible so that my team can easily review them. During development, I use all agents like reviewer, deep thinker, and code simplifier based on what I consider I need. I also use the git commit agent a lot, that leverages shell scripts so that committing is quite fast. :)) ",

Most agent orchestration tools treat parallel workflows as a list, but the Figma-style canvas lets you visually group related agents and see the branching structure. That's genuinely useful when you're running 5-10 agents and need to remember what each one is doing.The reactflow + embedded terminals approach is clever. I've been using Claude Code and OpenCode heavily, and the biggest friction is context-switching between sessions. Having them all visible on a canvas with decision nodes surfaced would save real time.The JSONL file structure that Claude Code uses is surprisingly hackable. You're right that the clean separation between tool calls and messages makes it easy to build secondary interfaces. The session awareness via tagged IDs is a nice touch for handling highlighted text [context.One](http://context.One) thing i'd want: persistent state between canvas sessions. When you close and reopen, do the agent sessions restore with their full history, or do you need to restart from scratch? The worst part of the current IDE experience is losing context when you close a tab.Curious what the memory footprint looks like running multiple terminal instances. Electron apps can get heavy.",

It’s when you want to hack and customize your agentic system just like you would your nvim. I remember their docs saying something like that. So the tui experience was their #1 priority. And that’s the reason why they have keybindings and extensibility. extensibility in the form of you can have your own commands, agents, your own models, and a plugin system for further expansion (_those are the first few that they have out of the box_).\n\nAlso, they’ve always recommend claude models (_im not sure if they do still, but they did for the longest time_). \n\nBut i think what got people reaching for opencode is to avoid the vendor lockin. It’s not just anthropic. Every model provider has been accused of nerfing their model post launch. And having your own setup from one agentic tool only to be rug pulled is annoying to the say the least. \n\nSo yeah, i think people are switching to opencode because it’s model agnostic. \n\nAnd although not everybody would hack and customize their setup, we have a few that would even turn their setups into plugins and make it available for others.",

Instead of writing out long explanations, I figured I'd just make a video covering the essentials.\n\nA lot of people mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the options or not knowing where to start, so I tried to keep this focused and practical no fluff, just the core stuff you actually need to know to start using it.\n\nHere's what we go through:\n\n* Installation & setup\n* Default agents and how they work\n* Configuring models (including free options)\n* Creating your own custom agents\n* Sub-agents and how to use them effectively\n* Skills and how to build them\n* Permissions and security basics\n* Using the Open Agents Control repo for a faster setup\n\nThe whole thing is under 20 minutes. Figured this might help some of you who've been wanting to jump in but didn't know how.\n\nIf you're looking to get started with Opencode quickly, hopefully this saves you some time. And if you're already using it, let me know what else you'd want to see.\n\nCheers, and thanks for the requests.\n\n[![Opencode-setup-guide](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8toBNmRDO90/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8toBNmRDO90?si=v1bIb3SjUOP5_3Ll)\n",

              "text": "The Subagent failed as the original main agent’s prompt wasn’t explicit enough to call my exact subagent and that’s why wasn’t called. \n\nEssentially under the hood opencode uses a Task tool to call agents and agent name is important for that call. \nSo in first prompt the Main agent saw call subagent but didn’t quite understand that there was a dedicated subagent for planning. So it called a general task agent which is not what we wanted and we wanted it to call our specialised agent. \n\nSo we had to explicitly highlight the name so the main agent would call it directly and not get confused.\n\nHope that helps clear some things up.",

As setup of the cloud agent makes it use a large portion of the context window. ON SETUP...\n\nClaude solved this too and their ecosystem is a bit better, similar approach to cursor.\n\nOpencode should have a github mention integration where AI does its thing. Pretty sure you can set this up using GH Actions.\n\nBut... all of them miss critical infrastructure.\n\nI built SprintFlint, a tool similar to Linear but you can autoplay issues and AI creates PRs for you, utilising what you give it; skills, mcps, plugins, agent browser and so on. No vendor lock in so you can use any AI with it (as long as it runs in the terminal). Utilising GH Actions.\n\nI started using this to further develop SprintFlint, needless to say this AI feature is still a work in progress. The agent asks questions in issue comments if it has any and creates the PR if it has enough clarity.\n\nI want to improve it further so you can see what's going on and chat with the AI properly in SprintFlint, but that'll take some time.",
