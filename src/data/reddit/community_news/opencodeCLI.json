Yes there could be occasions when you have to wait a bit but in my experience 98% of the time it's been fast. Let's wait and see what happens when everyone piles on once the hype reaches critical mass. \n\nThat said it's definitely way better than free tier openrouter models that are insanely rate limited and slow - so, so far it's been a great experience.",

Just my two cents, based on my experience and the config - you seems to be using ollama. If you would like to try with llama.cpp, it might give an edge over ollama. It seems much better optimized in using system resources, and also gets support for newer models much sooner than ollama.",

The most useful part of it is more in regard to some of the tooling that is added to help keep an agent running. Ralph loop, todo continuation, etc. I also noticed that it doesn't seem to spawn subagents very often and when it does it seems to not handle it that well.\n\nPersonally, I think there isn't a ton to get out of an orchestrating agent being the orchestrator because the orchestrator is inherently error prone and likely to suffer the same issues as using an agent regularly. Eventually as the context grows, the agent is less likely to do the things you tell are important. It just isn't ever going to happen consistently when the agent is managing everything. It starts great, but eventually will break down.\n\nI've been working with various orchestrators that leverage beads and deterministic state to execute workflows around centrally planned and broken down work and get much better results from this approach. I've also been working on my own state-machine based orchestration layer as well that is getting close to being usable. Basically, the idea is to have a state machine based orchestration layer that orchestrates the agents and when needed can leverage an agent to recover from bad states, etc.",

      "text": "\n\nYes you read the title correctly. Kimi K2.5 is THAT good. \n\nI would place it around Sonnet 4.5 level quality. It’s great for agentic coding and uses structured to-do lists similar to other frontier models, so it’s able to work autonomously like Sonnet or Opus.\n\nIt's thinking is very methodical and highly logical, so its not the best at creative writing but the tradeoff is that it is very good for agentic use.\n\nThe move from K2 -> K2.5 brought multimodality, which means that you can drive it to self-verify changes. Prior to this, I used antigravity almost exclusively because of its ability to drive the browser agent to verify its changes. This is now a core agentic feature of K2.5. It can build the app, open it in a browser, take a screenshot to see if it rendered correctly, and then loop back to fix the UI based on what it \"saw\". Hookup playwright or vercel's browser-agent and you're good to go.\n\nNow like I said before, I would still classify Opus 4.5 as superior outside of JS or TS environments. If you are able to afford it you should continue using Opus, especially for complex applications. \n\nBut for many workloads the best economical and capable pairing would be Opus as an orchestrator/planner + Kimi K2.5 as workers/subagents. This way you save a ton of money while getting 99% of the performance (depending on your workflow).  \n\n\n\\+ You don't have to be locked into a single provider for it to work.\n\n\\+ Screw closed source models.\n\n\\+ Spawn hundreds of parallel agents like you've always wanted WITHOUT despawning your bank account.\n\n\n\n*Btw this is coming from someone who very much disliked GLM 4.7 and thought it was benchmaxxed to the moon*\n\n\n\n# Get Started\n\n  \nThere are plenty of providers for open source models and only one for claude (duh)\n\n[Nano-GPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)\n\nA provider aggregator. Essentially routing all of your requests to a provider in their network. This is by far the most cost effective way to drive opencode, claude code, vscode (insiders), or any other harness. For the cost of a one extremely large cup of coffee, $8/month, you get 60,000 requests/month. That is $0.00013 per request regardless of input or output size. To put that into perspective, Sonnet 4.5 would cost you $0.45 for a request of 100k in/1k out (small-medium codebase) and not taking caching into account. Sonnet is 3,461x more expensive.\n\nAlso you can use Opus 4.5 through nano-gpt at API rates like I do to drive the orchestrator and then my subscription covers K2.5 subagents.\n\nCheap AF, solid community, founders are very active and helpful  \n  \nMy referral for 5% off web: [https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)\n\n  \n[**Synethetic.new**](https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G)\n\nThis is what I would recommend for anyone needing maximum security and lightning fast inference. It costs a premium of $20/month ($10 with my referral), but compared to claude pro plan's usage limit, its a bargain. 135 requests/5hrs with tool calls only counting as 0.1 requests. This is the best plan for professionals and you can hook it up with practically any tool like claude code and opencode. Within a 10 hour period, you can use up to 270 requests which comes out to $0.002. Sonnet 4.5 is 225x more expensive.\n\nCheap, fast speed, $60/month plan gets you 1,350 requests/5hr, data not trained on \n\nMy referral for $10 or $20 off: [https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G](https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G)",

I tried GLM 4.7 free on zen ai and it was really bad for agentic coding, maybe they are overloaded.

Its super fast, privacy centered and much cheaper than Sonnet 4.5. It also gives you the stability that is required for enterprise workloads. Combine it with your favorite frontier model (Opus 4.5/GPT 5.2) for best performance.\n\nNano-gpt is much slower but much more economical. Recommending this for side projects and hobbyists. I find this to be a great option if you need to spin up many subagents at once. Currently there are some multi-turn tool call issues which the devs are working on actively to rectify.

In my day-to-day work, I use OpenCode with two plugins and three MCPs.\n\nMy biggest discovery, and the one I'm most pleased with, is the DCP plugin, which automatically reduces token usage by removing outdated tool results from the conversation history.\n\nBesides the AGENTS.md file, I use the Simple Memory Plugin, which saves important context (like a pattern or a new discovery) during a session as logfmt files, allowing agent to search by range, type, or query. However, I think there are some better solutions for permanent memory that would not have to be loaded at the beginning of the session.\n\nOn top of that, I use three MCPs: Angular CLI MCP, Playwright MCP, and the most important and useful one, Context Engine MCP from Augment. Code indexing is quite crucial. It helps avoid lots of \"grep\" commands and find patterns within the project.",

It’s when you want to hack and customize your agentic system just like you would your nvim. I remember their docs saying something like that. So the tui experience was their #1 priority. And that’s the reason why they have keybindings and extensibility. extensibility in the form of you can have your own commands, agents, your own models, and a plugin system for further expansion (_those are the first few that they have out of the box_).\n\nAlso, they’ve always recommend claude models (_im not sure if they do still, but they did for the longest time_). \n\nBut i think what got people reaching for opencode is to avoid the vendor lockin. It’s not just anthropic. Every model provider has been accused of nerfing their model post launch. And having your own setup from one agentic tool only to be rug pulled is annoying to the say the least. \n\nSo yeah, i think people are switching to opencode because it’s model agnostic. \n\nAnd although not everybody would hack and customize their setup, we have a few that would even turn their setups into plugins and make it available for others.",

Instead of writing out long explanations, I figured I'd just make a video covering the essentials.\n\nA lot of people mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the options or not knowing where to start, so I tried to keep this focused and practical no fluff, just the core stuff you actually need to know to start using it.\n\nHere's what we go through:\n\n* Installation & setup\n* Default agents and how they work\n* Configuring models (including free options)\n* Creating your own custom agents\n* Sub-agents and how to use them effectively\n* Skills and how to build them\n* Permissions and security basics\n* Using the Open Agents Control repo for a faster setup\n\nThe whole thing is under 20 minutes. Figured this might help some of you who've been wanting to jump in but didn't know how.\n\nIf you're looking to get started with Opencode quickly, hopefully this saves you some time. And if you're already using it, let me know what else you'd want to see.\n\nCheers, and thanks for the requests.\n\n[![Opencode-setup-guide](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8toBNmRDO90/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8toBNmRDO90?si=v1bIb3SjUOP5_3Ll)\n",

Playing right into the anchor.\n\nWhile in reality their price needs to be compared to other alternatives that are comparable. At this point, they no longer have the \"SOTA\" benefit anymore.\n\nGLM 4.7 is really killing it, and while I started planning with Opus and implementing with GLM, I have gradually moved to doing most of my planning with GLM-4.7\n\nHaven't tried Kimi, but it seems to beat them both on many benchmarks.\n\nSure, they are in their \"Give it all for cheap\" phase, but the price difference between Anthropic and everyone else is not proportionate.\n\nSo people really need to ask themselves if they really need Claude for either the sub or the APIs.\n\nAt this point, if you are writing some code that any AI company might be interested in stealing, then by all means stick to Claude or OpenAI (in case they are absolutely trustworthy). I hope no model is actually seeing any customer data to begin with.\n\nAnd if someone is really doing something that is so complicated that they feel only Claude can do it, then maybe, they either their employer or their revenue should be able to pay for it.\n\nFor everyone else, there are cheaper, and equally (in some cases, more) capable models.\n\nI have personally been weaning out my usage from Anthropic to GLM within Claude code. And at the same time, also moving my workflows to Opencode, for the day when Anthropic decides to also ban accounts for using other models in Claude code (I bet they are collecting those stats even when you are using a different model)\n\nAt this stage, I wouldn't care much, even if my account is banned. Since I moved to GLM, I haven't hit my Claude limits for 2-3 weeks. And already planning to move to $20 sub at the end of this month (already moved from 200 to 100 1.5 months ago)\n\nOr maybe, they will be happy that people who they were losing money on, are finally leaving.",

But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended. \n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm a big fan of Opus 4.5 especially in opencode. Fits my workflow very well and enjoy the conversational aspect of it a lot.\n\nI'm always trying new models as they come, because the space is moving so fast and also because Anthropic doesn't seem to want me as a customer. I tried GLM 4.7, MiniMax-2, Devstral 2, Mistral Large 3, and I never was satisfied by the results. Too many errors that couldn't compete with what Opus 4.5 was delivering. I also tried GPT5.2 (medium or high) but I hate it so much (good work but the interactions are hell).\n\nSo I set Kimi K2.5 up to work with a SPEC.md file that I used in a previous project  (typescript node + react, status notification app) and here is how it went:\n\n* Some tool calls error with truncated input which halted the task (solved by just saying \"continue and be careful about your tool calls\")\n* It offered to implement tests, which none of the other models did\n* It had a functional implementation quite quickly without too many back and forth\n* It lacked some logic in the UI (missing buttons) but pointing it out led to a working fix\n* Conversation with it is on par with what I get from Opus, albeit it feels like a little bit less competent coworker ; but if feels GOOD.\n* The end result is very good!\n\nI highly recommend you try it out for yourself. It is better than I expected. (edit to clarify: not as good as Opus, but better than anything else I tried - \"better\" is  very personal as I tried to laid out above, it's more about the process than the end result)\n\nWhat is your experience with it? Did I develop some patience with these models or is it quite competent?\n\nedit: I'm using the official Kimi Code sub, as I've read integration in vendors can lead to less success in tool calls especially. Since this is open weight, not all providers are equal. See [https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier) for instance (they updated it for K2.5 and it should equalize vendors more, but keep that in mind)",

I'm only using it for analysis tasks, but it has handled tools well, which has not be true of other models I've tried (to be fair, 6+ months ago). I haven't swapped into any major tasks, mostly because I have plenty of Claude headroom, but will over time.

Like it or not, you're used to doing things the Anthropic way, and if you try to bring it to z.ai you're going to have a lot of issues.\n\nIt's a different tool, trained a different way, by different people, using different tools. It's not weird it requires you to change the way you've done things up until now.\n\nI still struggle every now and again, but once I ironed out the workflow I'm back to working confidently. I'm on the small base plan and max it out all the time. It's 3x the usage of the $20 Claude Pro plan I was on and even though I hit limits sometimes, it generally takes 3-4 hours, so I take a coffee break and come back and work.\n\nFor $28 it's a fuckin' steal.\n\nTake your time an invest heavily into learning how to use **sub agents**. They're the key to working with z.ai.\n\nIs it slow? Kinda. I find the `4.7-Flash` model is crazy slow. I try to delegate different sub agents to use different models. Like committing things to git doesn't require an insane amount of thought, so I use `4.7-flash` instead of `4.7` which saves on tokens, especially if you're committing a lot. Gaining context? Why do you need the equivalent of deepthink enabled just to get context about your project into the context window? Use a different less expensive agent. Doing that repeatedly saves you tons of usage--but like I said, it's been kinda slow lately because it's been getting much more popular.\n\nBut generally, I find it to be about the same as Sonnet 4.5. I'm generally not glued to the AI window anyways. I run long running commands and watch a movie. Who cares if it takes 5 minutes vs 8 minutes?\n\nGLM 4.7 is ranked as the 6th best LLM for coding in the world. Sonnet 4.5 is ranked as the first. The difference between them? 4.9% yet Claude cost me $240/yr, and GLM 4.7 cost me $28/yr.\n\n*So are you willing to spend 158% more for 4.9% performance?*",

It requires more structure. I always use plan mode to converse with the agent about proposed changes that I want to make. Then I'll write them to file in a multi-phase implementation plan in manageable chunks so GLM doesn't confuse itself. Then I use sub agents. The main agent will pass only enough context for the sub agent to complete its task, so context is kept to a minimum and there's less of a chance for hallucination.",

Especially for glm and minimax models. \nAlso i noticed that [minimax coding](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan?code=HO46LCwAJ5&source=link) itself promises 100 prompts but they calculate this in a way of giving much much more than 100 prompts - as single prompt means 15 model calls and it seems that it's very efficiently calculated somehow - i tried to cap 100 prompts there with my usual workload and i was not able to do so (mainly webdevelopment). \nReflinks giving you additional discounts there - feel free to use them",

If you JUST have an openai subscription then you can have an orchestrator running a small gpt model, when it needs to create an SDD and dependency map it could use the xhigh gpt5, then kick off that result to build an implementation plan to codex, and then code it up with codex.  You would get almost the exact same results as using GPT5 xhigh, but at a much reduced cost.  Enough of a reduced cost that you could then have a dialectical agent come in behind top level steps and validate results.\n\nThe downside is that there is a lot of learning.  If you use opencode I'd suggest also grabing some popular plugins to check out what is possibe such as oh my opencode.  OMO is kind of heavy, so its debatable on if it's a good daily driver BUT it absolutely is a good example of things that can be done in the system.",
