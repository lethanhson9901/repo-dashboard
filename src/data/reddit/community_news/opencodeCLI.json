      "text": "I've been using OpenCode since the early betas and GLM since version 4. During that time I've tried countless prompt patterns and agent designs. Most didn't quite deliver, but a few approaches seemed to work consistently.\n\nA bit about me: I'm a Clojure developer with 5+ years of experience and a Solution Architect for 2+ years. My daily driver is Emacs/Doom. I spend a lot of time doing vibe coding—rapid PoCs to verify architectural concepts and run calculations. When I'm writing production code, I work in tandem with Grok Code and the coder agent.\n\nThese agents are tuned around GLM4.6/4.7 and Grok Code, and I use them every day in my work.\n\n# The Agents\n\n# _arch — Architecture Planning\n\nThis agent focuses on breaking down problems rather than writing code. It uses complexity frameworks and applies a \"bare minimum\" filter to help identify what's actually needed for an MVP.\n\nHow it works in practice: if you don't know System Design at all, it sets a good direction with atomic tasks. If you do know it well, it helps you find blind spots in your solution. Don't treat it as a source of truth, but it's been useful for generating JIRA-formatted tasks with deployment considerations.\n\n# _coder — Code Implementation\n\nAn autonomous coding agent that reads the existing codebase before making changes. It follows the ReAct pattern—reasoning, planning, acting, observing, reflecting.\n\nThis is the most unstable agent. It depends heavily on whether the model actually listens to instructions. There's some copium involved here, but sometimes it does remember about DRY, SOLID, and proper error handling. When it works, it catches more edge cases because it understands the context first.\n\n# _writer — Content Creation\n\nHigher temperature agent designed for narrative work. It goes through multiple thinking phases before writing, which tends to produce more natural prose.\n\nThis is the best creative agent I've built. I use it regularly to edit articles and releases, summarize meetings, and write documentation. It's become my go-to for anything that needs to read like it was written by a person, not an LLM.\n\n# _beagle — Research Assistant\n\nStarts with a query and follows information trails, building connection maps between related concepts. Every fact gets a source citation, and it provides a confidence rating.\n\nThis is my magnum opus. I finally managed to build an agent that does iterative hierarchical web search, properly understanding terms along the way. It's especially valuable for unpopular domains where you need papers from arXiv or Medium posts written by actual researchers working on the problem.\n\n# How I Use Them\n\nI run these agents both as primary assistants and as sub-agents for specific tasks. I also actively use [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) in my workflow — *big* *shoutout to the Fission-AI team*. I even opened an issue to let `openspec-apply/proposal` use the current active agent instead of being limited to just Build.\n\n# MCP Tools I Use\n\n|Tool|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Context7**|Library documentation with semantic search|\n|**zread**|GitHub repository search and file reading|\n|**zai-mcp-server**|Image analysis, OCR, error screenshot diagnosis|\n|**web-search-prime**|Web search with time-based filters|\n|**web-reader**|Converting web pages to markdown|\n|**playwright**|Browser automation|\n\n# Some Observations\n\nSpecialization seems to work better than trying to have one agent do everything. Different temperatures and permission sets for different tasks have been more reliable than a general-purpose assistant.\n\nI've set thinking to English across all agents while keeping responses in the language I'm using—this seems to improve reasoning quality.\n\nThese prompts are tuned around GLM4.7 with unlimited tokens, so your mileage may vary with different models.\n\nRepository: [https://github.com/veschin/opencode-agents](https://github.com/veschin/opencode-agents)",

It’s nearly on par with something like Sonnet 4.5, but for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI’ve tried using OpenRouter’s free models through OpenCode, but they’re almost always hampered or virtually unusable. So my go-to is either OpenCode’s own free models or, for more demanding work, I switch to one of OpenRouter’s paid models. Occasionally, when I need more reasoning power, I’ll use the Claude API through OpenRouter. I try to use the most cost-efficient model for the task at hand. \n\nWhile it's available, I'll probably continue to rely quite a bit on OpenCode's free GLM 4.7.",

Everything happens on-device.\n\nI'm sharing my initial release of openground, an opensource and completely on-device RAG tool that let's you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like and Context7 MCP provide a likely source of truth for docs, but their closed-source ingestion and querying pose security/privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to agents and how it is ingested. Find a documentation source (git repo or sitemap), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.\n\nAgain, this is an initial release, so it is pretty barebones. Upcoming features I am working on:\n\n\\- specific library version handling (it currently only supports latest versions)\n\n\\- docs \"registry\" to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to S3\n\n\\- lighter-weight package\n\nSuggestions and PRs welcome! I'll also be around for discussion.",

Then, the supervisor agent takes over and passes the task to the planner, coder, reviewer, etc. I'm certain that I can achieve better quality code results this way. \n\nI've posted a brief explanation [here](https://zashboy.com/articles/opencode-supervisor-orchestrating-multi-agent-development-workflows).\n\nDoes anybody else do something like this?
