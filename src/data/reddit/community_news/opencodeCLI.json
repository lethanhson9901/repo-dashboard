      "text": "Hey OpenCode folks,\n\nJust wanted to say thanks to everyone maintaining OpenCode and keeping it open source. Projects like this are rare. It is genuinely useful in day-to-day work, and it is also built in a way that lets other people actually build on top of it.\n\nI have been working on a cross-platform desktop app using Tauri, and running OpenCode as a local sidecar has been a huge help. Having a solid headless runtime I can rely on means I get to focus on the desktop experience, security boundaries, and local-first behavior instead of reinventing an agent runtime from scratch.\n\nA few things I really appreciate:\n\n* The CLI and runtime are practical and easy to ship, not just a demo.\n* The clear separation between the engine and the UI makes embedding possible.\n* The architecture makes it possible to build on top of OpenCode or embed it elsewhere, rather than having to fork the core runtime. (EDIT for clarity)\n\nAnyway, just a sincere thank you for the work you are doing. It is unglamorous, hard engineering, and it is helping other open-source projects actually ship. I also love the frequent updates. Keep up the great work!",

I actually ran into the same “one agent can only do so much at once” limitation, and ended up building a simple orchestration layer into my app to solve it.\n\nThe inspiration for this was OpenClaw’s multi‑agent setup: multiple agents working in parallel toward a shared goal, then folding their results back together.\n\nIn practice my setup looks like: a list of tasks -> one Orchestrator -> multiple worker agents. The Orchestrator assigns tasks concurrently (so research, extraction, code changes, verification, etc. can happen side‑by‑side), tracks progress, and then merges the outputs into a final answer/plan.\n\nOpencode could absolutely implement the same idea. They’d ***just*** need an orchestration layer that can run multiple sessions/tasks at the same time, handle coordination (who’s doing what), and then aggregate results. That’s basically the missing piece between a single agent session and a team of agents collaborating.\n\nThis does not require multiple opencode instances either.",

Subagent orchestration: After disabling a couple of MCP servers, it performed well, so I think it *does* struggle quite a bit with middle-of-the-road context bloat. Note that I almost always exhaust my context usage at the end of a session due to heavy research tasks.\n3. Inference: (I'm on ultra, so YMMV), Almost at par with Kimi K2.5 on Synthetic. Not blazing fast, but definitely an improvement over GLM 4.7 on Z.ai.\n\nIf you are keen to try it out, please check out the writeup above first.",

After some back and forth with claude and a little reverse engineering, the coordination layer turns out to be a clever mix of tmux + file locks and undocumented cli arguments.\n\nSo I pulled it apart and reimplemented it as a standalone MCP server. Any MCP client can use it now, including\n\nopencode as seen in the demo video.\n\nHere's what the server exposes:\n\n\\- Team + spawning: create teams, spawn Claude Code teammates into tmux panes, graceful and forced shutdown.\n\n\\- Task coordination: ownership, status tracking, dependency graphs with cycle detection.\n\n\\- Messaging: DMs, broadcast, long-polling inbox, shutdown/plan-approval protocol.\n\n\\- Concurrency safety: file locks on inboxes and tasks, atomic config writes.\n\nRepo: [github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp](http://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp)\n\nIt's early (v0.1.0) and I'd love as much feedback as possible specifically around tighter opencode integrations.",

Is that not the idea with this?\n\nIdeally, you'd spawn an opencode server associated with a project/directory if there already isn't one available when starting up opencode since that avoids any mcp server duplication and your plugin can interact with any sessions, events, etc. You want a plugin that hooks into all the relevant events for making sure all the expected interactions work as expected and you can recover from any odd states.\n\nIf trying to have this work outside of the opencode server process, it's possible but i think it'll be more difficult. There are some other projects doing something similar and there is a ton of adapter work. Gastown, for example is one of those. ",

A proper agent team can't occur without multi-caller support.\n\nThis is because currently, when an agent that isn't the Parent persists a session with a subagent, the subagent thinks the calling agent is the Parent.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\nPrimary A tasks subagent A. Subagent A tasks Subagent B. Primary A tries to communicate with Subagent B, and Subagent B thinks it's talking to Subagent A.\n\nTo coordinate a team of agents, which are communicating, and orchestrating each others actions, you need them to be able to identify who they're talking to/with.\n\nI have a workaround system where agents write relay-files, where a sub-skill helps them know the relay-file protocol. It's part of a larger Agentic Collaboration Framework.\n\nI think a proper OpenCode implementation for Agent Teams needs first, to merge my PR, second to revamp the caller system so that it supports multi-callers.\n\nIt is getting tiresome that Anthropic releases something, and people think it's innovative, say they should copy it, but something better is already available for OpenCode, but the community just isn't paying attention or pitching in.\n\nI have a complete roadmap for agentic collaboration in development for OpenCode. The PR is just one small part of it. A critical part, but a small part. There's so much more that needs doing, and I'm just one newbie vibe coder who develops purely to build the tools that I need for litigation.\n\nEdit: decided to turn this comment into a GitHub Issue.

It lets you send prompts to OpenCode agents from your phone, track task progress, and get notified when jobs finish.\n\n* GitHub (plugin): [https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa](https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa)\n* App: [https://vicoa.ai/](https://vicoa.ai/) (iOS and web for now, Android coming soon, freemium)\n\n\n\n**Why I made it**\n\nVibe coding with OpenCode is great, but I need to constantly wait for the agents to finish. It feels like being chained to the desk, babysitting the agents.\n\nI want to be able to monitor the agent progress and prompt the OpenCode agents even on the go. \n\n**What it does**\n\n* Connects OpenCode to a mobile client (Vicoa)\n* Lets you send prompts to OpenCode agents from your phone\n* Real-time sync of task progress\n* Send task completion or permission required notifications\n* Send slash commands\n* Fuzzy file search on the app\n\nThe goal is to treat agents more like background workers instead of something you have to babysit.\n\n**Quick Start (easy)**\n\nThe integration is implemented as an OpenCode plugin and is fully open-source.\n\nAssuming you have OpenCode installed, you just need to install Vicoa with a single command: \n\n    pip install vicoa\n\nthen just run:\n\n    vicoa opencode\n\nThat’s it. It automatically installs the plugin and handles the connection.\n\nLinks again: \n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa](https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa)\n* Documentation: [https://vicoa.ai/docs/agents/opencode](https://vicoa.ai/docs/agents/opencode)\n\nThanks for reading!

Being able to kick off tasks, approve permissions, and check progress from anywhere completely changed how I work with AI coding agents.

I've been using the opencode-antigravity-auth plug-in to use Claude with Antigravity because I've been running out of my Claude Max 20x weekly limit way too quickly, and I've been paying for Gemini ultra for $250 a month which I hardly used because I just didn't like Gemini 3 Pro nearly as much as I expected, so I thought it was safe to supplement my usage and take advantage of that subscription. I'm writing a letter of appeal to Google in hopes that they might grant me a pardon, but I don't expect much.\n\nI would cancel my Gemini subscription and pay Anthropic $400 a month instead if I could so I don't have to worry about running out of my Opus limits, but that's not even an option. Apparently it's against their terms of service to have two Max accounts, which is really lame. Now I'm being forced to use codex to supplement my addiction, but it's just not satisfying my itch. I guess I have to lean more on Kimi K2.5 and now GLM-5 as my fallbacks. What's a full-time independent developer to do? I've been going all in to take my commercial project I've been working on for so long to completion, can't slow down now...",

One shot tasks or \"the questions and forget\" maybe, but it is frustrating to stare at stacked edits and try to figure out what is going on. Opencode at least lets you see edits in a nicely highlighted manner and list all current edits and TODOs at once.",

I’m using synthetic mainly because of the promo and so far it’s been noticeably faster than before. I might even stay after the promo expires since their service is a lot better compared to other providers. I feel more secure using it and I no longer want to explore other AI providers because it takes a lot of time and usually requires paying just to try their plans.\n\nThey recently added US-based servers, and one of them is using NVIDIA GPUs. I don’t really understand all the infra details, but performance-wise it’s definitely faster compared to their previous setup. Latency feels a lot better on my end.\n\nOne thing to note is that I think the standard plan is still on a waitlist right now, while the pro plan is available. If anyone wants to double-check, their discord is probably the best place. The devs are active there and they post updates about infra changes, issues and what they’re working on.\n\nIf you want to try it with the discounted offer:  \n[https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK](https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK)\n\nEdit: Based on what I’ve seen on their discord, they’re really focusing on improving and stabilizing the service with their new infra setup and servers. They plan to add glm-5 once the infrastructure can handle more users, since adding it too early would definitely flood the service and cause slowdowns.",

Re-explaining your architecture, your decisions, where stuff lives. Every. Single. Time.\n\nGot tired of it so I built MegaMemory. It's an MCP server that gives your coding agent persistent project memory through a local knowledge graph.\n\nSearch is semantic, not keyword matching. Your agent calls `understand(\"message cache timeout\")` and it finds related concepts even if those exact words never appear anywhere. It matches on meaning, not text. All embeddings run locally in-process, no API calls, no OpenAI key, nothing leaves your machine.\n\nKnowledge is stored as a graph, not flat notes. Concepts have types (module, pattern, decision, config) and real relationships between them (depends\\_on, implements, calls, configured\\_by). When the agent queries something it gets structure. How things connect, what depends on what, why decisions were made. Not just a wall of text.\n\nWhen the agent finishes work it calls `create_concept` to record what it built and why. Next session it picks up right where it left off. Memory grows with your project.\n\nQuick rundown:\n\n* `npx megamemory install` and pick your targets. Supports OpenCode, Claude Code, and Antigravity out of the box\n* Interactive installer walks you through setup, no manual config editing\n* Everything lives in `.megamemory/` in your repo. Commit it to git like anything else\n* Fully local, all processing happens on your machine\n* Web explorer with semantic search built in so you can browse your knowledge graph visually\n* Branch merging support so knowledge doesn't get lost across git branches\n* Open source, MIT licensed, zero external deps, Node 18+\n\nJust shipped v1.3.1 with a bunch of improvements since launch. Interactive multi-target installer, structured error handling, semantic search in the web explorer, and a lot more test coverage. Already getting external PRs from the community.\n\n[https://github.com/0xK3vin/MegaMemory](https://github.com/0xK3vin/MegaMemory)\n\n`npm install -g megamemory`\n\nHope you get some use out of it, check it out and let me know what you think.",

              "text": "Yeah that's a valid concern. The way it works is the agent doesn't just accumulate knowledge blindly. When it reads from a concept before working on code, it's prompted to update that concept and any linked concepts after it's done. So if concept\\_A says the cache TTL is 60s and the agent changes it to 120s, it updates concept\\_A and anything connected to it. Knowledge stays current because updating is part of the workflow, not a separate maintenance task.",

We start with semantic search using 384-dim MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings and cosine similarity to surface relevant concepts. Each result comes with its local graph neighborhood, and the agent decides what to follow next. The LLM is effectively the traversal engine.\n\nBrute-force similarity works fine here. Even a large project is only a few hundred concepts, and 10k nodes is a theoretical ceiling. Best part, it’s a single `.db` file. No services, no infra, drop-in and done.",
