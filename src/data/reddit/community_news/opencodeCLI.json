On one hand, it does make sense -- if you ask a model to create a function that does X, you can actually verify if the implementation is correct. But it's much harder to create a benchmark that would include complex tasks like code refactoring involving multiple files -- particularly when it comes to assessing the results... But I was not actually following this benchmarking area lately, maybe there is something like this already... My approach is empirical -- I just try different models with my real codebase and see how they perform. But of course that is not a \"real\" benchmarking.",

We probably need a good agent harness/opening prompt/system prompt for this?   \n  \nI have not tried it with something like Beads and see if it can keep an eye on that. But it does actively engage with Serena it seems to be fairly good at recognizing tools and utilizing them.   \n  \nI made a video about some changes I made on a personal use project and it did an OK job but now that I've messed with it some more and done some IT tasks with it I recognize that it kind of fizzles after one task and comes back to the user.

They already have competitive pricing and so many models and services intergrated.\n\nOne thing I’m hoping for is better support for using local models. So far I haven’t been able to intergrate LM Studio support. The setup process is straight forward but I can’t seem to get them to link together in terms of OpenCode using LM studio for local generation",

Yes there could be occasions when you have to wait a bit but in my experience 98% of the time it's been fast.

      "text": "\n\nYes you read the title correctly. Kimi K2.5 is THAT good. \n\nI would place it around Sonnet 4.5 level quality. It’s great for agentic coding and uses structured to-do lists similar to other frontier models, so it’s able to work autonomously like Sonnet or Opus.\n\nIt's thinking is very methodical and highly logical, so its not the best at creative writing but the tradeoff is that it is very good for agentic use.\n\nThe move from K2 -> K2.5 brought multimodality, which means that you can drive it to self-verify changes. Prior to this, I used antigravity almost exclusively because of its ability to drive the browser agent to verify its changes. This is now a core agentic feature of K2.5. It can build the app, open it in a browser, take a screenshot to see if it rendered correctly, and then loop back to fix the UI based on what it \"saw\". Hookup playwright or vercel's browser-agent and you're good to go.\n\nNow like I said before, I would still classify Opus 4.5 as superior outside of JS or TS environments. If you are able to afford it you should continue using Opus, especially for complex applications. \n\nBut for many workloads the best economical and capable pairing would be Opus as an orchestrator/planner + Kimi K2.5 as workers/subagents. This way you save a ton of money while getting 99% of the performance (depending on your workflow).  \n\n\n\\+ You don't have to be locked into a single provider for it to work.\n\n\\+ Screw closed source models.\n\n\\+ Spawn hundreds of parallel agents like you've always wanted WITHOUT despawning your bank account.\n\n\n\n*Btw this is coming from someone who very much disliked GLM 4.7 and thought it was benchmaxxed to the moon*\n\n\n\n# Get Started\n\n  \nThere are plenty of providers for open source models and only one for claude (duh)\n\n[Nano-GPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)\n\nA provider aggregator. Essentially routing all of your requests to a provider in their network. This is by far the most cost effective way to drive opencode, claude code, vscode (insiders), or any other harness. For the cost of a one extremely large cup of coffee, $8/month, you get 60,000 requests/month. That is $0.00013 per request regardless of input or output size. To put that into perspective, Sonnet 4.5 would cost you $0.45 for a request of 100k in/1k out (small-medium codebase) and not taking caching into account. Sonnet is 3,461x more expensive.\n\nAlso you can use Opus 4.5 through nano-gpt at API rates like I do to drive the orchestrator and then my subscription covers K2.5 subagents.\n\nCheap AF, solid community, founders are very active and helpful  \n  \nMy referral for 5% off web: [https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)\n\n  \n[**Synethetic.new**](https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G)\n\nThis is what I would recommend for anyone needing maximum security and lightning fast inference. It costs a premium of $20/month ($10 with my referral), but compared to claude pro plan's usage limit, its a bargain. 135 requests/5hrs with tool calls only counting as 0.1 requests. This is the best plan for professionals and you can hook it up with practically any tool like claude code and opencode. Within a 10 hour period, you can use up to 270 requests which comes out to $0.002. Sonnet 4.5 is 225x more expensive.\n\nCheap, fast speed, $60/month plan gets you 1,350 requests/5hr, data not trained on \n\nMy referral for $10 or $20 off: [https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G](https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G)",

That 76.8% vs Claude's 80.9% shows up when you're touching multiple files with shared state.\n- Speed matters for iteration. 34 tok/s vs Sonnet's 91 means longer feedback loops.

It’s honestly one of the first coding agents I’ve trusted enough for real production tasks.\n\nThat said, once you start using it *a lot*, some tradeoffs show up.\n\nCost becomes noticeable. Model choice matters more than you expect. And because it’s a managed tool, you don’t really get to see or change how the agent works under the hood. You mostly adapt your workflow to it.\n\nOut of curiosity, I started testing OpenCode (Got Hyped up from X & reddit TBH). Didn’t realize how big it had gotten until recently. The vibe is very different.\n\nClaude Code feels guarded and structured. It plans carefully, asks before doing risky stuff, and generally prioritizes safety and predictability.\n\nOpenCode feels more like raw infrastructure. You pick the model per task. It runs commands, edits files, and you validate by actually running the code. More control, less hand-holding.\n\nBoth got the job done when I tried real tasks (multi-file refactors, debugging from logs). Neither “failed.” The difference was *how* they worked, not whether they could.\n\nIf you want something managed and predictable, Claude Code is great. If you care about flexibility, cost visibility, and owning the workflow, OpenCode is interesting.\n\nI wrote up a longer comparison [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/opencode-the-best-claude-code-alternative) if anyone wants the details.",

OpenCode’s flow is already so rigid (with task management being handled in the conversation), and Superpowers expects the full lifecycle of its skills to complete a task, and doesn’t wrap up things if you get interrupted.\n\nThat being said, I like using Superpowers in CC with Opus for brainstorming and planning, and then having it write to files that I can pick up and continue to work with in OpenCode with Codex for implementation/testing/review.\n\nPerfect?

For single-shot complex reasoning where you need one good answer, GPT 5.2 pays for itself in fewer retries.\n\nSo rather than Black 20 + another sub, you could route at the task level: classify incoming requests by complexity and let a cheap router model decide. OpenRouter and similar services support this natively. Cuts costs 30-40% without degrading quality on the tasks that matter.",

Does caching work (that helps a lot with speed)? \n\nIn my experience, having paid for the $20 Synthetic plan for a few months now, Synthetic is faster and more stable --- and the inference is higher-quality --- for their self hosted models (GLM 4.7, Kimi K2T, etc) than any other provider. Currently, they're proxying K2.5 to Fireworks.AI while they get their infrastructure and hardware ready to run it, so it's not nearly as reliable in tool calling as their general capabilities, but it's still faster and more stable than other services I've tried (to be fair, I haven't tried any of the Big Three --- Gemini, Claude, or GPT Codex). \n\nAlso, OpenCode is pretty API call efficient; when I was still using it, the 135 API calls provided by the $20/mo Synthetic plan felt like more than enough. If you have an agent that uses a lot more API requests, like the Zed Agent, you can start to run up against the limits more often if you've got, like, several agents running, or having them run in a really really tight loop where they output and do very little per API call, but for general usage even in more token-heavy agents, it takes some heavy nonstop usage to hit the limit within their 5 hour window. Their limits are more generous than what the Claude Code subscription gives you, for instance.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm a big fan of Opus 4.5 especially in opencode. Fits my workflow very well and enjoy the conversational aspect of it a lot.\n\nI'm always trying new models as they come, because the space is moving so fast and also because Anthropic doesn't seem to want me as a customer. I tried GLM 4.7, MiniMax-2, Devstral 2, Mistral Large 3, and I never was satisfied by the results. Too many errors that couldn't compete with what Opus 4.5 was delivering. I also tried GPT5.2 (medium or high) but I hate it so much (good work but the interactions are hell).\n\nSo I set Kimi K2.5 up to work with a SPEC.md file that I used in a previous project  (typescript node + react, status notification app) and here is how it went:\n\n* Some tool calls error with truncated input which halted the task (solved by just saying \"continue and be careful about your tool calls\")\n* It offered to implement tests, which none of the other models did\n* It had a functional implementation quite quickly without too many back and forth\n* It lacked some logic in the UI (missing buttons) but pointing it out led to a working fix\n* Conversation with it is on par with what I get from Opus, albeit it feels like a little bit less competent coworker ; but if feels GOOD.\n* The end result is very good!\n\nI highly recommend you try it out for yourself. It is better than I expected. (edit to clarify: not as good as Opus, but better than anything else I tried - \"better\" is  very personal as I tried to laid out above, it's more about the process than the end result)\n\nWhat is your experience with it? Did I develop some patience with these models or is it quite competent?\n\nedit: I'm using the official Kimi Code sub, as I've read integration in vendors can lead to less success in tool calls especially. Since this is open weight, not all providers are equal. See [https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier) for instance (they updated it for K2.5 and it should equalize vendors more, but keep that in mind)",

I'm only using it for analysis tasks, but it has handled tools well, which has not be true of other models I've tried (to be fair, 6+ months ago). I haven't swapped into any major tasks, mostly because I have plenty of Claude headroom, but will over time. Kind of on an urgent project at the moment so not a lot of \"play\" time.\n\nI do want to integrate it into our tool. We're building a focused coding agent.

Playing right into the anchor.\n\nWhile in reality their price needs to be compared to other alternatives that are comparable. At this point, they no longer have the \"SOTA\" benefit anymore.\n\nGLM 4.7 is really killing it, and while I started planning with Opus and implementing with GLM, I have gradually moved to doing most of my planning with GLM-4.7\n\nHaven't tried Kimi, but it seems to beat them both on many benchmarks.\n\nSure, they are in their \"Give it all for cheap\" phase, but the price difference between Anthropic and everyone else is not proportionate.\n\nSo people really need to ask themselves if they really need Claude for either the sub or the APIs.\n\nAt this point, if you are writing some code that any AI company might be interested in stealing, then by all means stick to Claude or OpenAI (in case they are absolutely trustworthy). I hope no model is actually seeing any customer data to begin with.\n\nAnd if someone is really doing something that is so complicated that they feel only Claude can do it, then maybe, they either their employer or their revenue should be able to pay for it.\n\nFor everyone else, there are cheaper, and equally (in some cases, more) capable models.\n\nI have personally been weaning out my usage from Anthropic to GLM within Claude code. And at the same time, also moving my workflows to Opencode, for the day when Anthropic decides to also ban accounts for using other models in Claude code (I bet they are collecting those stats even when you are using a different model)\n\nAt this stage, I wouldn't care much, even if my account is banned. Since I moved to GLM, I haven't hit my Claude limits for 2-3 weeks. And already planning to move to $20 sub at the end of this month (already moved from 200 to 100 1.5 months ago)\n\nOr maybe, they will be happy that people who they were losing money on, are finally leaving.",

It’s structured, but flexible enough that I can reshape the whole plan whenever I get stuck or suddenly decide to deep-dive ownership at 2am.\n\nIt uses a pyramid-style method where each layer builds on the last, and I can expand it as I go. The repo basically becomes a living skill tree. Also, I get to ask all the “dumb” questions I’d never ask a human. No judgment. Just explanations until it finally clicks.\n\nLearning at my own pace, on my own time, has been way more comfortable, and honestly the speed is kind of wild. Rust went from intimidating to fun way faster than I expected.\n\nEdit:   \ntook down the link before, but happy to share it again, thanks for the support y'all!  \n[https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust](https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust)",

I knew I wanted to have different level of answers depending on how much detail I want, so I setup the \"pyramid method\" which is how news articles are written.  \nthen I started slowly to scaffold what a lesson is and what an exercise is, then added an \"ex-00\" which just gives me basic syntax to learn, and other exercises to teach the concepts.  \nI found myself learning by analogy (bun vs cargo, memory management in C...) so I told the agents file about my background so that it explain conxepts in a relevant manner.  \nanyhow, it's a moving process, but I hitnk it's getting better as I advance in lessons, happy to give you more detail if you want (pyramid method again haha).",
