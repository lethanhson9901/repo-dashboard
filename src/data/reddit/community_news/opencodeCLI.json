I’m able to build lots of code with agents forms in Kimi, which really builds the scaffolding for my projects from a code perspective, and then I throw in Codex to the heavy lifting, and I end with the Gemini CLI using Stich to polish off the UI. It’s been a pretty good workflow so far.",

And the results were very disappointing.\n\nDespite all these posts, videos and benchmarks stating how awesome minimax m2.5 is, it failed my test horribly given the same environment and prompt, that the others easily passed.\n\nMinimax kept hallucinating various solutions and situations that didn't make any sense. It didn't properly search online or utilized the available documentation properly. So, I wonder how all those benchmarks claiming minimax as some opus alternative actually made their benchmark.\n\nI saw a few other real benchmarks where Minimax M2.5 actually was way below Haiku 4.5 while GLM 5 and Kimi went above Sonnet 4.5; personally it felt like that as well. So at the increased price points from all these providers, its very interesting. Though neither are on opus or codex level.\n\nI did not test the same prompt with gemini, or couldn't test it, to be more precise due to circumstances. But I have a feeling Gemini 3 Pro would be similar to Kimi and GLM 5, maybe just a bit higher.\n\nWhat is your experience with Minimax compared to GLM and Kimi?",

Just scroll this page to see what i am talking about https://openrouter.ai/models 😄 The only real benchmark that one should follow is to try the models for himself and compare their performance on a given task.

Without that litigaiton, my human rights will continue to be violated. I'm currently dependent on Claude in Opencode for my agentic workflow. I live in fear that one day Anthropic will make Claude no longer work at all in OpenCode. What then? Kimi 2.5 I guess.\n\nWill I, as an America citizen, have to use Chinese AI to protect my civil and constitutional rights because Anthropic won't provide an effective, equitable, and dependable way for me to use Claude?\n\nThe reason I need OpenCode isn't out of preference, but necessity; no platform was providing the features I needed, so I must build it myself. I have to build my tools, and do my own litigation. It's a societal-wide failure; I need AI because no one is helping people like me with these legal or development problems.\n\nI think of my situation - between my mental and physical disabilities, the hardship of the rights violations, imposed poverty, and general abandonment by the legal community and nonprofits -  like I'm having to build a sand castle in the middle of a hurricane, while other people build on a sunny-day beach. Then people go out of their way to make it even harder for me to build, or try to destroy what I've built.\n\nI don't fear misaligned AI. I fear misaligned people.\n\nI really like and enjoy Claude, but I fear Anthropic is going to make Claude inaccessible to me; they seem intent on preventing users like me from having equitable, effective access to Claude in OpenCode. While showing no interest or intent to develop the features my workflow needs in Claude Code or CoWork.\n\nMeanwhile, an open-source model will always be accessible, even if less performant.\n\nThe world would be such a better place if entities like Anthropic would help people like me, instead of create friction and more problems.  It's nice to have AI agents that help me, but now the company who owns that AI is working to prevent Claude from being helpful to me.\n\nThe more I try to do my work, the more I end up documenting how totally screwed up everything is.\n\nThere's a lot more to consider than just price and performance when picking which AI you use.\n\nMy life-long severe disability makes me especially mindful of what I am dependent upon. If I don't have specific things, I get injured, badly.\n\nI've become dependent upon Claude, and any day now, it could just be gone. The fear of that day weighs heavily on me. I find it very disturbing that my safety and human rights are not being better served by U.S. AI companies.\n\nHow will OpenCode survive? By being one of a scarce few places where people like me can build a future our survival can depend on.",

      "text": "Everyone is mourning the free version of OpenCode Zen, but the real play is moving to MiniMax M2.5. It's the most reliable alternative to Opus I've found. It's a Real World Coworker that costs $1 an hour and hits SOTA benchmarks (80.2% SWE-Bench). I've seen people complain about M2.1 fixing linting instead of errors, but M2.5 is a massive upgrade in task decomposition. If you want the cheapest, most accurate model for your CLI, this is it. Their RL tech blog is a must-read for anyone looking to optimize their dev workflow.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been using OpenCode for heavier refactoring lately, but I keep hitting the wall where the native `Compaction` kicks in and the Agent basically gets a lobotomy. It forgets exact variable names, loses track of the files it just opened, and hallucinates its next steps.\n\nI got frustrated and spent the weekend building `opencode-working-memory`, a drop-in plugin to give the Agent a persistent, multi-tier memory system before the wipe happens.\n\nMy main goal was: **keep it simple and require absolutely zero configuration.** You just install it, and it silently manages the context in the background.\n\nHere is what the **Working Memory** architecture does automatically:\n\n1. **LRU File Pool (Auto-decay):** It tracks file paths the Agent uses. Active files stay \"hot\" in the pool, while ignored files naturally decay and drop out of the prompt, saving massive tokens.\n2. **Protected Slots (Errors & Decisions):** It intercepts `stderr` and important decisions behind the scenes, locking them into priority slots so the Agent never forgets the bug it's fixing or the tech choices it made.\n3. **Core Memory & Todo Sync:** It maintains persistent Goal/Progress blocks and automatically injects pending SQLite todos back into the prompt after a compaction wipe.\n4. **Storage Governance:** It cleans up after itself in the background (caps tool outputs at 300 files / 7-day TTL) so your disk doesn't bloat.\n\nNo setup, no extra prompt commands. It just works out of the box.\n\nIt's been working perfectly for my own workflow. I open-sourced it (MIT) in case anyone needs a plug-and-play fix: **Repo:**[https://github.com/sdwolf4103/opencode-working-memory]()\n\n*(Installation is literally just adding* `\"opencode-working-memory\"` *to your* `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` *plugin array and restarting—it downloads automatically!)*",

My implementation takes task implements it triggers my test plugin that just feeds errors back to keep context clean.

I needed something to fix the \"Session Amnesia\" that happens after a `Compaction` event, where the AI forgets the goal or the file structure.\n\nTo clarify the **7-day/300-file limit**: That is strictly for **temporary tool output caching** (just to keep your disk clean from thousands of `grep` results). It does **NOT** delete the actual memory.\n\nThe real \"brain\" lives in `memory-working.json`, which persists with your session:\n\n* It ranks files based on **\"Dynamic Attention\"**.\n* **Example:** If you switch tasks (e.g., from Backend to Frontend), the new files will naturally overtake the old ones in rank after about **7-8 mentions**.\n* The AI’s focus shifts automatically to what matters *now*, pushing irrelevant context down without you needing to manage it manually.\n\n**Regarding Cross-Project Memory:** You are totally right—global memory is the next logical step. I definitely hope to implement a \"Long Term Memory\" layer in the future to handle that cross-project experience!",

As you said, done on a weekend. \n\nOn the other hand many people do not use such tools. Maybe because these tools consume a lot of token themselves and perform often somewhere between unreliable and non-deterministic. Although it is zero config, you often need to remind the model to use it. \n\nSo I went over to write structured documentation and implementation-lists as many others did. I try to prevent to hit the context limit and start a clean session on every phase of the implementation-list. The DCP Plugin keeps the context size low and the structure is defined by agents, skills and templates.\n\nThat's working for me, but others may think different",

I'm not always disciplined enough to keep it clean!\n\n**Regarding DCP:** It’s a solid alternative, but as you noted, it really shines when you **start fresh sessions** frequently. If you use DCP in a long, continuous session, modifying history actually breaks **Prefix Caching**, so you lose the speed/cost benefits.\n\n**Also, a big reason for hitting limits:** I'm using GitHub Copilot, and their context cap for Claude seems to be about **half** of what you get directly from Anthropic.

          "text": "Hey OpenCode community,\n\nTL;DR: I’m building UnLoveable, a self-hosted Loveable/Bolt-style “prompt -> docs -> checklist -> agent swarm executes” builder on top of OpenCode. This repo already has a Next.js build UI (Monaco editor, file explorer, diffs, PTY terminal, orchestrator dashboard) talking to a Bun/Hono OpenCode server (SSE orchestrator events, file read/write, PTY websockets, multi-provider LLM). What I need help finishing: a real safe preview/sandbox (not just iframe-a-URL), reliable parallel worker isolation + merging, and better prompt-to-plan output quality so agents produce working code more consistently.\n\nHere’s how my Valentine’s Day went: sitting alone in my apartment in, Georgia, doomscrolling and thinking “why am I paying for yet another ‘AI builds your app’ tool when I’m literally surrounded by an agent runtime?”\n\nSo I snapped and started building a self-hosted alternative on top of OpenCode.\n\nWhat I built: UnLoveable\n\nA local-first “prompt → docs → plan → agent swarm executes while you watch” builder.\n\nIt’s not trying to be a magic SaaS website generator. The premise is: generate the planning artifacts first (spec/UI spec/architecture/registry/implementation plan/prompt), then have multiple OpenCode agents chew through the checklist with tests/validation, with a UI that lets you observe + intervene.\n\nCodebase tour (what’s actually in this repo)\n\n- web/: Next.js (React 19) app with a split-pane build UI (Monaco editor, diff viewer, orchestrator dashboard, SSE event console) + an xterm PTY terminal.\n\n- opencode/: Bun + Hono headless server exposing:\n\n- Orchestrator routes (/orchestrator/...) including SSE stream at /orchestrator/:id/event\n\n- File browser + read/write (/file, /file/content, /file/status)\n\n- PTY over WebSocket (/pty/:id/connect)\n\n- Provider plumbing via Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI + OpenAI-compatible + others)\n\n- workspace/: mounted project directory where generated docs/code live (see docker-compose.yml volume mounts).\n\n- Loop packs/templates: templates/unloveable/, unloveable_loop_v2/ (“Ralph Wiggum static-context loop”: checklist-driven, fresh context per iter, runlogs, validation profiles).\n\nWhat’s working right now\n\n- /build “IDE”: file explorer + Monaco edit/save via /file/content, diff viewer via /file/status, orchestrator panel for editing generated docs, terminal via /pty.\n\n- “Simple Mode” kickoff: start orchestrator → generate docs via pipeline → run checklist executor with configurable workers.\n\n- Real-time-ish updates: the UI listens to orchestrator SSE events and refreshes status/dashboards.\n\nWhere I’m stuck (and what I want help with)\n\n1.\t⁠Preview / sandboxing / “run what we built”\n\n- Current “Live Preview” is literally an iframe that loads a URL you paste (web/src/components/live-preview.tsx). It’s not a sandbox.\n\n- What I want: click “Preview” and it spins up the generated app (Vite/Next/etc.) in an isolated way, then embeds it reliably (ideally same-origin proxied) without CORS/postMessage misery or security footguns.\n\n2) Multi-worker isolation + merging back\n\n- The runner can parallelize tasks; when workers > 1 it tries to use git worktrees (opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts + worktree pool/merger).\n\n- I need battle-tested guidance on merge strategy + conflict handling + how to make parallel agents not trample each other (and what to do when the target workspace isn’t a git repo).\n\n3) Output quality (docs + plan → executable tasks)\n\n- Pipeline doc generation is currently a pretty bare prompt that returns JSON schema (opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts).\n\n- I need stronger prompting + post-processing so the implementation plan becomes “agent-executable” more consistently (right granularity, no deprecated libs, fewer dead-end tasks, better validation hooks).\n\nWhy I’m posting\n\nIt’s 3AM energy, but the bones feel real: OpenCode is already the hard part. This UI + orchestration layer is the missing “Bolt/Loveable experience” for people who want self-hosted + transparent + hackable.\n\nIf you want to dig in, the most relevant files:\n\n- docker-compose.yml\n\n- web/src/app/build/page.tsx\n\n- web/src/components/live-preview.tsx\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/orchestrator.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/file.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/pty.ts\n\nHow you can help\n\n- If you’ve solved “safe preview for untrusted/generated web code” in a product: tell me the architecture you’d use here.\n\n- If you’ve built parallel agent systems: I’d love opinions on worktree/branch/patch-based workflows + conflict resolution ergonomics.\n\n- If you’re good at prompt-to-plan reliability: help me tighten the pipeline so it produces better specs + checklists.\n\nRepo link: I’ll drop it once I push a cleaned snapshot (it’s currently living as this local codebase).\n\nIf you’ve ever rage-coded something at 2AM and thought “wait, this might actually be useful,” please chime in.\n\nThis version does not work yet, but has some much needed architecture changes\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/UnLoveable-parallel\n\nThis version works but has way too much logic in the frontend, and runs loops in series, so it is kinda slow.\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/unloveable-series",

No React, Vue, Alpine, etc.\n- **Static**: Must work as a static file (no server-side logic)\n- **Self-hostable**: Drop into Vercel as `index.html` or paste into CodePen\n\n### Quality Bar\n\nThis is NOT a simple landing page. It should feel like it was commissioned by a world-class brand agency. Include:\n\n**Visual craft:**\n\n- Scroll-triggered reveals with Intersection Observer (not scroll events -- use IO for performance)\n- Parallax depth on at least 2 layers (background moves slower than foreground)\n- Typography that has character -- mix of serif and sans, large display type with tight tracking\n- Color palette of 3-4 tones maximum, applied with intention (not rainbow)\n- Subtle animated texture or grain overlay via CSS (repeating SVG noise, pseudo-element with opacity)\n\n**Interaction:**\n\n- Cursor that responds subtly (not gimmicky -- a small dot or trail at most)\n- Hover states that feel intentional (transforms, not just color changes)\n- Navigation that changes opacity/style on scroll\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n- Hero section with large, centered typographic statement\n- At minimum 5 distinct sections with scroll transitions between them\n- Footer with subtle details (coordinates, a fictional address, a motto in a second language)\n- A moment of surprise -- one section that does something unexpected (inverted colors, a canvas animation, text that rearranges)\n- Scent \"notes\" (top/heart/base) revealed on scroll as floating pills\n- Canvas particle system simulating mist/smoke drifting upward\n- CSS blurs that shift as you scroll (backdrop-filter manipulation)\n\n**Polish details:**\n\n- `font-display: swap` on any web fonts\n- `will-change: transform` on animated elements\n- Smooth scroll behavior on `html`\n- Mobile-responsive (flexbox/grid, no fixed px widths on containers)\n- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for accessibility\n```",

One drawback is that you have to fight with it to work in parallel branches. Sometimes I just respawn a fresh GSD project with every new feature branch instead of dealing with the headaches.\n\nI will not use Claude CLI which regularly breaks inside vscode and is a pain to look at compared to Opencode. I am not a one-shot vibe coder, so change readability is quite important to me.

It doesn’t just give you \"alerts\"; it actually identifies and delivers exploits to prove where your vulnerabilities are.\n\n# Why this matters for OpenCode users:\n\nUntil now, Shannon was mostly a standalone powerhouse. With the **opencode-shannon-plugin**, you can now bake security auditing right into your agentic workflow.\n\n* **Security-First Vibe Coding:** Stop treating security as an afterthought.\n* **Autonomous Audits:** Let Shannon scan your PRs and local codebase for exploits before you ever hit \"merge.\"\n* **Zero Friction:** It integrates directly via the OpenCode plugin system.\n\n# How to get it:\n\nThe plugin is hosted on GitHub by **vichhka-git**: 👉[https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin](https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin)\n\n**Quick Install (usually):**\n\n1. Clone/Add the plugin to your `.opencode/plugin/` directory.\n2. Restart OpenCode.\n3. (Check the README for specific environment variables needed for the Shannon core).\n\nHuge props to the dev for making this bridge. It makes the \"full-stack\" agentic dream feel a lot more production-ready.\n\n**Has anyone tried running it against their current projects yet? Curious to see what kind of exploits it's catching in AI-generated code!**",

If you're looking for static code security auditing or SAST, this isn't it; if you need to pentest deployed applications, it might be useful.\n\nThis post conflates the original Shannon's capabilities (which DO include source code analysis for \"scan your PRs\") with this simplified plugin (which only does black-box network pentesting). The plugin author appears to have built a thin wrapper around Shannon's attack tools without implementing the source analysis capabilities that would make the \"scan your PRs\" claim true. Shrug.",

Found out, that saving tokens using Subs isn't that easy. Prompting this thoroughly is a piece of work on its own.\n\nAnyway, I thought it might be a good Idea to structure work and docs a bit better, so that I could easily start new sessions and work in the model's sweet spot below 128k - instead of hitting the compaction border like a vibe coder on regular basis.

They're cooking.\n\nNow we just need z-ai to sort their capacity issues out and re-issue more competitive pricing like they had before.\n\n\n\nAs for Kimi 2.5: it's a tad better than GLM 4.7 but weaker than GLM 5 in my testing. I sometimes wonder if making it multi-modal (which yields a massive-param-count model - trillion params) might've been a bad play for coding.

When I switched to GPT 5.3-Codex, the same task (with the same TDD approach) was finished in minutes without issues.\n\nIn my case, for coding, they seem to be on the same level as GPT-mini.\n\nI also used GLM5 to orchestrate agents; here it works pretty well.

I've only just started adding GLM 5 as subagent to my agentic workflow. \n\nIt's not proving itself to have any particular aptitudes so far. Combined with this problem with tool use, not looking good. Preliminary data, but still pertinent data.\n\nKimi 2.5 has surprisingly offered insights that all other models failed to provide. Particularly when it comes to systems-based thinking and scientific approaches to modeling problems and communicating findings.\n\nIt fails in many other ways that Opus succeeds at. But it's contributions, when it finds something the other don't, are really helpful in that additive way that makes everything better. ",

Since yesterday (version 1.2.0+), opencode migrated from storing sessions in JSON files to using a SQLite database. I’ve updated ocmonitor to support this change.\n\nI also added a hierarchy view to show subagents as part of the parent session, and monitoring of output rate (TPS) to give an indication of model performance.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or bug reports (preferably via GitHub). PRs and contributions are also welcome.  \n[https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share](https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share)",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a tool called **opencode-kanban** to manage multiple OpenCode sessions and Git worktrees.\n\nThe project is essentially a mixture of two existing concepts, aiming to fix the friction I felt with both:\n\n1. **The Functionality (vs. Agent of Empires):** Like [*Agent of Empires*](https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires), this manages multiple agents through tmux sessions. However, I built this because I found AoE a bit clunky for my daily workflow. I wanted something more ergonomic - offering more features like task tracking.\n2. **The Workflow (vs. Vibe Kanban):** I loved the visual organization of [*Vibe Kanban*](https://www.vibekanban.com/), but I didn't want to leave the terminal. This project brings that Kanban view (Todo/Doing/Done) directly into the CLI.\n3. **OpenCode-Only:** Most importantly, because this is built *exclusively* for OpenCode, it doesn't suffer from the friction of tools trying to support every agent out there. Tapping directly into the OpenCode API unlocks a much more tailored experience, giving you native features like automatic session attaching and built-in todo tracking.\n\n**The Result:** A TUI-first experience that lets you manage parallel work streams visually, while still allowing you to stick with the native OpenCode TUI inside auto-managed tmux sessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24kvmv98fdkg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9851e35ad1ddb7aef473b49b067887488f9581dc\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/qrafty-ai/opencode-kanban](https://github.com/qrafty-ai/opencode-kanban)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",
