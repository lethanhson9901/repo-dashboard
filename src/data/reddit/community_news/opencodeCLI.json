And the results were very disappointing.\n\nDespite all these posts, videos and benchmarks stating how awesome minimax m2.5 is, it failed my test horribly given the same environment and prompt, that the others easily passed.\n\nMinimax kept hallucinating various solutions and situations that didn't make any sense. It didn't properly search online or utilized the available documentation properly. So, I wonder how all those benchmarks claiming minimax as some opus alternative actually made their benchmark.\n\nI saw a few other real benchmarks where Minimax M2.5 actually was way below Haiku 4.5 while GLM 5 and Kimi went above Sonnet 4.5; personally it felt like that as well. So at the increased price points from all these providers, its very interesting. Though neither are on opus or codex level.\n\nI did not test the same prompt with gemini, or couldn't test it, to be more precise due to circumstances. But I have a feeling Gemini 3 Pro would be similar to Kimi and GLM 5, maybe just a bit higher.\n\nWhat is your experience with Minimax compared to GLM and Kimi?",

Subagent orchestration: After disabling a couple of MCP servers, it performed well, so I think it *does* struggle quite a bit with middle-of-the-road context bloat. Note that I almost always exhaust my context usage at the end of a session due to heavy research tasks.\n3. Inference: (I'm on ultra, so YMMV), Almost at par with Kimi K2.5 on Synthetic. Not blazing fast, but definitely an improvement over GLM 4.7 on Z.ai.\n\nIf you are keen to try it out, please check out the writeup above first.",

I've been using the opencode-antigravity-auth plug-in to use Claude with Antigravity because I've been running out of my Claude Max 20x weekly limit way too quickly, and I've been paying for Gemini ultra for $250 a month which I hardly used because I just didn't like Gemini 3 Pro nearly as much as I expected, so I thought it was safe to supplement my usage and take advantage of that subscription. I'm writing a letter of appeal to Google in hopes that they might grant me a pardon, but I don't expect much.\n\nI would cancel my Gemini subscription and pay Anthropic $400 a month instead if I could so I don't have to worry about running out of my Opus limits, but that's not even an option. Apparently it's against their terms of service to have two Max accounts, which is really lame. Now I'm being forced to use codex to supplement my addiction, but it's just not satisfying my itch. I guess I have to lean more on Kimi K2.5 and now GLM-5 as my fallbacks. What's a full-time independent developer to do? I've been going all in to take my commercial project I've been working on for so long to completion, can't slow down now...",

I’m using synthetic mainly because of the promo and so far it’s been noticeably faster than before. I might even stay after the promo expires since their service is a lot better compared to other providers. I feel more secure using it and I no longer want to explore other AI providers because it takes a lot of time and usually requires paying just to try their plans.\n\nThey recently added US-based servers, and one of them is using NVIDIA GPUs. I don’t really understand all the infra details, but performance-wise it’s definitely faster compared to their previous setup. Latency feels a lot better on my end.\n\nOne thing to note is that I think the standard plan is still on a waitlist right now, while the pro plan is available. If anyone wants to double-check, their discord is probably the best place. The devs are active there and they post updates about infra changes, issues and what they’re working on.\n\nIf you want to try it with the discounted offer:  \n[https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK](https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK)\n\nEdit: Based on what I’ve seen on their discord, they’re really focusing on improving and stabilizing the service with their new infra setup and servers. They plan to add glm-5 once the infrastructure can handle more users, since adding it too early would definitely flood the service and cause slowdowns.",

          "text": "Hey OpenCode community,\n\nTL;DR: I’m building UnLoveable, a self-hosted Loveable/Bolt-style “prompt -> docs -> checklist -> agent swarm executes” builder on top of OpenCode. This repo already has a Next.js build UI (Monaco editor, file explorer, diffs, PTY terminal, orchestrator dashboard) talking to a Bun/Hono OpenCode server (SSE orchestrator events, file read/write, PTY websockets, multi-provider LLM). What I need help finishing: a real safe preview/sandbox (not just iframe-a-URL), reliable parallel worker isolation + merging, and better prompt-to-plan output quality so agents produce working code more consistently.\n\nHere’s how my Valentine’s Day went: sitting alone in my apartment in, Georgia, doomscrolling and thinking “why am I paying for yet another ‘AI builds your app’ tool when I’m literally surrounded by an agent runtime?”\n\nSo I snapped and started building a self-hosted alternative on top of OpenCode.\n\nWhat I built: UnLoveable\n\nA local-first “prompt → docs → plan → agent swarm executes while you watch” builder.\n\nIt’s not trying to be a magic SaaS website generator. The premise is: generate the planning artifacts first (spec/UI spec/architecture/registry/implementation plan/prompt), then have multiple OpenCode agents chew through the checklist with tests/validation, with a UI that lets you observe + intervene.\n\nCodebase tour (what’s actually in this repo)\n\n- web/: Next.js (React 19) app with a split-pane build UI (Monaco editor, diff viewer, orchestrator dashboard, SSE event console) + an xterm PTY terminal.\n\n- opencode/: Bun + Hono headless server exposing:\n\n- Orchestrator routes (/orchestrator/...) including SSE stream at /orchestrator/:id/event\n\n- File browser + read/write (/file, /file/content, /file/status)\n\n- PTY over WebSocket (/pty/:id/connect)\n\n- Provider plumbing via Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI + OpenAI-compatible + others)\n\n- workspace/: mounted project directory where generated docs/code live (see docker-compose.yml volume mounts).\n\n- Loop packs/templates: templates/unloveable/, unloveable_loop_v2/ (“Ralph Wiggum static-context loop”: checklist-driven, fresh context per iter, runlogs, validation profiles).\n\nWhat’s working right now\n\n- /build “IDE”: file explorer + Monaco edit/save via /file/content, diff viewer via /file/status, orchestrator panel for editing generated docs, terminal via /pty.\n\n- “Simple Mode” kickoff: start orchestrator → generate docs via pipeline → run checklist executor with configurable workers.\n\n- Real-time-ish updates: the UI listens to orchestrator SSE events and refreshes status/dashboards.\n\nWhere I’m stuck (and what I want help with)\n\n1.\t⁠Preview / sandboxing / “run what we built”\n\n- Current “Live Preview” is literally an iframe that loads a URL you paste (web/src/components/live-preview.tsx). It’s not a sandbox.\n\n- What I want: click “Preview” and it spins up the generated app (Vite/Next/etc.) in an isolated way, then embeds it reliably (ideally same-origin proxied) without CORS/postMessage misery or security footguns.\n\n2) Multi-worker isolation + merging back\n\n- The runner can parallelize tasks; when workers > 1 it tries to use git worktrees (opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts + worktree pool/merger).\n\n- I need battle-tested guidance on merge strategy + conflict handling + how to make parallel agents not trample each other (and what to do when the target workspace isn’t a git repo).\n\n3) Output quality (docs + plan → executable tasks)\n\n- Pipeline doc generation is currently a pretty bare prompt that returns JSON schema (opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts).\n\n- I need stronger prompting + post-processing so the implementation plan becomes “agent-executable” more consistently (right granularity, no deprecated libs, fewer dead-end tasks, better validation hooks).\n\nWhy I’m posting\n\nIt’s 3AM energy, but the bones feel real: OpenCode is already the hard part. This UI + orchestration layer is the missing “Bolt/Loveable experience” for people who want self-hosted + transparent + hackable.\n\nIf you want to dig in, the most relevant files:\n\n- docker-compose.yml\n\n- web/src/app/build/page.tsx\n\n- web/src/components/live-preview.tsx\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/orchestrator.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/file.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/pty.ts\n\nHow you can help\n\n- If you’ve solved “safe preview for untrusted/generated web code” in a product: tell me the architecture you’d use here.\n\n- If you’ve built parallel agent systems: I’d love opinions on worktree/branch/patch-based workflows + conflict resolution ergonomics.\n\n- If you’re good at prompt-to-plan reliability: help me tighten the pipeline so it produces better specs + checklists.\n\nRepo link: I’ll drop it once I push a cleaned snapshot (it’s currently living as this local codebase).\n\nIf you’ve ever rage-coded something at 2AM and thought “wait, this might actually be useful,” please chime in.\n\nThis version does not work yet, but has some much needed architecture changes\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/UnLoveable-parallel\n\nThis version works but has way too much logic in the frontend, and runs loops in series, so it is kinda slow.\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/unloveable-series",

One drawback is that you have to fight with it to work in parallel branches.

I am not a one-shot vibe coder, so change readability is quite important to me. Solves the \"fix this issue no matter the cost or means\" situations.\n\nAn extra workflow that occasionally works for me is generating a concise spec + pass criteria with plan mode or GSD, then dump the plan into a ralph loop to brute force it.",

(Hope it's true) So I gave it a go.\n\nStill the context size restriction nags a bit, but I think maybe it is time to work less \"sloppy\". I created some workflow (Skills and Agents) for me to work intensively with subagents. Currently only for creating docs, onboarding projects and creating execution plans.\n\nI checked the billing and verified that my workflow only get charged one premium request per prompt, but in the background tools and subs are consuming a hell of a lot of tokens on single premium request.\n\nAre there any limits I shall take care of? I mean this could be really maxxed out by using the Question-Tool and Subagents etc. Dont wanna risk my companies Github Account.\n\nAny experience or hints ?\n\nEDIT: After someone posted about suspension I searched and found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if\\_you\\_create\\_a\\_long\\_todo\\_list\\_in\\_agent\\_mode\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if_you_create_a_long_todo_list_in_agent_mode_you/)  Very Interesting.

Found out, that saving tokens using Subs isn't that easy. Prompting this thoroughly is a piece of work on its own.\n\nAnyway, I thought it might be a good Idea to structure work and docs a bit better, so that I could easily start new sessions and work in the model's sweet spot below 128k - instead of hitting the compaction border like a vibe coder on regular basis.

It doesn’t just give you \"alerts\"; it actually identifies and delivers exploits to prove where your vulnerabilities are.\n\n# Why this matters for OpenCode users:\n\nUntil now, Shannon was mostly a standalone powerhouse. With the **opencode-shannon-plugin**, you can now bake security auditing right into your agentic workflow.\n\n* **Security-First Vibe Coding:** Stop treating security as an afterthought.\n* **Autonomous Audits:** Let Shannon scan your PRs and local codebase for exploits before you ever hit \"merge.\"\n* **Zero Friction:** It integrates directly via the OpenCode plugin system.\n\n# How to get it:\n\nThe plugin is hosted on GitHub by **vichhka-git**: 👉[https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin](https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin)\n\n**Quick Install (usually):**\n\n1. Clone/Add the plugin to your `.opencode/plugin/` directory.\n2. Restart OpenCode.\n3. (Check the README for specific environment variables needed for the Shannon core).\n\nHuge props to the dev for making this bridge. It makes the \"full-stack\" agentic dream feel a lot more production-ready.\n\n**Has anyone tried running it against their current projects yet? Curious to see what kind of exploits it's catching in AI-generated code!**",

If you're looking for static code security auditing or SAST, this isn't it; if you need to pentest deployed applications, it might be useful.\n\nThis post conflates the original Shannon's capabilities (which DO include source code analysis for \"scan your PRs\") with this simplified plugin (which only does black-box network pentesting). The plugin author appears to have built a thin wrapper around Shannon's attack tools without implementing the source analysis capabilities that would make the \"scan your PRs\" claim true. Shrug.",

Since yesterday (version 1.2.0+), opencode migrated from storing sessions in JSON files to using a SQLite database. I’ve updated ocmonitor to support this change.\n\nI also added a hierarchy view to show subagents as part of the parent session, and monitoring of output rate (TPS) to give an indication of model performance.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or bug reports (preferably via GitHub). PRs and contributions are also welcome.  \n[https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share](https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share)",

          "text": "I wrote this before in another post but I'll give you the breakdown. If you do things in smaller increments where the model doesn't have to keep building, fixing, and in turn making the context bloat. Just do small directed prompts by giving a file path makes me work on Claude pro plans all day and opencode with kimi 2.5 non stop all day for about $3-$4 but I mean alot of coding. I have let loose when I am lazy and let the model search around but have found out if you give full file.paths and limit it's scope it's better. Be specific on the prompt and the few things it should do. \n\nIn short The plan modes work real well with tight scope and don't let the context go to far as it gets sent again and again. For every new prompt. Start a new session for each file or few files that are related. It's so much faster as well. I do sometimes tell.it to browse my code and suggest things but that for assessments not getting tasks done.\n\nIf I wanted to get it down to less I would even use dumber models for simple refactors. Many cheaper models interpret and debug pretty well when given something to look at but very few models can write something new well. So preserve the refactor assessment document use cases in opencode to smaller parameter models. Now if your asking to write a whole app with it iterating and with context bloat it will burn tokens like a wild fire. \n\nAlso chatgpt free is excellent for code if you give it a full coding document and ask it to fix something. I use that for free and when I want to assess bugs etc. It usually fixes them. I leave sonnet,haiku,and kimi for more agentic coding. It's all about style. I have fit massive coding in the pro plan.

I cannot imagine why they could possibly work better there, but maybe models are just trained that way, so they \"know\" the tools etc? Anyone noticed anything like that?",

          "text": "This is what people mean when they say \"the harness\". Using it in codex means you get the bare bones experience. Not bad but it just means it isn't fine tuned to work specifically for coding /what you would want for coding at least. \n\nThere's a concern for over engineering but that's why things are open source. Claudecode for example has a lot of changes to its system prompt to work well for everything Claude code will try to do like call mini agents and tools during it's execution. Codex afaik actually has nothing but I could be wrong. GitHub copilot has its own too supposedly tuned for multi model workflows, and opencode has their own as well.\n\nImo all models work better in opencode. Sometimes this changes with select models, but it's a safe bet just to use opencode.",
