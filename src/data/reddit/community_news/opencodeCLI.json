I'll run out of weekly/monthly quota after a couple of days with basically any kind of programming work.  \n  \nQuota usage seems to depend on the token count and the model's API usage price, not just on the number of requests. Requests with large contexts or more generated tokens deplete the quota faster. The requests show up in the Zen usage history as usual with some per-request costs. My request history page shows that I've used $1.38 worth of requests with the Go subscription, and I'm already at 6% of my monthly quota.

You're right about the NVIDIA loophole - now that they swapped the non-renewing 1000-credit cap for per-minute rate limits, it's a great resource.\n\nThat said, I'd highly recommend adding a quality/eval filter, rather than just sorting by latency and uptime. I found that optimizing for speed over quality is a trap with these free tiers. Many of the fastest models will hallucinate, fail tool calls, or completely ignore instructions. For example, my benchmarks showed models like Minimax-2.5 consistently mutilating code (e.g., quietly changing hyphens to underscores in variables).\n\nIf you adjust your agent/tool to evaluate and filter models based on actual coding performance and instruction-following - not just ping times - this could be incredibly useful. Right now, sending users to the top 20 fastest models might just result in a lot of frustrating debugging sessions.",

You can't verify your account at [build.nvidia.com](http://build.nvidia.com) because their sms otp stuff to verify you is broken and has been for months and months.  There's hundreds of community discussions about it on Nvidia's developer forum.  It's been over 6 months for me and I've been trying every few weeks.  And without a verified account, you can't generate an API key.  \n\nThe most valuable company in the history of the world has been sitting on this bug for over 6 months.  If they wanted it fixed, it would be fixed.  Instead, the nvidia employees just tell people to email support for manual verification.

Make it accessible over network\n\nTo use with Tailscale, bind to all interfaces and set a password:\n\nopencode web --host [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0) \\--port 4096\n\nSet a password for security:\n\nexport OPENCODE\\_SERVER\\_PASSWORD=\"your-password\"\n\nopencode web --host [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0)\n\n3. Connect via Tailscale\n\n1. Ensure Tailscale is running on both machines\n\n2. Find your Tailscale IP: tailscale ip -4\n\n3. Access from another machine at http://<tailscale-ip>:4096\n\n4. Optional: Enable HTTPS with Caddy or nginx reverse proxy\n\nFor encrypted traffic over Tailscale, you can set up a simple reverse proxy, or just use Tailscale's built-in encryption (it already encrypts all traffic).\n\nNote: Tailscale's network is already encrypted, so the OPENCODE\\_SERVER\\_PASSWORD provides app-level authentication. Make sure to set a strong password if exposing to network access.",

The price is pretty good for what you get, but from what I've understood and talked to Alibaba support, you get only one endpoint and it's Singapore/global. I don't know if they change your main server based on API calls (as their panel has options for Singapore/US/China), but you by yourself can't really change it (correct me if I'm wrong, please).\n\nSpeed is meh. I was using Synthetic before, but after changes in subscriptions to weird subscription packs, they lost me on that. But comparing them to each other, Synthetic wasn't ultra-fast, but Alibaba seems to be even slower sometimes.\n\nAnd there is some weird behavior with Kimi for sure, some weird loops that I didn't get with any other provider and didn't even think that Kimi can go for loops like this. I'm hoping that it will be a little bit better after some time.\n\nQwen's models in this subscription seem solid. Can't say anything on MiniMax and GLM because I didn't use them too much yet, but one subagent run MiniMax and for now didn't go into some strange loops.\n\n",

When you read the thinking output it’s like “wow, this thing thinks like a lead developer” but when you see the solution you realise it’s better at communicating than coding.\n\nGemini 3.1 however seems to think and blab on about tool selection incessantly but created something amazing that wasn’t even on my radar and solves my problem in both a technically superior way and is about 50x cheaper to run.\n\nCodex is somewhere between Gemini and Claude and with the insane limits at the moment is a true workhorse.\n\nThen if you’re into the “run 20 Opencode instances 24/7” kind of crowd then having Kimi 2.5 on your Black plan do the grunt work means you’ll struggle to hit the limit of a Zen&Codex Max plan.\n\nIf you have less than $50 a month budget I’d get the cheapest Codex plan and top the rest up with Kimi credit or the cheapest Zen Black plan.",

The models seem to handle context and logic particularly well in it, especially when using the Plan agent first and then switching to Build.\n\nEven before Openclaw became popular, I kept thinking how useful it would be to access OpenCode from my phone. I noticed OpenCode has a server mode, which meant building a custom client was totally doable. Initially, I just wanted to write a simple Telegram bot for my own needs. But, as it usually goes, I got carried away, added more features, and eventually decided to open-source the project.\n\nI definitely won't call it \"fully functional\" yet - there are still rough edges. However, it currently has enough features to be used for actual development.\n\nHere is what works right now:\n\n* Switching between projects and sessions.\n* Selecting the agent, model, and variant (reasoning effort).\n* Tracking the agent's progress on a task.\n* Receiving code diffs directly in the chat as text files.\n\nIronically, I'm now at the point where I use the bot to write code for the bot itself. It’s a pretty great feeling to lie on the couch, watch a TV series, and casually send dev tasks to the agent via Telegram on my phone.\n\nI plan to keep actively developing the project since I use it daily. If anyone wants to try it out, the repo is here: [https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot](https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot)\n\nI would be really grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or suggestions!",

      "text": "I saw this provider a lot in reddit. Some guys keep promoting it and i got hooked.  20 USD a month, x3 Claude Usage ,  no weekly limits.  Too good to be true. However,  there are a problems with the provider: \n\n 1.  **Standard Plan 5 hour  limit is  x3 of Claude Pro Plan:**   Maybe this is correct in theory, but in practice not at all.  Maybe due to caching or another reason,   the plan hits the limit pretty quickly.  Also I believe Chinese models can be inefficient with the tool calling  hence,   Standard Plan 5 hour limit is same as  Codex/Claude  20 USD plan.  \n  \n2. **Impractial Usage:**  Since  for a regular coding task you will hit  5 hour limit pretty quickly on their standard model , having no weekly limit has no advantages for the developers at all.  The existing plan is actually made for the abusers , which is funny cause the provider keep complaining about some accounts abusing their system while  they are the one actually allowing it in the first place.  Cause the provider is  for  bots  not for regular developer.\n\n3. **Price Increase:**  They increased the price  from  20 USD to **30 USD** for standard plan last night . Their ratioanle is  \"They need a lot of compute\".  But the reason for the need for compute is  that, their bad planning.  There's no way an everyday  coder/user can abuse this system,  you need to be  24/7 online, which means this for bots and bots are abusing it but they want everyone to pay for it. \n\n**4. Delayed model release:**   Even  opencode was serving GLM5 , Minimax M2.5 and Kimi K2.5  for **free.** And as of today, they are still not serving  GLM5 and Minimax M2.5  only  K2.5.  They are using the same excuse ;   shorteage of compute/GPUs.\n\n  \nI already cancelled my subscription. Just shariing this so that , you don't fall for their false advertisement on reddit as i did.

I understand their marketing but it doesn't make a ton of sense to directly compare them to claude. They are hosting free OSS models for you.\n\nMy prediction by the end of the year is that the buffet-style AI plans from the big guys are either going to get killed or massively nerfed as they try to make the the numbers make sense. Synth doesn't have the luxury of bottomless investment money so they are making that adjustment now",

So the title here irks me the wrong way \"stay away\" etc. Also, I do not think they have been doing much advertising (I may be wrong) but rather users have recommended them (I have done it a few times in comments). It is a very small company and they are bending over backwards to make the leading open weight models work well from the harnesses we like the most like Claude Code and Opencode etc. I started with the $20 which IMHO was much harder to run out of than the Anthropic Pro subscription. Then I upped to the $60 option which gave 10x and I never ever came close running out. But as Synthetic have clearly admitted, it was a non sustainable plan. I think the new plan scheme with \"packs\" is a good idea and I have every trust in that they are honestly trying to find a model that works well.  \n  \nAnyway, I am super happy with their service, they are extremely helpful and very transparent in what they do. I use mainly Kimi K2.5, Minimax M2.5 and a bit of Deepseek 3.2/GLM4.7. And I use it purely for coding. Just my 2c, felt this thread was... oddly negative given mine and many others experiences. :) ",

However, if you need fast results, it’s definitely not a good option.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see what the limits look like for the new Open Zen Go subscription.

As 5h caps might be low or high, i don't care but what will stop you from progressing with your projects is a weekly cap suddenly hit after 3 days. and then you're done.   \ncan't be compared to gh copilot or anything monthly based quota as the quota amount provided by synthetic will be indefinitely higher than gh copilot pro.   \nalso the reasoning is not 'they need more gpu' but rather 'they need to make the plan fair for everyone' - if you'd read the announcement correctly then it'd be probably clear (or copy paste it into some ai to explain to you). It still makes a ton of sense for developers as you still get 135 prompts per 5h which is really hard to cap these out working on some serious projects and not just pushing idiotic prompts blindly around to force the ai to progress. And also it makes total sense for me to set the change so I as a dev can receive 80tps+ on kimi k2.5 because the infra doesn't struggle with openclaw bots just abusing the system to the very limit. And not gonna lie - their previous limit of 1.35k prompts per 5h sounded great on paper, but i always wondered how they can sustain it as I as dev even running parallel sessions was able to maye reach 400 prompts usage per 5h max - and yet some people abused the pro plan to very last token.

          "text": "considering majority of accessible providers, especially when we talk about budget friendly:  \n\\- kimi via their coding plan is a big joke, but can be 'abused' for 0.99$ subscriptions. However they're on 3x usage quota right now till 'who knows when' and it's a joke as even lightweight work can cap out 5h quota in 1.5h and each 5h quota is 20% of weekly quota. You can rotate a few accounts tho easily  \n\\- glm via official api seems to be probably smartest out of these 3, best when it comes to actual frontend design and picking up logic tasks quite well. The main issue is that official api is generally slow / very slow for 95% of the time (and im EU based...) and other providers are having either quite low quota allowance or doesn't host it at all. Can't wait till synthetic provides it still (btw when they open the waitlist gates remember about [referral discount](https://synthetic.new/?referral=IDyp75aoQpW9YFt))  \n**have in mind that both kimi and glm via official api have weekly caps** which are quite.. low in both cases. GLM is better than kimi tho.  \n\\- minimax m2.5 via the minimax provider is my go-to for now, as it's reliable enough to develop 95% of usual work (i run amp free when i really need opus 4.6 for some super complex debugging) and also it has the -highspeed variant which is insanely fast as it provides constant 100tps. So for my fast paced workflow of ideate > plan > develop > review > fix > merge it's great, as minimax's speed vs kimi / glm both as a model and provider is a big win here. Also they still host [10% discount via reflinks aswell ](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan?code=HO46LCwAJ5&source=link)\\- can recommend. Also **there is no weekly cap** and they say it's 100 / 300 / 1000 / 2000 prompts per 5h but the main pros of minimax system are:  \n\\- their 5h windows are fixed (00 - 05 am / 5 - 10 / 10 - 3pm / 3-8 / 8 - 11:59:59 pm) > which might sound as not like a big deal but you can basically start working at 8am, code for 2h and even if you'd get anywhere close to the cap - the limit resets at 10 so you can move forward with your work. It's IMO **way better system** than rolling 5h window as you know when to expect a reset so can potentially plan upfront.   \n\\- their system says as prompts, but what they don't say on the pricing page is that each prompt is at least 15-20 model calls - so even the 10$ (9 with discount) plan allows to do a **ton of coding**. I'm right now at 40$ highspeed plan, spinning 3 agents all the time and using their api for one of my SaaS and can't cap it out really through the day.   \nHave in mind that with 3 agents and highspeed minimax usually the human in the loop is worst piece of the whole system and workflow. :) ",

As for Kimi and GLM, Kimi is more reliable on \"fragile\" tasks where failed tool calls can derail the whole tasks (e.g. frameworks like GSD where each step must produce artifacts that later steps depend on). It sometimes decide to stop where it is not supposed to, but it is fairly easy to fix. GLM seems to be more intelligent and can solve more complex problems \"from scratch\" (basically using bare prompts), but it does not seem to be very reliable with tool calls, and will eventually start hallucinating tools or generating nonsensical texts if the task goes on for too long.\n\nI don't think I have enough evidence to tell which one works better generally, but for now I would prefer Kimi for orchestrated workflows and GLM for adhoc / interactive use. When trying popular prompting frameworks, GSD works better with Kimi (GLM derails in fully automated tasks), and OAC works better with GLM (Kimi impersonates user and fills user questions automatically).",

I mainly used AI to save myself the trouble of looking through the documentation or to discuss errors and ideas.    \nI want to use opencode because I don't want a vendor lock and I like the idea to use any model that ich want.   \nI would also like to use an open source model, but I can't decide for a plan. \n\nWhat's the best open source model for opencode ? Is NanoGPT with the 8 dollar plan good ? Maybe [https://z.ai/subscribe](https://z.ai/subscribe) ? \n\nOr pay only my real use with a api key from [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) or [https://opencode.ai/docs/zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen)\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences. :)\n\nLg ",

      "text": "I posted a few weeks ago about a very early build of my OpenCode plugin. I've iterated on it every day multiple times a day since then until we are here now with version 6.11. See below for a general guide on what it is and why it could help you. This comparison was built using Perplexity Computer over multiple iterations doing extensive market research on other plugins and capabilities.  \n  \nI've been working on opencode-swarm for a while now and figured I'd share what it actually does and why it exists.\n\nThe short version: most multi-agent coding tools throw a bunch of agents at your codebase in parallel and hope for the best. That works fine for demos. It falls apart on real projects where a bad merge or a missed security hole costs you a week of debugging.\n\nopencode-swarm does the opposite. One task at a time. Every task goes through a full QA gauntlet before the next one starts. Syntax validation (tree-sitter across 9 languages), static security analysis (63+ OWASP rules), placeholder/slop detection, secret scanning, lint, build check, then a reviewer on a *different model* than the coder, then a test engineer that writes both verification AND adversarial tests against your code. Only after all of that passes does the plan move forward.\n\nThe agents aren't generic workers either. There are 9 of them with actual permission boundaries. The Explorer can't write code. The SME can't execute anything. The Critic only reviews plans. The Architect owns the plan and delegates everything. Nobody touches what they shouldn't.\n\nSome stuff that took a lot of iteration to get right:\n\n* **Critic gate**: the plan gets reviewed by a separate agent before any code gets written. Prevents the most expensive failure mode, which is perfectly executing a bad plan\n* **Heterogeneous models**: coder and reviewer run on different LLMs on purpose. Different models have different blind spots, and this catches stuff single-model setups miss\n* **Retrospectives**: at the end of each phase, execution metrics (revisions, rejections, test failures) and lessons learned get captured and injected into the architect's prompt for the next phase. The swarm actually learns from its own mistakes within a project\n* **Everything persists**: plan.json, [context.md](http://context.md), evidence bundles, phase history. Kill your terminal, come back tomorrow, pick up exactly where you left off\n* **4,008 tests** on the plugin itself. Not the projects it builds. On the framework\n\nThe tradeoff is real. It's slower than parallel approaches. If you want 5 agents banging out code simultaneously, this isn't that. But if you've ever had an AI tool generate something that looked right, passed a vibe check, and then blew up in production... that's the problem this solves.\n\n**How it compares to other stuff out there**\n\nThere's a lot of multi-agent tooling floating around right now so here's how I see the landscape:\n\n**Swarm Tools (opencode-swarm-plugin)** is the closest competitor and honestly a solid project. Their focus is speed through parallelism: break a task into subtasks, spawn workers, file reservations to avoid conflicts. They also have a learning system that tracks what strategies worked. Where we differ is philosophy. Their workers are generic and share the same model. Mine are specialized with different models on purpose. They have optional bug scanning after the fact. I have 15+ QA gates that run on every single task before it moves on. If you want fast, go Swarm Tools. If you want verified, this is the one.\n\n**Get Shit Done (GSD)** is more of a meta-prompting and spec-driven framework than a true multi-agent system. It's great at what it does: interviews you, builds a detailed spec, then executes phase by phase. It recently added parallel wave execution and subagent orchestration. But it doesn't have a persistent QA pipeline, no security scanning, no heterogeneous models, and no evidence system. GSD is a planning tool that got good at execution. opencode-swarm is a verification system that happens to plan and execute.\n\n**Oh My OpenCode** gets a lot of attention because of the RPG theming and the YouTube coverage. Six agents with fun names, easy to set up, approachable. But when you look under the hood it's basically prompt engineering. No persistent state between sessions. No QA pipeline. No security analysis. No test suite on the plugin itself. It's a good entry point if you've never tried multi-agent coding, but it's not something I'd trust on a production codebase.\n\n**Claude Code Agent Teams** is native to Claude Code, which is a big advantage since there's no plugin to install. Peer-to-peer messaging between agents is cool architecturally. But it's still experimental with known limitations: no session resumption, no built-in QA, no evidence trail. Running multiple Opus-class agents in parallel also gets expensive fast with zero guarantees on output quality.\n\n**Codex multi-agent** gives you a nice macOS GUI and git worktree isolation so agents don't step on each other. But the workflow is basically \"agents do stuff in parallel branches, you manually review and merge.\" That's just branch management with extra steps. No automated QA, no verification, no persistence beyond conversation threads.\n\nThe common thread across all of these: none of them answer the question \"how do you know the AI's output is actually correct?\" They coordinate agents. They don't verify their work. That's the gap opencode-swarm fills.\n\nMIT licensed: [https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm](https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture or any of the design decisions.",

Or if its a smaller project the other two swarms can handle it themselves.\n\nTLDR I would recommend a minimum of two models NOT by the same company (i.e. dont do Qwen3.5 and also Qwen3 Coder. The plugin prompts are about as good as they can be, but no prompt will solve a blind spot caused by training data. Only a different data set can solve that.",

You can set up a single swarm, multiple swarms, a swarm that is all one model, and there is a defaults file that it will fall back to if necessary, although by default it just falls back to whatever model you set as the orchestrator. The most important part you want to be absolutely sure of is that the antagonistic agents are using different models. So Coder and Reviewer, Architect and Critic. You can prompt engineer all you want but if its the same model it will make the same mistakes. Two models trained on two different data sets will find problems that homogeneous setups miss.\n\nFor an example, I have one swarm called \"laptop\" that I run on my Ryzen AI Max 395+ 128gb system when I'm traveling.

I usually kick a project off with Mega and then let one of the other swarms take over. Or if its a smaller project the other two swarms can handle it themselves.\n\nThe last piece that is critical is generating an implementation plan BEFORE you get into OpenCode. I use Perplexity, Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, QwenChat, etc via web chat to bounce ideas off each other until I can generate a single agreed upon implementation plan that is written specifically for the swarm workflow. I then pop it in the directory and tell the architect to implement. This saves a huge amount of API calls just nailing down the plan itself without doing any actual work.",

But honestly, I find its documentation extremely verbose without getting anywhere.\n\nI’m not a vibe coder, I’m a software engineer, and I had to read it three times and still only figured out how to use it by, well… using it.\n\nThe project seems very good at first glance, but being good is not enough if people simply don’t know how to use it, what it’s for, how it actually works… But even worse, what it is. Again, I, a technical professional, had to read it three times and still didn’t understand.\n\nA vibe coder or someone seriously entering the field will try to read it three times and won’t have the knowledge to explore it on their own, they’ll just give up.\n\nAt the moment, my concerns are more about communication than technical aspects. I need to test it much more, I’ll integrate it into the workflow of smaller projects at my company and see how it performs.\n\nI liked the suggestion of using models from different companies for tasks like QA, that perspective is usually ignored in this kind of workflow and you were spot on there, congratulations. There’s no point in asking the GLM to verify whether the code it wrote is good, it’s the same as asking me if the code I wrote is good, my answer will be “obviously, I wrote it.”\n\nNow a question: I know they’re different proposals but the end goal is the same, how do you position yourself in relation to the GitHub Spec Kit? Yours feels much more “vibe coder vibe” (sorry for the pun), Spec Kit involves a lot of manual action and direct user inference, yours seems more automated, fine, different proposals. But have you compared the final results both methods produce? It seems like something interesting to analyze.\n\nIn any case, I hope to see this project evolve further over time.

I bounce between Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, QwenChat, Deepseek, all via their web chat and build a single implementation plan they all agree on. I give all of them a gitingest of my swarm plugin so they understand the workflow and can build the implementation plan specifically for it. AFAIK spec kit stops when it comes to creating actual code, which is where this plugin picks it up. It is about creating the highest quality code possible, but it can still be impacted by garbage in garbage out.

              "text": "I actually went back and forth with Perplexity about this a few days ago. The below was the result.  \n  \nShort version: it uses about 3-5x more tokens per task than base OpenCode or Claude Code. Every task goes through architect, coder, reviewer, and test engineer instead of one agent doing everything, so yeah, more tokens.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe QA gates (syntax checking, SAST, secret scanning, build verification, placeholder detection) all run locally. No LLM calls. That stuff is free. Meanwhile Claude Code users are regularly posting about burning 10% of their weekly quota on a single plan-mode message because context just spirals.\n\nSerial execution helps too. Only one agent is loaded at a time. Claude Code's Agent Teams run at 7x overhead according to Anthropic's own docs because every teammate keeps its own full context window open.\n\nThe retrospective system also pays for itself over time. The swarm learns from past mistakes so you get fewer rework cycles, which is where most people actually waste tokens.\n\nWhere it genuinely costs more: simple stuff. A one-line typo fix still runs through the full pipeline. That's overkill and I know it.\n\nQuick comparison:\n\n* Base OpenCode/Claude Code: 1x (no review, no testing, no security scanning)\n* GSD: roughly 1x (single agent, good context isolation, but no verification)\n* Oh-My-OpenCode: 2-3x (subagents with lean context, less enforcement)\n* Claude Code Agent Teams: 7x (per Anthropic's docs)\n* opencode-swarm: 3-5x (code comes out reviewed, tested, and security scanned)\n\nThe way I think about it: what matters is cost per correct line of code, not cost per task. If you're spending tokens on rework because nothing got reviewed, you're paying anyway. The swarm just moves that cost upfront into verification instead of after the fact into debugging.",

Level 1 loads the `name` \\+ `description` of **every** skill into the system prompt at startup. With 2,004 skills, that's **\\~80,000 tokens consumed before I even type a prompt** \\- roughly 40% of a 200K context window.\n\n# The fix: SkillPointer\n\nIt's not a plugin or library. It's an **organizational pattern** that works with native skills:\n\n1. Move all 2,004 raw skills to a hidden vault directory (outside the agent's scan path)\n2. Replace them with 35 lightweight \"category pointer\" skills\n3. Each pointer tells the AI: \"use `list_dir` and `view_file` to browse the vault and find the exact skill you need\"\n\nResult:\n\n||Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Startup tokens|\\~80,000|\\~255|\n|Skills accessible|2,004|2,004|\n|Reduction|\\-|99.7%|\n\nThe AI still accesses every skill - it just discovers them on-demand using file tools it already has, instead of loading all descriptions at startup.\n\n# How I verified this\n\n* Measured actual YAML frontmatter sizes from all 2,004 [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) files\n* Confirmed the `<available_skills>` loading behavior in [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) and [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)\n* Real data from my own environment, not theoretical numbers\n\n# Repo\n\n[github.com/blacksiders/SkillPointer](https://github.com/blacksiders/SkillPointer)\n\nIncludes a zero-dependency Python setup script that auto-categorizes your skills and generates the pointers.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the approach. I know \"it's just skills organizing skills\" - that's literally the point. The value is in the pattern, not the tech. savings in scale.",

You absolutely nailed the dilemma, but you actually read my mind, I'm not skipping vector search entirely, I’m just layering it.\n\nI use FAISS+Langchain and a custom Qdrant MCP at different layers under the hood (since Cursor/VS Code have built-in indexers by default anyway).\n\nThe problem with pure RAG/Vector DB lookups at the *top* level is semantic failure. If I ask a pure RAG setup to 'Build a stretchy IK arm', it pulls the IK node and all connected if you know those DBS can have up to 700+ vrctors, but misses the 'Naming Conventions' file because the mathematical overlap just isn't there.\n\nSo I use SkillPointer as a strict text router to force a custom dependency map first. This mixed, layer-by-layer approach saves massive tokens. Once inside the routed skill, the AI can trigger the Qdrant MCP for semantic search if it actually needs to deep-dive into the docs.\n\nAs you probably know, MCP is a context vampire and gives you 'auto-compact', where you loosing details and moving you closer to hallucinations. If you have hundreds of tools/skills active, MCP will literally eat 80% of your context window just defining the JSON schemas.\n\nBy putting SkillPointer's strict text routing in front, I shield the AI from that MCP bloat. The AI only loads the schema for the *one* tool it actually needs at that exact moment, rather than choking on the entire protocol dictionary.\n\nIn the end, it's all about ruthlessly optimizing context limits to prevent hallucinations in complex tasks.

Code of idea is open and you can see examples and improve them for your specific needs.\n\nBut the real safeguard is the AI itself. Because the Pointers are incredibly token-cheap (just a few sentences), the agent will naturally trigger multiple pointers simultaneously if a task is ambiguous. But it also can skip most of them, depends on approach and rules llm follows.\n\nIf I ask for a 'secure React native login', the AI will hit the Security, Mobile, and Web-Dev pointers all at once, scan those three specific hidden vaults, and find the skill wherever the script dropped it. The gateways are so cheap it can afford to double-check, main thing if you have -60 token avarage description for all 2000 skills in context, it's just massive.  \n  \nTo be clear, I’m not trying to sell this as a universal ‘best’ pattern or some magic skill standard. I’m just sharing one concrete way I’ve been optimizing context usage in a messy, real pipeline so the agent doesn’t drown in skills metadata and start hallucinating.

I must say I am impressed.  I managed in a couple hours to implement from scratch a small game with Rust+Ratatui, just giving interactive directions on what I wanted ( no coding suggestions or such ) and running the resulting program to see if it worked ( 95% it worked at first attempt, the remaining 5% it was able to fix the issues at second attempt ).\n\nAt work, we cannot use these tools extensively, because we cannot expose our company software to the internet for obvious reasons, so we just use LLMs to search for ideas and suggestions on how to do things with technology we are not familiar with. Which is a pity, since tools like these  would speed up development significantly. I work for a large international company, which probably can and will build its own AI infrastructure (or rent something with the proper legal restrictions in place) . But as many big companies it will move slow, and maybe I will retire first.\n\nWell, I can say I have lived almost the whole arc of human software programming, from punch cards to AI coding agents ;-)  \n\nI wish my younger collegues lots of fun with these new toys and don't worry, there will be always work for people willing to use their brain and their experience to try and use new tools.",
