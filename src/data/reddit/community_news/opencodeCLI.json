      "text": "I’ve been using Claude Code pretty heavily for day-to-day work. It’s honestly one of the first coding agents I’ve trusted enough for real production tasks.\n\nThat said, once you start using it *a lot*, some tradeoffs show up.\n\nCost becomes noticeable. Model choice matters more than you expect. And because it’s a managed tool, you don’t really get to see or change how the agent works under the hood. You mostly adapt your workflow to it.\n\nOut of curiosity, I started testing OpenCode (Got Hyped up from X & reddit TBH). Didn’t realize how big it had gotten until recently. The vibe is very different.\n\nClaude Code feels guarded and structured. It plans carefully, asks before doing risky stuff, and generally prioritizes safety and predictability.\n\nOpenCode feels more like raw infrastructure. You pick the model per task. It runs commands, edits files, and you validate by actually running the code. More control, less hand-holding.\n\nBoth got the job done when I tried real tasks (multi-file refactors, debugging from logs). Neither “failed.” The difference was *how* they worked, not whether they could.\n\nIf you want something managed and predictable, Claude Code is great. If you care about flexibility, cost visibility, and owning the workflow, OpenCode is interesting.\n\nI wrote up a longer comparison [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/opencode-the-best-claude-code-alternative) if anyone wants the details.",

OpenCode’s flow is already so rigid (with task management being handled in the conversation), and Superpowers expects the full lifecycle of its skills to complete a task, and doesn’t wrap up things if you get interrupted.\n\nThat being said, I like using Superpowers in CC with Opus for brainstorming and planning, and then having it write to files that I can pick up and continue to work with in OpenCode with Codex for implementation/testing/review.\n\nPerfect?

They haven't published any information about how their quotas will work, and they probably won't have any of that nailed down until after the service goes live for everyone.\n\nOpenAI seems friendly towards the OpenCode community, and I'm always hearing people say how plentiful their quotas are compared to Anthropic.

The math flips depending on what you're actually doing.\n\nFor agentic work with lots of tool calls and iterations, K2.5 handles the volume. For single-shot complex reasoning where you need one good answer, GPT 5.2 pays for itself in fewer retries.\n\nSo rather than Black 20 + another sub, you could route at the task level: classify incoming requests by complexity and let a cheap router model decide. OpenRouter and similar services support this natively. Cuts costs 30-40% without degrading quality on the tasks that matter.",

Does caching work (that helps a lot with speed)? \n\nIn my experience, having paid for the $20 Synthetic plan for a few months now, Synthetic is faster and more stable --- and the inference is higher-quality --- for their self hosted models (GLM 4.7, Kimi K2T, etc) than any other provider. Currently, they're proxying K2.5 to Fireworks.AI while they get their infrastructure and hardware ready to run it, so it's not nearly as reliable in tool calling as their general capabilities, but it's still faster and more stable than other services I've tried (to be fair, I haven't tried any of the Big Three --- Gemini, Claude, or GPT Codex). \n\nAlso, OpenCode is pretty API call efficient; when I was still using it, the 135 API calls provided by the $20/mo Synthetic plan felt like more than enough. If you have an agent that uses a lot more API requests, like the Zed Agent, you can start to run up against the limits more often if you've got, like, several agents running, or having them run in a really really tight loop where they output and do very little per API call, but for general usage even in more token-heavy agents, it takes some heavy nonstop usage to hit the limit within their 5 hour window. Their limits are more generous than what the Claude Code subscription gives you, for instance.",

It’s structured, but flexible enough that I can reshape the whole plan whenever I get stuck or suddenly decide to deep-dive ownership at 2am.\n\nIt uses a pyramid-style method where each layer builds on the last, and I can expand it as I go. The repo basically becomes a living skill tree. Also, I get to ask all the “dumb” questions I’d never ask a human. No judgment. Just explanations until it finally clicks.\n\nLearning at my own pace, on my own time, has been way more comfortable, and honestly the speed is kind of wild. Rust went from intimidating to fun way faster than I expected.\n\nEdit:   \ntook down the link before, but happy to share it again, thanks for the support y'all!  \n[https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust](https://github.com/feuersteiner/learning-rust)",

      "text": "I created a swarm plugin for OpenCode that I've been rigorously testing on my own and I think its in a good enough state to get additional feedback. Github link is below but all you have to do is add the plugin to your OpenCode config and NPM will download the latest package for you automatically.\n\n[https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm](https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm)  \n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm)\n\nGeneral idea is that of perspective management. When you code with the traditional Plan/Build method in OpenCode, you are forcing a slightly different perspective on the LLM but in the end it is still a perspective borne of the same exact training set. My intent was to collate genuinely different data sets by calling different models for each agent.\n\nA single architect guides the entire process. This is your most capable LLM be it local or remote. Its job is to plan the project, collate all intake, and ensure the project proceeds as planned. The architect knows to break the task down into domains and then solicit Subject Matter Expert input from up to 3 domains it has detected. So if you are working on a python app, it would ask for input from a Python SME. This input is then collated, plan adjusted, and implementation instructions are sent to the coding agent one task at a time. The architect knows that it is the most capable LLM and writes all instructions for the lowest common denominator. All code changes are sent to an independent auditor and security agent for review. Lastly, the Test Engineer writes robust testing frameworks and scripts and runs them against the code base.\n\nIf there are any issues with any of these phases they will be sent back to the architect who will interpret and adjust fire. The max number of iterations the architect is allowed to roll through is configurable, I usually leave it at 5.\n\nClaude put together a pretty good readme on the github so take a look at that for more in depth information. Welcoming all feedback. Thanks!",

I actually built the swarm as a full on application before I ever knew about OpenCode. When I saw what you could do with plugins I decided to just move the entire idea to OpenCode instead. Following your project readme's instruction to just ask an LLM about it, I put both our project readmes in GPT 5.2 and this was the TLDR.\n\n**Choose OpenCode Swarm when you care about correctness, control, and repeatability.**  \nIt enforces an architect-planned, phase-gated workflow with mandatory QA before code merges and persists project state to disk so work can be resumed deterministically. Best for complex tasks where you want traceability, predictable outcomes, and protection against agent drift or context loss.\n\n**Choose Oh-My-OpenCode when you care about speed, tooling breadth, and ecosystem power.**  \nIt provides a rich library of prebuilt agents, LSP/AST tooling, and strong community support to accelerate development workflows. Best when you want maximum productivity and flexibility and are comfortable trading strict process control for capability and convenience.\n\nAs an aside, one of my constraints was that I needed to use entirely local resources, which limited how many agents I could call. Parallel agents drastically slow down inference on consumer hardware. I needed to build in hard requires for serial operation.",

I haven't seen anything that's doing a 1 for 1 copy. joelhooks has a single coordinator that can spawn multiple parallel workers to decompose a project and allow for parallelization. Along with project memory. Mine has project memory as well, but the point is quality, not speed. Swarm-tools doesn't elicit perspectives from other models and it doesn't give the sub agents different roles. So in the end, the quality will be whatever your coordinator is capable of outputting.\n\nWith opencode-swarm, every agent can be a truly different outlook born of vastly different training data and methods. This more closely replicates actual software development methodologies, where you have team members with different jobs and very different backgrounds all working together.   \n  \nHeterogeneous perspectives on a problem are almost always better than homogeneous. In my opinion anyway, all of this is up for interpretation and at the end of the day whatever fits your needs is the best option regardless of how it does it.",

They're actively working on securing more compute, and communicating very actively in their Discord with users about the state of things and listening to complaints (when they're not sleeping, or pulling all-nighters). I've used K2T (K2.5's predecessor) with them since I joined and it has been rock solid. K2.5 will get there eventually too.\n\nI don't think it's fair to call this fake.",

They're extremely open, active, and responsive in their Discord, so you always know what's going on\n4.

They won't secretly replace a model with a differently-RL'd one under your nose, but keep the ID the same\n6. They won't secretly quantize a model under load and then gaslight you telling you it's not different.\n\nCall me a bot if you want. I'm not. Y'all are just cynical.
