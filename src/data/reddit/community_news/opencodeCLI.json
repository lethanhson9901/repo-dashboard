I was actually planning on switching to Opencode black from my Claude Pro plan, but at the very least Claude gives you a very clear 30-day retention number and provide *some* protections against using the data for marketing purposes.

For example, looking at our monitoring for GLM-4.7 over the past 24hrs, it averages >100tps... But benchmarking it just now for prose, it's \\~70tps, since the speculative decoder that Zai ships with GLM is more effective at predicting code than prose, so it's slower for prose use cases (generally GLM has varied TPS performance, since the speculator is very fast but when it misses, it slows down; it's still quite good overall IMO). In the SF Bay Area I usually see around \\~1sec time-to-first token, but your results may vary by geography: our API servers are currently hosted in AWS us-east-1. Kimi K2 Thinking averages around 90tps in our logs; MiniMax M2.1 is about the same (although I personally prefer KK2-Thinking and GLM-4.7 to MiniMax).",

I think omo pre jan was the sweet spot for me. The balance really was deep planning and simple execution, but now the planning and execution both feel bloated out and heavy with waterboarding token usage. \n\nI've since reverted back to standard open code and I'm just a bit more picky on model selection dependent on the use case. I miss the deeper planning modes but you can get around that with more explicit promoting as well as using memory plugins. \n\nI'll likely take more inspiration from it but I agree it's gone a little over the top in its most recent incarnations",

They have a responsive terminal layout, if there is enough space, you'll get a sidebar.

Anthropic doesn't want you to use their Claude Code subscription with OpenCode, so using Opus in OpenCode (through the API then) is prohibitvely expensive.

          "text": "Sure they might be swamped in tickets, but as working in bleeding edge AI tooling for software development, they should have set up an automatic screening process for incoming tickets, assessing if this is reporting a security issue, and if so, is it valid and how severe is it?  \nThat could be done with two or three prompts (1. decide if it IS about a security issue, 2. if so, run an OpenCode prompt with the issue description and the task to assess if it is valid or not and to judge it on a severity scale).\n\nI doubt that there are so many issues remaining after such screening, that they cannot take care of this and at least acknowledge these to the person reporting it.\n\nBut I also have sympathy for them, that they don't have a proper protocol in place yet. Of course it shouldn't be like that, but it is very common and understandable that such a setup is not your first thought if you start a new project.\n\nThat said, I think it should be standard practice to develop in an isolated container environment anyway these days. Pre-AI it was already dangerous, especially in the JS ecosystem where you install an uncountable number of dependencies via npm. But now, with AI agents autonomously running code on your machine, this potential danger even multiplied.\n\nThis is not a cure-for-all solution but greatly reduces the potential impact of such things.",

They still pay the same sub. Unless maybe they are collecting data when people use Claude Code then I'd understand the incentive to keep people in there. Otherwise I don't understand it. Claude Code is just a harness for the most part. It's not like usage changes for the same plan just because you used Opencode. I am glad GitHub, OpenAI, and other companies are embracing Opencode and all the other open harnesses. It's good.",

I prefer to know if I have 5 minutes or 5 hours of coding left before the reset.\n\nSo, I built [opencode-antigravity-quota](https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3novpv0yp4dg1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=da012cf14f4a65e9c2a73ba20e0ffc8a6c084aa3\n\nIt’s a plugin that hooks into your authenticated accounts and gives you the option to visualize your current quotas and exact reset times directly in the terminal.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\*   Visual Status: ASCII-style progress bars showing usage for models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash, and Claude.\n\n\\*   Multi-Account: Checks all accounts configured via the auth plugin at once.\n\n\\*   Reset Timers: Tells you exactly when your quota resets (e.g., \"Reset in: 2h 15m\").\n\n\\*   Local Cache: Lets you see if you are being throttled locally vs the server.\n\nIt requires opencode-antigravity-auth to work. It’s been a lifesaver for my workflow, so I figured I’d share it.\n\nRepo/Install: [https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota](https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota)\n\nLet me know if you find it useful",

      "text": "# I wrote most of this post with opencode, as a summary of my migration. And then edited it myself.\n\nI’d been quietly annoyed at Claude Code’s arbitrary, opaque quota limits for a while. I kept tolerating not becuase I feel that I could not live without Opus or Sonnet (I feel most models have become pretty good these days, if you have slightest idea of what you are doing). But because I’d invested in custom commands, agents, and skills for months, and all of that just works for me in claude code.\n\nAnd the thought of rebuilding everything sounded painful. Then the “OpenCode max subscription ban” landed and that was my last straw.\n\nObviously, I had to disconnect opencode from claude sub, but it meant I had no reason left tpo keep paying them $200 (well, already reduced to $100 recently, and bought some other subscriptions with the difference)\n\nNo warning, no clarity, and were reports of accounts being banned for \"misuse\". People might justify it with \"they can do whatever they want with THEIR subscription\", but then \"customers are free to leave as well\". It felt like a toxic dependency: good when it worked, exhausting when it didn’t. I decided to start cutting the cord for good. I spent a few hours learning how OpenCode organizes commands, agents, and skills and realized I could migrate without nuking my Claude setup. That became the mission: keep my Claude assets usable while making them first‑class in OpenCode.\n\n# The three pillars I had to understand\n\nOpenCode is structured around three things, and once I understood them the migration was mostly plumbing:\n\n* **Commands**: slash commands with frontmatter\n* **Agents**: explicit roles with prompts + tool permissions\n* **Skills**: reusable instruction bundles loaded on demand\n\n# Migration strategy (keep Claude intact, add OpenCode wrappers)\n\nI wanted zero rewrites in my Claude files. The simplest path was wrappers + symlinks so Claude stays the source of truth.\n\n# 1) Skills: symlink Claude → OpenCode\n\nThis lets both tools use the same skills.\n\n    # Project\n    ln -s .claude/skills .opencode/skill\n    \n    # User\n    ln -s ~/.claude/skills ~/.config/opencode/skill\n\n# 2) Commands: wrap Claude commands with frontmatter\n\nOpenCode needs frontmatter, Claude doesn’t. Wrappers let OpenCode read Claude commands without edits.\n\nExample wrapper:\n\n    ---\n    description: Enforce code discipline checklist\n    agent: build\n    ---\n    @.claude/commands/enforce-code-disciplines.md\n\nI did this for all project commands (including the `priming/` folder) and all user‑level commands in `~/.claude/commands/`.\n\n# 3) Agents: wrap Claude prompts\n\nOpenCode agents can point to a prompt file, which makes them perfect wrappers for Claude agents.\n\n    ---\n    description: Senior code reviewer\n    mode: subagent\n    prompt: \"{file:~/.claude/agents/senior-code-reviewer.md}\"\n    ---\n\nI wrapped all my Claude agents as **subagents** to preserve behavior.\n\n# Verification checks (how I proved it worked)\n\nThese were the concrete checks that confirmed OpenCode was seeing everything:\n\n    opencode debug skill\n\n* Commands show up in the `/` palette\n* Agents show up in the `@` picker\n* Skills list correctly in `opencode debug skill`\n\nIf skills don’t show up, I enabled them in `opencode.json`:\n\n    \"tools\": {\n      \"read\": true,\n      \"write\": true,\n      \"edit\": true,\n      \"bash\": true,\n      \"skill\": true\n    }\n\n# Bonus: I turned the playbook into a skill\n\nI didn’t want to repeat this on every repo, so I started with asking opencode to write a migration skill that:\n\n* Scans Claude commands, agents, and skills\n* Creates OpenCode wrappers and symlinks\n* Verifies discovery\n\nNow migration is repeatable and documented instead of a one‑off bash ritual.\n\n# Tips\n\n* You can invoke skills by name in plain language. Unlike claude code, you don't have to keep asking it to \"invoke the skill properly\", and not just read a single SKILL.md file (leaving everything else). Open code invoked the skill, and read every file mentioned in it.\n* Skills can load fine even if the UI doesn’t surface them. Use `opencode debug skill`.\n* Wrappers won’t load without frontmatter.\n\n# Final take\n\nIf Claude Code’s limits are starting to feel arbitrary, there is a clean exit ramp. You don’t have to throw away your existing commands or skills. OpenCode can run them while Claude remains intact. I’m now fully migrated without losing anything, and it feels like getting my workflow back.\n\nI do plan to use Claude Code for planning at times, but now I have options.\n\nAnd honestly, I was only flirting with OpenCode for the last few months, but watching accounts being banned by Anthropic because customers didn't like their tooling, was a dic\\* move. And it made me realise that I just can't let myself be fully dependent on such a company.\n\nNow, if Anthropic suddenly decides to ban my account for some random reason, I can just walk away without being devastated.\n\nEven if Opus4.5, I have to spend time ensuring that the code is as per my preferences and standards. So for me, the loss would have been leaving behind the workflow that just worked for me. But now it seems that OpenCode is the best place for it to fit one-to-one.\n\nIf anyone wants the playbook or migration skill, here you go:\n\n[https://github.com/SmrutAI/opencode-migration](https://github.com/SmrutAI/opencode-migration)\n\nJust install it, and it migrates everything.\n\n  \nWill soon include a way to reuse Claude's settings.json and hooks, which are the last bit of attachment I have with Claude.

      "text": "hey!\n\nanother update on [opencode studio](https://github.com/Microck/opencode-studio). ive been busy with other projects but havent stopped working on it. lots of new QoL and Antigravity/Google related stuff! trying to keep up to date (id want the same antigravity rotation system but for openai's new specific support) but there's an overwhelming amount of stuff coming every day :P\n\nits probably filled with bugs that I havent discovered myself so let me know anything that you find or that you want added!\n\n# what's new:\n\n**usage dashboard (new tab: /usage)**\n\nv1.0.5 had no usage page. now there’s a full usage dashboard that pulls from your local opencode message logs and turns it into token + cost stats.\n\nwhat you get:\n\n* summary cards for total cost, input tokens, output tokens.\n* usage timeline (stacked bars) broken down by model. hover a segment and it shows input vs output cost for that model.\n* cost breakdown pie chart with a legend (and a view toggle when you have lots of models).\n* top projects table. click a project row to instantly filter the whole page to that project.\n* model performance table with input/output tokens + estimated cost.\n\nfilters + exports:\n\n* range presets: 24h, 7d, 30d, 3m, 6m, 1y\n* custom range actually prompts for start + end dates and filters server-side using from/to timestamps\n* project dropdown: all projects or one project\n* export csv (model, input, output, total, cost)\n* save screenshot (exports the whole dashboard) pricing model:\n* studio includes a small pricing table (per 1m tokens) for common models (claude, gpt, gemini, etc).\n* anything unknown falls back to a default rate so you still get estimates instead of blanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g7ppot4w7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=317837cc180e09c5ce42d1b75409b2fac5eef167\n\n**google auth got split into gemini vs antigravity**\n\nif you have both google auth plugins installed, studio treats them as two modes:\n\n* gemini auth: simple, single-account flow\n* antigravity auth: multi-account pooling and rotation\n\nyou can switch the active mode from the auth page. it updates which google namespace is active and keeps the rest of your config intact.\n\n**google account pool + quota tracking (auth page)**\n\nthis is the big new auth feature since v1.0.5.\n\n* add multiple google accounts into a pool (oauth in browser)\n* each account gets a status: active, ready, cooldown, expired\n* rotate to the next available account when you get rate limited\n* activate a specific account manually\n* cooldown an account for an hour if it’s currently burned\n* quota bar shows daily usage %, remaining, and reset timer\n\nthis is built for people who have work + personal accounts, or multiple paid seats, and don’t want to keep re-logging.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4y3qnibw7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=825615b3137da115b44a077687838de4cabecb35\n\n**auth tutorial (first visit)**\n\n/auth can be a lot when you first land there. there’s now a short first-time walkthrough, plus a help button to reopen it later.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buk47rxfw7dg1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=c760e1567c13fbb3ac6d7d4c8a37e84ab06baab2\n\n**one-click profile switching (auth)**\n\nprofiles are still there, but switching is now just a click. it’s the kind of thing you only notice when it’s gone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ps29alkw7dg1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=19279a8da39f864a572502cc5752c93a9833abff\n\n**presets (new feature)**\n\npresets are basically save-bundles and apply it when I need to.\n\n* open presets from skills, plugins, or mcp\n* create a preset with:\n   * name + description\n   * skills list\n   * plugins list\n   * mcp servers list\n* partial selection is supported. you can pick exactly which items are included.\n* apply modes:\n   * exclusive: apply preset and disable everything else\n   * additive: apply preset and keep other items enabled\n\nthe create preset dialog also starts preselected with whatever you currently have enabled, so it’s fast to capture your current setup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqqhs7c3x7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1ff2e341292e0286be235eab6a9bf1083bc2069\n\n**mcp editing in-place**\n\nmcp management isn’t add/toggle/delete anymore. mcp cards support editing the config in place (command/args/env style changes), so you don’t need to round-trip through raw json for common tweaks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5hx9mh6x7dg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=db944f0686f8216b6f05af71822ba95e78e85302\n\n**disconnected landing is more guided**\n\nwhen the frontend can’t see the backend, it now shows:\n\n* explicit setup steps (install opencode-ai, install studio server)\n* a reminder to run opencode --version once to initialize config\n* after \\~10s, it shows an update hint: npm install -g opencode-studio-server@latest\n* quick links to github and npm\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt62mivmx7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef0fb3223871eade1e093f547a209a1c1b2418f\n\n**protocol handler: local open mode + queued actions**\n\n* opencodestudio://launch?open=local starts the backend and opens http://localhost:3000\n* deep links now create a pending action that studio asks you to confirm (import skill, import plugin, etc)\n* mcp deep links are treated more cautiously now (the app won’t blindly execute arbitrary command strings from a url)\n\n**ui + site basics**\n\n* updated app icons/favicons\n* added robots.txt + sitemap for the hosted site\n\n# update (hosted frontend mode)\n\nif you’re coming from v1.0.5, you mainly just update the backend:\n\n`npm install -g opencode-studio-server@latest`\n\nrepo:

No more switching between apps. You get AI-powered project management assistance right where you take notes and manage your projects.\n\n# Why I built this\n\nAs someone who uses Obsidian for project documentation and notes, I got tired of constantly switching windows to use OpenCode. Now I can write specs, reference my notes, and get AI coding help all in the same workspace.\n\n# Key Features\n\n* **Full terminal emulation** via xterm.js with proper color support, cursor handling, and resize\n* **Theme-aware** \\- automatically pulls your Obsidian theme colors so it looks native\n* **Vault as working directory** \\- OpenCode can see and work with all your files\n* **Image paste support** \\- paste screenshots directly into the terminal\n* **Multiple instances** \\- open several OpenCode tabs if you need them\n* **Toggle focus hotkey** \\- quickly switch between editor and terminal\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Obsidian Desktop\n* Python 3.x\n* OpenCode installed and in your PATH\n* Windows users: `pip install pywinpty`\n\n# Quick Install\n\nRun this from your vault's root directory:\n\n    mkdir -p .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/main.js -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/main.js\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/manifest.json -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/manifest.json\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/styles.css -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/styles.css\n\nThen enable it in Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins.\n\n# Links\n\n* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar](https://github.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar)\n* **License**: MIT\n\nWould love to hear your feedback! If you run into any issues, please open a GitHub issue. I have only tested this on my Linux machine, but it should work on Windows and MacOS too.",

I don’t want the model to stop working in the middle of serious work.\n\nPlease introduce clear limits or a paid coding plan (ZAI-level or slightly above).  \nIf one plan expires, I'll switch accounts or plans and continue no issue.\n\nJust give us predictability",

Free tiers are nice for experimentation, but for serious backend work predictability > freebies.\n\nWhat worked for me was building around a paid coding plan with known limits as the backbone, and then treating fast/free models like Big Pickle as opportunistic accelerators. Opus (or similar) sets the architecture, GLM 4.7 and Big Pickle handles the implementation and refactor loops, and anything else fast just rides on top.\n\nIf you’re looking for something closer to a predictable, paid plan rather than a gamble on a free endpoint, Zai has coding plans where you can still get 50% discount for first year + 30% discount (current offers + additional 10% coupon code) but I think it will expire soon (some offers are already gone!) > [https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=TLDEGES7AK](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=TLDEGES7AK)",
