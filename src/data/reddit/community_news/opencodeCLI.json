      "text": "I’ve been using Claude Code pretty heavily for day-to-day work. It’s honestly one of the first coding agents I’ve trusted enough for real production tasks.\n\nThat said, once you start using it *a lot*, some tradeoffs show up.\n\nCost becomes noticeable. Model choice matters more than you expect. And because it’s a managed tool, you don’t really get to see or change how the agent works under the hood. You mostly adapt your workflow to it.\n\nOut of curiosity, I started testing OpenCode (Got Hyped up from X & reddit TBH). Didn’t realize how big it had gotten until recently. The vibe is very different.\n\nClaude Code feels guarded and structured. It plans carefully, asks before doing risky stuff, and generally prioritizes safety and predictability.\n\nOpenCode feels more like raw infrastructure. You pick the model per task. It runs commands, edits files, and you validate by actually running the code. More control, less hand-holding.\n\nBoth got the job done when I tried real tasks (multi-file refactors, debugging from logs). Neither “failed.” The difference was *how* they worked, not whether they could.\n\nIf you want something managed and predictable, Claude Code is great. If you care about flexibility, cost visibility, and owning the workflow, OpenCode is interesting.\n\nI wrote up a longer comparison [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/opencode-the-best-claude-code-alternative) if anyone wants the details.",

OpenCode’s flow is already so rigid (with task management being handled in the conversation), and Superpowers expects the full lifecycle of its skills to complete a task, and doesn’t wrap up things if you get interrupted.\n\nThat being said, I like using Superpowers in CC with Opus for brainstorming and planning, and then having it write to files that I can pick up and continue to work with in OpenCode with Codex for implementation/testing/review.\n\nPerfect?

After some back and forth with claude and a little reverse engineering, the coordination layer turns out to be a clever mix of tmux + file locks and undocumented cli arguments.\n\nSo I pulled it apart and reimplemented it as a standalone MCP server. Any MCP client can use it now, including\n\nopencode as seen in the demo video.\n\nHere's what the server exposes:\n\n\\- Team + spawning: create teams, spawn Claude Code teammates into tmux panes, graceful and forced shutdown.\n\n\\- Task coordination: ownership, status tracking, dependency graphs with cycle detection.\n\n\\- Messaging: DMs, broadcast, long-polling inbox, shutdown/plan-approval protocol.\n\n\\- Concurrency safety: file locks on inboxes and tasks, atomic config writes.\n\nRepo: [github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp](http://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp)\n\nIt's early (v0.1.0) and I'd love as much feedback as possible specifically around tighter opencode integrations.",

Is that not the idea with this?\n\nIdeally, you'd spawn an opencode server associated with a project/directory if there already isn't one available when starting up opencode since that avoids any mcp server duplication and your plugin can interact with any sessions, events, etc. You want a plugin that hooks into all the relevant events for making sure all the expected interactions work as expected and you can recover from any odd states.\n\nIf trying to have this work outside of the opencode server process, it's possible but i think it'll be more difficult. There are some other projects doing something similar and there is a ton of adapter work. Gastown, for example is one of those. ",

A proper agent team can't occur without multi-caller support.\n\nThis is because currently, when an agent that isn't the Parent persists a session with a subagent, the subagent thinks the calling agent is the Parent.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\nPrimary A tasks subagent A. Subagent A tasks Subagent B. Primary A tries to communicate with Subagent B, and Subagent B thinks it's talking to Subagent A.\n\nTo coordinate a team of agents, which are communicating, and orchestrating each others actions, you need them to be able to identify who they're talking to/with.\n\nI have a workaround system where agents write relay-files, where a sub-skill helps them know the relay-file protocol. It's part of a larger Agentic Collaboration Framework.\n\nI think a proper OpenCode implementation for Agent Teams needs first, to merge my PR, second to revamp the caller system so that it supports multi-callers.\n\nIt is getting tiresome that Anthropic releases something, and people think it's innovative, say they should copy it, but something better is already available for OpenCode, but the community just isn't paying attention or pitching in.\n\nI have a complete roadmap for agentic collaboration in development for OpenCode. The PR is just one small part of it. A critical part, but a small part. There's so much more that needs doing, and I'm just one newbie vibe coder who develops purely to build the tools that I need for litigation.\n\nEdit: decided to turn this comment into a GitHub Issue.

Github link is below but all you have to do is add the plugin to your OpenCode config and NPM will download the latest package for you automatically.\n\n[https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm](https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm)  \n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-swarm)\n\nGeneral idea is that of perspective management. When you code with the traditional Plan/Build method in OpenCode, you are forcing a slightly different perspective on the LLM but in the end it is still a perspective borne of the same exact training set. My intent was to collate genuinely different data sets by calling different models for each agent.\n\nA single architect guides the entire process. This is your most capable LLM be it local or remote. Its job is to plan the project, collate all intake, and ensure the project proceeds as planned. The architect knows to break the task down into domains and then solicit Subject Matter Expert input from up to 3 domains it has detected. So if you are working on a python app, it would ask for input from a Python SME. This input is then collated, plan adjusted, and implementation instructions are sent to the coding agent one task at a time. The architect knows that it is the most capable LLM and writes all instructions for the lowest common denominator. All code changes are sent to an independent auditor and security agent for review. Lastly, the Test Engineer writes robust testing frameworks and scripts and runs them against the code base.\n\nIf there are any issues with any of these phases they will be sent back to the architect who will interpret and adjust fire. The max number of iterations the architect is allowed to roll through is configurable, I usually leave it at 5.\n\nClaude put together a pretty good readme on the github so take a look at that for more in depth information. Welcoming all feedback. Thanks!",

Following your project readme's instruction to just ask an LLM about it, I put both our project readmes in GPT 5.2 and this was the TLDR.\n\n**Choose OpenCode Swarm when you care about correctness, control, and repeatability.**  \nIt enforces an architect-planned, phase-gated workflow with mandatory QA before code merges and persists project state to disk so work can be resumed deterministically. Best for complex tasks where you want traceability, predictable outcomes, and protection against agent drift or context loss.\n\n**Choose Oh-My-OpenCode when you care about speed, tooling breadth, and ecosystem power.**  \nIt provides a rich library of prebuilt agents, LSP/AST tooling, and strong community support to accelerate development workflows. Best when you want maximum productivity and flexibility and are comfortable trading strict process control for capability and convenience.\n\nAs an aside, one of my constraints was that I needed to use entirely local resources, which limited how many agents I could call. Parallel agents drastically slow down inference on consumer hardware. I needed to build in hard requires for serial operation.",

I haven't seen anything that's doing a 1 for 1 copy. joelhooks has a single coordinator that can spawn multiple parallel workers to decompose a project and allow for parallelization. Along with project memory. Mine has project memory as well, but the point is quality, not speed. Swarm-tools doesn't elicit perspectives from other models and it doesn't give the sub agents different roles. So in the end, the quality will be whatever your coordinator is capable of outputting.\n\nWith opencode-swarm, every agent can be a truly different outlook born of vastly different training data and methods. This more closely replicates actual software development methodologies, where you have team members with different jobs and very different backgrounds all working together.   \n  \nHeterogeneous perspectives on a problem are almost always better than homogeneous. In my opinion anyway, all of this is up for interpretation and at the end of the day whatever fits your needs is the best option regardless of how it does it.",

Having the code changes immediately reviewed before moving to the next code change has caught hundreds of issues that would have either made it all the way through or would have needed long complicated fixes later on.  I have hard gated it even further for my workflow because I care about quality not speed. So every code change is reviewed immediately, all plans are reviewed before implementation, and a full end to end test suite is built and run at the end of each phase of work.  \n  \nI have done a lot of work on the plugin since this post, its now up to v4.5.0. Recent additions like a reviewer whose job it is to critique the architects plan and ensure there are no obvious indicators of AI slop. SME calls are now fully dynamic with the architect crafting its prompt based on what it needs not on a set of hard code SME domains. Also the agents now have persistent memory across sessions and can now communicate with each other to ask questions or provide needed context.  \n  \nI am also working on a writing swarm. Same idea as the current swarm but laser focused on producing high quality output by sending it through multiple reviewers tn ensure I get human style writing with no AI slop.",

I've done it regularly for months since I subscribed. They're absolutely not fake.\n\nRegarding the errors and slowness of K2.5, this is a temporary thing, due to the huge influx of new users they've had, plus the fact that K2.5 was just released. They're actively working on securing more compute, and communicating very actively in their Discord with users about the state of things and listening to complaints (when they're not sleeping, or pulling all-nighters). I've used K2T (K2.5's predecessor) with them since I joined and it has been rock solid. K2.5 will get there eventually too.\n\nI don't think it's fair to call this fake.",

Possibly introducing some extra magic commands to start a new session. Maybe also to open the current session with opencode. I imagine the situation when one starts a dummy exchange, and then it develops into something interesting and worth preserving.\n\nBut coming back to your question: I don't have Windows. I will at some point test it on Windows too, but I cannot promise this will happen in the next few days. Did you try to run it with WSL or WSL2? It should work, but I did not test it myself.",

They host open-source models and the API is OpenAI-compatible so it just plugs into your CLI or Dev Environment. $20/mo flat for the subscription tier is nice.\n\nOpen-source models still lag behind frontier models for complex reasoning tasks in my opinion, so it's not a full replacement.

They’re on discord, issues get acknowledged and you can see what they’re working on instead of guessing why a model suddenly feels worse.\n\nOnce the promo is over, I’ll probably reassess again, especially if other Kimi or GLM providers improve.

Even on trivial 4-node problems it tops out around 80%.\n\nThe benchmarks that made it look Sonnet-tier are heavily weighted toward code generation and agentic tool use, not abstract reasoning. For date comparisons and arithmetic, you're basically hitting its weakest surface.\n\naeroumbria's multi-model approach in the comments is the pragmatic fix. Route logic-heavy tasks to a model that doesn't fumble basic orderings.",

          "text": "I don't think anyone is making the claim that GLM is better, or on par with Sonnet or Opus. But GLM **will** fix things for me that both Sonnet and Opus miss. Some pretty obvious things that I have explicitly asked both Sonnet and Opus to fix, they've said they did, but they actually didn't. GLM was able to identify the problem, and fix it on the first time, and it **actually** fixed the problem, didn't just say \"hey, I fixed this.\"\n\nIt's a **different** tool, made in a **different** way and people expect it to perform well in the **same metrics** you use to classify another tool. It's just plain stupid.\n\nPeople want to throw \"do this thing\" at an LLM agent and expect it to extrapolate extremely detailed context and perform that task perfectly, and you just can't do that with GLM.\n\nIt's the difference between automatic (Anthropic) and manual (GLM) engines. People are going to fight ad infinitum about which is better. Some people prefer the convenience of the Anthropic model and will generally **never** be able to use a manual transmission because they learned on automatic, and it just is what it is.\n\nIf you're willing to take the time to learn how to respond appropriately to the model, and to learn what it needs and expects, GLM is a great model, most especially at the price point it's being offered for.",
