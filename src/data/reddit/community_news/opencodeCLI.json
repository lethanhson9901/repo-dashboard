My request history page shows that I've used $1.38 worth of requests with the Go subscription, and I'm already at 6% of my monthly quota.

      "text": "I've been collecting skill packs for OpenCode/Claude Code and hit 2,004 skills across 34 categories (ai-ml, security, devops, game-dev, etc.).\n\nThe problem: AI agents use a [3-level progressive disclosure system](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) to load skills. Level 1 loads the `name` \\+ `description` of **every** skill into the system prompt at startup. With 2,004 skills, that's **\\~80,000 tokens consumed before I even type a prompt** \\- roughly 40% of a 200K context window.\n\n# The fix: SkillPointer\n\nIt's not a plugin or library. It's an **organizational pattern** that works with native skills:\n\n1. Move all 2,004 raw skills to a hidden vault directory (outside the agent's scan path)\n2. Replace them with 35 lightweight \"category pointer\" skills\n3. Each pointer tells the AI: \"use `list_dir` and `view_file` to browse the vault and find the exact skill you need\"\n\nResult:\n\n||Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Startup tokens|\\~80,000|\\~255|\n|Skills accessible|2,004|2,004|\n|Reduction|\\-|99.7%|\n\nThe AI still accesses every skill - it just discovers them on-demand using file tools it already has, instead of loading all descriptions at startup.\n\n# How I verified this\n\n* Measured actual YAML frontmatter sizes from all 2,004 [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) files\n* Confirmed the `<available_skills>` loading behavior in [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) and [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)\n* Real data from my own environment, not theoretical numbers\n\n# Repo\n\n[github.com/blacksiders/SkillPointer](https://github.com/blacksiders/SkillPointer)\n\nIncludes a zero-dependency Python setup script that auto-categorizes your skills and generates the pointers.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the approach. I know \"it's just skills organizing skills\" - that's literally the point. The value is in the pattern, not the tech. savings in scale.",

You absolutely nailed the dilemma, but you actually read my mind, I'm not skipping vector search entirely, I’m just layering it.\n\nI use FAISS+Langchain and a custom Qdrant MCP at different layers under the hood (since Cursor/VS Code have built-in indexers by default anyway).\n\nThe problem with pure RAG/Vector DB lookups at the *top* level is semantic failure. If I ask a pure RAG setup to 'Build a stretchy IK arm', it pulls the IK node and all connected if you know those DBS can have up to 700+ vrctors, but misses the 'Naming Conventions' file because the mathematical overlap just isn't there.\n\nSo I use SkillPointer as a strict text router to force a custom dependency map first. This mixed, layer-by-layer approach saves massive tokens. Once inside the routed skill, the AI can trigger the Qdrant MCP for semantic search if it actually needs to deep-dive into the docs.\n\nAs you probably know, MCP is a context vampire and gives you 'auto-compact', where you loosing details and moving you closer to hallucinations. If you have hundreds of tools/skills active, MCP will literally eat 80% of your context window just defining the JSON schemas.\n\nBy putting SkillPointer's strict text routing in front, I shield the AI from that MCP bloat. The AI only loads the schema for the *one* tool it actually needs at that exact moment, rather than choking on the entire protocol dictionary.\n\nIn the end, it's all about ruthlessly optimizing context limits to prevent hallucinations in complex tasks.

Code of idea is open and you can see examples and improve them for your specific needs.\n\nBut the real safeguard is the AI itself. Because the Pointers are incredibly token-cheap (just a few sentences), the agent will naturally trigger multiple pointers simultaneously if a task is ambiguous. But it also can skip most of them, depends on approach and rules llm follows.\n\nIf I ask for a 'secure React native login', the AI will hit the Security, Mobile, and Web-Dev pointers all at once, scan those three specific hidden vaults, and find the skill wherever the script dropped it. The gateways are so cheap it can afford to double-check, main thing if you have -60 token avarage description for all 2000 skills in context, it's just massive.  \n  \nTo be clear, I’m not trying to sell this as a universal ‘best’ pattern or some magic skill standard. I’m just sharing one concrete way I’ve been optimizing context usage in a messy, real pipeline so the agent doesn’t drown in skills metadata and start hallucinating.

This sounds too good to be true?\n\nAvailable Models: GLM 5, Minimax M2.5, Kimi K2.5 and Qwen 3.5 Plus.\n\nWhat's the catch? Bad unreliable service? Their definition of 'request' is misleading? I don't get it. If this is all true, then this is the most value for money plan, right?\n\nI'm searching everywhere and I see no one is talking about it at all.\n\nAlso, for my Indian brothers out there. Currently, they do not have a way to verify +91 phone numbers so they're not allowing registrations / account sign ups for India. I spoke with their contact, and they said something about their data center recently shutting down in India. Their system requires mandatory phone number verification before making any purchase so the agent was 'unofficially' recommending me to buy a virtual online phone number for another country and sign up that way.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear more about this from you guys. Maybe someone is already using it and can share their experience with it?",

To invite people to talk about it so anyone else who searches about it will know what's up. And based on this, I knew my gut feeling was right.\n\nThey must be quantizing the models. Which is a big red flag for coding use so I'm not gonna be bothering with it. I maybe could use it for roleplay and general tasks but I already use NanoGPT subscription for that which also includes image gen, and Deepseek models. Add to the fact that I can't even sign up properly, this one's a big no for me.\n\nI'm considering just going ahead with Opencode Go plans for now.",

Yesterday it wasted about 25 million tokens in sudden tool call loops and another 25 million on a project branch I had to scrap completely it made such a mess.   GLM5 was able to (mostly) complete the project but I mostly used Zai’s endpoint.  Falling back to bailian when I got timeouts.   But then having to poke it to stop it falling asleep.    Not a good experience with Alibaba’s coding plan.   The one thing it’s sold for “coding” is the one thing I wouldn’t trust it to attempt ever again.   It’s just a waste of time and possibly tokens or requests if you’re paying for them.   On the plus side, qwen is fantastic for collating, sorting through project plans, and surprisingly: writing.

To test this, I created my own personal benchmark: update a personal project that used to read from OpenCode’s JSON files to instead read from the SQLite db. Sonnet 4.5/4.6 and GPT 5.2/5.3 Codex finished these within 15 minutes and with no issues. GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, and Kimi K2.5 failed spectacularly. For the same prompt, each model took 40+ minutes and didn’t even produce a working migration. MiniMax M2.5 had issues with tool calling and would just stop randomly. I have tested with OpenCode + Oh My OpenCode + GitHub Copilot (just to see if GPT/Sonnet would do). Am I missing something? How are others getting performance that is anything close to Sonnet/GPT from these cheaper models?",

We seem to have developed the idea that prompts and agents should be universal for sufficiently intelligent models, but there is no reason for this to be guaranteed. I suspect prompts have model biases when I found that some models work surprisingly well in one framework but fail catastrophically in others (e.g. Kimi seems to be really competent with strict phase-gated frameworks like GSD and can recover from its own mistakes, but always seem to struggle with frameworks that rely on skill activation like OAC, while GLM 5 seems to be the opposite). The developers of agent frameworks will usually have one primary model they develop on to see whether something works reliably, so consciously or not, we end up engineering prompts against specific models. If everyone validates against one model, that one model will naturally perform better with tools validated on it. The problem with these newer models might be that they replace each other as favourite of the month too fast, that people don't have time to develop toolings that are more compatible with them.\n\nIt does seem that tools with shorter prompts, more defined workflow and less reliant on perfectly timed spontaneous decisions (think of instructing \"run test after coding\" vs having a \"test\" skill which says \"activate yourself after coding\") usually perform better across models.",

Optional: Enable HTTPS with Caddy or nginx reverse proxy\n\nFor encrypted traffic over Tailscale, you can set up a simple reverse proxy, or just use Tailscale's built-in encryption (it already encrypts all traffic).\n\nNote: Tailscale's network is already encrypted, so the OPENCODE\\_SERVER\\_PASSWORD provides app-level authentication.

However,  there are a problems with the provider: \n\n 1.  **Standard Plan 5 hour  limit is  x3 of Claude Pro Plan:**   Maybe this is correct in theory, but in practice not at all.  Maybe due to caching or another reason,   the plan hits the limit pretty quickly.  Also I believe Chinese models can be inefficient with the tool calling  hence,   Standard Plan 5 hour limit is same as  Codex/Claude  20 USD plan.  \n  \n2. **Impractial Usage:**  Since  for a regular coding task you will hit  5 hour limit pretty quickly on their standard model , having no weekly limit has no advantages for the developers at all.  The existing plan is actually made for the abusers , which is funny cause the provider keep complaining about some accounts abusing their system while  they are the one actually allowing it in the first place.  Cause the provider is  for  bots  not for regular developer.\n\n3. **Price Increase:**  They increased the price  from  20 USD to **30 USD** for standard plan last night . Their ratioanle is  \"They need a lot of compute\".  But the reason for the need for compute is  that, their bad planning.  There's no way an everyday  coder/user can abuse this system,  you need to be  24/7 online, which means this for bots and bots are abusing it but they want everyone to pay for it. \n\n**4. Delayed model release:**   Even  opencode was serving GLM5 , Minimax M2.5 and Kimi K2.5  for **free.** And as of today, they are still not serving  GLM5 and Minimax M2.5  only  K2.5.  They are using the same excuse ;   shorteage of compute/GPUs.\n\n  \nI already cancelled my subscription. Just shariing this so that , you don't fall for their false advertisement on reddit as i did.

So the title here irks me the wrong way \"stay away\" etc. Also, I do not think they have been doing much advertising (I may be wrong) but rather users have recommended them (I have done it a few times in comments). It is a very small company and they are bending over backwards to make the leading open weight models work well from the harnesses we like the most like Claude Code and Opencode etc. I started with the $20 which IMHO was much harder to run out of than the Anthropic Pro subscription. Then I upped to the $60 option which gave 10x and I never ever came close running out. But as Synthetic have clearly admitted, it was a non sustainable plan. I think the new plan scheme with \"packs\" is a good idea and I have every trust in that they are honestly trying to find a model that works well.  \n  \nAnyway, I am super happy with their service, they are extremely helpful and very transparent in what they do. I use mainly Kimi K2.5, Minimax M2.5 and a bit of Deepseek 3.2/GLM4.7. And I use it purely for coding. Just my 2c, felt this thread was... oddly negative given mine and many others experiences. :) ",

As 5h caps might be low or high, i don't care but what will stop you from progressing with your projects is a weekly cap suddenly hit after 3 days. and then you're done.   \ncan't be compared to gh copilot or anything monthly based quota as the quota amount provided by synthetic will be indefinitely higher than gh copilot pro.   \nalso the reasoning is not 'they need more gpu' but rather 'they need to make the plan fair for everyone' - if you'd read the announcement correctly then it'd be probably clear (or copy paste it into some ai to explain to you). It still makes a ton of sense for developers as you still get 135 prompts per 5h which is really hard to cap these out working on some serious projects and not just pushing idiotic prompts blindly around to force the ai to progress. And also it makes total sense for me to set the change so I as a dev can receive 80tps+ on kimi k2.5 because the infra doesn't struggle with openclaw bots just abusing the system to the very limit. And not gonna lie - their previous limit of 1.35k prompts per 5h sounded great on paper, but i always wondered how they can sustain it as I as dev even running parallel sessions was able to maye reach 400 prompts usage per 5h max - and yet some people abused the pro plan to very last token.

For me legacy plan i have now seems to be just fine for real world usecases when I'm running Kimi K2.5. they don't host any annual plan which feels fair as if any changes are done then you can just move on. \n\nI'll just mention annual plans that messed up their userbase way way more that changed recently - Trae (totally messed up any usage within 100$ range), glm reducing quota usage by 33% and adding weekly caps, Kimi code being unusable for any serious dev under 79$ range because of weekly cap aswell. \nNot defending synthetic completely but they still have most balanced subscription model out there that feels just fair considering both sides of the business. Have in mind for past year everyone was running ai inference at a loss so it's not a big surprise companies are changing their plans and basically this is sort of an end of\n1. Using single provider all the time as terms will change \n2. Cheap vibecoding using sota or top opensource models at 10$ / monthly with almost unlimited usage.\n\nPeople will need to realize that running ai is expensive and nobody will throw own money at the business forever for peeps to just run their openclaw instances. And tbh for any sort of serious development price range within 40/60$ / month is still kinda occupied mainly by synthetic if you'd want a reliable provider for 5-8-10h of work daily.",

          "text": "considering majority of accessible providers, especially when we talk about budget friendly:  \n\\- kimi via their coding plan is a big joke, but can be 'abused' for 0.99$ subscriptions. However they're on 3x usage quota right now till 'who knows when' and it's a joke as even lightweight work can cap out 5h quota in 1.5h and each 5h quota is 20% of weekly quota. You can rotate a few accounts tho easily  \n\\- glm via official api seems to be probably smartest out of these 3, best when it comes to actual frontend design and picking up logic tasks quite well. The main issue is that official api is generally slow / very slow for 95% of the time (and im EU based...) and other providers are having either quite low quota allowance or doesn't host it at all. Can't wait till synthetic provides it still (btw when they open the waitlist gates remember about [referral discount](https://synthetic.new/?referral=IDyp75aoQpW9YFt))  \n**have in mind that both kimi and glm via official api have weekly caps** which are quite.. low in both cases. GLM is better than kimi tho.  \n\\- minimax m2.5 via the minimax provider is my go-to for now, as it's reliable enough to develop 95% of usual work (i run amp free when i really need opus 4.6 for some super complex debugging) and also it has the -highspeed variant which is insanely fast as it provides constant 100tps. So for my fast paced workflow of ideate > plan > develop > review > fix > merge it's great, as minimax's speed vs kimi / glm both as a model and provider is a big win here. Also they still host [10% discount via reflinks aswell ](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan?code=HO46LCwAJ5&source=link)\\- can recommend. Also **there is no weekly cap** and they say it's 100 / 300 / 1000 / 2000 prompts per 5h but the main pros of minimax system are:  \n\\- their 5h windows are fixed (00 - 05 am / 5 - 10 / 10 - 3pm / 3-8 / 8 - 11:59:59 pm) > which might sound as not like a big deal but you can basically start working at 8am, code for 2h and even if you'd get anywhere close to the cap - the limit resets at 10 so you can move forward with your work. It's IMO **way better system** than rolling 5h window as you know when to expect a reset so can potentially plan upfront.   \n\\- their system says as prompts, but what they don't say on the pricing page is that each prompt is at least 15-20 model calls - so even the 10$ (9 with discount) plan allows to do a **ton of coding**. I'm right now at 40$ highspeed plan, spinning 3 agents all the time and using their api for one of my SaaS and can't cap it out really through the day.   \nHave in mind that with 3 agents and highspeed minimax usually the human in the loop is worst piece of the whole system and workflow. :) ",

As for Kimi and GLM, Kimi is more reliable on \"fragile\" tasks where failed tool calls can derail the whole tasks (e.g. frameworks like GSD where each step must produce artifacts that later steps depend on). It sometimes decide to stop where it is not supposed to, but it is fairly easy to fix. GLM seems to be more intelligent and can solve more complex problems \"from scratch\" (basically using bare prompts), but it does not seem to be very reliable with tool calls, and will eventually start hallucinating tools or generating nonsensical texts if the task goes on for too long.\n\nI don't think I have enough evidence to tell which one works better generally, but for now I would prefer Kimi for orchestrated workflows and GLM for adhoc / interactive use. When trying popular prompting frameworks, GSD works better with Kimi (GLM derails in fully automated tasks), and OAC works better with GLM (Kimi impersonates user and fills user questions automatically).",

The models seem to handle context and logic particularly well in it, especially when using the Plan agent first and then switching to Build.\n\nEven before Openclaw became popular, I kept thinking how useful it would be to access OpenCode from my phone. I noticed OpenCode has a server mode, which meant building a custom client was totally doable. Initially, I just wanted to write a simple Telegram bot for my own needs. But, as it usually goes, I got carried away, added more features, and eventually decided to open-source the project.\n\nI definitely won't call it \"fully functional\" yet - there are still rough edges. However, it currently has enough features to be used for actual development.\n\nHere is what works right now:\n\n* Switching between projects and sessions.\n* Selecting the agent, model, and variant (reasoning effort).\n* Tracking the agent's progress on a task.\n* Receiving code diffs directly in the chat as text files.\n\nIronically, I'm now at the point where I use the bot to write code for the bot itself. It’s a pretty great feeling to lie on the couch, watch a TV series, and casually send dev tasks to the agent via Telegram on my phone.\n\nI plan to keep actively developing the project since I use it daily. If anyone wants to try it out, the repo is here: [https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot](https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot)\n\nI would be really grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or suggestions!",

      "text": "Thought I would share this here. Something I wanted to do for a long time, compare if MCP tools actually made any difference, and if Oh My Opencode was just snake oil. Most papers, and other testing I've seen mostly indicate these things are useless and actually have a negative impact. Thought I would test it myself. \n\nFull test results and data is available here if you want to skip to it: [https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/](https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/)\n\nMore about the eval here in previous posts if anyone is interested: [Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qp4ftj/i_made_a_coding_eval_and_ran_it_against_49/), [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r2g7lq/new_minimax_m25_gpt53codex_glm_5_coding_eval/),  and an explanation of how the eval works [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r2g7lq/comment/o4wrsv6/). These are all results for the newer v1.8.x leaderboard, which I have not made a post about, but basically all the breaking changes I wanted to make, I've made them now, to improve overall fairness and fix a lot of other issues. Lot of stuff was fixed or improved. \n\n# Oh My Opencode - Opus with Extra Steps, but Worse\n\nLet's start with oh my opencode. I will save you some time, no OmO = 73.1% pass rate, with OmO Ultrawork = 69.2%. It also took 10 minutes longer, at 55 minutes to complete the eval, and made 96 total requests. Without OmO only 27 requests are made to Github Copilot. That's it. You can look for the next header and skip to the next section if that's all you wanted to know. \n\nHonestly, I had very low expectations for this one, so while it showed no improvement whatsoever and was somewhat worse, it was not worse by as much as I thought it would be. There are a *lot* of questionable decisions made in its design, in my opinion, but I won't get into that or this will turn into a very long post. I followed the readme, which literally told me to go ask my agent to set it up for me. I hated this. I prefer to do things manually so I can configure things exactly how I want, and know what is what. It took Junie CLI Opus 4.6 like 25 minutes to get things set up and working properly.. really? Below is how I configured my OmO, using my copilot and AG subscriptions via my cliproxy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfznlwz38zlg1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa7b4e207e529fa251835ac6cb35a856a298a284\n\nHonestly, I think if opus wasnt carrying this, OmO would have degraded scores much more significantly. Opus from all my testing I've done, has shown to be extremely resilient to harness differences. Weaker models are much more sensitive to the agent they are running in and how you have them set up. \n\n# MCP Servers -  Old news, just confirmed again\n\nI think most of have by now have probably already read one or two articles, or some testing and analysis out there of MCP servers concluding they usually have a negative impact. I confirmed nothing new and saw exactly this again. I used opencode + kimi k2.5 for all results because I saw Kimi had a higher MCP usage rate than other models like Opus (I did a bunch of runs to specifically figure this out), and was a good middle strength candidate in my opinion. Strong enough to call tools properly and use them right, but weak enough to have room to benefit from better tools (maybe?). I use an MCP (or SKILL) agnostic prompt to nudge the agent to use their external tools more without telling them how to use it or what to do with them. This was a little challenging, finding the right prompt, since I didn't want to steer how the agent solved tasks but also needed the agent to stop ignoring it's MCP tools. I ran evals against different prompts for 2 days straight to find the best one. Here are my test results against 9 different MCP servers, and throwing in one search cli tool + skills (Firecrawl). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2y6rongkfzlg1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ecf7e13a9f8ef67d061d28b7f4d91be2ec16e0\n\nLeft column are the MCP servers used (with one entry being SKILL + cli rather than mcp). The gemini cli entry is incorrect, that was supposed to be \"Gemini MCP Tool\". The baseline is well.. just regular old kimi k2.5 running on vanilla opencode, no extra tools. \n\nThe ONLY MCP tool to actually make improvements is the only code indexing and semantic retrieval tool using embeddings here. Not only did it score higher than baseline, it also used less time than most of the other MCP tools. I do believe it used less tokens, which probably helped offset the number one weakness of mcp servers. I've been a big proponent of these kinds of tools, I feel they are super underrated. I don't recommend this one in particular, it was just what I saw was popular so I used it. My biggest grip with claude context is it wants you to use their cloud service instead of keeping things local (cmon, spinning up lancedbs would work just fine), and the lack of reranker support (which I think is super slept on). \n\nI was surprised that firecrawl cli + skills did worse than the MCP server. Maybe it comes with too much context/info in it's skills file that it ends up not really solving the MCP issue of polluting context with unnecessary tokens? I imagine it might only be pronounced here since we are solving small tasks rather than implementing whole projects. \n\n# Some rambly rambles about embeddings, indexing, etc that you can skip\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the subject, some of you might already know, that even using a very tiny embedding model + a very tiny reranker model will give you much better accuracy than even the largest and best embedding models alone. I'm not sure why I decided to test it myself since it's already pretty well established, but I did, since I wanted to see what it would be like working with lancedb instead of sqlite-vec (and benchmark some things along the way). [https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/evals/vecdb](https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/evals/vecdb) The interesting thing I found was, that it made an even bigger difference for coding, than it did in my tests on fictional writing. \n\nModern instruction tuned reranker models and embedding models are great, you provide them things like metadata, and you get amazing results. In the right system, this can be very good for code indexing, especially with the use of things like AST aware code chunking, tree-sitter, etc. We have all the tools to give these models the metadata to help it. Just thought this was really cool, and I have plans to make my own code indexing tool (again) since nobody else seems to make one with reranking support. My last attempt was to fork someone's vibe-slopped nightmare and fix it up.. and after that nightmare I've realized I would have had a better time making my own from scratch (I did have it working well at ONE point, but please dont go looking for it, ive broken it once more in the last few versions trying to fix more stuff and gave up on it). I did learn a lot though. A lot of the testing I have done was partially to see if it would even be a good idea, since it comes up in my circle of friends sometimes \"how do we know it wont just make things worse like most other mcp servers?\" I guess I will just have to do the best I can, and make both CLI + skills and MCP tool to see what works better.  \n\nOh yeah, I guess I also have a toy web api eval thing too I made. This is pretty low effort though. I just wanted to see what implementation was like for each API since I was building a research agent. [https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/evals/web-search](https://sanityboard.lr7.dev/evals/web-search) The most interesting part will be Semantic and Reranker scores at the bottom. There are a lot of random points of data here, so it's up to you guys to figure out what's actually substantial and what's noise here, since this wasnt really a serious eval project for me. Also firecrawl has an insanely aggressive rate limits for free users, that I could not work around even with generous retry attempts and timeout limits. \n\nIf you guys have any questions pls feel free to join my discord (linked in my eval site). I think we have some pretty cool discussions there sometimes. Not really trying to shill anything, I just enjoy talking about this stuff with others.  Stars would be cool too, on some of my github projects if you like any of them. Not sure how ppl be gettin these. ",

It's literally just opus with more steps. Honestly these ai vibe slopped projects are getting annoying cause they clearly aren't testing anything and just going to Claude and saying \"make this but better\" then Claude comes back and goes \"here's your plan,this will be 50% better\" and everyone just goes okay I believe you. Im sure omo slim might be better but I'm almost sure that it's really not that different from just using vanilla opencode. I've tested over 120+ different agent/model combinations and there is a very apparent pattern that all the tools that try to do too much score much lower, and the tools that try to keep things as simple, efficient and lean as possible score the highest. If you use junie CLI you will literally see in its reasoning traces \"looking for the simplest approach\" multiple times over while it works (which I thought was interesting behavior).",

      "text": "I posted a few weeks ago about a very early build of my OpenCode plugin. I've iterated on it every day multiple times a day since then until we are here now with version 6.11. See below for a general guide on what it is and why it could help you. This comparison was built using Perplexity Computer over multiple iterations doing extensive market research on other plugins and capabilities.  \n  \nI've been working on opencode-swarm for a while now and figured I'd share what it actually does and why it exists.\n\nThe short version: most multi-agent coding tools throw a bunch of agents at your codebase in parallel and hope for the best. That works fine for demos. It falls apart on real projects where a bad merge or a missed security hole costs you a week of debugging.\n\nopencode-swarm does the opposite. One task at a time. Every task goes through a full QA gauntlet before the next one starts. Syntax validation (tree-sitter across 9 languages), static security analysis (63+ OWASP rules), placeholder/slop detection, secret scanning, lint, build check, then a reviewer on a *different model* than the coder, then a test engineer that writes both verification AND adversarial tests against your code. Only after all of that passes does the plan move forward.\n\nThe agents aren't generic workers either. There are 9 of them with actual permission boundaries. The Explorer can't write code. The SME can't execute anything. The Critic only reviews plans. The Architect owns the plan and delegates everything. Nobody touches what they shouldn't.\n\nSome stuff that took a lot of iteration to get right:\n\n* **Critic gate**: the plan gets reviewed by a separate agent before any code gets written. Prevents the most expensive failure mode, which is perfectly executing a bad plan\n* **Heterogeneous models**: coder and reviewer run on different LLMs on purpose. Different models have different blind spots, and this catches stuff single-model setups miss\n* **Retrospectives**: at the end of each phase, execution metrics (revisions, rejections, test failures) and lessons learned get captured and injected into the architect's prompt for the next phase. The swarm actually learns from its own mistakes within a project\n* **Everything persists**: plan.json, [context.md](http://context.md), evidence bundles, phase history. Kill your terminal, come back tomorrow, pick up exactly where you left off\n* **4,008 tests** on the plugin itself. Not the projects it builds. On the framework\n\nThe tradeoff is real. It's slower than parallel approaches. If you want 5 agents banging out code simultaneously, this isn't that. But if you've ever had an AI tool generate something that looked right, passed a vibe check, and then blew up in production... that's the problem this solves.\n\n**How it compares to other stuff out there**\n\nThere's a lot of multi-agent tooling floating around right now so here's how I see the landscape:\n\n**Swarm Tools (opencode-swarm-plugin)** is the closest competitor and honestly a solid project. Their focus is speed through parallelism: break a task into subtasks, spawn workers, file reservations to avoid conflicts. They also have a learning system that tracks what strategies worked. Where we differ is philosophy. Their workers are generic and share the same model. Mine are specialized with different models on purpose. They have optional bug scanning after the fact. I have 15+ QA gates that run on every single task before it moves on. If you want fast, go Swarm Tools. If you want verified, this is the one.\n\n**Get Shit Done (GSD)** is more of a meta-prompting and spec-driven framework than a true multi-agent system. It's great at what it does: interviews you, builds a detailed spec, then executes phase by phase. It recently added parallel wave execution and subagent orchestration. But it doesn't have a persistent QA pipeline, no security scanning, no heterogeneous models, and no evidence system. GSD is a planning tool that got good at execution. opencode-swarm is a verification system that happens to plan and execute.\n\n**Oh My OpenCode** gets a lot of attention because of the RPG theming and the YouTube coverage. Six agents with fun names, easy to set up, approachable. But when you look under the hood it's basically prompt engineering. No persistent state between sessions. No QA pipeline. No security analysis. No test suite on the plugin itself. It's a good entry point if you've never tried multi-agent coding, but it's not something I'd trust on a production codebase.\n\n**Claude Code Agent Teams** is native to Claude Code, which is a big advantage since there's no plugin to install. Peer-to-peer messaging between agents is cool architecturally. But it's still experimental with known limitations: no session resumption, no built-in QA, no evidence trail. Running multiple Opus-class agents in parallel also gets expensive fast with zero guarantees on output quality.\n\n**Codex multi-agent** gives you a nice macOS GUI and git worktree isolation so agents don't step on each other. But the workflow is basically \"agents do stuff in parallel branches, you manually review and merge.\" That's just branch management with extra steps. No automated QA, no verification, no persistence beyond conversation threads.\n\nThe common thread across all of these: none of them answer the question \"how do you know the AI's output is actually correct?\" They coordinate agents. They don't verify their work. That's the gap opencode-swarm fills.\n\nMIT licensed: [https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm](https://github.com/zaxbysauce/opencode-swarm)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture or any of the design decisions.",

It only uses two models. GPT OSS 20b and some variant of Qwen coder. GPT serves as the architect, reviewer, etc while Qwen serves as the critic, coder, and test engineer. When at home I run 3 swarms, Mega, Paid, and Local. Mega has all the expensive top of the line models, Paid is one step down, and Local is all running here locally. I usually kick a project off with Mega and then let one of the other swarms take over. Or if its a smaller project the other two swarms can handle it themselves.\n\nTLDR I would recommend a minimum of two models NOT by the same company (i.e. dont do Qwen3.5 and also Qwen3 Coder. The plugin prompts are about as good as they can be, but no prompt will solve a blind spot caused by training data. Only a different data set can solve that.",

              "text": "I actually went back and forth with Perplexity about this a few days ago. The below was the result.  \n  \nShort version: it uses about 3-5x more tokens per task than base OpenCode or Claude Code. Every task goes through architect, coder, reviewer, and test engineer instead of one agent doing everything, so yeah, more tokens.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe QA gates (syntax checking, SAST, secret scanning, build verification, placeholder detection) all run locally. No LLM calls. That stuff is free. Meanwhile Claude Code users are regularly posting about burning 10% of their weekly quota on a single plan-mode message because context just spirals.\n\nSerial execution helps too. Only one agent is loaded at a time. Claude Code's Agent Teams run at 7x overhead according to Anthropic's own docs because every teammate keeps its own full context window open.\n\nThe retrospective system also pays for itself over time. The swarm learns from past mistakes so you get fewer rework cycles, which is where most people actually waste tokens.\n\nWhere it genuinely costs more: simple stuff. A one-line typo fix still runs through the full pipeline. That's overkill and I know it.\n\nQuick comparison:\n\n* Base OpenCode/Claude Code: 1x (no review, no testing, no security scanning)\n* GSD: roughly 1x (single agent, good context isolation, but no verification)\n* Oh-My-OpenCode: 2-3x (subagents with lean context, less enforcement)\n* Claude Code Agent Teams: 7x (per Anthropic's docs)\n* opencode-swarm: 3-5x (code comes out reviewed, tested, and security scanned)\n\nThe way I think about it: what matters is cost per correct line of code, not cost per task. If you're spending tokens on rework because nothing got reviewed, you're paying anyway. The swarm just moves that cost upfront into verification instead of after the fact into debugging.",

You can set up a single swarm, multiple swarms, a swarm that is all one model, and there is a defaults file that it will fall back to if necessary, although by default it just falls back to whatever model you set as the orchestrator. The most important part you want to be absolutely sure of is that the antagonistic agents are using different models. So Coder and Reviewer, Architect and Critic. You can prompt engineer all you want but if its the same model it will make the same mistakes. Two models trained on two different data sets will find problems that homogeneous setups miss.\n\nFor an example, I have one swarm called \"laptop\" that I run on my Ryzen AI Max 395+ 128gb system when I'm traveling. It only uses two models. GPT OSS 20b and some variant of Qwen coder. GPT serves as the architect, reviewer, etc while Qwen serves as the critic, coder, and test engineer. When at home I run 3 swarms, Mega, Paid, and Local. Mega has all the expensive top of the line models, Paid is one step down, and Local is all running here locally. I usually kick a project off with Mega and then let one of the other swarms take over. Or if its a smaller project the other two swarms can handle it themselves.\n\nThe last piece that is critical is generating an implementation plan BEFORE you get into OpenCode. I use Perplexity, Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, QwenChat, etc via web chat to bounce ideas off each other until I can generate a single agreed upon implementation plan that is written specifically for the swarm workflow. I then pop it in the directory and tell the architect to implement. This saves a huge amount of API calls just nailing down the plan itself without doing any actual work.",

But honestly, I find its documentation extremely verbose without getting anywhere.\n\nI’m not a vibe coder, I’m a software engineer, and I had to read it three times and still only figured out how to use it by, well… using it.\n\nThe project seems very good at first glance, but being good is not enough if people simply don’t know how to use it, what it’s for, how it actually works… But even worse, what it is. Again, I, a technical professional, had to read it three times and still didn’t understand.\n\nA vibe coder or someone seriously entering the field will try to read it three times and won’t have the knowledge to explore it on their own, they’ll just give up.\n\nAt the moment, my concerns are more about communication than technical aspects. I need to test it much more, I’ll integrate it into the workflow of smaller projects at my company and see how it performs.\n\nI liked the suggestion of using models from different companies for tasks like QA, that perspective is usually ignored in this kind of workflow and you were spot on there, congratulations. There’s no point in asking the GLM to verify whether the code it wrote is good, it’s the same as asking me if the code I wrote is good, my answer will be “obviously, I wrote it.”\n\nNow a question: I know they’re different proposals but the end goal is the same, how do you position yourself in relation to the GitHub Spec Kit? Yours feels much more “vibe coder vibe” (sorry for the pun), Spec Kit involves a lot of manual action and direct user inference, yours seems more automated, fine, different proposals. But have you compared the final results both methods produce? It seems like something interesting to analyze.\n\nIn any case, I hope to see this project evolve further over time.

I bounce between Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, QwenChat, Deepseek, all via their web chat and build a single implementation plan they all agree on. I give all of them a gitingest of my swarm plugin so they understand the workflow and can build the implementation plan specifically for it. AFAIK spec kit stops when it comes to creating actual code, which is where this plugin picks it up. It is about creating the highest quality code possible, but it can still be impacted by garbage in garbage out.

As of today, it is feature-rich, supports ALL providers, is highly customizable, and has a web interface too.\n\nVery nice.\n\nAll the companies that have been blocked by Anthropic's Terms of Service will need to find a more open and cheaper solution. The combination of OpenCode, GLM-5, and Fireworks Al is a solid option if you are frustrated by Anthropic's API token costs but don't want to compromise on quality for your users.\n\nWe are going to adopt this stack, and it is clear to me that options will only increase.

          "text": "This study gave me a moment of genuine doubt about something I’ve been building… I’m working on a tool called Vist, a note-taking and task management app with an MCP server that gives AI assistants persistent memory across sessions. The whole premise is that context makes AI more useful. So naturally, reading that context files “tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context” and increase inference cost by over 20% was… not ideal timing. 🫣\n\nAm I building something counterproductive?\n\nAfter sitting with it for a bit, I don’t think so, and the paper actually explains why. The problem with AGENTS.md files isn’t context per se, it’s static, monolithic, often auto-generated descriptions that pile on “unnecessary requirements” and push agents toward broad exploration when they should stay focused. The paper’s own conclusion is that human-written files should “describe only minimal requirements.” That’s not an argument against context. That’s an argument against noise.\nWhat Vist tries to do is structurally different: recent and dynamic context (what you’ve been working on, what decisions were made this week), things you deliberately chose to persist rather than LLM-generated summaries of your entire codebase, and short actionable snapshots rather than architectural essays.\nThe study’s behavioral finding actually supports this: agents did follow instructions in context files, they just got misled by noisy or overly prescriptive ones. The problem is signal quality, not context as a concept.\nIf anything, the paper is a useful reminder to keep Vist’s loaded context tight. The temptation when building a memory system is to surface more, always more. The right instinct is probably the opposite: surface less, surface it well, make sure it’s current. \nA lesson I’ll almost certainly have to learn twice. 😬",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI've been working on [**True-Mem**](https://github.com/rizal72/true-mem), a plugin that gives OpenCode persistent memory across sessions - **completely automatically**.  \nI made it for myself, taking inspiration from [PsychMem](https://github.com/muratg98/psychmem), but I tried to adapt it to my multi-agent workflow (I use [oh-my-opencode-slim](https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim) of which I am an active contributor) and my likings, trying to minimize the flaws that I found in other similar plugins: it is much more restrictive and does not bloat your prompt with useless false positives. It's not a replacement for *AGENTS.md*: it is another layer of memory!  \nI'm actively maintaining it simply because **I use it**...\n\n# The Problem\n\nIf you've ever had to repeat your preferences to your AI assistant every new session - \"I prefer TypeScript\", \"Never use var\", \"Always run tests before commit\" - you know the pain. The AI forgets everything you've already told it.\n\nOther memory solutions require you to manually tag memories, use special commands, or explicitly tell the system what to remember. That's not how human memory works. Why should AI memory be any different?\n\n# The Solution\n\n**True-Mem** is **100% automatic**. Just have a normal conversation with OpenCode. The plugin extracts, classifies, stores, and retrieves memories without any intervention:\n\n* No commands to remember\n* No tags to add\n* No manual storage calls\n* No special syntax\n\nIt works like your brain: you talk, it remembers what matters, forgets what doesn't, and surfaces relevant context when you need it.\n\n# What Makes It Different\n\nIt's modeled after cognitive psychology research on human memory:\n\n* **Atkinson-Shiffrin Model** \\- Classic dual-store architecture (STM/LTM) with automatic consolidation based on memory strength\n* **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve** \\- Temporal decay for episodic memories using exponential decay function; semantic memories are permanent\n* **7-Feature Scoring Model** \\- Multi-factor strength calculation: Recency, Frequency, Importance, Utility, Novelty, Confidence, and Interference penalty\n* **Memory Reconsolidating** \\- Conflict resolution via similarity detection (Jaccard coefficient) with three-way handling: duplicate, complement, or conflict\n* **Four-Layer Defense System** \\- False positive prevention via Question Detection, Negative Pattern filtering (10 languages), Sentence-Level Scoring, and Confidence Thresholds\n* **ACT-R inspired Retrieval** \\- Context-aware memory injection based on current task, not blind retrieval\n\n# Signal vs Noise: The Real Difference\n\nMost memory plugins store **anything** that matches a keyword. \"Remember\" triggers storage. That's the problem.\n\nTrue-Mem understands **context and intent**:\n\n|You say...|Other plugins|True-Mem|Why|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\"I remember when we fixed that bug\"|❌ Stores it|✅ Skips it|You're recounting, not requesting storage|\n|\"Remind me how we did this\"|❌ Stores it|✅ Skips it|You're asking AI to recall, not to store|\n|\"Do you remember this?\"|❌ Stores it|✅ Skips it|It's a question, not a statement|\n|\"I prefer option 3\"|❌ Stores it|✅ Skips it|List selection, not general preference|\n|\"Remember this: always run tests\"|✅ Stores it|✅ Stores it|Explicit imperative to store|\n\nAll filtering patterns work across **10 languages**: English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, and Russian.\n\nThe result: a clean memory database with **actual preferences and decisions**, not conversation noise.\n\n**Scope Behavior**:\n\nBy default, explicit intent memories are stored at **project scope** (only visible in the current project). To make them **global** (available in all projects), include a global scope keyword anywhere in your phrase:\n\n|Language|Global Scope Keywords|\n|:-|:-|\n|**English**|\"always\", \"everywhere\", \"for all projects\", \"in every project\", \"globally\"|\n|**Italian**|\"sempre\", \"ovunque\", \"per tutti i progetti\", \"in ogni progetto\", \"globalmente\"|\n|**Spanish**|\"siempre\", \"en todas partes\", \"para todos los proyectos\"|\n|**French**|\"toujours\", \"partout\", \"pour tous les projets\"|\n|**German**|\"immer\", \"überall\", \"für alle projekte\"|\n|**Portuguese**|\"sempre\", \"em todos os projetos\"|\n\n# Why not just use Cloud Memory or an MCP?\n\nOther solutions like opencode-supermemory exist, but they take a different approach. True-Mem is **local-first** and **cognitive-first**. It doesn't just store text - it models how human memory actually works.\n\n# Key Features\n\n* 100% automatic - no commands, no tags, no manual calls\n* Smart noise filtering - understands context, not just keywords (10 languages)\n* Local-first - zero latency, full privacy, no subscription\n* Dual-scope memory (global + project-specific)\n* Non-blocking async extraction (no QUEUED states)\n* Multilingual support (15 languages)\n* Smart decay (only episodic memories fade)\n* Zero native dependencies (Bun + Node 22+)\n* Production-ready\n\n# Learn More\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/rizal72/true-mem](https://github.com/rizal72/true-mem)\n\nFull documentation, installation instructions, and technical details available in the repo.\n\n*Inspired by* [*PsychMem*](https://github.com/muratg98/psychmem) *- big thanks for pioneering persistent psychology-grounded memory for OpenCode.*\n\nFeedback welcome!",

It ranks them by similarity and injects only the top relevant ones into the prompt. Think of it as a smart search that runs automatically before every response.\n\n**Injection:** Memories are injected automatically into every prompt via a <true\\_memory\\_context> XML tag - no user action required. Only memories relevant to the current project and context are included. Core principle: minimal prompt bloat, zero token waste.\n\n**Relevance:** Two-stage filtering:\n\n1. Scope-based: Global memories available everywhere, project memories only in that project's worktree\n2. Similarity scoring: Jaccard compares query tokens vs memory content, returns top-k matches\n\n**Bonus:** Four-layer defense against false positives during extraction (question detection, negative patterns, multi-keyword validation, confidence threshold). Still refining to reduce noise (e.g., removing \"bugfix\" diaries that add little value).\n\n**EDIT:** Ah! In the last update I've also added a direct command (list-memories) that lists all the memories injected in the current prompt, grouped by GLOBAL and PROJECT scope. If you are unhappy of some memory you can always ask the AI assistant to delete it from the **true-mem** db and it will do it ;)  \nNext update will manage the \\[bugfix\\] category quite differently, maybe even deprecating it, I'm working on it right now...",

It's token-based similarity (Jaccard), not true semantic search with neural embeddings.\n\nHistory: Early versions of true-mem, used u/huggingface with a local model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, \\~43MB) for true semantic embeddings. It worked but caused stability issues - OpenCode crashed on exit due to cleanup problems with the Transformers.js runtime.\n\nThe current Jaccard approach was a pragmatic swap: zero dependencies, zero native code, instant startup.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Tokenize query and memory summaries into word sets\n2. Calculate Jaccard = intersection / union\n3. Rank by similarity score, return top-k\n\nTrade-off: Catches exact word matches well, but won't find synonyms (e.g., \"error\" won't match \"exception\"). For a coding assistant context, this is usually sufficient - technical terms are fairly consistent, and the zero-dependency benefit outweighs the semantic gap.",
