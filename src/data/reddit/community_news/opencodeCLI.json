      "text": "Opencode's newest [privacy policy](https://opencode.ai/legal/privacy-policy), which went into effect December 16th, is extremely concerning. It is the polar opposite of their previous stance with not holding any data except for Anthropic and OpenAI's 30-day retention period, and should be especially concerning to all users who use zen or are planning to use the new black subscription.\n\nIt basically states that they collect all usage data, can store it \"as long as necessary,\" and they can share it with service providers, business partners, authorized third parties, government/law encforcement when required, and explicitly state that they will use it for marketing purposes. I was actually planning on switching to Opencode black from my Claude Pro plan, but at the very least Claude gives you a very clear 30-day retention number and provide *some* protections against using the data for marketing purposes. If you care about privacy at all, please spread the word and urge the Opencode team to at least make more clear their data retention policies or even try to change their stance on privacy completely.",

Other days I had meetings and other distractions, so on average, about 6-8 hours a day. \n* I don't do the silly 10 agents generating tons of slop thing. I iterate with the LLM on detailed specifications and get one or two agents working on those. While those are running, I review code, test, and sometimes use a third agent for small tasks. ",

Hope it lasts.",

I think omo pre jan was the sweet spot for me. The balance really was deep planning and simple execution, but now the planning and execution both feel bloated out and heavy with waterboarding token usage. \n\nI've since reverted back to standard open code and I'm just a bit more picky on model selection dependent on the use case. I miss the deeper planning modes but you can get around that with more explicit promoting as well as using memory plugins. \n\nI'll likely take more inspiration from it but I agree it's gone a little over the top in its most recent incarnations",

Those same people who decided to give up their workflow and try Claude code because it was better than what they had are literally the ones who switch more often. Early adopters are flighty.

      "text": "# I wrote most of this post with opencode, as a summary of my migration. And then edited it myself.\n\nI’d been quietly annoyed at Claude Code’s arbitrary, opaque quota limits for a while. I kept tolerating not becuase I feel that I could not live without Opus or Sonnet (I feel most models have become pretty good these days, if you have slightest idea of what you are doing). But because I’d invested in custom commands, agents, and skills for months, and all of that just works for me in claude code.\n\nAnd the thought of rebuilding everything sounded painful. Then the “OpenCode max subscription ban” landed and that was my last straw.\n\nObviously, I had to disconnect opencode from claude sub, but it meant I had no reason left tpo keep paying them $200 (well, already reduced to $100 recently, and bought some other subscriptions with the difference)\n\nNo warning, no clarity, and were reports of accounts being banned for \"misuse\". People might justify it with \"they can do whatever they want with THEIR subscription\", but then \"customers are free to leave as well\". It felt like a toxic dependency: good when it worked, exhausting when it didn’t. I decided to start cutting the cord for good. I spent a few hours learning how OpenCode organizes commands, agents, and skills and realized I could migrate without nuking my Claude setup. That became the mission: keep my Claude assets usable while making them first‑class in OpenCode.\n\n# The three pillars I had to understand\n\nOpenCode is structured around three things, and once I understood them the migration was mostly plumbing:\n\n* **Commands**: slash commands with frontmatter\n* **Agents**: explicit roles with prompts + tool permissions\n* **Skills**: reusable instruction bundles loaded on demand\n\n# Migration strategy (keep Claude intact, add OpenCode wrappers)\n\nI wanted zero rewrites in my Claude files. The simplest path was wrappers + symlinks so Claude stays the source of truth.\n\n# 1) Skills: symlink Claude → OpenCode\n\nThis lets both tools use the same skills.\n\n    # Project\n    ln -s .claude/skills .opencode/skill\n    \n    # User\n    ln -s ~/.claude/skills ~/.config/opencode/skill\n\n# 2) Commands: wrap Claude commands with frontmatter\n\nOpenCode needs frontmatter, Claude doesn’t. Wrappers let OpenCode read Claude commands without edits.\n\nExample wrapper:\n\n    ---\n    description: Enforce code discipline checklist\n    agent: build\n    ---\n    @.claude/commands/enforce-code-disciplines.md\n\nI did this for all project commands (including the `priming/` folder) and all user‑level commands in `~/.claude/commands/`.\n\n# 3) Agents: wrap Claude prompts\n\nOpenCode agents can point to a prompt file, which makes them perfect wrappers for Claude agents.\n\n    ---\n    description: Senior code reviewer\n    mode: subagent\n    prompt: \"{file:~/.claude/agents/senior-code-reviewer.md}\"\n    ---\n\nI wrapped all my Claude agents as **subagents** to preserve behavior.\n\n# Verification checks (how I proved it worked)\n\nThese were the concrete checks that confirmed OpenCode was seeing everything:\n\n    opencode debug skill\n\n* Commands show up in the `/` palette\n* Agents show up in the `@` picker\n* Skills list correctly in `opencode debug skill`\n\nIf skills don’t show up, I enabled them in `opencode.json`:\n\n    \"tools\": {\n      \"read\": true,\n      \"write\": true,\n      \"edit\": true,\n      \"bash\": true,\n      \"skill\": true\n    }\n\n# Bonus: I turned the playbook into a skill\n\nI didn’t want to repeat this on every repo, so I started with asking opencode to write a migration skill that:\n\n* Scans Claude commands, agents, and skills\n* Creates OpenCode wrappers and symlinks\n* Verifies discovery\n\nNow migration is repeatable and documented instead of a one‑off bash ritual.\n\n# Tips\n\n* You can invoke skills by name in plain language. Unlike claude code, you don't have to keep asking it to \"invoke the skill properly\", and not just read a single SKILL.md file (leaving everything else). Open code invoked the skill, and read every file mentioned in it.\n* Skills can load fine even if the UI doesn’t surface them. Use `opencode debug skill`.\n* Wrappers won’t load without frontmatter.\n\n# Final take\n\nIf Claude Code’s limits are starting to feel arbitrary, there is a clean exit ramp. You don’t have to throw away your existing commands or skills. OpenCode can run them while Claude remains intact. I’m now fully migrated without losing anything, and it feels like getting my workflow back.\n\nI do plan to use Claude Code for planning at times, but now I have options.\n\nAnd honestly, I was only flirting with OpenCode for the last few months, but watching accounts being banned by Anthropic because customers didn't like their tooling, was a dic\\* move. And it made me realise that I just can't let myself be fully dependent on such a company.\n\nNow, if Anthropic suddenly decides to ban my account for some random reason, I can just walk away without being devastated.\n\nEven if Opus4.5, I have to spend time ensuring that the code is as per my preferences and standards. So for me, the loss would have been leaving behind the workflow that just worked for me. But now it seems that OpenCode is the best place for it to fit one-to-one.\n\nIf anyone wants the playbook or migration skill, here you go:\n\n[https://github.com/SmrutAI/opencode-migration](https://github.com/SmrutAI/opencode-migration)\n\nJust install it, and it migrates everything.\n\n  \nWill soon include a way to reuse Claude's settings.json and hooks, which are the last bit of attachment I have with Claude.

Or fight the users to ensure they stick with the CC CLI.\n\nThe problem is that more and more people use OC and get really pissed if they could no longer use OC and CC. Most people will drop Anthropic if they stand in front of the choice to use CC or stick with OC and leave.\n\nThis choice is a no trainer. Sticking with CC, you get a few great models and a rather poor CLI. Sure Anthropic could work on their cli but they already showed their will for an exclusive strategy. \n\nUsing OC, you can use ONE workflow and config and access plenty of models without being bound to a single vendor: no vendor lock-in.\n\nModels are racing ATM and it is not possible to say that model XYZ is \"the best\". So users will HAVE to use multiple models from multiple vendors to remain competitive. This is precisely what OC allows and CC wants to prevent.\n\nAnthropic is at a turning point and needs to make a smart choice if they want to avoid losing all their customers...\nFor now, existing customers leave or live in fear. New customers are scared to even join the battle.\n\nThis is all but healthy and ok plays strongly against Anthropic.\nTry bringing that up in their sub, you get censored. Ask me how I know.\n\nI personally don't want to \"live in fear\" **SO** I will stick with OC. \nIf Anthropic allows, I will keep paying for their models. If not, it won't change much for me and I will just switch OC to use another model or set of models.

Free tiers are nice for experimentation, but for serious backend work predictability > freebies.\n\nWhat worked for me was building around a paid coding plan with known limits as the backbone, and then treating fast/free models like Big Pickle as opportunistic accelerators. Opus (or similar) sets the architecture, GLM 4.7 and Big Pickle handles the implementation and refactor loops, and anything else fast just rides on top.\n\nIf you’re looking for something closer to a predictable, paid plan rather than a gamble on a free endpoint, Zai has coding plans where you can still get 50% discount for first year + 30% discount (current offers + additional 10% coupon code) but I think it will expire soon (some offers are already gone!) > [https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=TLDEGES7AK](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=TLDEGES7AK)",

Got frustrated enough to build my own solution.\n\n0.9 version\n\nSo I made \\[opencode-orchestrator\\]([https://github.com/agnusdei1207/opencode-orchestrator](https://github.com/agnusdei1207/opencode-orchestrator)). It's a plugin for OpenCode that handles:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Parallel sessions\\*\\* — up to 50 isolated sessions running simultaneously\n\n\\- \\*\\*Agent distribution\\*\\* — Commander delegates to Planner, Workers, Reviewer\n\n\\- \\*\\*Background tasks\\*\\* — non-blocking, async execution\n\n\\- \\*\\*Auto-retry\\*\\* — handles crashes, rate limits, context issues automatically\n\n\\- \\*\\*Loop until done\\*\\* — keeps going until all TODOs are complete and verified\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of one agent trying to do everything, split the work across specialized agents that run in parallel and coordinate through shared state.\n\n  \nIf you try it out and run into anything, feel free to open an issue — or since it's open source, just fork it and tinker with it yourself. If you come up with something cool, I'd love to hear about it.\n\n\n\nI think in the AI era, we're all going to end up building our own tools anyway.",

For others coding tests I ran identical prompts through Opus 4.5 (via *Claude Pro* plan), GLM 4.7, and Minimax. Results: Opus best at first-pass architecture, GLM best at iterative implementation (fewer context losses), Minimax faster but not cheaper as GLM.

      "text": "Heyo devs,\n\nBeen thinking on switching to OpenCode from Cursor to save some money.\n\nCurrently I run 2 cursor ultra accounts and I am still burning though limits too quickly. Can‘t afford to keep those costs tho, so I been planning on switching to OpenCode with a few chatgpt/google (maybe glm) accounts. I‘m pretty Sure those would end up being was cheaper for more tokens. My biggest costs is Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThe problem is: I love cursor‘s IDE and I really got used to it. I don‘t really like CLIs (didn’t like claude code too).\n\nAnd sadly I read that Anthropic is now actively attacking external usage of their subs.\n\nI want to test OpenCode (or something similar). OpenChamber is what I found, but thats more like an Chatbox than an Editor if I understood correctly.\n\nI also tried Google‘s AntiGravity but it‘s straight up not the level that Cursor is. And I also read last days that they also started making rate limits worse.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? Is there a good OpenCode Extension? How good is OpenCode actually?\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot to mention, I currently usually work like this:\n\nI first let a cheaper model do some research in the project based on a task. Then use Opus to create a plan and iterate till it creates a plan that follows what I want. Then I execute this plan with either composer, if I want it fast, or Gemini Flash 3, if I want it cheap (there is no other cheap model on cursor that‘s also good, flash is the 2nd cheapest next to GPT 5 nano on cursor, afaik). If Gemini fails, I also let it run though Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet and Opus itself, depending on the situation and project.\n\nEDIT 2 (18.01.2026):\n\nI tried OpenCode, added my ChatGPT Sub, Google Sub and GitHub Copilot Sub (got most of it for free because I am a student). It generally worked good, but I still don‘t really like working in the CLI. It just doesn‘t give me the User Experience and viewing that an Editor like Cursor gives me. I also tried OpenCode Desktop and that‘s also not optimal.\n\nEven tho my credit usage might suggest otherwise: I am not a „pure vibe coder“. I actively manually check all edits, fix stuff manually and code manually. I don‘t let AI do everything by itself.",

For me, the differences in antigravity from cursor for me were very small. \n\nSo now my set up is focused on opencode with the antigravity authentication extension. That gives me access to all of the opus and sonnet usage you get with antigravity. The Opus and sonnet usage you get with a single user is very limited. But, you can significantly increase that by buying a $20 a month family plan to the Google AI Pro subscription. That subscription allows you to sign up five “family members”.  Every family member gets its own unique quota for antigravity Claude models. So if you set this up for $20 a month you get a fairly substantial amount of daily Claude usage. \n\nI also purchased a three dollar a month GLM 4.7 subscription for day-to-day tasks. Together the Google AI pro subscription with the “five family members” and the GLM 4.7  subscription give a very significant amount of usage for low cost. That’s probably enough for most people, but I also have a ChatGPT $20 a month subscription that also hooks into opencode. ChatGPT 5.2 may be slow, but I found it to be very reliable. I have plenty of horsepower for 4 to 5 hour coding sessions.\n\nThis is certainly much more complex than just paying for cursor. But my cursor bills were often exceeding $120 a month. Right now this costs me closer to $40-$50 a month and I don’t feel like I’m losing much. The extra complexity may not be right for everyone, but it works pretty well for me.",

Never used chutes. \n\nI believe NanoGPT uses some cheaper providers to keep their prices competitive, so I end up getting some very big token speed variation. I use mostly GLM 4.7 Thinking nowadays. Hardly for coding, but in the end, there`s not a lot of difference. Sometimes my requests start processing instantly, others times, it seems like I enter a queue. I time the whole request time (from the moment I press enter, to the moment I receive the whole response, I don`t usually use streaming), so I`m not sure of the actual TPS. But if I`d calculate the tokens per second with the whole request time, sometimes I get 100t/s, some rarer cases it`s very close to 10t/s. Usually it`s more in the middle. But I believe this variation is the delay until my request starts getting processed instead of actual TPS variation. These calcs I mentioned were usually done with around 20k~30k input context and 1k~3k output.\n\nI tried the big boys (GPT and Claude) a few times and they seem to respond the same as from the source.\nAll in all, I`m not a vibe coder, I prefer to use mostly tab-autocomplete, which is outside of what NanoGPT offers. So I don`t really mind the speed variation. At this point in time, I wouldn`t leave NanoGPT for any other provider. New released models become available almost immediately. The devs are also always listening to the users and suggestions are quickly implemented (when they make sense).\n\nSo for open source models, I`m of the opinion that it`s the best, in terms of price, available models and support. When it comes to premium models, there doesn`t seem to be much difference from other providers besides some discounts.",

You can also build your own front-end to talk with the server as well and use OpenCode as part of your thing.\n\nOpenCode's another selling point is model agnosticity. You can work with every model with single tool - it's like Visual Studio Code or Neovim of the Agentic Tools. The flavor of the month on the model market will change - perhaps you want to work with OpenAI models. Perhaps you want to work it some self-hosted model as well. Perhaps your workflow consists of using multi-provider models for different things. So if your toolkit is model agnostic, swapping the models that you use does not mean that you have to change your whole workflow - thats the point. For example as a Claude user you're breaking their TOS if you're not using their own clients for their own tools (except the API option, but their API option is quite expensive)\n\nI guess Cursor does that same thing to an extend - but OpenCode is open-source and Cursor is not (this might not mean anything to you, but for other people it does). I can see what the OpenCode does under the hood - and I can even fork it and create my own version of it if I want to. In the end the value proposition of a product is also a preference thing. I prefer to work in terminal, you might not - and you don't have to. Cursor is extremely good as well.",

The key insight is moving tool discovery to runtime instead of loading schemas upfront.\n\nThe problem: MCP integrations are fragmented. Claude Code has native support, most other tools don't. If you switch agents, you lose access to your MCP setup.\n\nBuilt mcpx to bring this pattern to any agent with bash. OpenCode, Aider, your custom setup. If it can run bash, it can use MCP servers now.\n\n\\- brew tap cs50victor/mcpx && brew install mcpx\n\n\\- mcpx  ( list all servers/tools )\n\n\\- mcpx grep \"\\*browser\\*\"          ( search by pattern )\n\n\\- mcpx playwright/click          ( get schema )\n\n\\- mcpx playwright/click '{\"selector\": \"#submit\"}'  ( call tool )\n\nwhy this approach:\n\n\\- Works across agents - not locked to any specific tool\n\n\\- Runtime discovery - \\~400 tokens vs 47k for upfront schema loading\n\n\\- Daemon mode - keeps stateful connections alive (browser sessions, db handles)\n\n\\- Uses your existing MCP config - no migration needed\n\nIt's open source: [https://github.com/cs50victor/mcpx](https://github.com/cs50victor/mcpx)\n\nWould love feedback, especially from folks who've been switching between agents.",
