[claude-plugins.dev](http://claude-plugins.dev) began as an index of public Claude Code plugins on GitHub to help us quickly search by use case. When Anthropic launched Claude skills, we expanded the registry. Now that skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io), we’ve added compatibility for most clients. Today, the registry lists 45,000+ OpenCode-compatible skills, plus a CLI with quick installation and management instructions.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can install Anthropic's popular [frontend-design skill](https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@anthropics/claude-code/frontend-design) with just one command:\n\n    npx skills-installer install /claude-code/frontend-design --client opencode\n\nWe currently sort plugins and skills by GitHub stars and CLI installs, and we’re exploring better ways to rank effectiveness. Upvotes/downvotes are a popular request, but we don’t see that scale.\n\nThe project is [open source](https://github.com/kamalnrf/claude-plugins). Feedback and contributions are welcome!",

If you installed a skill globally (available to all projects), you'll find the skill installed to `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`. Once installed, you can also use the `skills-installer list` command to quickly see a list of installed skills.\n\nWhen you install a skill, your agent loads the skill's name and description just to know what the skill is and when it might be relevant to use it. It is only when your task matches a skill's description that the agent reads the rest of the `SKILL.md` instructions into context.\n\nLet me know if there's more I can help you with!",

When we try and understand why, however, we observe that the problem is one of understanding the effectiveness of these skills. There's many projects on GitHub that try to curate skills and make it easier for people to find ones that work best according to the curator. But the number of skills (and their adoption) is growing fast enough that curation simply cannot scale to solve this problem.\n\nOur restraint in introducing reviews/comments or upvotes/downvotes comes from a place of wanting to solve for identifying effectiveness. One way we're approaching this problem is to see if we can use hooks to track how these skills are used, so we can share this information with skill creators as well as potential users.\n\nWe're open to ideas, though! If there's something on your mind you think we'd find helpful, let us know!",

      "text": "I've been using OpenCode since the early betas and GLM since version 4. During that time I've tried countless prompt patterns and agent designs. Most didn't quite deliver, but a few approaches seemed to work consistently.\n\nA bit about me: I'm a Clojure developer with 5+ years of experience and a Solution Architect for 2+ years. My daily driver is Emacs/Doom. I spend a lot of time doing vibe coding—rapid PoCs to verify architectural concepts and run calculations. When I'm writing production code, I work in tandem with Grok Code and the coder agent.\n\nThese agents are tuned around GLM4.6/4.7 and Grok Code, and I use them every day in my work.\n\n# The Agents\n\n# _arch — Architecture Planning\n\nThis agent focuses on breaking down problems rather than writing code. It uses complexity frameworks and applies a \"bare minimum\" filter to help identify what's actually needed for an MVP.\n\nHow it works in practice: if you don't know System Design at all, it sets a good direction with atomic tasks. If you do know it well, it helps you find blind spots in your solution. Don't treat it as a source of truth, but it's been useful for generating JIRA-formatted tasks with deployment considerations.\n\n# _coder — Code Implementation\n\nAn autonomous coding agent that reads the existing codebase before making changes. It follows the ReAct pattern—reasoning, planning, acting, observing, reflecting.\n\nThis is the most unstable agent. It depends heavily on whether the model actually listens to instructions. There's some copium involved here, but sometimes it does remember about DRY, SOLID, and proper error handling. When it works, it catches more edge cases because it understands the context first.\n\n# _writer — Content Creation\n\nHigher temperature agent designed for narrative work. It goes through multiple thinking phases before writing, which tends to produce more natural prose.\n\nThis is the best creative agent I've built. I use it regularly to edit articles and releases, summarize meetings, and write documentation. It's become my go-to for anything that needs to read like it was written by a person, not an LLM.\n\n# _beagle — Research Assistant\n\nStarts with a query and follows information trails, building connection maps between related concepts. Every fact gets a source citation, and it provides a confidence rating.\n\nThis is my magnum opus. I finally managed to build an agent that does iterative hierarchical web search, properly understanding terms along the way. It's especially valuable for unpopular domains where you need papers from arXiv or Medium posts written by actual researchers working on the problem.\n\n# How I Use Them\n\nI run these agents both as primary assistants and as sub-agents for specific tasks. I also actively use [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) in my workflow — *big* *shoutout to the Fission-AI team*. I even opened an issue to let `openspec-apply/proposal` use the current active agent instead of being limited to just Build.\n\n# MCP Tools I Use\n\n|Tool|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Context7**|Library documentation with semantic search|\n|**zread**|GitHub repository search and file reading|\n|**zai-mcp-server**|Image analysis, OCR, error screenshot diagnosis|\n|**web-search-prime**|Web search with time-based filters|\n|**web-reader**|Converting web pages to markdown|\n|**playwright**|Browser automation|\n\n# Some Observations\n\nSpecialization seems to work better than trying to have one agent do everything. Different temperatures and permission sets for different tasks have been more reliable than a general-purpose assistant.\n\nI've set thinking to English across all agents while keeping responses in the language I'm using—this seems to improve reasoning quality.\n\nThese prompts are tuned around GLM4.7 with unlimited tokens, so your mileage may vary with different models.\n\nRepository: [https://github.com/veschin/opencode-agents](https://github.com/veschin/opencode-agents)",

So my go-to is either OpenCode’s own free models or, for more demanding work, I switch to one of OpenRouter’s paid models. Occasionally, when I need more reasoning power, I’ll use the Claude API through OpenRouter.

Everything happens on-device.\n\nI'm sharing my initial release of openground, an opensource and completely on-device RAG tool that let's you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like and Context7 MCP provide a likely source of truth for docs, but their closed-source ingestion and querying pose security/privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to agents and how it is ingested. Find a documentation source (git repo or sitemap), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.\n\nAgain, this is an initial release, so it is pretty barebones. Upcoming features I am working on:\n\n\\- specific library version handling (it currently only supports latest versions)\n\n\\- docs \"registry\" to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to S3\n\n\\- lighter-weight package\n\nSuggestions and PRs welcome! I'll also be around for discussion.",

I've experimented with this idea and developed a command that allows me to define the type of workflow I want, as well as the prompt. Then, the supervisor agent takes over and passes the task to the planner, coder, reviewer, etc. I'm certain that I can achieve better quality code results this way. \n\nI've posted a brief explanation [here](https://zashboy.com/articles/opencode-supervisor-orchestrating-multi-agent-development-workflows).\n\nDoes anybody else do something like this?

Once you review and approve the spec, the automated flow continues by creating detailed tasks and assigning implementation agents. When the implementation is done, a code review agent prepares a pull request, which you then review.\n\nI have this fully automated and I track the state of everything in dashboards. Whenever I need to review specs or code, tasks are created for me. Everything else runs automatically. Doing this is much easier when using CLI tools.\n\nRight now I only use my editor to read specs and to do code reviews.\n\nA neat trick is that I have scripts that can reopen the exact spec session where the spec was originally created, so I can continue refining it in the same context. This is again much easier to do with CLI tools.\n\nThe goal is to automate the steps where you don't need to be involved.

If there is a way to directly do it in opencode I don't know it.  There might be an opencode plugin out there somewhere that'll do what you ask.",
