And the results were very disappointing.\n\nDespite all these posts, videos and benchmarks stating how awesome minimax m2.5 is, it failed my test horribly given the same environment and prompt, that the others easily passed.\n\nMinimax kept hallucinating various solutions and situations that didn't make any sense. It didn't properly search online or utilized the available documentation properly. So, I wonder how all those benchmarks claiming minimax as some opus alternative actually made their benchmark.\n\nI saw a few other real benchmarks where Minimax M2.5 actually was way below Haiku 4.5 while GLM 5 and Kimi went above Sonnet 4.5; personally it felt like that as well. So at the increased price points from all these providers, its very interesting. Though neither are on opus or codex level.\n\nI did not test the same prompt with gemini, or couldn't test it, to be more precise due to circumstances. But I have a feeling Gemini 3 Pro would be similar to Kimi and GLM 5, maybe just a bit higher.\n\nWhat is your experience with Minimax compared to GLM and Kimi?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been using OpenCode for heavier refactoring lately, but I keep hitting the wall where the native `Compaction` kicks in and the Agent basically gets a lobotomy. It forgets exact variable names, loses track of the files it just opened, and hallucinates its next steps.\n\nI got frustrated and spent the weekend building `opencode-working-memory`, a drop-in plugin to give the Agent a persistent, multi-tier memory system before the wipe happens.\n\nMy main goal was: **keep it simple and require absolutely zero configuration.** You just install it, and it silently manages the context in the background.\n\nHere is what the **Working Memory** architecture does automatically:\n\n1. **LRU File Pool (Auto-decay):** It tracks file paths the Agent uses. Active files stay \"hot\" in the pool, while ignored files naturally decay and drop out of the prompt, saving massive tokens.\n2. **Protected Slots (Errors & Decisions):** It intercepts `stderr` and important decisions behind the scenes, locking them into priority slots so the Agent never forgets the bug it's fixing or the tech choices it made.\n3. **Core Memory & Todo Sync:** It maintains persistent Goal/Progress blocks and automatically injects pending SQLite todos back into the prompt after a compaction wipe.\n4. **Storage Governance:** It cleans up after itself in the background (caps tool outputs at 300 files / 7-day TTL) so your disk doesn't bloat.\n\nNo setup, no extra prompt commands. It just works out of the box.\n\nIt's been working perfectly for my own workflow. I open-sourced it (MIT) in case anyone needs a plug-and-play fix: **Repo:**[https://github.com/sdwolf4103/opencode-working-memory]()\n\n*(Installation is literally just adding* `\"opencode-working-memory\"` *to your* `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` *plugin array and restarting—it downloads automatically!)*",

It does **NOT** delete the actual memory.\n\nThe real \"brain\" lives in `memory-working.json`, which persists with your session:\n\n* It ranks files based on **\"Dynamic Attention\"**.\n* **Example:** If you switch tasks (e.g., from Backend to Frontend), the new files will naturally overtake the old ones in rank after about **7-8 mentions**.\n* The AI’s focus shifts automatically to what matters *now*, pushing irrelevant context down without you needing to manage it manually.\n\n**Regarding Cross-Project Memory:** You are totally right—global memory is the next logical step. I definitely hope to implement a \"Long Term Memory\" layer in the future to handle that cross-project experience!",

Maybe because these tools consume a lot of token themselves and perform often somewhere between unreliable and non-deterministic. Although it is zero config, you often need to remind the model to use it. \n\nSo I went over to write structured documentation and implementation-lists as many others did. I try to prevent to hit the context limit and start a clean session on every phase of the implementation-list. The DCP Plugin keeps the context size low and the structure is defined by agents, skills and templates.\n\nThat's working for me, but others may think different",

If you use DCP in a long, continuous session, modifying history actually breaks **Prefix Caching**, so you lose the speed/cost benefits.\n\n**Also, a big reason for hitting limits:** I'm using GitHub Copilot, and their context cap for Claude seems to be about **half** of what you get directly from Anthropic.

I’m using synthetic mainly because of the promo and so far it’s been noticeably faster than before. I might even stay after the promo expires since their service is a lot better compared to other providers. I feel more secure using it and I no longer want to explore other AI providers because it takes a lot of time and usually requires paying just to try their plans.\n\nThey recently added US-based servers, and one of them is using NVIDIA GPUs. I don’t really understand all the infra details, but performance-wise it’s definitely faster compared to their previous setup. Latency feels a lot better on my end.\n\nOne thing to note is that I think the standard plan is still on a waitlist right now, while the pro plan is available. If anyone wants to double-check, their discord is probably the best place. The devs are active there and they post updates about infra changes, issues and what they’re working on.\n\nIf you want to try it with the discounted offer:  \n[https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK](https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK)\n\nEdit: Based on what I’ve seen on their discord, they’re really focusing on improving and stabilizing the service with their new infra setup and servers. They plan to add glm-5 once the infrastructure can handle more users, since adding it too early would definitely flood the service and cause slowdowns.",

          "text": "Hey OpenCode community,\n\nTL;DR: I’m building UnLoveable, a self-hosted Loveable/Bolt-style “prompt -> docs -> checklist -> agent swarm executes” builder on top of OpenCode. This repo already has a Next.js build UI (Monaco editor, file explorer, diffs, PTY terminal, orchestrator dashboard) talking to a Bun/Hono OpenCode server (SSE orchestrator events, file read/write, PTY websockets, multi-provider LLM). What I need help finishing: a real safe preview/sandbox (not just iframe-a-URL), reliable parallel worker isolation + merging, and better prompt-to-plan output quality so agents produce working code more consistently.\n\nHere’s how my Valentine’s Day went: sitting alone in my apartment in, Georgia, doomscrolling and thinking “why am I paying for yet another ‘AI builds your app’ tool when I’m literally surrounded by an agent runtime?”\n\nSo I snapped and started building a self-hosted alternative on top of OpenCode.\n\nWhat I built: UnLoveable\n\nA local-first “prompt → docs → plan → agent swarm executes while you watch” builder.\n\nIt’s not trying to be a magic SaaS website generator. The premise is: generate the planning artifacts first (spec/UI spec/architecture/registry/implementation plan/prompt), then have multiple OpenCode agents chew through the checklist with tests/validation, with a UI that lets you observe + intervene.\n\nCodebase tour (what’s actually in this repo)\n\n- web/: Next.js (React 19) app with a split-pane build UI (Monaco editor, diff viewer, orchestrator dashboard, SSE event console) + an xterm PTY terminal.\n\n- opencode/: Bun + Hono headless server exposing:\n\n- Orchestrator routes (/orchestrator/...) including SSE stream at /orchestrator/:id/event\n\n- File browser + read/write (/file, /file/content, /file/status)\n\n- PTY over WebSocket (/pty/:id/connect)\n\n- Provider plumbing via Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI + OpenAI-compatible + others)\n\n- workspace/: mounted project directory where generated docs/code live (see docker-compose.yml volume mounts).\n\n- Loop packs/templates: templates/unloveable/, unloveable_loop_v2/ (“Ralph Wiggum static-context loop”: checklist-driven, fresh context per iter, runlogs, validation profiles).\n\nWhat’s working right now\n\n- /build “IDE”: file explorer + Monaco edit/save via /file/content, diff viewer via /file/status, orchestrator panel for editing generated docs, terminal via /pty.\n\n- “Simple Mode” kickoff: start orchestrator → generate docs via pipeline → run checklist executor with configurable workers.\n\n- Real-time-ish updates: the UI listens to orchestrator SSE events and refreshes status/dashboards.\n\nWhere I’m stuck (and what I want help with)\n\n1.\t⁠Preview / sandboxing / “run what we built”\n\n- Current “Live Preview” is literally an iframe that loads a URL you paste (web/src/components/live-preview.tsx). It’s not a sandbox.\n\n- What I want: click “Preview” and it spins up the generated app (Vite/Next/etc.) in an isolated way, then embeds it reliably (ideally same-origin proxied) without CORS/postMessage misery or security footguns.\n\n2) Multi-worker isolation + merging back\n\n- The runner can parallelize tasks; when workers > 1 it tries to use git worktrees (opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts + worktree pool/merger).\n\n- I need battle-tested guidance on merge strategy + conflict handling + how to make parallel agents not trample each other (and what to do when the target workspace isn’t a git repo).\n\n3) Output quality (docs + plan → executable tasks)\n\n- Pipeline doc generation is currently a pretty bare prompt that returns JSON schema (opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts).\n\n- I need stronger prompting + post-processing so the implementation plan becomes “agent-executable” more consistently (right granularity, no deprecated libs, fewer dead-end tasks, better validation hooks).\n\nWhy I’m posting\n\nIt’s 3AM energy, but the bones feel real: OpenCode is already the hard part. This UI + orchestration layer is the missing “Bolt/Loveable experience” for people who want self-hosted + transparent + hackable.\n\nIf you want to dig in, the most relevant files:\n\n- docker-compose.yml\n\n- web/src/app/build/page.tsx\n\n- web/src/components/live-preview.tsx\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/orchestrator.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/file.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/pty.ts\n\nHow you can help\n\n- If you’ve solved “safe preview for untrusted/generated web code” in a product: tell me the architecture you’d use here.\n\n- If you’ve built parallel agent systems: I’d love opinions on worktree/branch/patch-based workflows + conflict resolution ergonomics.\n\n- If you’re good at prompt-to-plan reliability: help me tighten the pipeline so it produces better specs + checklists.\n\nRepo link: I’ll drop it once I push a cleaned snapshot (it’s currently living as this local codebase).\n\nIf you’ve ever rage-coded something at 2AM and thought “wait, this might actually be useful,” please chime in.\n\nThis version does not work yet, but has some much needed architecture changes\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/UnLoveable-parallel\n\nThis version works but has way too much logic in the frontend, and runs loops in series, so it is kinda slow.\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/unloveable-series",

One drawback is that you have to fight with it to work in parallel branches.

Maybe someone with a similar setup could enlighten me.\n\nHalf time I use Opus (Rest of the time still burning my Azure Credits on codex), but after all this discussions of TOS Violations with Antigravity and CC and some further issues I canceled there.\n\nI read that Opencode is accepted as a 3rd Party Agent with GitHub Copilot. (Hope it's true) So I gave it a go.\n\nStill the context size restriction nags a bit, but I think maybe it is time to work less \"sloppy\". I created some workflow (Skills and Agents) for me to work intensively with subagents. Currently only for creating docs, onboarding projects and creating execution plans.\n\nI checked the billing and verified that my workflow only get charged one premium request per prompt, but in the background tools and subs are consuming a hell of a lot of tokens on single premium request.\n\nAre there any limits I shall take care of? I mean this could be really maxxed out by using the Question-Tool and Subagents etc. Dont wanna risk my companies Github Account.\n\nAny experience or hints ?\n\nEDIT: After someone posted about suspension I searched and found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if\\_you\\_create\\_a\\_long\\_todo\\_list\\_in\\_agent\\_mode\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1r0wimi/if_you_create_a_long_todo_list_in_agent_mode_you/)  Very Interesting.

Found out, that saving tokens using Subs isn't that easy. Prompting this thoroughly is a piece of work on its own.\n\nAnyway, I thought it might be a good Idea to structure work and docs a bit better, so that I could easily start new sessions and work in the model's sweet spot below 128k - instead of hitting the compaction border like a vibe coder on regular basis.

No React, Vue, Alpine, etc.\n- **Static**: Must work as a static file (no server-side logic)\n- **Self-hostable**: Drop into Vercel as `index.html` or paste into CodePen\n\n### Quality Bar\n\nThis is NOT a simple landing page. It should feel like it was commissioned by a world-class brand agency. Include:\n\n**Visual craft:**\n\n- Scroll-triggered reveals with Intersection Observer (not scroll events -- use IO for performance)\n- Parallax depth on at least 2 layers (background moves slower than foreground)\n- Typography that has character -- mix of serif and sans, large display type with tight tracking\n- Color palette of 3-4 tones maximum, applied with intention (not rainbow)\n- Subtle animated texture or grain overlay via CSS (repeating SVG noise, pseudo-element with opacity)\n\n**Interaction:**\n\n- Cursor that responds subtly (not gimmicky -- a small dot or trail at most)\n- Hover states that feel intentional (transforms, not just color changes)\n- Navigation that changes opacity/style on scroll\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n- Hero section with large, centered typographic statement\n- At minimum 5 distinct sections with scroll transitions between them\n- Footer with subtle details (coordinates, a fictional address, a motto in a second language)\n- A moment of surprise -- one section that does something unexpected (inverted colors, a canvas animation, text that rearranges)\n- Scent \"notes\" (top/heart/base) revealed on scroll as floating pills\n- Canvas particle system simulating mist/smoke drifting upward\n- CSS blurs that shift as you scroll (backdrop-filter manipulation)\n\n**Polish details:**\n\n- `font-display: swap` on any web fonts\n- `will-change: transform` on animated elements\n- Smooth scroll behavior on `html`\n- Mobile-responsive (flexbox/grid, no fixed px widths on containers)\n- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for accessibility\n```",

It doesn’t just give you \"alerts\"; it actually identifies and delivers exploits to prove where your vulnerabilities are.\n\n# Why this matters for OpenCode users:\n\nUntil now, Shannon was mostly a standalone powerhouse. With the **opencode-shannon-plugin**, you can now bake security auditing right into your agentic workflow.\n\n* **Security-First Vibe Coding:** Stop treating security as an afterthought.\n* **Autonomous Audits:** Let Shannon scan your PRs and local codebase for exploits before you ever hit \"merge.\"\n* **Zero Friction:** It integrates directly via the OpenCode plugin system.\n\n# How to get it:\n\nThe plugin is hosted on GitHub by **vichhka-git**: 👉[https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin](https://github.com/vichhka-git/opencode-shannon-plugin)\n\n**Quick Install (usually):**\n\n1. Clone/Add the plugin to your `.opencode/plugin/` directory.\n2. Restart OpenCode.\n3. (Check the README for specific environment variables needed for the Shannon core).\n\nHuge props to the dev for making this bridge. It makes the \"full-stack\" agentic dream feel a lot more production-ready.\n\n**Has anyone tried running it against their current projects yet? Curious to see what kind of exploits it's catching in AI-generated code!**",

If you're looking for static code security auditing or SAST, this isn't it; if you need to pentest deployed applications, it might be useful.\n\nThis post conflates the original Shannon's capabilities (which DO include source code analysis for \"scan your PRs\") with this simplified plugin (which only does black-box network pentesting). The plugin author appears to have built a thin wrapper around Shannon's attack tools without implementing the source analysis capabilities that would make the \"scan your PRs\" claim true. Shrug.",

Since yesterday (version 1.2.0+), opencode migrated from storing sessions in JSON files to using a SQLite database. I’ve updated ocmonitor to support this change.\n\nI also added a hierarchy view to show subagents as part of the parent session, and monitoring of output rate (TPS) to give an indication of model performance.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or bug reports (preferably via GitHub). PRs and contributions are also welcome.  \n[https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share](https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share)",

          "text": "Simple answer: 5.3-Codex works a bit better in Codex when it comes to the overall quality of the work. However it is much, much nicer to use in Opencode Desktop on Windows. If you are on Windows then the best way to use native codex is the codex plugin in VSCode. However, Opencode Desktop is just much nicer to use, more transparent, more configurable and honestly just more fun. This might change when OpenAI stops gooning over Mac and finally decide to support the most used business OS in the world with their desktop app. I dislike Windows but it's what we use at work as does almost everybody.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a tool called **opencode-kanban** to manage multiple OpenCode sessions and Git worktrees.\n\nThe project is essentially a mixture of two existing concepts, aiming to fix the friction I felt with both:\n\n1. **The Functionality (vs. Agent of Empires):** Like [*Agent of Empires*](https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires), this manages multiple agents through tmux sessions. However, I built this because I found AoE a bit clunky for my daily workflow. I wanted something more ergonomic - offering more features like task tracking.\n2. **The Workflow (vs. Vibe Kanban):** I loved the visual organization of [*Vibe Kanban*](https://www.vibekanban.com/), but I didn't want to leave the terminal. This project brings that Kanban view (Todo/Doing/Done) directly into the CLI.\n3. **OpenCode-Only:** Most importantly, because this is built *exclusively* for OpenCode, it doesn't suffer from the friction of tools trying to support every agent out there. Tapping directly into the OpenCode API unlocks a much more tailored experience, giving you native features like automatic session attaching and built-in todo tracking.\n\n**The Result:** A TUI-first experience that lets you manage parallel work streams visually, while still allowing you to stick with the native OpenCode TUI inside auto-managed tmux sessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24kvmv98fdkg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9851e35ad1ddb7aef473b49b067887488f9581dc\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/qrafty-ai/opencode-kanban](https://github.com/qrafty-ai/opencode-kanban)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",
