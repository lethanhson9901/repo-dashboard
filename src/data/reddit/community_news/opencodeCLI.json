[claude-plugins.dev](http://claude-plugins.dev) began as an index of public Claude Code plugins on GitHub to help us quickly search by use case. When Anthropic launched Claude skills, we expanded the registry. Now that skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io), we’ve added compatibility for most clients. Today, the registry lists 45,000+ OpenCode-compatible skills, plus a CLI with quick installation and management instructions.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can install Anthropic's popular [frontend-design skill](https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@anthropics/claude-code/frontend-design) with just one command:\n\n    npx skills-installer install /claude-code/frontend-design --client opencode\n\nWe currently sort plugins and skills by GitHub stars and CLI installs, and we’re exploring better ways to rank effectiveness. Upvotes/downvotes are a popular request, but we don’t see that scale.\n\nThe project is [open source](https://github.com/kamalnrf/claude-plugins). Feedback and contributions are welcome!",

If you installed a skill globally (available to all projects), you'll find the skill installed to `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`. Once installed, you can also use the `skills-installer list` command to quickly see a list of installed skills.\n\nWhen you install a skill, your agent loads the skill's name and description just to know what the skill is and when it might be relevant to use it. It is only when your task matches a skill's description that the agent reads the rest of the `SKILL.md` instructions into context.\n\nLet me know if there's more I can help you with!",

When we try and understand why, however, we observe that the problem is one of understanding the effectiveness of these skills. There's many projects on GitHub that try to curate skills and make it easier for people to find ones that work best according to the curator. But the number of skills (and their adoption) is growing fast enough that curation simply cannot scale to solve this problem.\n\nOur restraint in introducing reviews/comments or upvotes/downvotes comes from a place of wanting to solve for identifying effectiveness. One way we're approaching this problem is to see if we can use hooks to track how these skills are used, so we can share this information with skill creators as well as potential users.\n\nWe're open to ideas, though! If there's something on your mind you think we'd find helpful, let us know!",

This is the first time I'm seeing this, I've tried re-authenticating and it still doesn't work. Looks like they started actually enforcing the OAuth rules?\n\nDamn, I just started using opencode like yesterday and got it all set up. Knew it was too good to last.\n\nEdit: It still works if I query claude-opus-4-5 or whatever through llm-mux. So they're not actually blocking the OAuth use, it looks like something specific to OpenCode like they're targetting?\n\nWould love to know if you guys have any workarounds/alternatives. What do you all use? I honestly didn't know about these OAuth workarounds until a few days ago and just stumbled across opencode, and I'm already sad as fuck to see it go. OG claude code interface and plugins kinda suck in comparison and I don't know what to use now.\n\n\n\nEdit again: [https://github.com/xeiroh/claude-oc-proxy](https://github.com/xeiroh/claude-oc-proxy)  in case this helps somebody\n\n`npx @xeiroh/claude-oc-proxy --setup`\n\nMade it based on [https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/10](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-anthropic-auth/pull/10), but using a proxy outside of opencode so it's more portable and can still get updates and stuff, at least until we have a permanent fix. \n\nBeen working great for the last few hours.",

So starting with a clean slate I gave the same prompt in opencode using Claude sonnet 4.7 and also GLM4.7. And in Claude it was sonnet 4.5. \n\nThe output from Claude code was way more general and it came back with questions slightly relaxant but not directly part of the main prompt. Clarifying them gave a broader scope to the task. \n\nOpencode on the other hand, directly provided suggestions for implementation with existing libraries and tools. This was the same/similar output for both the models. \n\nI’m interested to know what workflows others have and how they choose the best tool for the job.

          "text": "I’ve found that almost any tool I use, I can get good code out of it, but it does take some work to get things setup.\n\nSince my earliest trials of agentic tools for coding, I focused on the process and how I give the agents clear guide rails.\n\nI started with GitHub Copilot, as that’s what I initially had access to at work. I got myself a Copilot plan for my personal projects and used the VSCode insiders build so I could play with subagents. I setup a whole team of subagents to research, plan, implement, review and then one “Conductor” agent to orchestrate them all. I immediately found better outcomes no matter which model I threw at it. Mostly stuck to Opus for planning/orchestrating and Sonnet for the rest.\n\nI then got access to Claude Code and ported my same workflow over there. It has better support for subagents, which is nice, and since I was mostly using Claude models, it fit the workload well. The main issue I found it solved over Copilot was that the subagents in Copilot don’t respect the model setting in the agent files, so it only ever uses the same model for subagents as your primary orchestrating agent. I didn’t care for that.\n\nLast week, I decided to give OpenCode a try, as I’ve been hearing good things and had some time off. I rigged up OpenCode with my Claude plans, OpenRouter API, and also got the Z.ai coding plan on sale and added it to OpenCode as well. I ported over my Orchestration pattern and subagents to OpenCode and it worked quite well. It actually respects the model setting in the subagent files, and I really like the granular control of tools and commands.\n\nI initially tested with my standard collection of Claude models (Opus for planning and review, Sonnet for implementation) and it worked flawlessly. I then decided to try GLM-4.7 for implementation. GLM-4.7 isn’t as good at implementation, but it does still get the job done. I suspect that’s because of how strict my subagent files are with instructions about strict TDD and following the plan Opus made. I then have Opus review the code and then do a code review myself.\n\nWith this pattern, I’d say I have about a 95% success rate in getting good code out of almost any model I throw at my issue. It is slow and methodical, but as the saying goes, “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”. I rarely have to revisit a feature or bug fix.\n\nPart of the planning process my Conductor does involves invoking subagents to research the code and hit MCP servers to search documentation, both context7 and web fetching. I do this in a dedicated research subagent as those MCP servers can end up eating 25-50% of a context window. By having the researcher do that and then just return to the conductor with a plan for what needs to be done, I can keep my conductor context clean and concise.\n\nI have the conductor make a multiphase plan for each feature or fix I need. I then have it create the plan with the researcher subagent, and present it to me. I review the plan, agree, and it writes it to a markdown file in a plans directory. I then have it start implementing using the implement subagent, review the code with the review subagent, and finally present the completed code for the phase to me. It pauses at the end of the phase, I review, make the commit, and tell it to move on to the next phase. Repeat this until it’s all done.\n\nWith this, I’ve been able to break down and complete even complex tasks with ease. It has worked with almost any model I’ve thrown it at, but the better models do tend to get the right answer faster.\n\nI’ve open sourced my Copilot setup, but I plan to do the same with my OpenCode setup soon too.",

          "text": "From what I have observed in Codex, OpenCode, and CC, each has its own distinctive strengths. CC offers a highly comfortable user experience: it feels smooth, uninterrupted, and well-integrated. The model quality is also strong; however, the cost is exceptionally high. Moreover, CC can be less effective when substantial codebases require modification, such as in a monorepo. In such cases, it often struggles to locate and navigate the relevant parts of the code. Nevertheless, for developing a single feature, it performs very well and is generally sufficient.\n\nOpenCode, by contrast, provides a similarly pleasant experience to CC. It is more open, updates rapidly, and, interestingly, its outputs can be better sometimes. However, this advantage tends to appear when OpenCode is paired with GPT or other models; for instance, models such as Minimax or GLM still perform reasonably well. When using Claude's model within OpenCode, the results become unexpectedly poor sometimes, and I am not certain why.\n\nCodex performs best when the work involves large-scale processes, particularly within a monorepo. It can reliably execute both small and large tasks, provided that the relevant information fits within its context window. Under these conditions, it produces strong results and achieves significantly higher accuracy than the others. Recently, I tested the same task—integrating a frontend with a backend—using both OpenCode and Codex. Notably, Codex handled the integration more effectively, whereas OpenCode failed entirely. This was especially surprising because OpenCode was already using OpenSpec, while Codex succeeded without OpenSpec and delivered a highly reliable outcome. \n\nHowever, the cost of codex can sometimes be quite high. So, even though the limit is large, because it is extremely effective at capturing the context of the code, the cost of processing of Codex occasionally becomes higher than Open Code. In my view, so far Open Code has been more cost-efficient in token usage.",

          "text": "Interesting observation - I’ve noticed the same pattern.\n\nCC tends to be more “consultative” by design. It’s optimized for agentic workflows where understanding context deeply before acting prevents wasted iterations. The clarifying questions aren’t a bug, they’re trying to avoid building the wrong thing fast.\n\nOpenCode (and similar tools) lean more toward “just ship something” - which honestly works great for MVPs and exploration. You get tangible code faster, iterate from there.\n\nMy rough mental model:\n\n**CC shines when:**\n\n- Complex multi-file changes where wrong assumptions compound\n- Refactoring existing codebases (needs to understand before touching)\n- Tasks where scope creep is a real risk\n\n**OpenCode-style works better for:**\n\n- Greenfield MVPs like your case\n- When you already have clear specs\n- Rapid prototyping where “wrong but fast” > “right but slow”\n\nFor CC specifically, I’ve found adding “skip clarifying questions, make reasonable assumptions and note them” to prompts helps when you want that direct execution mode.\n\nWhat was the MVP btw? Curious if the broader scoping CC did ended up being useful or just noise.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

But on the other hand I get the same amount of story points done, when using Opus on its own.

The better mousetrap catches more mice. \n\nIt would be easy to test one OpenCode coding framework against another. Same prompt, same code, same task. Total token cost, time spent; code works or it doesn't. Subjective self-assessment can be added on top of the quantifiable measures. \n\nI think promoting agent discretion and autonomy and grounding in concepts-as-rules is the foundation for the best frameworks. Enable agents to be adaptable, and maximize their native intelligence and knowledge, as well as the intelligence that comes from emergent complexity in agentic systems.  Having that plus a system for observing and rating agent behaviors and task performance creates an agentic framework that self-improves over time for the specific needs of the user globally and at a project-level. That type of system improves as AI models get smarter and more capable. While rule-heavy and role-heavy frameworks create limitations that can make agents 'stay stupid'.\n\nI'm working on an Agentic Collaboration Framework optimized for legal/medical/financial and advocacy work for my own needs. I find OMO and Sisyphus get in the way of my ACF and have to be manually disabled for my non-coding projects. But for coding projects, I use OMO, because I don't want to have to build my own framework.\n\nIf someone has a better coding framework than OMO, then make a plugin and publish.

That popularity isn't tied to the skill/mcp/etc, which could still be garbage. I don't have a better solution, but initial un-filtered browsing shows me a bunch of resources out of context and doesn't entice me to keep browsing. Like \"why the heck is an 'add admin API endpoint'\" a top 3 skill? What is ghost, why do they need a skill for that?\n\nAssuming some decent popularity, I would recommend trying to track pageview metrics of your summary pages and default sort according to some version of that.\n\nAlso not sure what newest/oldest is based on, but I would (personally) want those tied to the timestamp of the first commit, and maybe add some sort of \"updated\" sort/filter too.",

      "text": "# \n\n**TL;DR:** Anthropic is banning some accounts that use Claude Pro/Max subscriptions through third-party coding tools. Multiple confirmed bans in the last month, though many users report continued success.\n\n# What's happening:\n\nAs of early January 2026, Anthropic is enforcing their ToS against using Claude Code OAuth credentials in third-party tools like OpenCode and Crush. While many users continue to use these tools without issues, **there are confirmed cases of accounts being detected and permanently banned** based on usage patterns.\n\n# Recent casualties:\n\n**January 5, 2026** \\- User banned after using OpenCode with OAuth:\n\n>\n\n[Source: OpenCode Issue #6930](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/6930)\n\nThe issue author explicitly stated they \"reached out to several Anthropic engineers on Twitter\" who confirmed this violates ToS.\n\n**January 7, 2026** \\- Charm (makers of Crush CLI) removed Claude Code support entirely:\n\n>\n\n[Source: Crush PR #1783](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/pull/1783)\n\n# Why this is happening:\n\nAnthropic doesn't want people using $20/month Claude Pro/Max subscriptions as a cheaper alternative to their expensive API pricing. Third-party tools like OpenCode and Crush were enabling exactly that, so Anthropic is shutting it down at the account level.\n\n# What about OpenCode?\n\nOpenCode **still has the OAuth login feature** in their docs and codebase, and many users continue to use it successfully. However, it clearly violates Anthropic's ToS and carries the risk of account termination.\n\nFrom the OpenCode docs (still live as of today):\n\n>\n\n[Source: OpenCode Provider Docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/)\n\n**Use at your own risk.** Some users have been banned, others haven't been caught yet.\n\n# Your options:\n\n1. **Use official Claude Code CLI** \\- Anthropic's sanctioned tool, zero risk\n2. **Continue with third-party OAuth** \\- Works for many, but violates ToS and risks ban\n3. **Pay for API access** \\- Get separate API keys (expensive but compliant)\n4. **Use different providers** \\- OpenRouter, DeepSeek, local models, etc.\n\nWhile many users continue using Claude subscriptions in third-party tools without issues, Anthropic has confirmed this violates ToS and they are enforcing it against some accounts. Whether you get caught seems inconsistent—possibly based on usage volume, upgrade triggers, or manual review.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - the OAuth feature still *works* for most people, which is why it hasn't been widely removed. But Anthropic can detect this usage and has banned accounts retroactively. The risk appears real but not universal.",

Is it expected to see the skill listen when not explicitly mentioning it?\n\nPrompt would be something like: Commit the current open changes\n\nIs my assumption correct of how skills work, or did I not define my skill correctly? \n\nWhat I have at the top of my skill file:   \n\n\n\\---\n\nname: git-commit\n\ndescription: Create a commit message following the best conventions\n\ncompatibility: opencode\n\n\\---",

Remember the primary agent only sees the skill description and decides if he is going to use it or not, words like, `MUST` or `CRITICAL` are loved by LLMs. These would be way more effective than adding instructions to AGENTS.md.\n\nChange your description to something like\n\n`You MUST load me before any commit`\n\nSkill tool exposes all your skills in its description, and thats gets injected into the agent's system prompt, when the agent decides to call a skill it passes the skill name to the tool and it replies back with the content of your SKILL.md\n\nI also recommed that your skills have an instructional language, if you are using Anthropic models use xml tags for maximum adherence, have a look at BMAD code base to see how they write the system prompts using xml tags.\n\nAlso having too many active skills adds cognitive overload to your agents, try to limit that as much as possible. I pushed a PR to OC to filter available skills respecting the new permission system, so utilize that to restrict the number of skills available to your agents. Just released yesterday.\n\nGood luck 🤞",

      "text": "**TL;DR-** With this plugin ([https://github.com/shanebishop1/opencode-command-hooks](https://github.com/shanebishop1/opencode-command-hooks)), you can use your agent's YAML frontmatter to define hooks to run commands before/after the subagent is invoked.  \n  \nHello! Sharing this plugin I made in case anyone else finds it useful :)\n\nBasically, I wanted a cleaner, more declarative way to inject bash hook outputs into my OpenCode sessions after tool calls (particularly after a primary agent delegates to a subagent). You can do this with custom plugins configured for each use case, but I wanted this config to live WITH the subagents I define.\n\nWhile I was setting this up, I also expanded it a bit to be a config parser for defining hooks for tool calls (or specific arguments to a tool call). For example, with a couple lines of JSON, you could set up a notification if the `write` tool is called with a given file as its argument.\n\nSubagent YAML frontmatter example:\n\n    ---\n    description: Analyzes the codebase and implements code changes.\n    mode: subagent\n    hooks:\n      after:\n        - run: \"npm test\"\n          inject: \"Test Output: {stdout}\"\n    ---\n\n",

Everything happens on-device.\n\nI'm sharing my initial release of openground, an opensource and completely on-device RAG tool that let's you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like and Context7 MCP provide a likely source of truth for docs, but their closed-source ingestion and querying pose security/privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to agents and how it is ingested. Find a documentation source (git repo or sitemap), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.\n\nAgain, this is an initial release, so it is pretty barebones. Upcoming features I am working on:\n\n\\- specific library version handling (it currently only supports latest versions)\n\n\\- docs \"registry\" to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to S3\n\n\\- lighter-weight package\n\nSuggestions and PRs welcome! I'll also be around for discussion.",

Then, the supervisor agent takes over and passes the task to the planner, coder, reviewer, etc. I'm certain that I can achieve better quality code results this way. \n\nI've posted a brief explanation [here](https://zashboy.com/articles/opencode-supervisor-orchestrating-multi-agent-development-workflows).\n\nDoes anybody else do something like this?

More predictable, but more overhead to maintain specs.\n\n**Context Driven** (like opencode-conductor): You feed the AI rich project context (architecture docs, conventions, examples) and let it make decisions. Less rigid, more adaptive.\n\nThink of it like:\n\n- Spec driven = giving someone a detailed recipe\n- Context driven = teaching someone your kitchen, ingredients, and preferences, then letting them cook\n\nFrom my experience building dev tools, context-driven works better for iterative work where requirements evolve. Spec-driven shines when you have clear, stable requirements and need consistency across a team.\n\nThe real answer? Most production setups use both - specs for the “what” and context for the “how.”\n\nI’ve been working on something similar with Claude Code workflows (VibeRune.dev) - the sweet spot seems to be lightweight specs + heavy context loading. Curious what use case you’re looking at?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

If you work in a team, there needs to be a clear easy to follow workflow, context sharing, iterations support, etc. With the recent advances of AI coding it is also increasingly important to optimize your feeding right requirements in rather than iterating with an agent.

Once you review and approve the spec, the automated flow continues by creating detailed tasks and assigning implementation agents. When the implementation is done, a code review agent prepares a pull request, which you then review.\n\nI have this fully automated and I track the state of everything in dashboards. Whenever I need to review specs or code, tasks are created for me. Everything else runs automatically. Doing this is much easier when using CLI tools.\n\nRight now I only use my editor to read specs and to do code reviews.\n\nA neat trick is that I have scripts that can reopen the exact spec session where the spec was originally created, so I can continue refining it in the same context. This is again much easier to do with CLI tools.\n\nThe goal is to automate the steps where you don't need to be involved. Less of this admin work enables you to work on multiple features at the same time.",

I only need to create an issue with a tag \\`ai-task\\` and OpenCode completes the work autonomously. Now, anytime I have a quick idea for something I want in my app, I can create a quick issue in GitHub on my phone, and bam, the agents start working on it autonomously. I can provide feedback for changes and reset the label to \\`ai-task\\` and it will iterate the work. You can actually see some of this in action as I've recently connected it to itself! ✌️\n\n[https://github.com/BuffMcBigHuge/opencode-orchestrator](https://github.com/BuffMcBigHuge/opencode-orchestrator)\n\nA few notes - it's not a GitHub bot, it uses personal access token, so you effectively create a token with write privileges to the repos you want to connect to, then run the node app on your local machine or in the cloud so it's always listening to issues in the repos. You will need the project on the same machine as OpenCode and the OpenCode-Orchestrator.\n\nI hope it's useful to some of you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v8pst3xs0cg1.png?width=2260&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0a4b5e7300f30801bc6e8239a42c924b9a76c3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c06befsxs0cg1.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c867be301313e4a7a17a99f698019c003c1d66\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbtz27pys0cg1.png?width=2260&format=png&auto=webp&s=616bb8905ba47488b3871c235a7a833671e98d9e\n\n",
