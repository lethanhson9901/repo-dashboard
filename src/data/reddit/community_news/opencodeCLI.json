[claude-plugins.dev](http://claude-plugins.dev) began as an index of public Claude Code plugins on GitHub to help us quickly search by use case. When Anthropic launched Claude skills, we expanded the registry. Now that skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io), we’ve added compatibility for most clients. Today, the registry lists 45,000+ OpenCode-compatible skills, plus a CLI with quick installation and management instructions.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can install Anthropic's popular [frontend-design skill](https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@anthropics/claude-code/frontend-design) with just one command:\n\n    npx skills-installer install /claude-code/frontend-design --client opencode\n\nWe currently sort plugins and skills by GitHub stars and CLI installs, and we’re exploring better ways to rank effectiveness. Upvotes/downvotes are a popular request, but we don’t see that scale.\n\nThe project is [open source](https://github.com/kamalnrf/claude-plugins). Feedback and contributions are welcome!",

If you installed a skill globally (available to all projects), you'll find the skill installed to `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`. Once installed, you can also use the `skills-installer list` command to quickly see a list of installed skills.\n\nWhen you install a skill, your agent loads the skill's name and description just to know what the skill is and when it might be relevant to use it. It is only when your task matches a skill's description that the agent reads the rest of the `SKILL.md` instructions into context.\n\nLet me know if there's more I can help you with!",

When we try and understand why, however, we observe that the problem is one of understanding the effectiveness of these skills. There's many projects on GitHub that try to curate skills and make it easier for people to find ones that work best according to the curator. But the number of skills (and their adoption) is growing fast enough that curation simply cannot scale to solve this problem.\n\nOur restraint in introducing reviews/comments or upvotes/downvotes comes from a place of wanting to solve for identifying effectiveness. One way we're approaching this problem is to see if we can use hooks to track how these skills are used, so we can share this information with skill creators as well as potential users.\n\nWe're open to ideas, though! If there's something on your mind you think we'd find helpful, let us know!",

So starting with a clean slate I gave the same prompt in opencode using Claude sonnet 4.7 and also GLM4.7. And in Claude it was sonnet 4.5. \n\nThe output from Claude code was way more general and it came back with questions slightly relaxant but not directly part of the main prompt. Clarifying them gave a broader scope to the task. \n\nOpencode on the other hand, directly provided suggestions for implementation with existing libraries and tools. This was the same/similar output for both the models. \n\nI’m interested to know what workflows others have and how they choose the best tool for the job. Or if you have any special prompts that you use would love to heard from you. ",

          "text": "From what I have observed in Codex, OpenCode, and CC, each has its own distinctive strengths. CC offers a highly comfortable user experience: it feels smooth, uninterrupted, and well-integrated. The model quality is also strong; however, the cost is exceptionally high. Moreover, CC can be less effective when substantial codebases require modification, such as in a monorepo. In such cases, it often struggles to locate and navigate the relevant parts of the code. Nevertheless, for developing a single feature, it performs very well and is generally sufficient.\n\nOpenCode, by contrast, provides a similarly pleasant experience to CC. It is more open, updates rapidly, and, interestingly, its outputs can be better sometimes. However, this advantage tends to appear when OpenCode is paired with GPT or other models; for instance, models such as Minimax or GLM still perform reasonably well. When using Claude's model within OpenCode, the results become unexpectedly poor sometimes, and I am not certain why.\n\nCodex performs best when the work involves large-scale processes, particularly within a monorepo. It can reliably execute both small and large tasks, provided that the relevant information fits within its context window. Under these conditions, it produces strong results and achieves significantly higher accuracy than the others. Recently, I tested the same task—integrating a frontend with a backend—using both OpenCode and Codex. Notably, Codex handled the integration more effectively, whereas OpenCode failed entirely. This was especially surprising because OpenCode was already using OpenSpec, while Codex succeeded without OpenSpec and delivered a highly reliable outcome. \n\nHowever, the cost of codex can sometimes be quite high. So, even though the limit is large, because it is extremely effective at capturing the context of the code, the cost of processing of Codex occasionally becomes higher than Open Code. In my view, so far Open Code has been more cost-efficient in token usage.",

          "text": "I’ve found that almost any tool I use, I can get good code out of it, but it does take some work to get things setup.\n\nSince my earliest trials of agentic tools for coding, I focused on the process and how I give the agents clear guide rails.\n\nI started with GitHub Copilot, as that’s what I initially had access to at work. I got myself a Copilot plan for my personal projects and used the VSCode insiders build so I could play with subagents. I setup a whole team of subagents to research, plan, implement, review and then one “Conductor” agent to orchestrate them all. I immediately found better outcomes no matter which model I threw at it. Mostly stuck to Opus for planning/orchestrating and Sonnet for the rest.\n\nI then got access to Claude Code and ported my same workflow over there. It has better support for subagents, which is nice, and since I was mostly using Claude models, it fit the workload well. The main issue I found it solved over Copilot was that the subagents in Copilot don’t respect the model setting in the agent files, so it only ever uses the same model for subagents as your primary orchestrating agent. I didn’t care for that.\n\nLast week, I decided to give OpenCode a try, as I’ve been hearing good things and had some time off. I rigged up OpenCode with my Claude plans, OpenRouter API, and also got the Z.ai coding plan on sale and added it to OpenCode as well. I ported over my Orchestration pattern and subagents to OpenCode and it worked quite well. It actually respects the model setting in the subagent files, and I really like the granular control of tools and commands.\n\nI initially tested with my standard collection of Claude models (Opus for planning and review, Sonnet for implementation) and it worked flawlessly. I then decided to try GLM-4.7 for implementation. GLM-4.7 isn’t as good at implementation, but it does still get the job done. I suspect that’s because of how strict my subagent files are with instructions about strict TDD and following the plan Opus made. I then have Opus review the code and then do a code review myself.\n\nWith this pattern, I’d say I have about a 95% success rate in getting good code out of almost any model I throw at my issue. It is slow and methodical, but as the saying goes, “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”. I rarely have to revisit a feature or bug fix.\n\nPart of the planning process my Conductor does involves invoking subagents to research the code and hit MCP servers to search documentation, both context7 and web fetching. I do this in a dedicated research subagent as those MCP servers can end up eating 25-50% of a context window. By having the researcher do that and then just return to the conductor with a plan for what needs to be done, I can keep my conductor context clean and concise.\n\nI have the conductor make a multiphase plan for each feature or fix I need. I then have it create the plan with the researcher subagent, and present it to me. I review the plan, agree, and it writes it to a markdown file in a plans directory. I then have it start implementing using the implement subagent, review the code with the review subagent, and finally present the completed code for the phase to me. It pauses at the end of the phase, I review, make the commit, and tell it to move on to the next phase. Repeat this until it’s all done.\n\nWith this, I’ve been able to break down and complete even complex tasks with ease. It has worked with almost any model I’ve thrown it at, but the better models do tend to get the right answer faster.\n\nI’ve open sourced my Copilot setup, but I plan to do the same with my OpenCode setup soon too.",

It’s optimized for agentic workflows where understanding context deeply before acting prevents wasted iterations. The clarifying questions aren’t a bug, they’re trying to avoid building the wrong thing fast.\n\nOpenCode (and similar tools) lean more toward “just ship something” - which honestly works great for MVPs and exploration. You get tangible code faster, iterate from there.\n\nMy rough mental model:\n\n**CC shines when:**\n\n- Complex multi-file changes where wrong assumptions compound\n- Refactoring existing codebases (needs to understand before touching)\n- Tasks where scope creep is a real risk\n\n**OpenCode-style works better for:**\n\n- Greenfield MVPs like your case\n- When you already have clear specs\n- Rapid prototyping where “wrong but fast” > “right but slow”\n\nFor CC specifically, I’ve found adding “skip clarifying questions, make reasonable assumptions and note them” to prompts helps when you want that direct execution mode.\n\nWhat was the MVP btw? Curious if the broader scoping CC did ended up being useful or just noise.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Everything happens on-device.\n\nI'm sharing my initial release of openground, an opensource and completely on-device RAG tool that let's you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like and Context7 MCP provide a likely source of truth for docs, but their closed-source ingestion and querying pose security/privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to agents and how it is ingested. Find a documentation source (git repo or sitemap), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.\n\nAgain, this is an initial release, so it is pretty barebones. Upcoming features I am working on:\n\n\\- specific library version handling (it currently only supports latest versions)\n\n\\- docs \"registry\" to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to S3\n\n\\- lighter-weight package\n\nSuggestions and PRs welcome! I'll also be around for discussion.",

Once you review and approve the spec, the automated flow continues by creating detailed tasks and assigning implementation agents. When the implementation is done, a code review agent prepares a pull request, which you then review.\n\nI have this fully automated and I track the state of everything in dashboards. Whenever I need to review specs or code, tasks are created for me. Everything else runs automatically. Doing this is much easier when using CLI tools.\n\nRight now I only use my editor to read specs and to do code reviews.\n\nA neat trick is that I have scripts that can reopen the exact spec session where the spec was originally created, so I can continue refining it in the same context. This is again much easier to do with CLI tools.\n\nThe goal is to automate the steps where you don't need to be involved.

More predictable, but more overhead to maintain specs.\n\n**Context Driven** (like opencode-conductor): You feed the AI rich project context (architecture docs, conventions, examples) and let it make decisions. Less rigid, more adaptive.\n\nThink of it like:\n\n- Spec driven = giving someone a detailed recipe\n- Context driven = teaching someone your kitchen, ingredients, and preferences, then letting them cook\n\nFrom my experience building dev tools, context-driven works better for iterative work where requirements evolve. Spec-driven shines when you have clear, stable requirements and need consistency across a team.\n\nThe real answer? Most production setups use both - specs for the “what” and context for the “how.”\n\nI’ve been working on something similar with Claude Code workflows (VibeRune.dev) - the sweet spot seems to be lightweight specs + heavy context loading. Curious what use case you’re looking at?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",
