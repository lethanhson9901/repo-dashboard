      "text": "Hey OpenCode folks,\n\nJust wanted to say thanks to everyone maintaining OpenCode and keeping it open source. Projects like this are rare. It is genuinely useful in day-to-day work, and it is also built in a way that lets other people actually build on top of it.\n\nI have been working on a cross-platform desktop app using Tauri, and running OpenCode as a local sidecar has been a huge help. Having a solid headless runtime I can rely on means I get to focus on the desktop experience, security boundaries, and local-first behavior instead of reinventing an agent runtime from scratch.\n\nA few things I really appreciate:\n\n* The CLI and runtime are practical and easy to ship, not just a demo.\n* The clear separation between the engine and the UI makes embedding possible.\n* The architecture makes it possible to build on top of OpenCode or embed it elsewhere, rather than having to fork the core runtime. (EDIT for clarity)\n\nAnyway, just a sincere thank you for the work you are doing. It is unglamorous, hard engineering, and it is helping other open-source projects actually ship. I also love the frequent updates. Keep up the great work!",

              "text": "Interesting.. I actually ran into the same “one agent can only do so much at once” limitation, and ended up building a simple orchestration layer into my app to solve it.\n\nThe inspiration for this was OpenClaw’s multi‑agent setup: multiple agents working in parallel toward a shared goal, then folding their results back together.\n\nIn practice my setup looks like: a list of tasks -> one Orchestrator -> multiple worker agents. The Orchestrator assigns tasks concurrently (so research, extraction, code changes, verification, etc. can happen side‑by‑side), tracks progress, and then merges the outputs into a final answer/plan.\n\nOpencode could absolutely implement the same idea. They’d ***just*** need an orchestration layer that can run multiple sessions/tasks at the same time, handle coordination (who’s doing what), and then aggregate results. That’s basically the missing piece between a single agent session and a team of agents collaborating.\n\nThis does not require multiple opencode instances either.",

Note that I almost always exhaust my context usage at the end of a session due to heavy research tasks.\n3. Inference: (I'm on ultra, so YMMV), Almost at par with Kimi K2.5 on Synthetic. Not blazing fast, but definitely an improvement over GLM 4.7 on Z.ai.\n\nIf you are keen to try it out, please check out the writeup above first.",

I'm writing a letter of appeal to Google in hopes that they might grant me a pardon, but I don't expect much.\n\nI would cancel my Gemini subscription and pay Anthropic $400 a month instead if I could so I don't have to worry about running out of my Opus limits, but that's not even an option.

I’m using synthetic mainly because of the promo and so far it’s been noticeably faster than before. I might even stay after the promo expires since their service is a lot better compared to other providers. I feel more secure using it and I no longer want to explore other AI providers because it takes a lot of time and usually requires paying just to try their plans.\n\nThey recently added US-based servers, and one of them is using NVIDIA GPUs. I don’t really understand all the infra details, but performance-wise it’s definitely faster compared to their previous setup. Latency feels a lot better on my end.\n\nOne thing to note is that I think the standard plan is still on a waitlist right now, while the pro plan is available. If anyone wants to double-check, their discord is probably the best place. The devs are active there and they post updates about infra changes, issues and what they’re working on.\n\nIf you want to try it with the discounted offer:  \n[https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK](https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK)\n\nEdit: Based on what I’ve seen on their discord, they’re really focusing on improving and stabilizing the service with their new infra setup and servers. They plan to add glm-5 once the infrastructure can handle more users, since adding it too early would definitely flood the service and cause slowdowns.",

I’m specifically wondering if:\n\n* There’s some other config I’m missing that controls how much work OpenCode does per prompt\n* OpenCode is doing extra planning or background steps even with agents disabled\n* Anyone else has seen similar credit usage and figured out what was causing it\n\nBasically, is this normal for OpenCode or am I accidentally paying for extra stuff I don’t need?",

          "text": "Hey OpenCode community,\n\nTL;DR: I’m building UnLoveable, a self-hosted Loveable/Bolt-style “prompt -> docs -> checklist -> agent swarm executes” builder on top of OpenCode. This repo already has a Next.js build UI (Monaco editor, file explorer, diffs, PTY terminal, orchestrator dashboard) talking to a Bun/Hono OpenCode server (SSE orchestrator events, file read/write, PTY websockets, multi-provider LLM). What I need help finishing: a real safe preview/sandbox (not just iframe-a-URL), reliable parallel worker isolation + merging, and better prompt-to-plan output quality so agents produce working code more consistently.\n\nHere’s how my Valentine’s Day went: sitting alone in my apartment in, Georgia, doomscrolling and thinking “why am I paying for yet another ‘AI builds your app’ tool when I’m literally surrounded by an agent runtime?”\n\nSo I snapped and started building a self-hosted alternative on top of OpenCode.\n\nWhat I built: UnLoveable\n\nA local-first “prompt → docs → plan → agent swarm executes while you watch” builder.\n\nIt’s not trying to be a magic SaaS website generator. The premise is: generate the planning artifacts first (spec/UI spec/architecture/registry/implementation plan/prompt), then have multiple OpenCode agents chew through the checklist with tests/validation, with a UI that lets you observe + intervene.\n\nCodebase tour (what’s actually in this repo)\n\n- web/: Next.js (React 19) app with a split-pane build UI (Monaco editor, diff viewer, orchestrator dashboard, SSE event console) + an xterm PTY terminal.\n\n- opencode/: Bun + Hono headless server exposing:\n\n- Orchestrator routes (/orchestrator/...) including SSE stream at /orchestrator/:id/event\n\n- File browser + read/write (/file, /file/content, /file/status)\n\n- PTY over WebSocket (/pty/:id/connect)\n\n- Provider plumbing via Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI + OpenAI-compatible + others)\n\n- workspace/: mounted project directory where generated docs/code live (see docker-compose.yml volume mounts).\n\n- Loop packs/templates: templates/unloveable/, unloveable_loop_v2/ (“Ralph Wiggum static-context loop”: checklist-driven, fresh context per iter, runlogs, validation profiles).\n\nWhat’s working right now\n\n- /build “IDE”: file explorer + Monaco edit/save via /file/content, diff viewer via /file/status, orchestrator panel for editing generated docs, terminal via /pty.\n\n- “Simple Mode” kickoff: start orchestrator → generate docs via pipeline → run checklist executor with configurable workers.\n\n- Real-time-ish updates: the UI listens to orchestrator SSE events and refreshes status/dashboards.\n\nWhere I’m stuck (and what I want help with)\n\n1.\t⁠Preview / sandboxing / “run what we built”\n\n- Current “Live Preview” is literally an iframe that loads a URL you paste (web/src/components/live-preview.tsx). It’s not a sandbox.\n\n- What I want: click “Preview” and it spins up the generated app (Vite/Next/etc.) in an isolated way, then embeds it reliably (ideally same-origin proxied) without CORS/postMessage misery or security footguns.\n\n2) Multi-worker isolation + merging back\n\n- The runner can parallelize tasks; when workers > 1 it tries to use git worktrees (opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts + worktree pool/merger).\n\n- I need battle-tested guidance on merge strategy + conflict handling + how to make parallel agents not trample each other (and what to do when the target workspace isn’t a git repo).\n\n3) Output quality (docs + plan → executable tasks)\n\n- Pipeline doc generation is currently a pretty bare prompt that returns JSON schema (opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts).\n\n- I need stronger prompting + post-processing so the implementation plan becomes “agent-executable” more consistently (right granularity, no deprecated libs, fewer dead-end tasks, better validation hooks).\n\nWhy I’m posting\n\nIt’s 3AM energy, but the bones feel real: OpenCode is already the hard part. This UI + orchestration layer is the missing “Bolt/Loveable experience” for people who want self-hosted + transparent + hackable.\n\nIf you want to dig in, the most relevant files:\n\n- docker-compose.yml\n\n- web/src/app/build/page.tsx\n\n- web/src/components/live-preview.tsx\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/pipeline.ts\n\n- opencode/src/orchestrator/runner.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/orchestrator.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/file.ts\n\n- opencode/src/server/routes/pty.ts\n\nHow you can help\n\n- If you’ve solved “safe preview for untrusted/generated web code” in a product: tell me the architecture you’d use here.\n\n- If you’ve built parallel agent systems: I’d love opinions on worktree/branch/patch-based workflows + conflict resolution ergonomics.\n\n- If you’re good at prompt-to-plan reliability: help me tighten the pipeline so it produces better specs + checklists.\n\nRepo link: I’ll drop it once I push a cleaned snapshot (it’s currently living as this local codebase).\n\nIf you’ve ever rage-coded something at 2AM and thought “wait, this might actually be useful,” please chime in.\n\nThis version does not work yet, but has some much needed architecture changes\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/UnLoveable-parallel\n\nThis version works but has way too much logic in the frontend, and runs loops in series, so it is kinda slow.\n\nhttps://github.com/unloveabledev/unloveable-series",

If you do things in smaller increments where the model doesn't have to keep building, fixing, and in turn making the context bloat. Just do small directed prompts by giving a file path makes me work on Claude pro plans all day and opencode with kimi 2.5 non stop all day for about $3-$4 but I mean alot of coding. I have let loose when I am lazy and let the model search around but have found out if you give full file.paths and limit it's scope it's better. Be specific on the prompt and the few things it should do. \n\nIn short The plan modes work real well with tight scope and don't let the context go to far as it gets sent again and again. For every new prompt. Start a new session for each file or few files that are related. It's so much faster as well. I do sometimes tell.it to browse my code and suggest things but that for assessments not getting tasks done.\n\nIf I wanted to get it down to less I would even use dumber models for simple refactors. Many cheaper models interpret and debug pretty well when given something to look at but very few models can write something new well. So preserve the refactor assessment document use cases in opencode to smaller parameter models. Now if your asking to write a whole app with it iterating and with context bloat it will burn tokens like a wild fire. \n\nAlso chatgpt free is excellent for code if you give it a full coding document and ask it to fix something. I use that for free and when I want to assess bugs etc. It usually fixes them. I leave sonnet,haiku,and kimi for more agentic coding. It's all about style. I have fit massive coding in the pro plan.

Since yesterday (version 1.2.0+), opencode migrated from storing sessions in JSON files to using a SQLite database. I’ve updated ocmonitor to support this change.\n\nI also added a hierarchy view to show subagents as part of the parent session, and monitoring of output rate (TPS) to give an indication of model performance.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or bug reports (preferably via GitHub). PRs and contributions are also welcome.  \n[https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share](https://github.com/Shlomob/ocmonitor-share)",
