[claude-plugins.dev](http://claude-plugins.dev) began as an index of public Claude Code plugins on GitHub to help us quickly search by use case. When Anthropic launched Claude skills, we expanded the registry. Now that skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io), we’ve added compatibility for most clients. Today, the registry lists 45,000+ OpenCode-compatible skills, plus a CLI with quick installation and management instructions.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can install Anthropic's popular [frontend-design skill](https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@anthropics/claude-code/frontend-design) with just one command:\n\n    npx skills-installer install /claude-code/frontend-design --client opencode\n\nWe currently sort plugins and skills by GitHub stars and CLI installs, and we’re exploring better ways to rank effectiveness. Upvotes/downvotes are a popular request, but we don’t see that scale.\n\nThe project is [open source](https://github.com/kamalnrf/claude-plugins). Feedback and contributions are welcome!",

When we try and understand why, however, we observe that the problem is one of understanding the effectiveness of these skills. There's many projects on GitHub that try to curate skills and make it easier for people to find ones that work best according to the curator. But the number of skills (and their adoption) is growing fast enough that curation simply cannot scale to solve this problem.\n\nOur restraint in introducing reviews/comments or upvotes/downvotes comes from a place of wanting to solve for identifying effectiveness. One way we're approaching this problem is to see if we can use hooks to track how these skills are used, so we can share this information with skill creators as well as potential users.\n\nWe're open to ideas, though! If there's something on your mind you think we'd find helpful, let us know!",

They dropped a Stripe link on X and it sold out within minutes.\n* The next day, Anthropic sent notices with authors of third-party clients (including Crush, a fork of the original, now archived version of OpenCode) asking them to remove OAuth support for Claude pro/max subscriptions.\n* Last night (Jan 8), Anthropic took further action to reject requests from third-party clients. Some users found hacks to work around this, but it looks like Anthropic is serious and many of these no longer work.\n* At the same time, OpenCode teased additional OpenCode Black availability.\n* They dropped another Stripe link (above) on X, but it appears to now also be sold out or at least on pause.\n\nEdit 2: ....and, it's gone.\n\nEdit 3: officialish statement from  Anthropic: [https://x.com/trq212/status/2009689809875591565](https://x.com/trq212/status/2009689809875591565)\n\nEdit 4: not much to update on - they have not yet added any kind of usage meters. I ran into a session limit once that reset in a about an hour. Other than that I've been using as usual with no issues.\n\nFor those asking what models it provides:\n\n* opencode/big-pickle\n* opencode/claude-3-5-haiku\n* opencode/claude-haiku-4-5\n* opencode/claude-opus-4-1\n* opencode/claude-opus-4-5\n* opencode/claude-sonnet-4\n* opencode/claude-sonnet-4-5\n* opencode/gemini-3-flash\n* opencode/gemini-3-pro\n* opencode/glm-4.6\n* opencode/glm-4.7-free\n* opencode/gpt-5\n* opencode/gpt-5-codex\n* opencode/gpt-5-nano\n* opencode/gpt-5.1\n* opencode/gpt-5.1-codex\n* opencode/gpt-5.1-codex-max\n* opencode/gpt-5.1-codex-mini\n* opencode/gpt-5.2\n* opencode/grok-code\n* opencode/kimi-k2\n* opencode/kimi-k2-thinking\n* opencode/minimax-m2.1-free\n* opencode/qwen3-coder",

Long story short, it used to work but now it's blocked by Anthropic, and both OpenAI and Microsoft have since announced that they welcome OpenCode users who wish to use their subscriptions instead of Anthropic's. \n\nThe details are not full clear, but the best guess is that Anthropic is heavily subsidizing subscription users and thus wants something more than money in exchange for the tokens. As they say, if you're not paying (or underpaying) you are the product, and it seems that's the case with Claude Code. My theory is that the MBAs are polishing the books getting ready for the IPO later this year.",

For the web UI, messages are stored so that we can serve them to you later on different devices, but for OpenCode usage this shouldn't matter since it's entirely API-based! [https://synthetic.new/policies/privacy#6-data-security-and-retention](https://synthetic.new/policies/privacy#6-data-security-and-retention)\n\nTPS varies by model and sometimes by use case. For example, looking at our monitoring for GLM-4.7 over the past 24hrs, it averages >100tps... But benchmarking it just now for prose, it's \\~70tps, since the speculative decoder that Zai ships with GLM is more effective at predicting code than prose, so it's slower for prose use cases (generally GLM has varied TPS performance, since the speculator is very fast but when it misses, it slows down; it's still quite good overall IMO). In the SF Bay Area I usually see around \\~1sec time-to-first token, but your results may vary by geography: our API servers are currently hosted in AWS us-east-1. Kimi K2 Thinking averages around 90tps in our logs; MiniMax M2.1 is about the same (although I personally prefer KK2-Thinking and GLM-4.7 to MiniMax).",

We discount requests where the most-recent message was `role: \"tool\"`, and do the same for the Anthropic-compatible API for the Anthropic-equivalent `role: \"tool_output\"`.\n2. Since some tools still send system-initiated \"tool calls\" with `role: \"user\"`, we have a whitelist of message templates that we consider to be tool calls despite not actually using the tool call spec. That being said, that list is definitely not perfect, since it's a moving target — for the most part you should rely on clients that follow the spec!",

I've noticed that it's ability to complete longstanding tasks is still there but the propensity for it to hallucinate is much larger. So to combat that, simply make a plan before executing tasks. Sometimes it's even worth it to do it for short tasks. \n\n\nInstead of asking GLM to complete a task outright, ask it to help you plan a method of action for implementation and to create a file (I usually call it CHANGES.md) that the LLM can use as immutable context while completing the task. \n\n\nChanging this behavior has far and away been the single greatest change that I've made migrating from Claude. I will spend hours sometimes creating a very comprehensive CHANGES.md and then I will ask GLM to implement it in stages checking back in after each stage. \n\n\nIt's more hands-on. It takes a bit more time and effort. But I have found that doing it this way gets me relatively the same results as using Claude. Because GLM is an open source model I can only see it getting better over time so for now I think it's worth investing the time into completing tasks this way. I spent $28 for a year for access to this model that I haven't even come close to hitting the limits on. When using Claude I was stopping every 2 to 3 hours because I had hit limits. \n\n\nVery worth it so far.",

Unless open code implements those same changes, opencode is going to use more tokens to achieve the same output. Of course, the opposite can also be true, but if Anthropic wants to subsidize only usage that's within their control, then that's their prerogative. People need to stop looking a gift horse in the mouth. If you want to cost a company more than they charge you, then play by their rules. Otherwise, pay the market rate for your usage. If you keep trying to exploit them, then you'll end up ruining it for everyone and paying market rate anyway.",

They have a responsive terminal layout, if there is enough space, you'll get a sidebar. You can quickly summon a list of ALL commands it supports and browse the list with a search.  \nPretty cool little features- for example I like the ctrl-x y shortcut, which copies the agent's last message to the clipboard.  \n  \nUnfortunately, I only use it occasionaly, or to try if some model can solve a bug that Claude Code struggled with. Anthropic doesn't want you to use their Claude Code subscription with OpenCode, so using Opus in OpenCode (through the API then) is prohibitvely expensive. And while I toy around with the other models, I just feel best served by Opus..",

Nobody should be surprised that as a U.S. company embroiled in the race to \"win\" the AI wars Anthropic would plug the hole of customers using their services in a way that bypasses a (potential?) revenue stream and do otherwise irrational things that hurts their fringe base.\n\nFact is though that since Anthropic released all of its agents and they are OpenCode compatible, you can still use those agents with other models. The question is, are you going to switch to another U.S. model that is playing the same game as Anthropic and OpenAI? Personally I've been very happy with r/MistralAI. I probably have to be a little more careful, prepare a little  better, and review my code a little harder as a result, but it's a tenth of the price for the API and there's a much smaller chance I'll get the rug pulled out from under me.",

Of course it shouldn't be like that, but it is very common and understandable that such a setup is not your first thought if you start a new project.\n\nThat said, I think it should be standard practice to develop in an isolated container environment anyway these days. Pre-AI it was already dangerous, especially in the JS ecosystem where you install an uncountable number of dependencies via npm. But now, with AI agents autonomously running code on your machine, this potential danger even multiplied.\n\nThis is not a cure-for-all solution but greatly reduces the potential impact of such things.",

I don't have a better solution, but initial un-filtered browsing shows me a bunch of resources out of context and doesn't entice me to keep browsing. Like \"why the heck is an 'add admin API endpoint'\" a top 3 skill? What is ghost, why do they need a skill for that?\n\nAssuming some decent popularity, I would recommend trying to track pageview metrics of your summary pages and default sort according to some version of that.\n\nAlso not sure what newest/oldest is based on, but I would (personally) want those tied to the timestamp of the first commit, and maybe add some sort of \"updated\" sort/filter too.",

So starting with a clean slate I gave the same prompt in opencode using Claude sonnet 4.7 and also GLM4.7.

Clarifying them gave a broader scope to the task. \n\nOpencode on the other hand, directly provided suggestions for implementation with existing libraries and tools. This was the same/similar output for both the models. \n\nI’m interested to know what workflows others have and how they choose the best tool for the job.

          "text": "I’ve found that almost any tool I use, I can get good code out of it, but it does take some work to get things setup.\n\nSince my earliest trials of agentic tools for coding, I focused on the process and how I give the agents clear guide rails.\n\nI started with GitHub Copilot, as that’s what I initially had access to at work. I got myself a Copilot plan for my personal projects and used the VSCode insiders build so I could play with subagents. I setup a whole team of subagents to research, plan, implement, review and then one “Conductor” agent to orchestrate them all. I immediately found better outcomes no matter which model I threw at it. Mostly stuck to Opus for planning/orchestrating and Sonnet for the rest.\n\nI then got access to Claude Code and ported my same workflow over there. It has better support for subagents, which is nice, and since I was mostly using Claude models, it fit the workload well. The main issue I found it solved over Copilot was that the subagents in Copilot don’t respect the model setting in the agent files, so it only ever uses the same model for subagents as your primary orchestrating agent. I didn’t care for that.\n\nLast week, I decided to give OpenCode a try, as I’ve been hearing good things and had some time off. I rigged up OpenCode with my Claude plans, OpenRouter API, and also got the Z.ai coding plan on sale and added it to OpenCode as well. I ported over my Orchestration pattern and subagents to OpenCode and it worked quite well. It actually respects the model setting in the subagent files, and I really like the granular control of tools and commands.\n\nI initially tested with my standard collection of Claude models (Opus for planning and review, Sonnet for implementation) and it worked flawlessly. I then decided to try GLM-4.7 for implementation. GLM-4.7 isn’t as good at implementation, but it does still get the job done. I suspect that’s because of how strict my subagent files are with instructions about strict TDD and following the plan Opus made. I then have Opus review the code and then do a code review myself.\n\nWith this pattern, I’d say I have about a 95% success rate in getting good code out of almost any model I throw at my issue. It is slow and methodical, but as the saying goes, “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”. I rarely have to revisit a feature or bug fix.\n\nPart of the planning process my Conductor does involves invoking subagents to research the code and hit MCP servers to search documentation, both context7 and web fetching. I do this in a dedicated research subagent as those MCP servers can end up eating 25-50% of a context window. By having the researcher do that and then just return to the conductor with a plan for what needs to be done, I can keep my conductor context clean and concise.\n\nI have the conductor make a multiphase plan for each feature or fix I need. I then have it create the plan with the researcher subagent, and present it to me. I review the plan, agree, and it writes it to a markdown file in a plans directory. I then have it start implementing using the implement subagent, review the code with the review subagent, and finally present the completed code for the phase to me. It pauses at the end of the phase, I review, make the commit, and tell it to move on to the next phase. Repeat this until it’s all done.\n\nWith this, I’ve been able to break down and complete even complex tasks with ease. It has worked with almost any model I’ve thrown it at, but the better models do tend to get the right answer faster.\n\nI’ve open sourced my Copilot setup, but I plan to do the same with my OpenCode setup soon too.",

          "text": "From what I have observed in Codex, OpenCode, and CC, each has its own distinctive strengths. CC offers a highly comfortable user experience: it feels smooth, uninterrupted, and well-integrated. The model quality is also strong; however, the cost is exceptionally high. Moreover, CC can be less effective when substantial codebases require modification, such as in a monorepo. In such cases, it often struggles to locate and navigate the relevant parts of the code. Nevertheless, for developing a single feature, it performs very well and is generally sufficient.\n\nOpenCode, by contrast, provides a similarly pleasant experience to CC. It is more open, updates rapidly, and, interestingly, its outputs can be better sometimes. However, this advantage tends to appear when OpenCode is paired with GPT or other models; for instance, models such as Minimax or GLM still perform reasonably well. When using Claude's model within OpenCode, the results become unexpectedly poor sometimes, and I am not certain why.\n\nCodex performs best when the work involves large-scale processes, particularly within a monorepo. It can reliably execute both small and large tasks, provided that the relevant information fits within its context window. Under these conditions, it produces strong results and achieves significantly higher accuracy than the others. Recently, I tested the same task—integrating a frontend with a backend—using both OpenCode and Codex. Notably, Codex handled the integration more effectively, whereas OpenCode failed entirely. This was especially surprising because OpenCode was already using OpenSpec, while Codex succeeded without OpenSpec and delivered a highly reliable outcome. \n\nHowever, the cost of codex can sometimes be quite high. So, even though the limit is large, because it is extremely effective at capturing the context of the code, the cost of processing of Codex occasionally becomes higher than Open Code. In my view, so far Open Code has been more cost-efficient in token usage.",

This evening I switched back (because things went unstable after the releases) and counting the results - I am not convinced that it delivers real value.\n\nWith Opus the context window fills quick and the well designed and well steered subagents promise longer sessions. But on the other hand I get the same amount of story points done, when using Opus on its own. And solo Opus seems to be \"sharper\", maybe because it does not need to perform all these inter agent handovers.\n\nGpt-5.2 has other advantages - rarely missed subagents here.\n\nwhat do you think - anybody made similar experiences ?\n\nEDIT: I am referring to oMo - Oh-My-Opencode - Which is an Opencode Plugin, which provides optimized CC like subagent structure ",

Total token cost, time spent; code works or it doesn't. Subjective self-assessment can be added on top of the quantifiable measures. \n\nI think promoting agent discretion and autonomy and grounding in concepts-as-rules is the foundation for the best frameworks. Enable agents to be adaptable, and maximize their native intelligence and knowledge, as well as the intelligence that comes from emergent complexity in agentic systems.  Having that plus a system for observing and rating agent behaviors and task performance creates an agentic framework that self-improves over time for the specific needs of the user globally and at a project-level. That type of system improves as AI models get smarter and more capable. While rule-heavy and role-heavy frameworks create limitations that can make agents 'stay stupid'.\n\nI'm working on an Agentic Collaboration Framework optimized for legal/medical/financial and advocacy work for my own needs. I find OMO and Sisyphus get in the way of my ACF and have to be manually disabled for my non-coding projects.

I prefer to know if I have 5 minutes or 5 hours of coding left before the reset.\n\nSo, I built [opencode-antigravity-quota](https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3novpv0yp4dg1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=da012cf14f4a65e9c2a73ba20e0ffc8a6c084aa3\n\nIt’s a plugin that hooks into your authenticated accounts and gives you the option to visualize your current quotas and exact reset times directly in the terminal.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\*   Visual Status: ASCII-style progress bars showing usage for models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash, and Claude.\n\n\\*   Multi-Account: Checks all accounts configured via the auth plugin at once.\n\n\\*   Reset Timers: Tells you exactly when your quota resets (e.g., \"Reset in: 2h 15m\").\n\n\\*   Local Cache: Lets you see if you are being throttled locally vs the server.\n\nIt requires opencode-antigravity-auth to work. It’s been a lifesaver for my workflow, so I figured I’d share it.\n\nRepo/Install: [https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota](https://github.com/frieser/opencode-antigravity-quota)\n\nLet me know if you find it useful",

No more switching between apps. You get AI-powered project management assistance right where you take notes and manage your projects.\n\n# Why I built this\n\nAs someone who uses Obsidian for project documentation and notes, I got tired of constantly switching windows to use OpenCode. Now I can write specs, reference my notes, and get AI coding help all in the same workspace.\n\n# Key Features\n\n* **Full terminal emulation** via xterm.js with proper color support, cursor handling, and resize\n* **Theme-aware** \\- automatically pulls your Obsidian theme colors so it looks native\n* **Vault as working directory** \\- OpenCode can see and work with all your files\n* **Image paste support** \\- paste screenshots directly into the terminal\n* **Multiple instances** \\- open several OpenCode tabs if you need them\n* **Toggle focus hotkey** \\- quickly switch between editor and terminal\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Obsidian Desktop\n* Python 3.x\n* OpenCode installed and in your PATH\n* Windows users: `pip install pywinpty`\n\n# Quick Install\n\nRun this from your vault's root directory:\n\n    mkdir -p .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/main.js -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/main.js\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/manifest.json -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/manifest.json\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar/refs/heads/main/styles.css -o .obsidian/plugins/opencode-sidebar/styles.css\n\nThen enable it in Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins.\n\n# Links\n\n* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar](https://github.com/derekross/obsidian-opencode-sidebar)\n* **License**: MIT\n\nWould love to hear your feedback! If you run into any issues, please open a GitHub issue. I have only tested this on my Linux machine, but it should work on Windows and MacOS too.",

      "text": "hey!\n\nanother update on [opencode studio](https://github.com/Microck/opencode-studio). ive been busy with other projects but havent stopped working on it. lots of new QoL and Antigravity/Google related stuff! trying to keep up to date (id want the same antigravity rotation system but for openai's new specific support) but there's an overwhelming amount of stuff coming every day :P\n\nits probably filled with bugs that I havent discovered myself so let me know anything that you find or that you want added!\n\n# what's new:\n\n**usage dashboard (new tab: /usage)**\n\nv1.0.5 had no usage page. now there’s a full usage dashboard that pulls from your local opencode message logs and turns it into token + cost stats.\n\nwhat you get:\n\n* summary cards for total cost, input tokens, output tokens.\n* usage timeline (stacked bars) broken down by model. hover a segment and it shows input vs output cost for that model.\n* cost breakdown pie chart with a legend (and a view toggle when you have lots of models).\n* top projects table. click a project row to instantly filter the whole page to that project.\n* model performance table with input/output tokens + estimated cost.\n\nfilters + exports:\n\n* range presets: 24h, 7d, 30d, 3m, 6m, 1y\n* custom range actually prompts for start + end dates and filters server-side using from/to timestamps\n* project dropdown: all projects or one project\n* export csv (model, input, output, total, cost)\n* save screenshot (exports the whole dashboard) pricing model:\n* studio includes a small pricing table (per 1m tokens) for common models (claude, gpt, gemini, etc).\n* anything unknown falls back to a default rate so you still get estimates instead of blanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g7ppot4w7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=317837cc180e09c5ce42d1b75409b2fac5eef167\n\n**google auth got split into gemini vs antigravity**\n\nif you have both google auth plugins installed, studio treats them as two modes:\n\n* gemini auth: simple, single-account flow\n* antigravity auth: multi-account pooling and rotation\n\nyou can switch the active mode from the auth page. it updates which google namespace is active and keeps the rest of your config intact.\n\n**google account pool + quota tracking (auth page)**\n\nthis is the big new auth feature since v1.0.5.\n\n* add multiple google accounts into a pool (oauth in browser)\n* each account gets a status: active, ready, cooldown, expired\n* rotate to the next available account when you get rate limited\n* activate a specific account manually\n* cooldown an account for an hour if it’s currently burned\n* quota bar shows daily usage %, remaining, and reset timer\n\nthis is built for people who have work + personal accounts, or multiple paid seats, and don’t want to keep re-logging.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4y3qnibw7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=825615b3137da115b44a077687838de4cabecb35\n\n**auth tutorial (first visit)**\n\n/auth can be a lot when you first land there. there’s now a short first-time walkthrough, plus a help button to reopen it later.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buk47rxfw7dg1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=c760e1567c13fbb3ac6d7d4c8a37e84ab06baab2\n\n**one-click profile switching (auth)**\n\nprofiles are still there, but switching is now just a click. it’s the kind of thing you only notice when it’s gone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ps29alkw7dg1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=19279a8da39f864a572502cc5752c93a9833abff\n\n**presets (new feature)**\n\npresets are basically save-bundles and apply it when I need to.\n\n* open presets from skills, plugins, or mcp\n* create a preset with:\n   * name + description\n   * skills list\n   * plugins list\n   * mcp servers list\n* partial selection is supported. you can pick exactly which items are included.\n* apply modes:\n   * exclusive: apply preset and disable everything else\n   * additive: apply preset and keep other items enabled\n\nthe create preset dialog also starts preselected with whatever you currently have enabled, so it’s fast to capture your current setup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqqhs7c3x7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1ff2e341292e0286be235eab6a9bf1083bc2069\n\n**mcp editing in-place**\n\nmcp management isn’t add/toggle/delete anymore. mcp cards support editing the config in place (command/args/env style changes), so you don’t need to round-trip through raw json for common tweaks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5hx9mh6x7dg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=db944f0686f8216b6f05af71822ba95e78e85302\n\n**disconnected landing is more guided**\n\nwhen the frontend can’t see the backend, it now shows:\n\n* explicit setup steps (install opencode-ai, install studio server)\n* a reminder to run opencode --version once to initialize config\n* after \\~10s, it shows an update hint: npm install -g opencode-studio-server@latest\n* quick links to github and npm\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt62mivmx7dg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef0fb3223871eade1e093f547a209a1c1b2418f\n\n**protocol handler: local open mode + queued actions**\n\n* opencodestudio://launch?open=local starts the backend and opens http://localhost:3000\n* deep links now create a pending action that studio asks you to confirm (import skill, import plugin, etc)\n* mcp deep links are treated more cautiously now (the app won’t blindly execute arbitrary command strings from a url)\n\n**ui + site basics**\n\n* updated app icons/favicons\n* added robots.txt + sitemap for the hosted site\n\n# update (hosted frontend mode)\n\nif you’re coming from v1.0.5, you mainly just update the backend:\n\n`npm install -g opencode-studio-server@latest`\n\nrepo:

This way it would be easier to edit the config without logging into the server itself. But I still need to login because each time I use your ui to edit it I need to login and git commit it anyway. Maybe that could be a feature to git commit it from the UI too :)",

      "text": "# \n\n**TL;DR:** Anthropic is banning some accounts that use Claude Pro/Max subscriptions through third-party coding tools. Multiple confirmed bans in the last month, though many users report continued success.\n\n# What's happening:\n\nAs of early January 2026, Anthropic is enforcing their ToS against using Claude Code OAuth credentials in third-party tools like OpenCode and Crush. While many users continue to use these tools without issues, **there are confirmed cases of accounts being detected and permanently banned** based on usage patterns.\n\n# Recent casualties:\n\n**January 5, 2026** \\- User banned after using OpenCode with OAuth:\n\n>\n\n[Source: OpenCode Issue #6930](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/6930)\n\nThe issue author explicitly stated they \"reached out to several Anthropic engineers on Twitter\" who confirmed this violates ToS.\n\n**January 7, 2026** \\- Charm (makers of Crush CLI) removed Claude Code support entirely:\n\n>\n\n[Source: Crush PR #1783](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/pull/1783)\n\n# Why this is happening:\n\nAnthropic doesn't want people using $20/month Claude Pro/Max subscriptions as a cheaper alternative to their expensive API pricing. Third-party tools like OpenCode and Crush were enabling exactly that, so Anthropic is shutting it down at the account level.\n\n# What about OpenCode?\n\nOpenCode **still has the OAuth login feature** in their docs and codebase, and many users continue to use it successfully. However, it clearly violates Anthropic's ToS and carries the risk of account termination.\n\nFrom the OpenCode docs (still live as of today):\n\n>\n\n[Source: OpenCode Provider Docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/)\n\n**Use at your own risk.** Some users have been banned, others haven't been caught yet.\n\n# Your options:\n\n1. **Use official Claude Code CLI** \\- Anthropic's sanctioned tool, zero risk\n2. **Continue with third-party OAuth** \\- Works for many, but violates ToS and risks ban\n3. **Pay for API access** \\- Get separate API keys (expensive but compliant)\n4. **Use different providers** \\- OpenRouter, DeepSeek, local models, etc.\n\nWhile many users continue using Claude subscriptions in third-party tools without issues, Anthropic has confirmed this violates ToS and they are enforcing it against some accounts. Whether you get caught seems inconsistent—possibly based on usage volume, upgrade triggers, or manual review.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - the OAuth feature still *works* for most people, which is why it hasn't been widely removed. But Anthropic can detect this usage and has banned accounts retroactively. The risk appears real but not universal.",

Unfortunately some files got deleted, and boom... code gone. She was vibing so hard she never made a git repo! Thankfully, opencode kinda does that for you already :)",

I pushed a PR to OC to filter available skills respecting the new permission system, so utilize that to restrict the number of skills available to your agents. Just released yesterday.\n\nGood luck 🤞",

Just make sure you write really intelligent instructions on WHEN OpenCode should use your skill. \n\nI didn't get them at first either - it was through experimentation that I shrunk my default context from 20% to 10% and still going lower.",

      "text": "**TL;DR-** With this plugin ([https://github.com/shanebishop1/opencode-command-hooks](https://github.com/shanebishop1/opencode-command-hooks)), you can use your agent's YAML frontmatter to define hooks to run commands before/after the subagent is invoked.  \n  \nHello! Sharing this plugin I made in case anyone else finds it useful :)\n\nBasically, I wanted a cleaner, more declarative way to inject bash hook outputs into my OpenCode sessions after tool calls (particularly after a primary agent delegates to a subagent). You can do this with custom plugins configured for each use case, but I wanted this config to live WITH the subagents I define.\n\nWhile I was setting this up, I also expanded it a bit to be a config parser for defining hooks for tool calls (or specific arguments to a tool call). For example, with a couple lines of JSON, you could set up a notification if the `write` tool is called with a given file as its argument.\n\nSubagent YAML frontmatter example:\n\n    ---\n    description: Analyzes the codebase and implements code changes.\n    mode: subagent\n    hooks:\n      after:\n        - run: \"npm test\"\n          inject: \"Test Output: {stdout}\"\n    ---\n\n",

Everything happens on-device.\n\nI'm sharing my initial release of openground, an opensource and completely on-device RAG tool that let's you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like and Context7 MCP provide a likely source of truth for docs, but their closed-source ingestion and querying pose security/privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to agents and how it is ingested. Find a documentation source (git repo or sitemap), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.\n\nAgain, this is an initial release, so it is pretty barebones. Upcoming features I am working on:\n\n\\- specific library version handling (it currently only supports latest versions)\n\n\\- docs \"registry\" to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to S3\n\n\\- lighter-weight package\n\nSuggestions and PRs welcome! I'll also be around for discussion.",

So, my question is, how do you plan such large tasks now?\n\nYou ask first for a large model, come up with a task and create a markdown file, which will already contain a detailed description of the task and individual execution options, then drop the small model, complete, for example, tasks 1 and 2. Or How?",
