You're right about the NVIDIA loophole - now that they swapped the non-renewing 1000-credit cap for per-minute rate limits, it's a great resource.\n\nThat said, I'd highly recommend adding a quality/eval filter, rather than just sorting by latency and uptime. I found that optimizing for speed over quality is a trap with these free tiers. Many of the fastest models will hallucinate, fail tool calls, or completely ignore instructions. For example, my benchmarks showed models like Minimax-2.5 consistently mutilating code (e.g., quietly changing hyphens to underscores in variables).\n\nIf you adjust your agent/tool to evaluate and filter models based on actual coding performance and instruction-following - not just ping times - this could be incredibly useful. Right now, sending users to the top 20 fastest models might just result in a lot of frustrating debugging sessions.",

Without that litigaiton, my human rights will continue to be violated. I'm currently dependent on Claude in Opencode for my agentic workflow. I live in fear that one day Anthropic will make Claude no longer work at all in OpenCode. What then? Kimi 2.5 I guess.\n\nWill I, as an America citizen, have to use Chinese AI to protect my civil and constitutional rights because Anthropic won't provide an effective, equitable, and dependable way for me to use Claude?\n\nThe reason I need OpenCode isn't out of preference, but necessity; no platform was providing the features I needed, so I must build it myself. I have to build my tools, and do my own litigation. It's a societal-wide failure; I need AI because no one is helping people like me with these legal or development problems.\n\nI think of my situation - between my mental and physical disabilities, the hardship of the rights violations, imposed poverty, and general abandonment by the legal community and nonprofits -  like I'm having to build a sand castle in the middle of a hurricane, while other people build on a sunny-day beach. Then people go out of their way to make it even harder for me to build, or try to destroy what I've built.\n\nI don't fear misaligned AI. I fear misaligned people.\n\nI really like and enjoy Claude, but I fear Anthropic is going to make Claude inaccessible to me; they seem intent on preventing users like me from having equitable, effective access to Claude in OpenCode. While showing no interest or intent to develop the features my workflow needs in Claude Code or CoWork.\n\nMeanwhile, an open-source model will always be accessible, even if less performant.\n\nThe world would be such a better place if entities like Anthropic would help people like me, instead of create friction and more problems.  It's nice to have AI agents that help me, but now the company who owns that AI is working to prevent Claude from being helpful to me.\n\nThe more I try to do my work, the more I end up documenting how totally screwed up everything is.\n\nThere's a lot more to consider than just price and performance when picking which AI you use.\n\nMy life-long severe disability makes me especially mindful of what I am dependent upon. If I don't have specific things, I get injured, badly.\n\nI've become dependent upon Claude, and any day now, it could just be gone. The fear of that day weighs heavily on me. I find it very disturbing that my safety and human rights are not being better served by U.S. AI companies.\n\nHow will OpenCode survive? By being one of a scarce few places where people like me can build a future our survival can depend on.",

Under the hood, Opencode hooks into your $20/mo consumer web subscriptions (like claude or anti) by spoofing direct oaut tokens and reverse-engineering private api providers like anthropic and Google crack down on this because those flaetrate tiers are priced as loss-leaders for normal human chatting, not for heavy-duty, automated CLI agent loops that burn through massive amounts of compute. Once they update their fingerprinting and catch unofficial requests pretending to be their native clients, they instantly ban the accounts for ToS violations.\n\nThis is exactly why I wrote [this](https://github.com/agentify-sh/desktop) mcp bridge for claude, codex, opencode instead of spoofing API tokens, it uses local browser automation to literally log into the actual web UI, type out the prompts, click send, and scrape the response back to your terminal. It bypasses API restrictions by essentially puppeteering a real browser session (Electron with a normal user agent but you might wanna customize that to be safe). \n\nHowever, even with that tool you still need to recognize the risks. It’s not a bulletproof shield providers are constantly upgrading their behavioral analytics. If your account is blasting out complex prompts 24/7 at superhuman speeds, you can still trigger CAPTCHAs, get heavily rate-limited, or eventually face a ban for botting. \n\nby default it types slowly and hits send button and prevents unintentional mass prompt automation but up to you to determine what level you are comfortable with I take no responsibility.\n\nmy original motivation for writing that bridge was so i can use chatgpt pro from codex cli without copy and pasting but i've expanded it so you can use any web sessions from not only gemini or claude or chatgpt but grok and perplexity as well",

When you read the thinking output it’s like “wow, this thing thinks like a lead developer” but when you see the solution you realise it’s better at communicating than coding.\n\nGemini 3.1 however seems to think and blab on about tool selection incessantly but created something amazing that wasn’t even on my radar and solves my problem in both a technically superior way and is about 50x cheaper to run.\n\nCodex is somewhere between Gemini and Claude and with the insane limits at the moment is a true workhorse.\n\nThen if you’re into the “run 20 Opencode instances 24/7” kind of crowd then having Kimi 2.5 on your Black plan do the grunt work means you’ll struggle to hit the limit of a Zen&Codex Max plan.\n\nIf you have less than $50 a month budget I’d get the cheapest Codex plan and top the rest up with Kimi credit or the cheapest Zen Black plan.",

The models seem to handle context and logic particularly well in it, especially when using the Plan agent first and then switching to Build.\n\nEven before Openclaw became popular, I kept thinking how useful it would be to access OpenCode from my phone. I noticed OpenCode has a server mode, which meant building a custom client was totally doable. Initially, I just wanted to write a simple Telegram bot for my own needs. But, as it usually goes, I got carried away, added more features, and eventually decided to open-source the project.\n\nI definitely won't call it \"fully functional\" yet - there are still rough edges. However, it currently has enough features to be used for actual development.\n\nHere is what works right now:\n\n* Switching between projects and sessions.\n* Selecting the agent, model, and variant (reasoning effort).\n* Tracking the agent's progress on a task.\n* Receiving code diffs directly in the chat as text files.\n\nIronically, I'm now at the point where I use the bot to write code for the bot itself. It’s a pretty great feeling to lie on the couch, watch a TV series, and casually send dev tasks to the agent via Telegram on my phone.\n\nI plan to keep actively developing the project since I use it daily. If anyone wants to try it out, the repo is here: [https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot](https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot)\n\nI would be really grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or suggestions!",

Is NanoGPT with the 8 dollar plan good ? Maybe [https://z.ai/subscribe](https://z.ai/subscribe) ? \n\nOr pay only my real use with a api key from [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) or [https://opencode.ai/docs/zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen)\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences. :)\n\nLg ",

When you switch branch etc. it'll always follow the latest in your workspace and update incrementally. The index is automatically updated when the MCP starts, and before any query.  \n  \nIf you have multiple worktrees, and when you load the MCP in different worktrees, it's indexing each worktree independently.  \n\n\nWe are having plans in future doing advanced optimization on this too!",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been using OpenCode for heavier refactoring lately, but I keep hitting the wall where the native `Compaction` kicks in and the Agent basically gets a lobotomy. It forgets exact variable names, loses track of the files it just opened, and hallucinates its next steps.\n\nI got frustrated and spent the weekend building `opencode-working-memory`, a drop-in plugin to give the Agent a persistent, multi-tier memory system before the wipe happens.\n\nMy main goal was: **keep it simple and require absolutely zero configuration.** You just install it, and it silently manages the context in the background.\n\nHere is what the **Working Memory** architecture does automatically:\n\n1. **LRU File Pool (Auto-decay):** It tracks file paths the Agent uses. Active files stay \"hot\" in the pool, while ignored files naturally decay and drop out of the prompt, saving massive tokens.\n2. **Protected Slots (Errors & Decisions):** It intercepts `stderr` and important decisions behind the scenes, locking them into priority slots so the Agent never forgets the bug it's fixing or the tech choices it made.\n3. **Core Memory & Todo Sync:** It maintains persistent Goal/Progress blocks and automatically injects pending SQLite todos back into the prompt after a compaction wipe.\n4. **Storage Governance:** It cleans up after itself in the background (caps tool outputs at 300 files / 7-day TTL) so your disk doesn't bloat.\n\nNo setup, no extra prompt commands. It just works out of the box.\n\nIt's been working perfectly for my own workflow. I open-sourced it (MIT) in case anyone needs a plug-and-play fix: **Repo:**[https://github.com/sdwolf4103/opencode-working-memory]()\n\n*(Installation is literally just adding* `\"opencode-working-memory\"` *to your* `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` *plugin array and restarting—it downloads automatically!)*",

If you use DCP in a long, continuous session, modifying history actually breaks **Prefix Caching**, so you lose the speed/cost benefits.\n\n**Also, a big reason for hitting limits:** I'm using GitHub Copilot, and their context cap for Claude seems to be about **half** of what you get directly from Anthropic. That forced my hand to build this!",

It does **NOT** delete the actual memory.\n\nThe real \"brain\" lives in `memory-working.json`, which persists with your session:\n\n* It ranks files based on **\"Dynamic Attention\"**.\n* **Example:** If you switch tasks (e.g., from Backend to Frontend), the new files will naturally overtake the old ones in rank after about **7-8 mentions**.\n* The AI’s focus shifts automatically to what matters *now*, pushing irrelevant context down without you needing to manage it manually.\n\n**Regarding Cross-Project Memory:** You are totally right—global memory is the next logical step.

I've only just started adding GLM 5 as subagent to my agentic workflow. \n\nIt's not proving itself to have any particular aptitudes so far. Combined with this problem with tool use, not looking good. Preliminary data, but still pertinent data.\n\nKimi 2.5 has surprisingly offered insights that all other models failed to provide. Particularly when it comes to systems-based thinking and scientific approaches to modeling problems and communicating findings.\n\nIt fails in many other ways that Opus succeeds at.
