      "text": "Hey OpenCode folks,\n\nJust wanted to say thanks to everyone maintaining OpenCode and keeping it open source. Projects like this are rare. It is genuinely useful in day-to-day work, and it is also built in a way that lets other people actually build on top of it.\n\nI have been working on a cross-platform desktop app using Tauri, and running OpenCode as a local sidecar has been a huge help. Having a solid headless runtime I can rely on means I get to focus on the desktop experience, security boundaries, and local-first behavior instead of reinventing an agent runtime from scratch.\n\nA few things I really appreciate:\n\n* The CLI and runtime are practical and easy to ship, not just a demo.\n* The clear separation between the engine and the UI makes embedding possible.\n* The architecture makes it possible to build on top of OpenCode or embed it elsewhere, rather than having to fork the core runtime. (EDIT for clarity)\n\nAnyway, just a sincere thank you for the work you are doing. It is unglamorous, hard engineering, and it is helping other open-source projects actually ship. I also love the frequent updates. Keep up the great work!",

I actually ran into the same “one agent can only do so much at once” limitation, and ended up building a simple orchestration layer into my app to solve it.\n\nThe inspiration for this was OpenClaw’s multi‑agent setup: multiple agents working in parallel toward a shared goal, then folding their results back together.\n\nIn practice my setup looks like: a list of tasks -> one Orchestrator -> multiple worker agents. The Orchestrator assigns tasks concurrently (so research, extraction, code changes, verification, etc. can happen side‑by‑side), tracks progress, and then merges the outputs into a final answer/plan.\n\nOpencode could absolutely implement the same idea. They’d ***just*** need an orchestration layer that can run multiple sessions/tasks at the same time, handle coordination (who’s doing what), and then aggregate results. That’s basically the missing piece between a single agent session and a team of agents collaborating.\n\nThis does not require multiple opencode instances either.",

After some back and forth with claude and a little reverse engineering, the coordination layer turns out to be a clever mix of tmux + file locks and undocumented cli arguments.\n\nSo I pulled it apart and reimplemented it as a standalone MCP server. Any MCP client can use it now, including\n\nopencode as seen in the demo video.\n\nHere's what the server exposes:\n\n\\- Team + spawning: create teams, spawn Claude Code teammates into tmux panes, graceful and forced shutdown.\n\n\\- Task coordination: ownership, status tracking, dependency graphs with cycle detection.\n\n\\- Messaging: DMs, broadcast, long-polling inbox, shutdown/plan-approval protocol.\n\n\\- Concurrency safety: file locks on inboxes and tasks, atomic config writes.\n\nRepo: [github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp](http://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp)\n\nIt's early (v0.1.0) and I'd love as much feedback as possible specifically around tighter opencode integrations.",

Is that not the idea with this?\n\nIdeally, you'd spawn an opencode server associated with a project/directory if there already isn't one available when starting up opencode since that avoids any mcp server duplication and your plugin can interact with any sessions, events, etc. You want a plugin that hooks into all the relevant events for making sure all the expected interactions work as expected and you can recover from any odd states.\n\nIf trying to have this work outside of the opencode server process, it's possible but i think it'll be more difficult. There are some other projects doing something similar and there is a ton of adapter work. Gastown, for example is one of those. ",

A proper agent team can't occur without multi-caller support.\n\nThis is because currently, when an agent that isn't the Parent persists a session with a subagent, the subagent thinks the calling agent is the Parent.\n\nWhat that looks like:\n\nPrimary A tasks subagent A. Subagent A tasks Subagent B. Primary A tries to communicate with Subagent B, and Subagent B thinks it's talking to Subagent A.\n\nTo coordinate a team of agents, which are communicating, and orchestrating each others actions, you need them to be able to identify who they're talking to/with.\n\nI have a workaround system where agents write relay-files, where a sub-skill helps them know the relay-file protocol. It's part of a larger Agentic Collaboration Framework.\n\nI think a proper OpenCode implementation for Agent Teams needs first, to merge my PR, second to revamp the caller system so that it supports multi-callers.\n\nIt is getting tiresome that Anthropic releases something, and people think it's innovative, say they should copy it, but something better is already available for OpenCode, but the community just isn't paying attention or pitching in.\n\nI have a complete roadmap for agentic collaboration in development for OpenCode. The PR is just one small part of it. A critical part, but a small part. There's so much more that needs doing, and I'm just one newbie vibe coder who develops purely to build the tools that I need for litigation.\n\nEdit: decided to turn this comment into a GitHub Issue.

      "text": "TL;DR — I added mobile support for OpenCode by building an open-source plugin. It lets you send prompts to OpenCode agents from your phone, track task progress, and get notified when jobs finish.\n\n* GitHub (plugin): [https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa](https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa)\n* App: [https://vicoa.ai/](https://vicoa.ai/) (iOS and web for now, Android coming soon, freemium)\n\n\n\n**Why I made it**\n\nVibe coding with OpenCode is great, but I need to constantly wait for the agents to finish. It feels like being chained to the desk, babysitting the agents.\n\nI want to be able to monitor the agent progress and prompt the OpenCode agents even on the go. \n\n**What it does**\n\n* Connects OpenCode to a mobile client (Vicoa)\n* Lets you send prompts to OpenCode agents from your phone\n* Real-time sync of task progress\n* Send task completion or permission required notifications\n* Send slash commands\n* Fuzzy file search on the app\n\nThe goal is to treat agents more like background workers instead of something you have to babysit.\n\n**Quick Start (easy)**\n\nThe integration is implemented as an OpenCode plugin and is fully open-source.\n\nAssuming you have OpenCode installed, you just need to install Vicoa with a single command: \n\n    pip install vicoa\n\nthen just run:\n\n    vicoa opencode\n\nThat’s it. It automatically installs the plugin and handles the connection.\n\nLinks again: \n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa](https://github.com/vicoa-ai/opencode-vicoa)\n* Documentation: [https://vicoa.ai/docs/agents/opencode](https://vicoa.ai/docs/agents/opencode)\n\nThanks for reading!

Being able to kick off tasks, approve permissions, and check progress from anywhere completely changed how I work with AI coding agents. The notification angle you have with Vicoa is smart, that is one of the biggest pain points. Curious how you handle the real-time sync -- are you using websockets or polling?",

Tried self-hosting with Ollama for a while but honestly the GPU costs and maintenance were annoying for anything bigger.\n\nEnded up trying [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new/?referral=hcHozzHNE8CxVvz) and it's been solid so far, alternatively [Z.ai](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=KQ77ZVKLB5) for just the GLM Models, nice for coding. They host open-source models and the API is OpenAI-compatible so it just plugs into your CLI or Dev Environment. $20/mo flat for the subscription tier is nice.\n\nOpen-source models still lag behind frontier models for complex reasoning tasks in my opinion, so it's not a full replacement. But if privacy is a priority for you and you don't want to deal with self-hosting, it's worth checking out.",

I’m currently using synthetic with opencode mostly because of the promo. At that price, it feels reasonable. What I like about it is that the devs are actually active and transparent. They’re on discord, issues get acknowledged and you can see what they’re working on instead of guessing why a model suddenly feels worse.\n\nOnce the promo is over, I’ll probably reassess again, especially if other Kimi or GLM providers improve. But for now it’s been a decent balance of cost and stability for my usage.  \n  \nIf anyone wants to try it, this is the link I used for the discounted offer:  \n[https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK](https://synthetic.new/?referral=4NNoPUXcb63ZYVK)",

I noticed a few things,\n\nThe GUI's MCP calling is not very good and fails mostly, \n\n  \nAfter Antigravity's new rate limiting on the Claude models, I needed a daily driver for which I choose Kimi 2.5 however on the \n\n  \nMost of the Youtube tutorial workflows suggested Opus for Planning and use OpenCodeCLI inside the Antigravity terminal rather than the CLI.\n\nI tried the GUI and Kimi 2.5 was performing very bad instead I had to switch to Kilocode which I found better. Idk y but I feel the CLI is noticeable better than the GUI than most cases and even it's used by most of the people.\n\n  \nWould like to know ur views",

One shot tasks or \"the questions and forget\" maybe, but it is frustrating to stare at stacked edits and try to figure out what is going on.
