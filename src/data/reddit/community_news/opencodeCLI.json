The rolling usage quota seems fine, but weekly and monthly limits are very restrictive. I'll run out of weekly/monthly quota after a couple of days with basically any kind of programming work.  \n  \nQuota usage seems to depend on the token count and the model's API usage price, not just on the number of requests. Requests with large contexts or more generated tokens deplete the quota faster. The requests show up in the Zen usage history as usual with some per-request costs. My request history page shows that I've used $1.38 worth of requests with the Go subscription, and I'm already at 6% of my monthly quota. This means for $10 per month I get the equivalent of around $20 in pay-as-you-go credit. Not sure if it's worth it.",

You're right about the NVIDIA loophole - now that they swapped the non-renewing 1000-credit cap for per-minute rate limits, it's a great resource.\n\nThat said, I'd highly recommend adding a quality/eval filter, rather than just sorting by latency and uptime. I found that optimizing for speed over quality is a trap with these free tiers. Many of the fastest models will hallucinate, fail tool calls, or completely ignore instructions. For example, my benchmarks showed models like Minimax-2.5 consistently mutilating code (e.g., quietly changing hyphens to underscores in variables).\n\nIf you adjust your agent/tool to evaluate and filter models based on actual coding performance and instruction-following - not just ping times - this could be incredibly useful. Right now, sending users to the top 20 fastest models might just result in a lot of frustrating debugging sessions.",

Without that litigaiton, my human rights will continue to be violated. I'm currently dependent on Claude in Opencode for my agentic workflow. I live in fear that one day Anthropic will make Claude no longer work at all in OpenCode. What then? Kimi 2.5 I guess.\n\nWill I, as an America citizen, have to use Chinese AI to protect my civil and constitutional rights because Anthropic won't provide an effective, equitable, and dependable way for me to use Claude?\n\nThe reason I need OpenCode isn't out of preference, but necessity; no platform was providing the features I needed, so I must build it myself. I have to build my tools, and do my own litigation. It's a societal-wide failure; I need AI because no one is helping people like me with these legal or development problems.\n\nI think of my situation - between my mental and physical disabilities, the hardship of the rights violations, imposed poverty, and general abandonment by the legal community and nonprofits -  like I'm having to build a sand castle in the middle of a hurricane, while other people build on a sunny-day beach. Then people go out of their way to make it even harder for me to build, or try to destroy what I've built.\n\nI don't fear misaligned AI. I fear misaligned people.\n\nI really like and enjoy Claude, but I fear Anthropic is going to make Claude inaccessible to me; they seem intent on preventing users like me from having equitable, effective access to Claude in OpenCode. While showing no interest or intent to develop the features my workflow needs in Claude Code or CoWork.\n\nMeanwhile, an open-source model will always be accessible, even if less performant.\n\nThe world would be such a better place if entities like Anthropic would help people like me, instead of create friction and more problems.  It's nice to have AI agents that help me, but now the company who owns that AI is working to prevent Claude from being helpful to me.\n\nThe more I try to do my work, the more I end up documenting how totally screwed up everything is.\n\nThere's a lot more to consider than just price and performance when picking which AI you use.\n\nMy life-long severe disability makes me especially mindful of what I am dependent upon. If I don't have specific things, I get injured, badly.\n\nI've become dependent upon Claude, and any day now, it could just be gone. The fear of that day weighs heavily on me. I find it very disturbing that my safety and human rights are not being better served by U.S. AI companies.\n\nHow will OpenCode survive? By being one of a scarce few places where people like me can build a future our survival can depend on.",

          "text": "opencode users are getting hit so hard with bans comes down to how it accesses compute. Under the hood, Opencode hooks into your $20/mo consumer web subscriptions (like claude or anti) by spoofing direct oaut tokens and reverse-engineering private api providers like anthropic and Google crack down on this because those flaetrate tiers are priced as loss-leaders for normal human chatting, not for heavy-duty, automated CLI agent loops that burn through massive amounts of compute. Once they update their fingerprinting and catch unofficial requests pretending to be their native clients, they instantly ban the accounts for ToS violations.\n\nThis is exactly why I wrote [this](https://github.com/agentify-sh/desktop) mcp bridge for claude, codex, opencode instead of spoofing API tokens, it uses local browser automation to literally log into the actual web UI, type out the prompts, click send, and scrape the response back to your terminal. It bypasses API restrictions by essentially puppeteering a real browser session (Electron with a normal user agent but you might wanna customize that to be safe). \n\nHowever, even with that tool you still need to recognize the risks. It’s not a bulletproof shield providers are constantly upgrading their behavioral analytics. If your account is blasting out complex prompts 24/7 at superhuman speeds, you can still trigger CAPTCHAs, get heavily rate-limited, or eventually face a ban for botting. \n\nby default it types slowly and hits send button and prevents unintentional mass prompt automation but up to you to determine what level you are comfortable with I take no responsibility.\n\nmy original motivation for writing that bridge was so i can use chatgpt pro from codex cli without copy and pasting but i've expanded it so you can use any web sessions from not only gemini or claude or chatgpt but grok and perplexity as well",

I also have a Codex plan and the limits are insane and 5.3 is pretty wild.\n\nI’m stopping my Claude Max plan at the end of the cycle as it seems Opus is brilliant at communicating what it does, but it never quite solves the problem and makes weird choices. When you read the thinking output it’s like “wow, this thing thinks like a lead developer” but when you see the solution you realise it’s better at communicating than coding.\n\nGemini 3.1 however seems to think and blab on about tool selection incessantly but created something amazing that wasn’t even on my radar and solves my problem in both a technically superior way and is about 50x cheaper to run.\n\nCodex is somewhere between Gemini and Claude and with the insane limits at the moment is a true workhorse.\n\nThen if you’re into the “run 20 Opencode instances 24/7” kind of crowd then having Kimi 2.5 on your Black plan do the grunt work means you’ll struggle to hit the limit of a Zen&Codex Max plan.\n\nIf you have less than $50 a month budget I’d get the cheapest Codex plan and top the rest up with Kimi credit or the cheapest Zen Black plan.",

The models seem to handle context and logic particularly well in it, especially when using the Plan agent first and then switching to Build.\n\nEven before Openclaw became popular, I kept thinking how useful it would be to access OpenCode from my phone. I noticed OpenCode has a server mode, which meant building a custom client was totally doable. Initially, I just wanted to write a simple Telegram bot for my own needs. But, as it usually goes, I got carried away, added more features, and eventually decided to open-source the project.\n\nI definitely won't call it \"fully functional\" yet - there are still rough edges. However, it currently has enough features to be used for actual development.\n\nHere is what works right now:\n\n* Switching between projects and sessions.\n* Selecting the agent, model, and variant (reasoning effort).\n* Tracking the agent's progress on a task.\n* Receiving code diffs directly in the chat as text files.\n\nIronically, I'm now at the point where I use the bot to write code for the bot itself. It’s a pretty great feeling to lie on the couch, watch a TV series, and casually send dev tasks to the agent via Telegram on my phone.\n\nI plan to keep actively developing the project since I use it daily. If anyone wants to try it out, the repo is here: [https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot](https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot)\n\nI would be really grateful for any feedback, thoughts, or suggestions!",

I mainly used AI to save myself the trouble of looking through the documentation or to discuss errors and ideas.    \nI want to use opencode because I don't want a vendor lock and I like the idea to use any model that ich want.   \nI would also like to use an open source model, but I can't decide for a plan. \n\nWhat's the best open source model for opencode ? Is NanoGPT with the 8 dollar plan good ? Maybe [https://z.ai/subscribe](https://z.ai/subscribe) ? \n\nOr pay only my real use with a api key from [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) or [https://opencode.ai/docs/zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen)\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences. :)\n\nLg ",

          "text": "considering majority of accessible providers, especially when we talk about budget friendly:  \n\\- kimi via their coding plan is a big joke, but can be 'abused' for 0.99$ subscriptions. However they're on 3x usage quota right now till 'who knows when' and it's a joke as even lightweight work can cap out 5h quota in 1.5h and each 5h quota is 20% of weekly quota. You can rotate a few accounts tho easily  \n\\- glm via official api seems to be probably smartest out of these 3, best when it comes to actual frontend design and picking up logic tasks quite well. The main issue is that official api is generally slow / very slow for 95% of the time (and im EU based...) and other providers are having either quite low quota allowance or doesn't host it at all. Can't wait till synthetic provides it still (btw when they open the waitlist gates remember about [referral discount](https://synthetic.new/?referral=IDyp75aoQpW9YFt))  \n**have in mind that both kimi and glm via official api have weekly caps** which are quite.. low in both cases. GLM is better than kimi tho.  \n\\- minimax m2.5 via the minimax provider is my go-to for now, as it's reliable enough to develop 95% of usual work (i run amp free when i really need opus 4.6 for some super complex debugging) and also it has the -highspeed variant which is insanely fast as it provides constant 100tps. So for my fast paced workflow of ideate > plan > develop > review > fix > merge it's great, as minimax's speed vs kimi / glm both as a model and provider is a big win here. Also they still host [10% discount via reflinks aswell ](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan?code=HO46LCwAJ5&source=link)\\- can recommend. Also **there is no weekly cap** and they say it's 100 / 300 / 1000 / 2000 prompts per 5h but the main pros of minimax system are:  \n\\- their 5h windows are fixed (00 - 05 am / 5 - 10 / 10 - 3pm / 3-8 / 8 - 11:59:59 pm) > which might sound as not like a big deal but you can basically start working at 8am, code for 2h and even if you'd get anywhere close to the cap - the limit resets at 10 so you can move forward with your work. It's IMO **way better system** than rolling 5h window as you know when to expect a reset so can potentially plan upfront.   \n\\- their system says as prompts, but what they don't say on the pricing page is that each prompt is at least 15-20 model calls - so even the 10$ (9 with discount) plan allows to do a **ton of coding**. I'm right now at 40$ highspeed plan, spinning 3 agents all the time and using their api for one of my SaaS and can't cap it out really through the day.   \nHave in mind that with 3 agents and highspeed minimax usually the human in the loop is worst piece of the whole system and workflow. :) ",

As for Kimi and GLM, Kimi is more reliable on \"fragile\" tasks where failed tool calls can derail the whole tasks (e.g. frameworks like GSD where each step must produce artifacts that later steps depend on). It sometimes decide to stop where it is not supposed to, but it is fairly easy to fix. GLM seems to be more intelligent and can solve more complex problems \"from scratch\" (basically using bare prompts), but it does not seem to be very reliable with tool calls, and will eventually start hallucinating tools or generating nonsensical texts if the task goes on for too long.\n\nI don't think I have enough evidence to tell which one works better generally, but for now I would prefer Kimi for orchestrated workflows and GLM for adhoc / interactive use. When trying popular prompting frameworks, GSD works better with Kimi (GLM derails in fully automated tasks), and OAC works better with GLM (Kimi impersonates user and fills user questions automatically).",

No React, Vue, Alpine, etc.\n- **Static**: Must work as a static file (no server-side logic)\n- **Self-hostable**: Drop into Vercel as `index.html` or paste into CodePen\n\n### Quality Bar\n\nThis is NOT a simple landing page. It should feel like it was commissioned by a world-class brand agency. Include:\n\n**Visual craft:**\n\n- Scroll-triggered reveals with Intersection Observer (not scroll events -- use IO for performance)\n- Parallax depth on at least 2 layers (background moves slower than foreground)\n- Typography that has character -- mix of serif and sans, large display type with tight tracking\n- Color palette of 3-4 tones maximum, applied with intention (not rainbow)\n- Subtle animated texture or grain overlay via CSS (repeating SVG noise, pseudo-element with opacity)\n\n**Interaction:**\n\n- Cursor that responds subtly (not gimmicky -- a small dot or trail at most)\n- Hover states that feel intentional (transforms, not just color changes)\n- Navigation that changes opacity/style on scroll\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n- Hero section with large, centered typographic statement\n- At minimum 5 distinct sections with scroll transitions between them\n- Footer with subtle details (coordinates, a fictional address, a motto in a second language)\n- A moment of surprise -- one section that does something unexpected (inverted colors, a canvas animation, text that rearranges)\n- Scent \"notes\" (top/heart/base) revealed on scroll as floating pills\n- Canvas particle system simulating mist/smoke drifting upward\n- CSS blurs that shift as you scroll (backdrop-filter manipulation)\n\n**Polish details:**\n\n- `font-display: swap` on any web fonts\n- `will-change: transform` on animated elements\n- Smooth scroll behavior on `html`\n- Mobile-responsive (flexbox/grid, no fixed px widths on containers)\n- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for accessibility\n```",
