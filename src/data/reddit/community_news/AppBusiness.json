Widgets + calm vibes seem to punch above weight lately.\n\nI wouldn’t add analytics yet either tbh. Let it breathe a bit and see what ppl organically do.\n\nNice execution for a <24h build",

To be honest, I'm not seeing massive profits yet—I'm actually at a slight loss right now, but my primary focus is on improving my app's ratings and building review momentum.\n\n\nRegarding conversion: it wasn't just one keyword. I started with Discovery campaigns to see what people were actually searching for. I’ve learned to avoid highly competitive keywords like 'dream journal' because the CPT (Cost Per Tap) is too high and doesn't guarantee a subscription. I lost quite a bit of money bidding on those high-competition terms early on; now, I’m focusing on lower-competition, more specific keywords where the intent is better, I've also started using tools like AppFigures to research keyword volume, competition, and ranking trends to find those “hidden keywords ” that are cheaper to bid on",

If you work with paid ads, especially on a decent budget, web2app funnels are worth testing early. They convert better once you understand your audience because you can educate, qualify, and price before the install, not after. Reddit and Product Hunt are fine for feedback, but rarely drive real growth. ASO helps, but it won’t fix a weak funnel. The biggest mistake I see is scaling traffic before retention and onboarding make sense. Web funnels helped connect those dots and made paid traffic way more predictable.",

      "text": "After 13 years of coding, deploying my first own mobile app feels harder than building it\n\nFor more than a decade I’ve been building products for other people.  \n\nDifferent companies, different domains, different responsibilities.  \n\nShipping features, fixing bugs, leading parts of architecture - the usual developer life.\n\nBut I never actually shipped something that was fully mine.\n\nSo recently I decided to change that.\n\nThe idea came unexpectedly.  \n\nI validated competitors, designed the architecture, built the backend, admin panel, and the mobile app completely solo.\n\nRoughly 1.5 months of intense development.\n\nAnd then I reached the final step…  \n\npublishing to the app stores.\n\nI honestly thought this would be the easiest part.  \n\nUpload → click submit → done.\n\nInstead, it feels like a completely different game:\n\nYou need subscriptions.  \n\nSubscriptions require configuration and review.  \n\nReview requires FAQ pages, privacy policy, terms, screenshots, explanations.  \n\nEach step unlocks three more hidden steps.\n\nAt this point it genuinely feels like:\n\nBuilding the product was level 1.  \n\nDeployment is the final boss.\n\nSo I’m curious - especially from indie devs who already went through this:\n\nHow do you handle the launch process without losing your mind?  \n\nAny checklists, lessons learned, or “I wish I knew this earlier” advice?",

You can have them just return true.. later you go back in and build out the modules. But I start my entry point as I intend to go on. A pretty minimal bootstrapper that calls all the important parts.\n\n\nAs for that alpha 1 - load up your key modules, add a debug console in your app, and do some basic stuff - just test they fire up (dependency test).",

After the switch, DAU dropped, but installs → pro subscriptions jumped noticeably. Overall intent feels much stronger.\n\nI attached a screenshot showing app units vs in-app purchases over the last month for context.\n\nA few things I changed at the same time:  \n– Improved the paywall UI and overall flow  \n– Tightened onboarding so value is clearer before asking for payment  \n– Removed the “forever free” path\n\nStill early and I’m continuing to watch retention and trial conversion, but the data speaks for itself.\n\nCurious how others here think about hard paywalls vs soft paywalls, especially for consumer apps.\n\nApp link for context: [https://push-pull.app/](https://push-pull.app/)\n\n",

I’m building a science-based fitness app (HIT / time-under-tension focused, very different use case), and I’ve been experimenting a lot with paywalls over the last few weeks.\n\nOn Android, the app has been live for a few weeks now:  \n• 1,000+ downloads  \n• 200+ registered users\n\nEarly on, I had a more restrictive setup and saw almost no meaningful usage. Once I switched to a 14-day free trial and reduced friction, actual feature usage finally started. Now I’m slowly tightening things again to understand where intent vs curiosity really sits.\n\nMy iOS app only went live a few days ago, so numbers are still small, but this whole “soft vs hard paywall” question is something I’m actively testing right now. What you’re describing about stronger intent after removing the forever-free path resonates a lot.\n\nHappy to exchange notes as more data comes in. I’m sharing updates pretty openly on Reddit as I go.\n\nApp for context (download page):  \n[https://app.hittrk.com/download](https://app.hittrk.com/download)",

You prevented those users from using anything without paying, so of course some percentage of them are going to pay since they're finding value in the features they use because they keep coming back. The others will leave.\n\nThe free tier is made up of people who would pay if they need to, and users who aren't getting enough value to ever pay. You forced a choice on them, they split into those two camps and acted accordingly.\n\nFree tiers are only ever useful, I think, for \"less volume\" and not really for \"less features\". Added features in the Pro tier aren't what converts people. If they wanted those features, they'd already be paying. The people who stay on free tier are, by definition, people who are getting along fine without the Pro features. They're never going to \"convert eventually.\"\n\nWhat you want is a free tier that's a good solid usable demo of the full product. When people like the product, and want more, that's what induces them to start paying. The paid tier removes friction, removes advertisements, allows easier imports/exports, eliminates manual steps, integrates more cleanly with other apps, removes caps on data storage, lets the user see more posts per day or make more posts per day...\n\nPro tiers work best for \"remove the stops, let the app go full speed\" vs \"get more optional features many users may never need or be willing to pay for.\"\n\nThere are many exceptions to that of course, for professional tools (e.g. an image editor that adds advanced tools)... but for consumer apps, it's rare for feature segmentation into tiers to be genuinely useful. Consumers aren't like professional users, they aren't generally willing (as a class) to pay for advanced features \"only a few people actually need\". Pros will pay for those features because efficiency turns around into money in their pocket. For consumer users, paying for more features is just pure cost.",

Now I am a father with a 6-month-old baby and I feel obligated to make more money for my family.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

It has a monthly subscription averaging $4.99 for \"rich\" countries (I localize and categorize my subscription fees based on the country's economy). I split it into 4 groups: $1.99 for lower-income countries, $2.99 for mid, $3.99 for high-mid, and $4.99 for countries like the US, UK, etc. The annual plan follows the same idea, ranging from $15.99 to $39.99.\n\n\n\nThe prices change occasionally since I’m constantly testing different price points.\n\n\n\nI haven't always been focused on this app since I have other projects, but what helped this app go from $0 to $100 is Apple Search Ads. What I noticed with Search Ads is that you can lose a lot of money at first, but once you learn how it works, you can turn those losses into earnings.\n\n\n\nNot counting my early mistakes (where I spent maybe $300+ learning the ropes), I’ve spent about $60 on ads since I figured it out. Apple Search Ads are like magic if set up correctly alongside a good product page. It can double your spend—for example, you spend $50 and earn $70+ back (not including Apple's commission, which is 15% in my case). I might try other advertisement channels like TikTok next. I have no experience in that area yet, so if you have tips or tricks for TikTok ads, please let me know! I will keep iterating until the end of the year, then I’ll post my achievements again.\n\n",

Use this phase to understand your customers and refine the app based on their behavior. Gradually optimize the product and user experience to guide customers toward subscriptions. Repeat this cycle several times to improve conversion.\n\nOnce you have a solid system in place, introduce a lifetime offer to raise capital, then invest that money into a large marketing campaign to attract new users, with the goal of converting them into long term subscribers.",
