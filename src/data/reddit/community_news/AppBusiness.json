Today, you can tell because everyone is building the same app. Seriously, build something original for once.\n\nAnd don’t be surprised when nobody buys from you if you just copy like monkeys and never create anything of your own. Use your brain again, think outside the box, and look beyond the obvious. AI answers are the same answers your competitors get, but in a different wording, so they end up doing the same thing you do. That’s not going to work.",

App 2: Product Hunt got 94 upvotes, 48 installs, 1 paid user. Same pattern, tire-kickers who never convert. App 3: Didn't bother with Product Hunt. Went straight to niche communities, app directories, and SEO. Got 180 installs first month, 28 paid users. 10x better results.​\n\n\n\nWhat actually worked for app 3: Posted in 8 specific subreddits where target users hang out, providing value first for 2 weeks, then mentioning app. Got 87 installs, 18 paid. Submitted to 15 app directories nobody talks about, smaller platforms but higher-intent users. Got 52 installs, 7 paid. Started app store SEO with careful keyword targeting in title/description. Got 41 organic installs, 3 paid.​\n\n\n\nWhy Product Hunt fails for apps: Users browse for entertainment, not solutions. They upvote cool concepts but rarely become paying customers. You're competing with 50+ other launches daily. Spike dies within 48 hours, zero long-term value. Better to spend launch energy on high-intent channels where people actively search for solutions.\n\n\n\nControversial take: Product Hunt is a vanity metric. Makes you feel good with upvotes but rarely drives sustainable growth. Only worth it if you already have audience to support the launch. For unknown founders, niche communities and app store SEO crush PH every time.\n\n\n\nFound this in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) studying 75+ app launches successful ones treated PH as optional, focused on App Store optimization and targeted communities. Failed ones bet everything on PH launch day magic that never came.​\n\n\n\nAm I wrong? Did Product Hunt actually drive real growth for your app?",

Feedback is positive, features are solid, and technically everything does what it’s supposed to do. But when it comes to traction, it feels painfully slow.\n\nI built Zolly .dev an AI application builder with the real Visual editor. After building application just drag n drop images, click to edit text, add link. One click publish\n\nEverything for FREE\n\nBeen 11 days of launch got 317 users but very few upgraded to the paid plan. \nEvery day I’m torn between improving the product further or stepping back and fixing how I’m selling and communicating it.\n\nFor founders who’ve been here before, what actually moved the needle for you? Was it doubling down on one channel, changing the narrative, or something you wish you had done earlier?\n\n\n",

Here are my 2 cents: \n\nFirst of all you are in competition with  like hundreds of similar solutions and most of them have big marketing money. So you need to compete with that!\n\nI go on your page, I don't see any samples. If want to sell sites/apps at least create 10 samples people can click through to see what your tool can do.\n\nI started with the free version, I can only choose Deepseek. Fine. I did use free Deepseek directly with the same prompt and the result is really better.\n\nPricing is really confusing: Free is $0 / month??? Weekly is $5 one-time? others also -one-time? w00t? So is it a subscription? You biy a package? No idea.\n\nYou sell credits with the packages. Good move. BUT, you don't explain anywhere, what I get for a credit. If I buy 39 credits, can I create 39 websites with it? Or do you charge a credit for every change you do on the page? I created a landingpage and it did cost me a credit. I clicked on a link in my landing page, it doubled your page inside your page and I only got 6 credits left. Makes no sense. It's also missing in the FAQ.\n\nSo, enough bashing 😉\n\nFrom my opinion, what would make it better:\n\nMake the page more friendly and use some pictures in it. You sell websites, make it visual then!\n\nExplain how it works. With credits explained. What do you get for what.\n\nYour USP is your Visual Editor. You need to realy point that out! Also that you can upload existing HTML templates to edit them. This is really cool also.\n\nMake a video (or better several) to show how your solution works and what you get as a user\n\nI would remove the free version, as you see people only use it to create or try some stuff. Not satisfied, no buy. Make a real trial version with all features available, all AI Models and full version of visual editor. If the result is cool, then you have a better chance for a buyer. \n\nAlso, you said you can download the HTML and I guess it is without the visual editor in it. So why not ad a hosting package to your soution. Peeps can host it right away.\n\nHope that helps!",

Actually I thought of removing but my competitors are giving free version so had to put. I am glad that you loved the product with Deepseek but believe me it gives far better results with Claude Sonnet 4.5 but sadly had to move that to paid tier. The API cost was huge. \n\nAnd I am from India where stripe is not available. So to test if the payment gateway is integrated properly I had to go with one time payment Paypal. \n\nAbout the picture the website, application it builds are contained with pictures. I am using unsplash API for that.  The generated site should provide a picture. Let me check if there is any bug related to that. \n\nThanks a lot for the feedback will update you after pushing the changes.",

That's 2.8% of users paying anything. 97.2% freeload forever. App Store economics are completely broken for indie developers.\n\nThe math that kills apps is 12,000 downloads, 2,100 monthly active users (82.5% uninstall or ghost), 340 paying users (16% convert to any payment), average $1/month per paying user from mix of $3/month subscriptions and one-time $5 purchases. Six months of work generating $340 monthly is $0.56 per hour invested.​\n\nWhy App Store monetization fails, users expect free, won't pay for productivity apps they can replace with free alternatives, subscriptions feel predatory in crowded category, one-time purchases don't create recurring revenue. You're competing with venture-backed apps that are free forever trying to reach 100M users before monetizing.\n\nWhat actually works picked the wrong category (productivity is bloodbath), should've built for niche B2B use case at $10-30/month, focused on 100 paying customers not 10,000 free users. My friend's contractor management app has 400 downloads, 80 paying at $15/month = $1,200 monthly. Lower downloads, 10x revenue.​\n\nThe App Store dream is dead for indie devs in consumer categories. You need niche B2B or accept poverty. Found this studying app economics in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) successful indie apps charged $10-50/month for professional use cases, failed apps tried consumer freemium competing with VC-backed companies.\n\nHow many downloads vs actual revenue? Bet most ratios are equally depressing.",

Classic engineer mistake.\n\nHere's what I do now before writing a single line of code:\n\n**Week 1: 10 Conversation Rule**\n\n* Find 10 people who have the problem you think you're solving\n* Don't pitch your solution. Just listen to them complain about their current workflow\n* If they don't complain unprompted, the problem isn't painful enough\n\n**Week 2: Wallet Test**\n\n* Describe your solution in 2 sentences\n* Ask: \"If this existed today for $X/month, would you pay for it?\"\n* If they hesitate or say \"maybe,\" that's a no\n\n**Week 3: Landing Page**\n\n* Simple landing page (Carrd, Framer, Lovable (AI), takes 30 mins)\n* Explain the solution, add email signup\n* Share it in relevant communities\n* Goal: 50+ signups before building anything\n\nThis process has saved me months of wasted dev time. Killed 3 ideas at validation stage that I would've built otherwise.\n\nHardest part? Accepting that your idea might not be the one. Way better to learn that in week 3 than month 6.\n\nYouTube videos that helped:\n\n* [10 step playbook. $200k/m in SaaS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zh8_yiPh4&pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv)\n* [2 brothers. $30k/m. Validation pays off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST2ROUFbdvU&pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIHZhbGlkYXRlIHlvdXIgYXBwIGlkZWE%3D)\n\nAnyone else learn this the hard way? What's your validation process?",

Reddit niches, Indie Hackers comments, GitHub issues, Discord servers, Twitter replies. Anywhere people describe broken workflows in plain language. I reach out selectively, ask about their process, no pitching upfront. Patterns show up fast. And then, there's always ads to help gauge who listens.\n\nFinding an audience before building is great too. Search any problem in google.. scroll down a bit and look at the dropdowns that rephrase or dive deeper (Google does this because these are real questions) .. copy and paste that into the search and keep drilling like that and you'll end up finding what people are actively looking for. Takes less than an hour.\n\nTarget that in your preferred marketing tool.\n\nu/richie_dev",

If they stop sending data after 2–3 days, it means the problem wasn’t urgent enough, no matter what they said on calls.\n\nFor the landing page phase, I’ve used Carrd + Stripe preauth + a waitlist, driven traffic from Indie Hackers, Reddit, and sometimes tools like Hypefury; lately I’ve added Pulse alongside SparkToro to find and join the exact Reddit threads where those users are already complaining.\n\nMain point: don’t trust words alone, trust who keeps showing up when it’s slightly inconvenient for them.",

I opened up features, removed most paywalls, and thought if people genuinely found it useful, they’d keep coming back. The assumption was simple. Use it enough, see the value, and eventually upgrading would feel natural.\n\nThe app is Zolly, and it quietly does a lot of the things founders usually juggle across multiple tools. Most of the premium tools I gave for free over here like Claude, Gpt. Provided a far better alternative for prompt to edit. \nI made most of that available for free, thinking generosity would drive trust and habit.\n\nWhat actually happened surprised me. People signed up, explored everything, and then stopped right there.\n\nNo complaints. No angry feedback. Just silence.\n\nIt’s making me question whether free really builds value or if it accidentally removes urgency. Without ads, influencers, or a budget, promotion feels like an entirely different game than building the product itself. Code ships fast. Distribution doesn’t.\n\nI’d genuinely love to hear from founders who’ve tried to grow an app with zero marketing spend. What actually worked for you once the product was already live?",

It wasn't what I asked, and it got the prompt all wrong.\n\nHonestly I think that people don't use more because it's not aggregating anything on top of all the million free stuff that we have. All my websites I created using Google AI Studio and it gives me a lot of amazing stuff for free. \n\nI know there are paid options out there that are much better, but that is the thing, if I pay I want something at least 5x better than google already offer me, and in the first test I got from your website, it gave me something 5x worse than what google is giving me more free. So I don't see a real reason to switch from the one I use. \n\n  \nAs for marketing, you have some sort of advantage because what you created is something visually appealing. So even without spending money or whatever, if you have a prompt that you can throw there and it's going to give something extremely good I think you can post those screenshots on X or Reddit (some sub about the topic) and people may be interested.

It's slower than paid growth, but it's sustainable and often leads to better retention.Here's what actually works (in rough order of impact/effort):\n\n1. Nail App Store Optimization (ASO) – This is free and your biggest lever. Use free tools like AppTweak or Sensor Tower's free tier to research keywords. Optimize your title, subtitle, description, icons, and screenshots. Good ASO alone can get you into search results and browse sections.\n2. Launch strategically on communities\n   * Product Hunt: Prep a good launch (story, visuals, early upvotes from friends). Many apps get 1k–10k+ visits from one solid PH day.\n   * Reddit: Post in niche subs related to your app's problem (not just promo subs—share your journey or \"I built this to solve X\"). Also r/SideProject, r/indiehackers.\n   * Hacker News (Show HN) if it's technical.\n   * IndieHackers: Share milestones and get feedback.\n3. Build in public on social\n   * X/Twitter: Thread about your dev process, challenges, wins. Tag relevant people/hashtags. Organic reach is still decent if you're consistent and helpful.\n   * TikTok/YouTube Shorts: Quick demos or \"how this app solves \\[pain point\\]\" videos. These can go viral easier than long-form.\n   * LinkedIn: Great if B2B—share professional insights.\n4. Content & SEO\n   * Start a simple blog/Substack/devlog about your niche. Rank for long-tail keywords related to the problem your app solves.\n   * Guest post on relevant blogs or answer Quora questions with subtle links.\n5. Cross-promos & partnerships\n   * Reach out to other indie devs with non-competing apps for shoutout swaps.\n   * Join Discord/Slack communities in your niche and be genuinely helpful first.\n6. Encourage organic sharing\n   * Build referral/viral loops if possible (e.g., share to unlock features).\n   * Ask early users for reviews (huge for ASO).\n   * Submit to free app directories and review sites.\n\nIt takes consistency (post/share weekly) and focusing on real value—people share useful stuff. Most overnight successes were grinding organically for months.What's your app about? That could unlock more targeted ideas (e.g., if it's productivity vs gaming, channels differ a lot).Good luck—you got this!",

How generous!  lol...\n\nAnyways, it got me thinking that this could actually work out for free if we just did some of this for each other.  \n  \nSo, I'm offering to give you honest feedback and actually sit with you over a video call for a proper user test if you'll do the same for me.  And maybe others in this thread can also partner up for this sort of exchange.  \n  \nMy app is a language learning app, so ideally I would like to do this exchange with some people who have used Duolingo or other apps a good bit.\n\nWe recently crossed 1000 downloads/month too.  Not a ton, but I'd be happy share with you how we did that and we can trade tips and tricks during our meeting too.\n\nCheers ya'll!",

Translating your metadata (title, subtitle, description, keywords) can open up a lot of organic downloads in markets with less competition.\n\nI kept my app English-only for about a month after launch. After localizing, Germany became my #1 market and passed the US. International users are searching in their own language, they just can't find you if your listing isn't there.\n\nI built a tool for this called ShipLocal ([shiplocal.app](https://shiplocal.app)) that connects to App Store Connect and handles the translations automatically. Free tier, no credit card. Might be worth trying.",

      "text": "Spent years building products hoping the right users would show up. They didn't.\n\nNow I find the audience before I write a single line of code. Takes less than an hour and it's completely free.\n\n**The Google Drill Method:**\n\nGoogle your problem. Scroll past the ads and top results. Look for the dropdown suggestions that appear when you click the search bar or scroll down the page.\n\nThese aren't random. Google shows these because people are actively searching for them right now.\n\nCopy one of those phrases. Search it. Scroll again. New dropdowns appear.\n\nKeep drilling. Each click takes you deeper into what people are actually looking for - not what you think they need.\n\n**Here's what this looks like in practice:**\n\n**Starting search:** \"app analytics tool\"\n\n**First dropdown layer:**\n\n* \"app analytics tool for startups\"\n* \"app analytics tool free\"\n* \"app analytics tool comparison\"\n\nPick one. Let's go with \"app analytics tool for startups.\"\n\n**Second dropdown layer:**\n\n* \"best app analytics for early stage startups\"\n* \"startup app analytics under $50\"\n* \"app analytics that integrates with Stripe\"\n\nNow you're getting specific. Pick \"app analytics that integrates with Stripe.\"\n\n**Third layer:**\n\n* \"Stripe analytics for SaaS revenue\"\n* \"track Stripe payments by feature\"\n* \"Stripe MRR dashboard\"\n\n**You just found your niche in 3 minutes.**\n\nPeople are actively searching \"Stripe MRR dashboard\" - that's not a hypothetical need. That's active demand you can target today.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n**Google's algorithm optimizes for real behavior.** Dropdowns = searches happening right now. Not guesses. Not trends from 2 years ago. Live demand.\n\n**You skip the \"build and hope\" phase.** If nobody's searching for it, that's a signal before you waste months building.\n\n**You find exact language your audience uses.** When you write your landing page or ads, use these exact phrases. They're already proven to get clicks.\n\n**What to do with this data:**\n\nOnce you've drilled down 3-4 layers, you have:\n\n* Your exact audience (early stage startups tracking Stripe revenue)\n* Their specific pain (need MRR dashboard)\n* The words they use to search for solutions\n\nNow you can:\n\n1. Build a landing page using that exact phrase as your headline\n2. Create content targeting those search terms\n3. Run targeted ads on Reddit/Twitter/Google to that specific query\n4. Join communities where people with that problem hang out\n\nYou're not guessing anymore. You're building for people who are already looking.\n\n**Also:** This method works for competitive research too.\n\nSearch your competitor's name. Look at the \"People also ask\" and \"Related searches\" sections. You'll see what problems their users still have that they're not solving.\n\nThat's your gap. Build there.\n\n**--------**\n\nWhat methods do you use to find your audience before building? Always looking for new approaches.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/user/Silent_Payment5495/)\n\n  \n  \nThis may help you guys: [Silent\\_Payment5495](https://www.reddit.com/user/Silent_Payment5495/) & [Richie\\_Dev](https://www.reddit.com/user/richie_dev/)[](https://www.reddit.com/?feed=home)",

UX/UI design  \nBad UX kills apps faster than bugs.  \nWireframes and user flows save months of rework later.\n\n  \n3. Development  \nFrontend + backend + APIs + logic.  \nThis is where traditional dev gets hard fast.\n\n  \n4. Testing  \nDifferent devices, screen sizes, OS versions.  \nA buggy launch = bad reviews = dead app.\n\n  \n5. Launch & maintenance  \nThe part nobody plans for.  \nOS updates, bug fixes, feature requests - it never really \"ends\".\n\n  \nThis is why a lot of founders use AI app builders like Base44 to remove the heaviest technical lift and focus on product, UX, and users instead.\n\n  \nYou don’t need to be a senior engineer - but you do need a plan.  \nWhat stage do you think most first-time founders underestimate?",
