If they have a widget for progress and a widget that you can check off shit you’ve done from your Home Screen, or allow exporting stats/importing checks through shortcuts I’d consider it, but I doubt it.",

Technology should be used for helping people not diminishing children’s attention spans, I get that the format and wording of this post is very…familiar, but I wouldn’t write this off as someone trying to take your money and give you nothing, if you’re already at a place you want to be, that might be the case, but something like this could be a god send to someone who really needs it, and unfortunately the  screen your looking at has turned a lot of people into the demographic this could actually help. We only have so much time here, and im pretty sure there’s tens of millions of people who’s precious seconds are, as you read this, being factored into  the cost of an ad as it harvests their attention. I honestly love seeing shit like this because this is the internet my brothers and future children will have to navigate, the skepticism is only natural but you didn’t have to be rude about it, have a good day tho.",

When users can actually see change, they’re way more likely to stick around.\n\nWe also stopped focusing on big life goals and shifted to small daily actions. Stuff that takes 5-10 minutes. Once people feel it’s manageable, consistency improves naturally.\n\nAnother big win was weekly check-ins. Instead of generic reminders, users get short personalized summaries about what’s working and what they should focus on next. It feels more like a coach than an app.\n\nWe do use streaks, but we’re careful with them. Missing one day doesn’t kill momentum. We added recovery days so people don’t quit just because life happens.\n\nSomething else that helped was letting users see anonymous progress from others. Not in a social-media way, more like quiet motivation. It made people feel they’re not alone in this.\n\nSome features that surprised us with how well they worked:\n\n• Face and body analysis with clear improvement steps\n• Skincare, fitness, and style suggestions based on habits\n• Habit maps that show weak areas\n• Monthly reset plans\n• Smarter reminders that adapt to how people actually use the app\n\nBiggest thing we learned: motivation fades, but when people can see progress and have a clear structure, they stay.\n\nReally respect what you’ve built here. This kind of traction isn’t easy. Keep going 🚀",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI was getting tired of checking and downloading motivation apps and deleting them a few days later as these have static quotes, not personalised at all, they all kind of feel the same. Open app. Random quote. Close app. Forget about it.\n\nI didn’t want another quote database. I wanted something that actually reacts to *me,* how I’m feeling today, what I’m struggling with, what I’m trying to build.\n\nSo I built **Motivation AI**.\n\nInstead of just picking “Success” or “Gym,” you can actually modify the input parameters and shape what you get back (during the onboarding process and later on from the settings).\n\nYou can play with it every day:\n\n* Change your mood (burned out, focused, anxious, calm, disciplined, etc.)\n* Set your goals\n* Describe the problems you're facing\n* Choose a mindset style (stoic, zen, spiritual…)\n* If you're a religious person, you can reflect that too\n* In the Elite (Pro) version, I also experimented with multiple languages. You can set your preferred language, and the AI will generate quotes and motivation based on that selection. I’m also using it to translate legendary English quotes when they’re displayed, so they feel native rather than copy-pasted.\n\nBased on that, it generates something tailored to your current state.\n\nYou’re not locked into one personality.  \nToday you can go full stoic.  \nTomorrow you can go zen.  \nNext week you can switch to spiritual perseverance mode.\n\n**It adapts.**\n\n**On top of that, it blends:**\n\n* Real-time AI generation\n* \\+ Legendary quotes (Stoics, classic thinkers, visionaries)\n* Context-aware structure\n\nSo you often get a mix of AI-crafted guidance + timeless wisdom, shaped around your profile.\n\nIt feels more like a personalised mindset engine than a quote app.\n\nA few things I really cared about:\n\n🔐 **Privacy & security**\n\n* Apple App Attestation (every device verified before hitting the backend)\n* JWT authentication\n* Prompt guardrails\n* No account required\n* No email collection\n* No personal data stored\n* Everything anonymized\n* iCloud backup for your preferences\n\nYou can use it completely anonymously.\n\n🧠 **Real LLM model**  \nThis isn’t templates. It’s generated live using a real language model.\n\n💸 **And the honest part:**  \nEvery time someone presses “ignite,” it costs me money. AI calls aren’t cheap. So I’ve spent time optimising token usage, balancing local vs cloud logic, and trying to keep the free version alive without turning it into a subscription trap, *but of course if you unlock the premium version you will receive a lot (more ignites,* ***first access to new models and updates, change the language, use more themes,*** *use the Lockscreen widget and extend the notification's limit).*\n\nIt’s still early. I’m building and improving constantly.\n\n**I would genuinely love feedback and any new features ideas are extremely welcomed :)**\n\n* What would make you actually keep this installed?\n* Can be helpful?\n\nBrutal honesty is welcome. I’m building this as a solo indie dev and I want it to actually help people, not just look cool[https://apps.apple.com/app/motivation-ai/id6757965941](https://apps.apple.com/app/motivation-ai/id6757965941)\n\n**IG:**\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/app.motivation.ai](https://www.instagram.com/app.motivation.ai)\n\n**Website:**\n\n[https://motivation-ai.app/](https://motivation-ai.app/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbavn8krb4kg1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=461da35d45da3fe64991e11f0af0875f83bee322\n\nthis is the output after you change and personalise your identity, with the goals you want, struggles, mindset etc during the onboarding or later on from the settings area. each generated quote, beside the ones which are from the historical figures are unique to you.  \n",

              "text": "Hey, that’s a totally fair question :)\n\nYes, technically you can ask any LLM for a motivational quote. The difference isn’t *AI access*. It’s structure, friction, and intentional design.\n\nMost people don’t want to engineer prompts every day. They want a focused, frictionless experience + some things a chat bot will not be able to provide.\n\nHere’s what makes it different:\n\n1. **It’s not just “give me a quote.”** You can tune mood, goal, intensity, and mindset framing (stoic, faith-based, disciplined, aggressive, calm, etc.). It combines live AI generation with curated historical wisdom, so it’s structured, not random and you can modify **9 different parameters.**\n2. It integrates into your routine. **You can set notifications, use the widget, and display quotes on your lock screen**. A chatbot cannot do that.\n3. The prompting **system is layered. Behind the scenes I’m using multi-line structured prompts that adapt over time based on user inputs. To replicate that manually in a chatbot, you’d have to repeatedly provide 8–9 criteria every single time and each with other unique informations** — and most people won’t do that consistently and its not a nice experience.\n4. It’s built for retention, not one-off replies. **You can save favorites (AI-generated or historical), share them with designed templates and themes, and build a personal motivation archive.**\n5. Early stage, but strong signals. It’s still early, but the users who stick with it use it as part of a routine — before meetings, workouts, stressful moments. That’s the real test.\n\nIf for someone it feels the same as prompting AI directly, that’s completely valid. But for many people, the structured experience and behavioral integration is the value plus the ability to modify the AI based on your needs. If i need to make a comparision, why Lovable is used, or n8N? because in the backend they are relying on the same llm's, users acces these platforms for specific use-cases and because someone else put everything together ",

If the app doesn’t appear in the Lifestyle chart, that’s precisely the inconsistency I’m pointing out not something I’m trying to fabricate.\n\nAccusing someone of lying while misunderstanding how App Store payments and rankings function doesn’t really strengthen your argument.

The real signal comes in the next couple of days when App Store analytics fully update, especially impressions → product page views → conversion rate. That funnel will tell you if this is sustainable or just a launch spike.\n\nFrom my experience, the biggest driver long-term is maintaining revenue momentum. Apple tends to keep giving visibility to apps that consistently generate revenue. So the key isn’t just getting traffic, it’s making sure your conversion rate is strong enough to keep turning future impressions into paying users.",

      "text": "Yes actually. \n\n(Btw no I have no marketing software/course/saas/etc. to sell you. I’m sharing what I did for a Bible study app lol) \n\nI marketed the app. Showed zero screenshots of styles or features of the app. All I did was make an app that I really believed him and I knew solve the problem that people actually had.\n\nSo how?\n\nFraming and solving a real problem are really the two big aspects that allowed me to do this.\n\nFraming: let assume that you’re selling a cooking/recipe. Extremely popular niche and has a lot of opportunity for subscriptions. You can either mark this as a recipe app, which is boring and is not interesting to anybody. Or you could make some form of a game modified version of this where you have a timer inside of the app where people have to make all their meals and under 25 minutes to show how easy and simple your meals are. Or are you frame it like you’re just having a conversation with a chef and in 15 seconds you get your dream meal.\n\nThe big difference is you’re solving the actual pain point that people have by making a different version of pretty much the exact same app that everybody else would be making anyways, but the functionality makes all of the difference\n\nSolving a real problem: I’m in a lot of these different sub, edits and some of the different app ideas that people have just kind of made me scratch my head. I wanna clarify that any app can make money and all apps even if they’re ugly or monetizing if you’re good enough at marketing.\n\nThe issue I’m seeing a lot is most of you all suck at marketing and you’re building a mediocre product when it comes to the problem that you’re solving. Simply put your idea isn’t an irresistible idea.\n\nSo that leads you down two paths you can either just be really good at marketing and push through the noise by having maybe a mediocre idea but excellent marketing. Or the other option is you can have an incredible idea and maybe even be terrible at marketing, but it’s such a good idea that people wanna share it with their friends.\n\nSo my Bible Study app fixed this problem. There are plenty of Bible Study apps out there and mine is a bit of a hybrid of a few things mixed together. By the way, it is not the one that you’ll find in my profile that I’m referring to right now.\n\nSo now how did they get 250 Leads to sign up for the app before actually even having it in the App Store? Well, I already had the idea for the app and what all features would be in the app so when it actually came to vibe coating it full transparency, it took me around two hours and all to vibecode the entire app.\n\nSo then, because I’ve done this a few times now I was approving the App Store first try which obviously made the process a lot quicker and easier.  this was after dozens of rejections on other apps to be clear. \n\nSo all I did is, I went on TikTok and Instagram reels and told people that I thought my idea was probably gonna be stupid in a terrible idea and then just shared what the app would do and I said if you’re interested, the word yes.\n\nThen the automation software dm’ed everyone the sign up page. \n\nI asked for name and phone number so could text them when it was live. \n\nResults: \n\nWell, this will happen this past week and in the first 48 hours of the app actually being live in the App Store we’re currently at $1000 in revenue. This definitely exceeded my expectations, but I am very very grateful. Obviously it’s too early to tell, but I’m guessing in the first 30 days the apps gonna hit between $5000 and $7500.\n\nSo 250 leads and currently at ironically 25 customers. \n\nYou wanna know what’s even crazier? (Feel free to make fun) \n\nI’m only in the App Store. I’ve gotten around a dozen messages now from people asking me when it’s gonna be in the play store. Meaning that my numbers would probably already be doubled. If I had it in Google play store but my dingdong self just didn’t expect a lot of people from the play store to be interested in the first place honestly\n\nI’ll update you all in the next week or so once that is up and what that does to the amount of new customers as well\n\nTLDR stop wasting time on building your product and just go out there and market it like crazy. If people don’t like the app then stop wasting time marketing it or start marketing it in a way that people are actually interested in. This is real life results for me doing this for the very first time myself over the past two weeks.",

      "text": "Launched our app three months ago banking on app store optimization to drive downloads. Optimized title, screenshots, keywords, description. Everything the ASO guides recommend. Got maybe 15-20 downloads per week, mostly from people who already knew about us. The problem was treating the app store as the only discovery channel. We were competing with millions of apps for attention in a crowded marketplace where the top charts get 90% of downloads.\n\n Built a parallel web presence to capture search traffic outside the app stores. Created a landing page explaining what the app does and why it solves specific problems. Then focused on getting that page to rank organically. Started with domain authority since the landing page domain had none. Used [backlink agency to establish baseline trust through directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to app directories and startup listings. This gave the web presence legitimacy separate from app store rankings.\n\n Then published 10 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to what the app solves. Not \"download our app\" content but actual helpful posts about the problem space. Things like \"how to solve X without Y\" or \"best way to manage Z on mobile.\"\n\n Month one showed minimal impact. Directory listings went live and the blog posts got indexed but downloads stayed around 20 weekly. The web presence existed but wasn't driving discovery yet.\n\n Month two is when organic web traffic started converting to downloads. Domain authority reached 18 and blog posts began ranking for longtail problem keywords. People found the content, read about the solution, then downloaded the app. Got to 60 downloads weekly. \n\nMonth three hit 120 downloads per week with 65% coming from organic web search rather than app store discovery. The conversion flow works because people arrive educated about their problem and our solution before hitting the app store.\n\n The interesting metric is retention. Users who find us through organic content have 3x better week-one retention than app store browsers. They downloaded with clear intent to solve a specific problem rather than casual exploration. The app business lesson is that the app stores are distribution but not the only distribution. Building organic web presence creates a discovery channel you control. People search for solutions on Google way more than they browse app store categories.\n\n If your app downloads are stuck relying on app store optimization, build a web funnel that captures search traffic and educates users before sending them to download.",

Every time we reduced ad spend, signups dropped almost immediately. It felt like we were stuck on a treadmill. \n\nAbout 6-7 months in, we decided to take SEO more seriously, especially [GetMoreBacklinks](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). We tried outreach ourselves, but it was time-consuming and hard to do consistently while also building the product. Eventually, we allocated budget toward structured outreach and used a service from GetMoreBacklinks to help secure contextual placements while we focused on improving our core pages and onboarding. \n\nNothing happened overnight. But after a few months, some of our key pages started climbing. One keyword hit page one, then a few more followed. \n\nThat’s when things changed. \n\nOrganic traffic started compounding. Signups became more consistent. And for the first time, we weren’t fully dependent on ads to grow. \n\nBacklinks didn’t magically fix everything; product, retention, and conversion still mattered, but they helped us build a foundation where growth became more predictable. \n\nCurious if other app founders here have had a similar experience with backlinks playing a turning point role, or if most of your growth has come from other channels.",
