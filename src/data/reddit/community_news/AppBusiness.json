In a few weeks check message boards, forums, etc for maybe users or IT’s looking at the app, etc.\n\nOnce you find out, it will be almost impossible to get $$ because high chances are each school has its own budgets, etc.\n\nYou want them using the app so suggest support, etc. even 30k of the 100k using the app even if students is MASSSSSIVE App Store usage, so give it another year to keep checking around (next school year too).

I'm seeing 3-5x more organic installs than I ever got from just\nkeyword optimization. It really feels like the App Store algo is weighing social signals pretty heavily now. \n\nUS TikTok views specifically seem to correlate with ranking boosts in competitive categories.\nI kept it super simple. Just 12-second demo clips, literally just a swipe gesture leading to \"instant calm\".I used trending audio and hashtags like #appcalm. The biggest issue was that since I'm not in the US, the FYP wasn't pushing my stuff to Americans. I was stuck at like 12% US audience share no matter what I did.\n\nI ended up switching to a geo-verified setup (used tokportal for the US device provisioning) and my audience immediately jumped to 92% US. Impressions went up 4x without spending a dime on ads.\n\n\nAlso, weird finding: \"Free Trial\" on the landing page beat \"Download Now\" by 28%. We hit category rank #47 in the US within 10 days of the TikTok account taking off. Anyone else\nusing TikTok specifically for ASO?",

They’ll keep getting removed. Instead, show up in threads about language learning, self-study, flashcards, “how to learn Portuguese”, etc., and give genuinely useful answers. Only drop the link when someone explicitly asks for it.\n* The bottleneck is usually “value before install.” With language apps especially, people need to feel the result before they become an “app user.” A solid test is a web2app flow: short web quiz/onboarding (why PT, level, minutes/day) plus a quick preview of the outcome (your first deck or plan or sample cards), then payment on the web, then a deferred deep link into the App Store so the first open feels seamless and access is already active. You can set this up quickly with web2wave without building all the infrastructure yourself.\n* If you go TikTok, I wouldn’t run “app ads.” I’d run content ads around the pain: why vocab doesn’t stick, how spaced repetition works, etc. Then send people not straight to the store, but into that web2app flow where the promise is clear and the user is warmed up.\n\nGood luck.

          "text": "\nTL;DR: Search Everything Optimization.\n\nI’ve just finished building a new app myself. I’m strong on building, weaker on marketing, and I’ve learned the same lesson you’re pointing at: a lot of “growth channels” sound good on paper but don’t move the needle in reality.\n\nWhat has worked for me so far is focusing almost obsessively on search optimization. Over the last ~2 weeks, this alone has brought in ~70 registered users with zero paid marketing. No ads, no promos. Just people actively looking for a solution and finding mine.\n\nWord of mouth absolutely compounds this once it starts, but search is what creates the initial surface area for that to happen.\n\nWhen I say search optimization, I don’t just mean classic SEO.\n\nWe’re now in a world of:\n\t•\tSearch engines (Google, Bing)\n\t•\tApp stores\n\t•\tAI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)\n\t•\tVoice assistants\n\t•\tAnswer engines and snippets\n\nSo I’ve been thinking of it less as “SEO” and more as search everything optimization:\n\t•\tMaking sure the app can be discovered wherever people ask questions\n\t•\tStructuring content so machines can understand and recommend it\n\t•\tAnswering very specific problems instead of broad keywords\n\t•\tReducing friction from “I have a problem” → “this is the solution”\n\nWhat surprised me most is how non-scalable this felt at first. Writing very targeted pages, FAQs, and explanations felt slow and boring compared to launching campaigns. But it compounds quietly, and unlike ads, it keeps working even when you stop actively pushing.\n\nThings I tried that felt promising but went nowhere:\n\t•\tGeneric social posting without a clear search or intent hook\n\t•\tBroad content without a defined problem it answered\n\t•\t“Growth hacks” before people could even find the product organically\n\nMy takeaway so far:\nIf people can’t find you at the moment they’re looking for help, nothing else really matters. Once they can, everything else suddenly works better.\n\nWould be curious to hear if others have seen similar results or if different channels kicked in only after search traction existed.",

That usually means tightening onboarding and in‑app loops until people come back on their own, then using focused channels like ASO, a couple of niche communities, and very targeted outreach instead of spraying content or ads everywhere.\n\nOnce you know who sticks and why, tools that give you ultra‑specific lead lists help a lot more than broad traffic - for example, if your app serves creators or small businesses active on Instagram, pulling verified emails from followers of niche accounts with IGScraping lets you talk directly to people already showing interest in your space instead of hoping they stumble across your app in a crowded store.",

You can also then use push campaigns for win-back and re-engagement.\n\nWe also optimise ASO and experiment with paid ads continuously.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched my first ever app 3 days ago! It was purely organic and completely free (no paid plans yet). I'm mainly looking for feedback and data right now, and I’ve already hit **147 users**.\n\nBounce rate: 68%, returning users: 13\n\nI'm really happy with the number, but I honestly have no idea if that's considered \"good\" for a first launch? I'm also not sure if they are actively using it or just creating an account and leaving.\n\n**The Challenge:** My app is focused on **social accountability**. I realized that if a user joins but doesn't have friends on the app yet, they might leave. So, I think I'll add some \"single-player\" features so people can enjoy it alone while waiting to connect with others.\n\nI also created a Discord to help users find like-minded people, but no members yet\n\nNext steps: I'm going to start making content on social media and see what happens.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!",

Need a platform that handles opt-in properly and lets us send timely transactional messages plus occasional promotional ones. Also want to coordinate sms with push notifications so we're not bombarding users across every channel.\n\nWhat sms marketing platforms do app businesses use that balance engagement without damaging user experience?",

      "text": "so im a marketing assistant for a company and few months ago i read a post here on reddit saying how they get clients from facebook ads of competitors, and it caught my attention.\n\nI’ve been doing this for our company now and we are getting a ton of appointments, completely for free.\n\nWe are 3 months into this and our strategy has evolved a lot so i just wanted to post it to help you guys out a bit, if you’re struggling to grow keep reading.\n\nheres that we did:\n\n1.listed down all of our competitors, for us we had approximately 300 competitors that came up on google.\n\n2.after I listed all of our competitors, i went to their website and checked how many of them had facebook page, approximately 180 of them had a facebook page\n\n3.after that i went to meta ads library and checked how many of them were actively running ads, there were 40 companies actively running ads.\n\n4.We then listed all the ad posts these companies were running on a google sheet, we had approximately 200 different ads being run.\n\n5.We then hired a virtual assistant from  [u/offshorewolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/offshorewolf/)  for $99/week full time (their general va, yes not a typo full time 8 hours a day assistant for $99/week)\n\nSo what this VA does is, she goes to all the 200 ads every single day, and dms people who have liked, commented in competitors ads.\n\nThese users were already interested in our competitors service meaning our reply rate from these people was really really high.\n\nThen the virtual assistant sends a personalized message, being honest always worked for us.\n\nHere’s what we sent:\n\nHey name, I noticed that you were checking COMPETITOR PAGE , we actually do YOUR CORE OFFER, often at much better PRICE OR RESULTS, do you want me to send more info?\n\nSince these people were already interested in a similar service that we offered, we got insane reply rate, 30-40%.\n\nThe VA then tracks all the dms sent in a google sheet, who was messageed, when, whether they replied or not.\n\nWe use a tagging system:\n\ninterested, not interested, ghosted, follow up again\n\nOnce a lead replies positively, the VA either continues the convo or books a time on our calendar for a discovery call (depending on each circumstance).\n\nThis method alone has brought in dozens of warm leads weekly, all for just $99 a week our cost is only the VA that we pay to manually go through all the ads, all day.\n\nMy COO and marketing director now thank me, even after 3 months they still say they cant believe I’m bringing leads for free using our competitors ad spent.\n\nI just wanted to share, as it really worked well for us. Happy to answer any questions or confusions",

Main thing I’d layer on is qualification and rotation: score leads based on comment type (pain point vs generic like), how often they engage with that brand, and how recently they interacted. Prioritize fresh, high-intent people so your VA isn’t spraying the same pool every week.\n\n\n\nI’d also build a simple feedback loop: tag calls with “source ad + objection,” then tweak the outreach script monthly. If you see the same pushback (price, timing, trust), pre-handle it in the second message instead of waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nFor scale, tools like Clay and PhantomBuster can help you surface similar prospects across platforms, and Pulse for Reddit is good if you want to catch folks asking about your competitors directly in niche subs without living here 24/7.\n\n\n\nMain point: keep the list fresh, qualify hard, and keep iterating the script off actual call notes so this doesn’t die as soon as competitors pause a few campaigns.",

Or should I be pivoting my distribution strategy entirely?\n\nAny roast or advice is welcome. Thanks!",

Short term for MVP this approach is okay, but long term you may want to think about an actual checkout flow.\n\nAs far as the admin panel, I assume you mean for yourself to modify users accounts? If so I would for sure go this route, it keeps errors down a minimum vs going in and changing database accounts directly. When I first started I used DB, but eventually I did switch to my own admin panel, it made the flow easy, especially if I was away from my pc I could just log in from my phone and make the changes. Although you can start out with DB directly as you build your admin panel.\n\nI would say whatever is stopping you from launching, don't let it, every new MVP will have pain points, you just need to make sure users are aware this is the first version and it will get better with time. As long as they find value and very little issues, they will continue to use it.",

If not, move on or pivot.\n\n⸻\n\nYou don’t need to choose between “market this forever” or “quit too early.”\nYou need a time-boxed experiment with objective signals.\n\nWhat’s worked for me and others:\n\n1) Launch, then commit to 14–30 days of focused distribution\nNot vague marketing. Pick 1–2 channels max:\n\t•\tSearch (SEO / App Store / Play Store search)\n\t•\tA niche community where people already complain about the problem\n\nIf you can’t drive any targeted traffic in 30 days, that’s already a signal.\n\n2) Define pass/fail metrics before you start\nExamples:\n\t•\t% of visitors who sign up\n\t•\tDay-1 / Day-7 retention\n\t•\t“Would you be annoyed if this disappeared?” feedback\n\nIf users don’t return or don’t care, more marketing won’t fix it.\n\n3) Don’t confuse slow growth with no signal\nSlow but improving = keep going\nFlat + zero engagement = stop or pivot\n\n4) Build your next app in parallel, not instead\nMost first apps fail. The real skill is shipping fast and validating fast.\n\nRule of thumb:\nIf users pull you forward, double down.\nIf you’re pushing uphill with no traction, move on.\n\nThe biggest waste isn’t quitting early — it’s spending months without real signals.",
