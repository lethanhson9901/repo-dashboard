          "text": "I've followed a similar path to achieve results like yours. Here's my perspective.\n\n# Organic Growth\n\n* ASO (App Store Optimization) is great because it brings free traffic. Be grateful when your app ranks well. But don't feel discouraged if it doesn't. It is not a reliable source you can fully depend on.\n   * The Apple and Google Store search algorithms are black boxes. No one truly knows how they work, and they can change anytime.\n   * New apps enter the market every day, increasing competition.\n* Daily posting on TikTok or Instagram works for some people. It didn't work for me. I tried, but creating content manually every day was exhausting and hard to sustain.\n* Posting on forums like Reddit works to some extent. You may get tens or hundreds of downloads occasionally, but it is not scalable.\n* Cold emailing website editors to feature your app can work too. You might get tens, hundreds, or even thousands of downloads once in a while. But again, it is not scalable.\n\n# Paid Ads\n\nFor me, the only channel that truly moves the needle is paid advertising. It works and it scales.\n\nHere is my experience:\n\n* Google Ads works well for Android apps, but not as effectively for iOS. Scaling can be challenging.\n* Apple Search Ads works well for iOS apps, but scaling is limited.\n* Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram) works very well for iOS apps and is extremely scalable.\n* TikTok Ads traffic, in my experience, is less likely to convert into paying users.\n* You need to create many different ad creatives. Hopefully, a few will emerge as strong performers.\n* Consider targeting non-English-speaking countries. These markets often have lower advertising costs due to less competition.\n* Be prepared to fail and to lose a meaningful amount of money while testing. For example, you may test ads in 10 markets, and only 2 become profitable. Even then, study why the other 8 failed. Use those lessons to refine your strategy or move on.\n* A/B testing and funnel analysis should be ongoing processes to improve profitability.\n* Tools like CapCut, Canva, and Nano Banana are great for beginners to create reasonably good ad creatives.\n* Some people are able to make it work by collaborating with influencers to promote their app. I haven't felt the urge to try that yet, as I believe it can be more expensive than paid ads and harder to measure performance effectively.\n\nCongrats and good luck. It is always inspiring to see an indie founder succeed after years of perseverance.",

Currently I'm testing Meta but my creatives are burning out very quickly (ad fatigue). And I don't see myself creating new creatives over and over again. What is your experience there?   \nTotally agree on that money burning aspect. Specially Meta felt like huge pain when testing creatives. Burned some hundreds within days just to figure out what might work for scaling.   \nFrom my experience it's also really hard to find some influencers. They barely answer my IG messages or emails. I can't understand how people manage to find dozens of influencer which are creating content for them. \n\nWhat you're working on at the moment? ",

For my music visualizer I recently saw decline in rankings + organic downloads and couldn't really figure out why exactly this was happening. Also what we see right now is a huge increase in apps which are released due to lower entry barriers (vibe coding and AI-powered coding). Releasing an app is so fast now. I recently started an experiment to develop + submit a vibe coded dev tool for color conversion and the hole process took 1 hour. From developing the concept over vibe coding it to submitting it to the AppStore for review. Back in the days when I started, that would have taken a hole day or so. But there are still opportunities out there. I started a MIDI Controller app end last year which works okay regarding organic downloads but majority of my newly released apps get less than 10 downloads a day. ",

Nice you finished it! \n\nI don't want to question your skills or offend you in any way but from my experience you'll generate nearly nothing from your first app (hope it's different for your first app). But keep going, your second app will be better and you'll also develop it way faster. \n\nMy recommendation is to see if there's interest for your app and you can get some downloads. Organic downloads are the most important thing in my opinion specially when you just started and don't have budget for paid marketing. I personally released MVP's for some apps completely for free just to get a feeling for the downloads I can get with it. If I'm unable to get some downloads, I usually move on to the next app. ",

Later you build processes for feedback, onboarding, retention, content, distribution, etc.\n\nThe companies that last aren’t necessarily the ones with the best launch.\n\nThey’re the ones that keep improving the boring internal loops for years.\n\n8 years of iteration is actually the impressive part here, not the number.\n\nThe internet loves overnight success stories, but most real ones look exactly like this. ❤️",

Hard to sell apps with no revenue. I would acquire them only if I see strong potential like high amount of constant downloads and no proper monetization strategy. But this is really an individual thing and every buyer thinks different here. My experience is that if the app relevant enough, people will just reach out to you but you can also list and browse apps on Flippa (marketplace for apps). They also have a team of people which help you to estimate the value of your app or saas. ",

If they have a widget for progress and a widget that you can check off shit you’ve done from your Home Screen, or allow exporting stats/importing checks through shortcuts I’d consider it, but I doubt it.",

Technology should be used for helping people not diminishing children’s attention spans, I get that the format and wording of this post is very…familiar, but I wouldn’t write this off as someone trying to take your money and give you nothing, if you’re already at a place you want to be, that might be the case, but something like this could be a god send to someone who really needs it, and unfortunately the  screen your looking at has turned a lot of people into the demographic this could actually help. We only have so much time here, and im pretty sure there’s tens of millions of people who’s precious seconds are, as you read this, being factored into  the cost of an ad as it harvests their attention. I honestly love seeing shit like this because this is the internet my brothers and future children will have to navigate, the skepticism is only natural but you didn’t have to be rude about it, have a good day tho.",

When users can actually see change, they’re way more likely to stick around.\n\nWe also stopped focusing on big life goals and shifted to small daily actions. Stuff that takes 5-10 minutes. Once people feel it’s manageable, consistency improves naturally.\n\nAnother big win was weekly check-ins. Instead of generic reminders, users get short personalized summaries about what’s working and what they should focus on next. It feels more like a coach than an app.\n\nWe do use streaks, but we’re careful with them. Missing one day doesn’t kill momentum. We added recovery days so people don’t quit just because life happens.\n\nSomething else that helped was letting users see anonymous progress from others. Not in a social-media way, more like quiet motivation. It made people feel they’re not alone in this.\n\nSome features that surprised us with how well they worked:\n\n• Face and body analysis with clear improvement steps\n• Skincare, fitness, and style suggestions based on habits\n• Habit maps that show weak areas\n• Monthly reset plans\n• Smarter reminders that adapt to how people actually use the app\n\nBiggest thing we learned: motivation fades, but when people can see progress and have a clear structure, they stay.\n\nReally respect what you’ve built here. This kind of traction isn’t easy. Keep going 🚀",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI was getting tired of checking and downloading motivation apps and deleting them a few days later as these have static quotes, not personalised at all, they all kind of feel the same. Open app. Random quote. Close app. Forget about it.\n\nI didn’t want another quote database. I wanted something that actually reacts to *me,* how I’m feeling today, what I’m struggling with, what I’m trying to build.\n\nSo I built **Motivation AI**.\n\nInstead of just picking “Success” or “Gym,” you can actually modify the input parameters and shape what you get back (during the onboarding process and later on from the settings).\n\nYou can play with it every day:\n\n* Change your mood (burned out, focused, anxious, calm, disciplined, etc.)\n* Set your goals\n* Describe the problems you're facing\n* Choose a mindset style (stoic, zen, spiritual…)\n* If you're a religious person, you can reflect that too\n* In the Elite (Pro) version, I also experimented with multiple languages. You can set your preferred language, and the AI will generate quotes and motivation based on that selection. I’m also using it to translate legendary English quotes when they’re displayed, so they feel native rather than copy-pasted.\n\nBased on that, it generates something tailored to your current state.\n\nYou’re not locked into one personality.  \nToday you can go full stoic.  \nTomorrow you can go zen.  \nNext week you can switch to spiritual perseverance mode.\n\n**It adapts.**\n\n**On top of that, it blends:**\n\n* Real-time AI generation\n* \\+ Legendary quotes (Stoics, classic thinkers, visionaries)\n* Context-aware structure\n\nSo you often get a mix of AI-crafted guidance + timeless wisdom, shaped around your profile.\n\nIt feels more like a personalised mindset engine than a quote app.\n\nA few things I really cared about:\n\n🔐 **Privacy & security**\n\n* Apple App Attestation (every device verified before hitting the backend)\n* JWT authentication\n* Prompt guardrails\n* No account required\n* No email collection\n* No personal data stored\n* Everything anonymized\n* iCloud backup for your preferences\n\nYou can use it completely anonymously.\n\n🧠 **Real LLM model**  \nThis isn’t templates. It’s generated live using a real language model.\n\n💸 **And the honest part:**  \nEvery time someone presses “ignite,” it costs me money. AI calls aren’t cheap. So I’ve spent time optimising token usage, balancing local vs cloud logic, and trying to keep the free version alive without turning it into a subscription trap, *but of course if you unlock the premium version you will receive a lot (more ignites,* ***first access to new models and updates, change the language, use more themes,*** *use the Lockscreen widget and extend the notification's limit).*\n\nIt’s still early. I’m building and improving constantly.\n\n**I would genuinely love feedback and any new features ideas are extremely welcomed :)**\n\n* What would make you actually keep this installed?\n* Can be helpful?\n\nBrutal honesty is welcome. I’m building this as a solo indie dev and I want it to actually help people, not just look cool[https://apps.apple.com/app/motivation-ai/id6757965941](https://apps.apple.com/app/motivation-ai/id6757965941)\n\n**IG:**\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/app.motivation.ai](https://www.instagram.com/app.motivation.ai)\n\n**Website:**\n\n[https://motivation-ai.app/](https://motivation-ai.app/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbavn8krb4kg1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=461da35d45da3fe64991e11f0af0875f83bee322\n\nthis is the output after you change and personalise your identity, with the goals you want, struggles, mindset etc during the onboarding or later on from the settings area. each generated quote, beside the ones which are from the historical figures are unique to you.  \n",

              "text": "Hey, that’s a totally fair question :)\n\nYes, technically you can ask any LLM for a motivational quote. The difference isn’t *AI access*. It’s structure, friction, and intentional design.\n\nMost people don’t want to engineer prompts every day. They want a focused, frictionless experience + some things a chat bot will not be able to provide.\n\nHere’s what makes it different:\n\n1. **It’s not just “give me a quote.”** You can tune mood, goal, intensity, and mindset framing (stoic, faith-based, disciplined, aggressive, calm, etc.). It combines live AI generation with curated historical wisdom, so it’s structured, not random and you can modify **9 different parameters.**\n2. It integrates into your routine. **You can set notifications, use the widget, and display quotes on your lock screen**. A chatbot cannot do that.\n3. The prompting **system is layered. Behind the scenes I’m using multi-line structured prompts that adapt over time based on user inputs. To replicate that manually in a chatbot, you’d have to repeatedly provide 8–9 criteria every single time and each with other unique informations** — and most people won’t do that consistently and its not a nice experience.\n4. It’s built for retention, not one-off replies. **You can save favorites (AI-generated or historical), share them with designed templates and themes, and build a personal motivation archive.**\n5. Early stage, but strong signals. It’s still early, but the users who stick with it use it as part of a routine — before meetings, workouts, stressful moments. That’s the real test.\n\nIf for someone it feels the same as prompting AI directly, that’s completely valid. But for many people, the structured experience and behavioral integration is the value plus the ability to modify the AI based on your needs. If i need to make a comparision, why Lovable is used, or n8N? because in the backend they are relying on the same llm's, users acces these platforms for specific use-cases and because someone else put everything together ",

No big audience. No email list. No paid ads. Just me pressing “submit” and hoping at least a few people would care.\n\nI posted it on Product Hunt mostly to force myself to launch publicly. It’s not blowing up or anything. No crazy upvotes. No front page domination. Just a handful of people engaging and a few thoughtful comments.\n\nBut here’s the part that caught me off guard:\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the App Store charts… and right now it’s sitting at **#142 in its category in Germany**.\n\nThree hours in.\n\nI genuinely didn’t expect to see a ranking at all. I always assumed those charts were reserved for companies with marketing budgets and coordinated launches. Seeing my tiny, self-funded app show up there — even at #142 — feels surreal.\n\nWhat’s wild is realizing how small the early momentum actually is. It doesn’t take thousands of downloads to start moving the needle when you’re starting from zero. A bit of visibility, a few shares, some organic installs… and suddenly you’re “on the chart.”\n\nThe launch is still happening. I’m still refreshing everything way too often. I have no idea where it’ll end up by tonight — it might climb, it might disappear.\n\nBut right now, three hours after launching, something I built is ranking in the App Store. And that feels pretty incredible.\n\nIf you’re building something and waiting for the “perfect” moment — this is your sign to just ship it.\n\nHappy to answer questions while I sit here refreshing stats 😅",

I’m sharing what I did for a Bible study app lol) \n\nI marketed the app. Showed zero screenshots of styles or features of the app. All I did was make an app that I really believed him and I knew solve the problem that people actually had.\n\nSo how?\n\nFraming and solving a real problem are really the two big aspects that allowed me to do this.\n\nFraming: let assume that you’re selling a cooking/recipe. Extremely popular niche and has a lot of opportunity for subscriptions. You can either mark this as a recipe app, which is boring and is not interesting to anybody. Or you could make some form of a game modified version of this where you have a timer inside of the app where people have to make all their meals and under 25 minutes to show how easy and simple your meals are. Or are you frame it like you’re just having a conversation with a chef and in 15 seconds you get your dream meal.\n\nThe big difference is you’re solving the actual pain point that people have by making a different version of pretty much the exact same app that everybody else would be making anyways, but the functionality makes all of the difference\n\nSolving a real problem: I’m in a lot of these different sub, edits and some of the different app ideas that people have just kind of made me scratch my head. I wanna clarify that any app can make money and all apps even if they’re ugly or monetizing if you’re good enough at marketing.\n\nThe issue I’m seeing a lot is most of you all suck at marketing and you’re building a mediocre product when it comes to the problem that you’re solving. Simply put your idea isn’t an irresistible idea.\n\nSo that leads you down two paths you can either just be really good at marketing and push through the noise by having maybe a mediocre idea but excellent marketing. Or the other option is you can have an incredible idea and maybe even be terrible at marketing, but it’s such a good idea that people wanna share it with their friends.\n\nSo my Bible Study app fixed this problem. There are plenty of Bible Study apps out there and mine is a bit of a hybrid of a few things mixed together. By the way, it is not the one that you’ll find in my profile that I’m referring to right now.\n\nSo now how did they get 250 Leads to sign up for the app before actually even having it in the App Store? Well, I already had the idea for the app and what all features would be in the app so when it actually came to vibe coating it full transparency, it took me around two hours and all to vibecode the entire app.\n\nSo then, because I’ve done this a few times now I was approving the App Store first try which obviously made the process a lot quicker and easier.  this was after dozens of rejections on other apps to be clear. \n\nSo all I did is, I went on TikTok and Instagram reels and told people that I thought my idea was probably gonna be stupid in a terrible idea and then just shared what the app would do and I said if you’re interested, the word yes.\n\nThen the automation software dm’ed everyone the sign up page. \n\nI asked for name and phone number so could text them when it was live. \n\nResults: \n\nWell, this will happen this past week and in the first 48 hours of the app actually being live in the App Store we’re currently at $1000 in revenue. This definitely exceeded my expectations, but I am very very grateful. Obviously it’s too early to tell, but I’m guessing in the first 30 days the apps gonna hit between $5000 and $7500.\n\nSo 250 leads and currently at ironically 25 customers. \n\nYou wanna know what’s even crazier? (Feel free to make fun) \n\nI’m only in the App Store. I’ve gotten around a dozen messages now from people asking me when it’s gonna be in the play store. Meaning that my numbers would probably already be doubled. If I had it in Google play store but my dingdong self just didn’t expect a lot of people from the play store to be interested in the first place honestly\n\nI’ll update you all in the next week or so once that is up and what that does to the amount of new customers as well\n\nTLDR stop wasting time on building your product and just go out there and market it like crazy. If people don’t like the app then stop wasting time marketing it or start marketing it in a way that people are actually interested in. This is real life results for me doing this for the very first time myself over the past two weeks.",

      "text": "When we first launched our app, growth was slow. \n\nWe had a solid product, early users liked it, and we were publishing content consistently, but traffic was inconsistent and heavily dependent on paid ads. Every time we reduced ad spend, signups dropped almost immediately. It felt like we were stuck on a treadmill. \n\nAbout 6-7 months in, we decided to take SEO more seriously, especially [GetMoreBacklinks](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). We tried outreach ourselves, but it was time-consuming and hard to do consistently while also building the product. Eventually, we allocated budget toward structured outreach and used a service from GetMoreBacklinks to help secure contextual placements while we focused on improving our core pages and onboarding. \n\nNothing happened overnight. But after a few months, some of our key pages started climbing. One keyword hit page one, then a few more followed. \n\nThat’s when things changed. \n\nOrganic traffic started compounding. Signups became more consistent. And for the first time, we weren’t fully dependent on ads to grow. \n\nBacklinks didn’t magically fix everything; product, retention, and conversion still mattered, but they helped us build a foundation where growth became more predictable. \n\nCurious if other app founders here have had a similar experience with backlinks playing a turning point role, or if most of your growth has come from other channels.",

Wanted to share transparent numbers and lessons since I found posts like these helpful when I was starting out.\n\n**30-Day Numbers:**\n\n* 280 total downloads (180 US, rest international)\n* 22.2K impressions, 2.06K product page views\n* 1.62% conversion rate\n* $49 in proceeds, \\~$16.30 per paying user\n* 6.25 sessions per active device\n* 0 crashes\n\n**What worked:**\n\n* Web referrals drove 24% of downloads — Reddit and external content marketing actually moved the needle more than I expected\n* App Store Browse (32%) slightly edged out App Store Search (30.7%), which tells me ASO still needs work\n* High session count shows retention is solid once people are in the app\n* Zero crashes from day one built trust and helped with early reviews\n\n**What I'd do differently:**\n\n* Invest in App Store screenshots and an app preview video earlier. My conversion rate is low and I think the product page is the bottleneck\n* Start with a free trial instead of a straight paywall. I'm implementing a 7-day trial now — should've done this at launch\n* Get to 10+ ratings ASAP. Took longer than expected and the low rating count hurt conversion early on\n\n**Biggest surprise:** The engagement metrics were way better than expected. 6+ sessions per device for a finance app felt strong. But converting impressions to downloads is the real challenge — having a great app means nothing if people scroll past your listing.\n\n**What I'm focused on next:**\n\n* Better ASO and a preview video to improve that conversion rate\n\niOS : [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wall-street-stocks/id6756940110](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wall-street-stocks/id6756940110)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the journey — app store rejections, subscription setup.",

Maybe a couple of more things.. you may want to test with your app icon not just the screenshots as this is an another important pillar of ASO. Also, more ratings definitely matter and how you can achieve that is either putting them right after users taking some key actions. Typically in commerce, you would put them right after making a purchase. Or you may just place them in the onboarding flow if you feel the onboarding flow is strong. ",

The growth of [Bible Chat AI ](https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6448849666?country=US)is a perfect example.\n\nThey essentially built a ChatGPT wrapper for the Christian niche, but they didn't just stop at a text box. They added journaling, streaks, and push notifications—turning a LLM into a sticky utility.\n\n**The 3 things they did differently:**\n\n* **Short-form Distribution:** They dominate TikTok/IG with reaction videos. It’s a dead-simple funnel: Viral Clip → App Tutorial → Download.\n* **The \"Investment\" Onboarding:** They use a multi-step quiz before the paywall. By the time the user sees a price, they’ve already invested 2 minutes into \"personalizing\" their experience.\n* **Hyper-Localization:** They didn't just stick to the US; they targeted high-growth Christian regions globally.\n\nIt’s wild that a dev and an entrepreneur can outperform massive studios now. I've been trying to replicate this \"lean\" flow myself. Honestly, with [Cursor](http://cursor.com) or better Claude Code for the logic and [Appthetics](https://www.appthetics.com) to spin up the UI/UX without hiring a designer, the \"time to market\" has basically dropped to zero.\n\nHas anyone else seen \"niche wrappers\" doing these kinds of numbers? I’m looking for more case studies to deconstruct.\n\n",

Check [https://odmo.app](https://odmo.app)out\n\nThe app teaches you how to live healthy based on principles I know help me personally, and it also includes many features found in other apps, like natural recipes and relaxing audio.   \nAnd this is only the MVP version, so imagine what else it could include in the future.",
