New icon, better screenshots, reworked description, keyword research… still stuck at 15-20 installs per week.\n\nWhat we didn't realize was that the app store was only part of the discovery puzzle. The real issue: zero web authority around the product.\n\nSo we ran a small experiment and treated the app like a SaaS by building a backlink foundation for the landing site.\n\nFirst step was building a simple landing page that explained the app, use cases, and FAQs. Nothing fancy, just enough to give people a reason to understand what the app does before they hit the download button.\n\nThen we submitted the site to 200+ SaaS, startup, and app directories using [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org) so we weren't manually filling forms for days. The goal was to create enough external signals that Google would start caring about our domain.\n\nWe also published five low-competition blog posts targeting \"problem-based\" queries related to the app's core job, not just the app name itself. These posts weren't getting traffic immediately but they were ready to rank once the authority kicked in.\n\nAfter 60 days, domain authority went from zero to a level where we started ranking for longtail queries around the problem space. Organic traffic to the landing page steadily increased week over week. Most importantly, app installs from search and referral started to surpass installs from our original paid experiments.\n\nThe lesson: if your app business treats the app store as the only front door, growth stalls fast. Giving the app a proper web footprint with backlinks and indexable content turned out to be the multiplier we didn't know we needed.",

App 2: Product Hunt got 94 upvotes, 48 installs, 1 paid user. Same pattern, tire-kickers who never convert. App 3: Didn't bother with Product Hunt. Went straight to niche communities, app directories, and SEO. Got 180 installs first month, 28 paid users. 10x better results.​\n\n\n\nWhat actually worked for app 3: Posted in 8 specific subreddits where target users hang out, providing value first for 2 weeks, then mentioning app. Got 87 installs, 18 paid. Submitted to 15 app directories nobody talks about, smaller platforms but higher-intent users. Got 52 installs, 7 paid. Started app store SEO with careful keyword targeting in title/description. Got 41 organic installs, 3 paid.​\n\n\n\nWhy Product Hunt fails for apps: Users browse for entertainment, not solutions. They upvote cool concepts but rarely become paying customers. You're competing with 50+ other launches daily. Spike dies within 48 hours, zero long-term value. Better to spend launch energy on high-intent channels where people actively search for solutions.\n\n\n\nControversial take: Product Hunt is a vanity metric. Makes you feel good with upvotes but rarely drives sustainable growth. Only worth it if you already have audience to support the launch. For unknown founders, niche communities and app store SEO crush PH every time.\n\n\n\nFound this in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) studying 75+ app launches successful ones treated PH as optional, focused on App Store optimization and targeted communities. Failed ones bet everything on PH launch day magic that never came.​\n\n\n\nAm I wrong? Did Product Hunt actually drive real growth for your app?",

Here are my 2 cents: \n\nFirst of all you are in competition with  like hundreds of similar solutions and most of them have big marketing money. So you need to compete with that!\n\nI go on your page, I don't see any samples. If want to sell sites/apps at least create 10 samples people can click through to see what your tool can do.\n\nI started with the free version, I can only choose Deepseek. Fine. I did use free Deepseek directly with the same prompt and the result is really better.\n\nPricing is really confusing: Free is $0 / month??? Weekly is $5 one-time? others also -one-time? w00t? So is it a subscription? You biy a package? No idea.\n\nYou sell credits with the packages. Good move. BUT, you don't explain anywhere, what I get for a credit. If I buy 39 credits, can I create 39 websites with it? Or do you charge a credit for every change you do on the page? I created a landingpage and it did cost me a credit. I clicked on a link in my landing page, it doubled your page inside your page and I only got 6 credits left. Makes no sense. It's also missing in the FAQ.\n\nSo, enough bashing 😉\n\nFrom my opinion, what would make it better:\n\nMake the page more friendly and use some pictures in it. You sell websites, make it visual then!\n\nExplain how it works. With credits explained. What do you get for what.\n\nYour USP is your Visual Editor. You need to realy point that out! Also that you can upload existing HTML templates to edit them. This is really cool also.\n\nMake a video (or better several) to show how your solution works and what you get as a user\n\nI would remove the free version, as you see people only use it to create or try some stuff. Not satisfied, no buy. Make a real trial version with all features available, all AI Models and full version of visual editor. If the result is cool, then you have a better chance for a buyer. \n\nAlso, you said you can download the HTML and I guess it is without the visual editor in it. So why not ad a hosting package to your soution. Peeps can host it right away.\n\nHope that helps!",

Actually I thought of removing but my competitors are giving free version so had to put. I am glad that you loved the product with Deepseek but believe me it gives far better results with Claude Sonnet 4.5 but sadly had to move that to paid tier. The API cost was huge. \n\nAnd I am from India where stripe is not available. So to test if the payment gateway is integrated properly I had to go with one time payment Paypal. \n\nAbout the picture the website, application it builds are contained with pictures. I am using unsplash API for that.  The generated site should provide a picture. Let me check if there is any bug related to that. \n\nThanks a lot for the feedback will update you after pushing the changes.",

That's 2.8% of users paying anything. 97.2% freeload forever. App Store economics are completely broken for indie developers.\n\nThe math that kills apps is 12,000 downloads, 2,100 monthly active users (82.5% uninstall or ghost), 340 paying users (16% convert to any payment), average $1/month per paying user from mix of $3/month subscriptions and one-time $5 purchases. Six months of work generating $340 monthly is $0.56 per hour invested.​\n\nWhy App Store monetization fails, users expect free, won't pay for productivity apps they can replace with free alternatives, subscriptions feel predatory in crowded category, one-time purchases don't create recurring revenue. You're competing with venture-backed apps that are free forever trying to reach 100M users before monetizing.\n\nWhat actually works picked the wrong category (productivity is bloodbath), should've built for niche B2B use case at $10-30/month, focused on 100 paying customers not 10,000 free users. My friend's contractor management app has 400 downloads, 80 paying at $15/month = $1,200 monthly. Lower downloads, 10x revenue.​\n\nThe App Store dream is dead for indie devs in consumer categories. You need niche B2B or accept poverty. Found this studying app economics in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) successful indie apps charged $10-50/month for professional use cases, failed apps tried consumer freemium competing with VC-backed companies.\n\nHow many downloads vs actual revenue?

I would work on the colors and trying to use some different UI components if you can to make it feel more unique.\n\n2. A hard paywall for a fitness tracker is a tough sell. Freemium is better in the market.\n\n3. What features do you have that people would pay for? What would make someone use the app over Hevy, Strong, or other free options that are already very established? You need to innovate to capture market share",

      "text": "Spent years building products hoping the right users would show up. They didn't.\n\nNow I find the audience before I write a single line of code. Takes less than an hour and it's completely free.\n\n**The Google Drill Method:**\n\nGoogle your problem. Scroll past the ads and top results. Look for the dropdown suggestions that appear when you click the search bar or scroll down the page.\n\nThese aren't random. Google shows these because people are actively searching for them right now.\n\nCopy one of those phrases. Search it. Scroll again. New dropdowns appear.\n\nKeep drilling. Each click takes you deeper into what people are actually looking for - not what you think they need.\n\n**Here's what this looks like in practice:**\n\n**Starting search:** \"app analytics tool\"\n\n**First dropdown layer:**\n\n* \"app analytics tool for startups\"\n* \"app analytics tool free\"\n* \"app analytics tool comparison\"\n\nPick one. Let's go with \"app analytics tool for startups.\"\n\n**Second dropdown layer:**\n\n* \"best app analytics for early stage startups\"\n* \"startup app analytics under $50\"\n* \"app analytics that integrates with Stripe\"\n\nNow you're getting specific. Pick \"app analytics that integrates with Stripe.\"\n\n**Third layer:**\n\n* \"Stripe analytics for SaaS revenue\"\n* \"track Stripe payments by feature\"\n* \"Stripe MRR dashboard\"\n\n**You just found your niche in 3 minutes.**\n\nPeople are actively searching \"Stripe MRR dashboard\" - that's not a hypothetical need. That's active demand you can target today.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n**Google's algorithm optimizes for real behavior.** Dropdowns = searches happening right now. Not guesses. Not trends from 2 years ago. Live demand.\n\n**You skip the \"build and hope\" phase.** If nobody's searching for it, that's a signal before you waste months building.\n\n**You find exact language your audience uses.** When you write your landing page or ads, use these exact phrases. They're already proven to get clicks.\n\n**What to do with this data:**\n\nOnce you've drilled down 3-4 layers, you have:\n\n* Your exact audience (early stage startups tracking Stripe revenue)\n* Their specific pain (need MRR dashboard)\n* The words they use to search for solutions\n\nNow you can:\n\n1. Build a landing page using that exact phrase as your headline\n2. Create content targeting those search terms\n3. Run targeted ads on Reddit/Twitter/Google to that specific query\n4. Join communities where people with that problem hang out\n\nYou're not guessing anymore. You're building for people who are already looking.\n\n**Also:** This method works for competitive research too.\n\nSearch your competitor's name. Look at the \"People also ask\" and \"Related searches\" sections. You'll see what problems their users still have that they're not solving.\n\nThat's your gap. Build there.\n\n**--------**\n\nWhat methods do you use to find your audience before building? Always looking for new approaches.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/user/Silent_Payment5495/)\n\n  \n  \nThis may help you guys: [Silent\\_Payment5495](https://www.reddit.com/user/Silent_Payment5495/) & [Richie\\_Dev](https://www.reddit.com/user/richie_dev/)[](https://www.reddit.com/?feed=home)",

Ok, very interesting app, the onboarding survey is long but I guess it’s necessary to make your profile. \n\nI found the UI/UX design stunning, like obviously this app is not made by just a developer, you got a real and great vision of your product and i really like it! \n\nThe only tiny downside is that when I arrive on the Home page, the elements keep loading and nothing happens.\n\nI hope I can see how this app evolves.

UX/UI design  \nBad UX kills apps faster than bugs.  \nWireframes and user flows save months of rework later.\n\n  \n3. Development  \nFrontend + backend + APIs + logic.  \nThis is where traditional dev gets hard fast.\n\n  \n4. Testing  \nDifferent devices, screen sizes, OS versions.  \nA buggy launch = bad reviews = dead app.\n\n  \n5. Launch & maintenance  \nThe part nobody plans for.  \nOS updates, bug fixes, feature requests - it never really \"ends\".\n\n  \nThis is why a lot of founders use AI app builders like Base44 to remove the heaviest technical lift and focus on product, UX, and users instead.\n\n  \nYou don’t need to be a senior engineer - but you do need a plan.  \nWhat stage do you think most first-time founders underestimate?",

Still, I’m wondering:\n\nDo you personally use AI detectors today?\n\nIf yes, in what context (school, work, content moderation, SEO, etc.)?\n\nIf not, why not?\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is a solved problem, a declining market, or something that still has room if done differently.\n\nWould love to hear honest opinions, even if the answer is “don’t build this”.",

The market exists because institutions are desperately trying to enforce pre-AI assessment models, but the tools don't work and never will work reliably because they're based on probability patterns, not actual detection.",

A lot of the basic free checkers are kind of unreliable, and there are real issues with false positives, especially for non-native English speakers. It's more of a tool to start a conversation now, not a final verdict. I use detectors for work (SEO and content) and just for personal curiosity online. I've tried a bunch, and honestly, the results can be all over the place between different tools. For me, the key is finding one that's straightforward and gives you a clear breakdown, not just a scary percentage.\n\nI've been using wasitaigenerated lately because it handles more than just text, you can check images and video clips too, which is huge with deepfakes going around. The results come back fast and the confidence score they give has lined up pretty well when I've tested it against stuff I know I wrote. So, it’s not a solved problem. If you build something that’s transparent, handles different types of media, and is presented as a helpful signal rather than a punishment tool, there's absolutely room for it. The focus should be on giving people useful information to make their own call.\n\nWhat kind of different approach are you thinking about?",
