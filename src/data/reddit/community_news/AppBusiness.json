I started with Discovery campaigns to see what people were actually searching for. I’ve learned to avoid highly competitive keywords like 'dream journal' because the CPT (Cost Per Tap) is too high and doesn't guarantee a subscription. I lost quite a bit of money bidding on those high-competition terms early on; now, I’m focusing on lower-competition, more specific keywords where the intent is better, I've also started using tools like AppFigures to research keyword volume, competition, and ranking trends to find those “hidden keywords ” that are cheaper to bid on",

I can imagine some pretty cool ads marketing for a dream journal. \n\nI don’t know how this works, but you know how sometimes you are talking about a brand or a product, and next thing you know instagram or tik tok is advertising that product to you?? What if there was a way so that your ad could target people who were recently talking about a dream they had last night. Then you could really target those people day of and prompt them to download your app while dreams are fresh on their mind.\n\nNo idea if that’s possible but it’s an interesting thought.",

If you work with paid ads, especially on a decent budget, web2app funnels are worth testing early. They convert better once you understand your audience because you can educate, qualify, and price before the install, not after. Reddit and Product Hunt are fine for feedback, but rarely drive real growth. ASO helps, but it won’t fix a weak funnel. The biggest mistake I see is scaling traffic before retention and onboarding make sense. Web funnels helped connect those dots and made paid traffic way more predictable.",

You can have them just return true.. later you go back in and build out the modules. But I start my entry point as I intend to go on. A pretty minimal bootstrapper that calls all the important parts.\n\n\nAs for that alpha 1 - load up your key modules, add a debug console in your app, and do some basic stuff - just test they fire up (dependency test).",

After the switch, DAU dropped, but installs → pro subscriptions jumped noticeably. Overall intent feels much stronger.\n\nI attached a screenshot showing app units vs in-app purchases over the last month for context.\n\nA few things I changed at the same time:  \n– Improved the paywall UI and overall flow  \n– Tightened onboarding so value is clearer before asking for payment  \n– Removed the “forever free” path\n\nStill early and I’m continuing to watch retention and trial conversion, but the data speaks for itself.\n\nCurious how others here think about hard paywalls vs soft paywalls, especially for consumer apps.\n\nApp link for context: [https://push-pull.app/](https://push-pull.app/)\n\n",

I’m building a science-based fitness app (HIT / time-under-tension focused, very different use case), and I’ve been experimenting a lot with paywalls over the last few weeks.\n\nOn Android, the app has been live for a few weeks now:  \n• 1,000+ downloads  \n• 200+ registered users\n\nEarly on, I had a more restrictive setup and saw almost no meaningful usage. Once I switched to a 14-day free trial and reduced friction, actual feature usage finally started. Now I’m slowly tightening things again to understand where intent vs curiosity really sits.\n\nMy iOS app only went live a few days ago, so numbers are still small, but this whole “soft vs hard paywall” question is something I’m actively testing right now. What you’re describing about stronger intent after removing the forever-free path resonates a lot.\n\nHappy to exchange notes as more data comes in. I’m sharing updates pretty openly on Reddit as I go.\n\nApp for context (download page):  \n[https://app.hittrk.com/download](https://app.hittrk.com/download)",

You prevented those users from using anything without paying, so of course some percentage of them are going to pay since they're finding value in the features they use because they keep coming back. The others will leave.\n\nThe free tier is made up of people who would pay if they need to, and users who aren't getting enough value to ever pay. You forced a choice on them, they split into those two camps and acted accordingly.\n\nFree tiers are only ever useful, I think, for \"less volume\" and not really for \"less features\". Added features in the Pro tier aren't what converts people. If they wanted those features, they'd already be paying. The people who stay on free tier are, by definition, people who are getting along fine without the Pro features. They're never going to \"convert eventually.\"\n\nWhat you want is a free tier that's a good solid usable demo of the full product. When people like the product, and want more, that's what induces them to start paying. The paid tier removes friction, removes advertisements, allows easier imports/exports, eliminates manual steps, integrates more cleanly with other apps, removes caps on data storage, lets the user see more posts per day or make more posts per day...\n\nPro tiers work best for \"remove the stops, let the app go full speed\" vs \"get more optional features many users may never need or be willing to pay for.\"\n\nThere are many exceptions to that of course, for professional tools (e.g. an image editor that adds advanced tools)... but for consumer apps, it's rare for feature segmentation into tiers to be genuinely useful. Consumers aren't like professional users, they aren't generally willing (as a class) to pay for advanced features \"only a few people actually need\". Pros will pay for those features because efficiency turns around into money in their pocket. For consumer users, paying for more features is just pure cost.",

No budget for paid ads. So instead you’re posting reels. \n\nESPECIALLY now everyone is a lead.

That’s two FREE leads every single day. Have a conversation not just hard pitch. \n\nHeck even offer to hop on a call with them. \n\nIt’s for a $10/m app. LTV is $50. Close 5 of those per week that’s $500/WEEK in new customers. $2,000/month EACH MONTH. \n\nMeaning in 12 months we’re talking $24k/m assuming your reels don’t get better. \n\nDon’t tell me it’s not working. \n\nDon’t tell me you’ve tried everything. \n\nDon’t tell me it’s not worth it. \n\nIt’s hard work.

Seen a lot of really good posts by people sharing real questions and concerns, and I think that’s what makes it useful. You’ll also find a lot of people sharing their product/services and asking for feedback. Tit for tat but definitely good stuff and good opportunities. Just be careful of the scammers.

It has a monthly subscription averaging $4.99 for \"rich\" countries (I localize and categorize my subscription fees based on the country's economy). I split it into 4 groups: $1.99 for lower-income countries, $2.99 for mid, $3.99 for high-mid, and $4.99 for countries like the US, UK, etc. The annual plan follows the same idea, ranging from $15.99 to $39.99.\n\n\n\nThe prices change occasionally since I’m constantly testing different price points.\n\n\n\nI haven't always been focused on this app since I have other projects, but what helped this app go from $0 to $100 is Apple Search Ads. What I noticed with Search Ads is that you can lose a lot of money at first, but once you learn how it works, you can turn those losses into earnings.\n\n\n\nNot counting my early mistakes (where I spent maybe $300+ learning the ropes), I’ve spent about $60 on ads since I figured it out. Apple Search Ads are like magic if set up correctly alongside a good product page. It can double your spend—for example, you spend $50 and earn $70+ back (not including Apple's commission, which is 15% in my case). I might try other advertisement channels like TikTok next. I have no experience in that area yet, so if you have tips or tricks for TikTok ads, please let me know! I will keep iterating until the end of the year, then I’ll post my achievements again.\n\n",

      "text": "Setting the stage before I start: I have 25+ years of online business behind me, marketing, SEO, ASO (not as long for that one, obviously 😉), a few successful exits, and many failures (including a startup with 130,000+ users).\n\nWhy make this post? Because I’ve seen many people going in circles when it comes to acquisition. Everyone is a lover of design/dev, but less so of marketing.\n\nI get it, but it can’t last.\n\nSo, I’m dropping 3 strategies here to get your first 100 app users, which I often recommend to entrepreneurs who are more \"tech\" than \"marketing.\"\n\n**1. UGC** \n\nWhether it's with AI or your tired builder’s face, it works. The important thing is to stay real, put 80% of your effort into your hook, and not say too much. It’s counter-intuitive, but it’s effective. Create a TikTok account, \"warm it up\" for 3-5 days (use it just like your ideal user would, 15-30 mins a day: watching/commenting/liking), and only post after that period. Focus heavily on benefits; people love a \"before/after.\"\n\n**2. ASO** \n\nWhere there's an App, there's ASO. I know that between Apple destroying \"Popularity\" data and adding even more ad slots lately, it’s complex. Complex... but not impossible. Just more \"professional\" than before. Yet, ASO is perfect for grabbing your first 100 users, as long as you don’t go after the giants. There’s no point in targeting high-volume keywords; what matters is that the keyword intent is \"NEED\" and that the Top 10 has weaknesses (low rating volume or poor ratings, inconsistent category, frequent movement). You can use AltisASO for free for this, then switch to paid later to beef up your strategy. Also, study the competition (Top 10) and rethink your icon and screenshots if necessary, or even your app title (even if I know it hurts the ego).\n\n**3. Reddit** \n\nWe're on it, I know, but there is a stratospheric number of subreddits. There are bound to be at least fifty where your ideal buyer, your future user, hangs out. Post without overdoing it, without spamming, simply by wanting to provide value. Stay as authentic and human as possible; everyone is sick of \"AI slop.\" Don’t promote your app (except where allowed), but talk about the real problems of your target audience.\n\nIn short, it’s really within your reach. Don’t think \"people don’t like my app\"; it’s often just a matter of cumulative actions and patience. Whether you like marketing or not, it’s really worth showing your baby (your app \\^\\^) to the users it can help.\n\nAvailable for questions if you have any, might as well help each other out to the end.",
