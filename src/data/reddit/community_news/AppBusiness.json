I started with Discovery campaigns to see what people were actually searching for. I’ve learned to avoid highly competitive keywords like 'dream journal' because the CPT (Cost Per Tap) is too high and doesn't guarantee a subscription. I lost quite a bit of money bidding on those high-competition terms early on; now, I’m focusing on lower-competition, more specific keywords where the intent is better, I've also started using tools like AppFigures to research keyword volume, competition, and ranking trends to find those “hidden keywords ” that are cheaper to bid on",

What if there was a way so that your ad could target people who were recently talking about a dream they had last night. Then you could really target those people day of and prompt them to download your app while dreams are fresh on their mind.\n\nNo idea if that’s possible but it’s an interesting thought.",

Looking at the ecomomic situation in Türkiye, this is quite an impressive result so far. \n\nHow many screens do you show in the onboarding? If you think that your onboarding is too long, are there any screens that are just \"nice-to-have\"? If so, start an A/B testing with a shorter onboarding flow, get rid of these screens and compare the results. ",

My main source is ASO with very precise search ads. Quite a few sales are from google which was surprise for me. 4) i wonder about that also. I feel like the first 3 days are essential. In your case i would like to see top performing tickers for the day or smth like that. Good luck",

      "text": "I’ve been involved in growth for a large women’s health app (period tracking, ovulation prediction, pregnancy guidance), and earlier this year we ran a focused authority-building push. Starting point:\n\n* \\~2.3M monthly organic visitors\n* \\~490k ranking keywords\n* DR \\~75\n\nAfter 2 months:\n\n* \\~2.77M monthly visitors (+16.8%)\n* 726k ranking keywords\n* 32 backlinks built\n* Significant increase in traffic value\n\nNow, 16% growth on a 2M+ base isn’t easy - especially in health. Because this is medical/fertility content, it falls under Google’s YMYL guidelines (high scrutiny, strict E-E-A-T expectations). Shortcuts would have backfired. We handle most growth in-house, but for this specific push we decided to bring in an [external SEO/link-building partner](http://submittodirectory.com/) to handle outreach at scale. The goal wasn’t volume - it was consistent, high-quality placements in a sensitive (YMYL) niche.\n\n# The competitive landscape\n\nWe were competing with platforms like:\n\n* Clue\n* Natural Cycles\n* Everyday Health\n\nHealth SERPs are extremely competitive and heavily trust-driven.\n\n# What actually moved rankings\n\n# Relevance over volume\n\nOnly 32 links in 2 months. But they were contextual and topically aligned with fertility, pregnancy, and data-backed health resources. Some placements included sites like:\n\n* GWI\n* Superprof\n\nNo mass guest posting. No spam directories.\n\n# Utility pages were the growth lever\n\nInstead of pushing general blog content, we focused on strengthening:\n\n* Pregnancy probability calculators\n* Ovulation prediction tools\n* “Am I pregnant?” resources\n\nUtility-based pages tend to attract citations naturally when structured well.\n\n# E-E-A-T alignment\n\nFor medical niches, we made sure:\n\n* Content was expert-reviewed\n* Authors were clearly attributed\n* Medical claims were conservative and sourced\n* Anchor strategy remained natural\n\nAggressive tactics would have hurt more than helped.\n\n# Ranking impact\n\nDuring the campaign, the app ranked top 3 for competitive queries like:\n\n* Early pregnancy symptoms\n* When to take pregnancy test\n* Track my period\n* Early signs of pregnancy\n\nOrganic traffic value also increased significantly during this window.\n\n# Biggest takeaway for app founders\n\nAt scale (1M+ traffic), growth rarely comes from “more content.” It comes from:\n\n* Authority stacking\n* Strengthening high-intent pages\n* Precision link acquisition\n* Protecting trust signals\n\nShort, focused campaigns can work - but only if the foundation is already strong. Curious for other app operators here: Is SEO still a major growth lever for you, or have paid channels taken over as your primary acquisition engine? Happy to share more specifics if helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2y1f6z4noig1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e381d88689d1b9b8a3a947ae49d89e173861b0\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been in the app development threads for a few weeks now and I’m convinced we suck at marketing, or at least we don’t have the motivation to apply ourselves to marketing the way we do to development.\n\nMy biggest goal coming here was to learn how to market and grow my app. I’ve launched on the App Store like many of you, but over the last few weeks my marketing has barely moved while my development is through the roof. I have an app I’m genuinely proud of but no confident path to grow the user base. Meanwhile I can confidently structure a database and design an onboarding flow all day long — but what’s the point if no one’s clicking through it?\n\nDeveloping is fun. I love hanging out with Claude Code late into the night. Haha I’ve replaced Call of Duty with vibe coding till 2am and I don’t miss it.\n\nSo my question: how do you take that same excitement you have for building and channel it into marketing? I’m convinced my inability to market is really just an unwillingness to apply myself to it the same way.\n\nFor anyone who’s overcome that hurdle, how did you do it? Where are you and your app now?\n\nI need some motivation.",

Solo dev, built something I'm proud of, \nspent months hiding in code because it felt productive.\n\nThe shift for me was treating marketing like a \ntechnical problem to solve, not a \"creative\" thing \nI'm bad at.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n1. I set a hard rule — no coding before 9:30am. \nFirst hour of the day is distribution only. \nPost something, comment on 5 threads, reply to \npeople. Non-negotiable. Like a cron job.\n\n2. I stopped thinking \"marketing\" and started thinking \n\"show the data.\" I'm not a copywriter. But I can \nshare numbers, results, patterns I see in my product. \nTurns out that's what people engage with most anyway.\n\n3. The uncomfortable truth: nobody cares about your \nproduct. They care about their problem. Every post \nshould start with THEIR pain, not your feature list. \nThis was the hardest mindset switch.\n\n4. I track marketing the same way I track code — \nweekly metrics, what moved, what didn't, iterate. \nOnce I put it in a spreadsheet it started feeling \nlike engineering and my brain clicked.\n\nThe motivation thing is real but it's a trap. \nYou don't need motivation, you need a system. \nI post every day not because I want to, but because \nit's in my daily routine between coffee and standup.\n\nYou already have the discipline — you code till 2am. \nJust redirect 1 hour of that energy to distribution. \nThe product is never the bottleneck.

I \"sucked at marketing\" and just kept building instead.\n\nWhat changed was realizing I didn't hate marketing, I hated what I thought marketing was. Posting, ads, social stuff. That all felt pointless to me\n\nThe reframe that helped was thinking in terms of distribution or growth systems instead. Treating growth more like engineering. Looking at funnels, data, where users drop off, testing small things and seeing what happens.\n\nOnce there's feedback, it gets interesting. Similar dopamine to vibecoding.",

If you think about it, the real competition comes when you're going to sponsor your product, whatever it may be, not in the creation phase. Absolutely everyone in this life will want to be sponsored in some way; it's basically a competition against everyone once you launch your product. Don't get discouraged and keep fighting. As long as you don't give up, you'll have a much better chance than someone who decides to quit.",

      "text": "After 13 years of coding, deploying my first own mobile app feels harder than building it\n\nFor more than a decade I’ve been building products for other people.  \n\nDifferent companies, different domains, different responsibilities.  \n\nShipping features, fixing bugs, leading parts of architecture - the usual developer life.\n\nBut I never actually shipped something that was fully mine.\n\nSo recently I decided to change that.\n\nThe idea came unexpectedly.  \n\nI validated competitors, designed the architecture, built the backend, admin panel, and the mobile app completely solo.\n\nRoughly 1.5 months of intense development.\n\nAnd then I reached the final step…  \n\npublishing to the app stores.\n\nI honestly thought this would be the easiest part.  \n\nUpload → click submit → done.\n\nInstead, it feels like a completely different game:\n\nYou need subscriptions.  \n\nSubscriptions require configuration and review.  \n\nReview requires FAQ pages, privacy policy, terms, screenshots, explanations.  \n\nEach step unlocks three more hidden steps.\n\nAt this point it genuinely feels like:\n\nBuilding the product was level 1.  \n\nDeployment is the final boss.\n\nSo I’m curious - especially from indie devs who already went through this:\n\nHow do you handle the launch process without losing your mind?  \n\nAny checklists, lessons learned, or “I wish I knew this earlier” advice?",

You can have them just return true.. later you go back in and build out the modules. But I start my entry point as I intend to go on. A pretty minimal bootstrapper that calls all the important parts.\n\n\nAs for that alpha 1 - load up your key modules, add a debug console in your app, and do some basic stuff - just test they fire up (dependency test).",

It has a monthly subscription averaging $4.99 for \"rich\" countries (I localize and categorize my subscription fees based on the country's economy). I split it into 4 groups: $1.99 for lower-income countries, $2.99 for mid, $3.99 for high-mid, and $4.99 for countries like the US, UK, etc. The annual plan follows the same idea, ranging from $15.99 to $39.99.\n\n\n\nThe prices change occasionally since I’m constantly testing different price points.\n\n\n\nI haven't always been focused on this app since I have other projects, but what helped this app go from $0 to $100 is Apple Search Ads. What I noticed with Search Ads is that you can lose a lot of money at first, but once you learn how it works, you can turn those losses into earnings.\n\n\n\nNot counting my early mistakes (where I spent maybe $300+ learning the ropes), I’ve spent about $60 on ads since I figured it out. Apple Search Ads are like magic if set up correctly alongside a good product page. It can double your spend—for example, you spend $50 and earn $70+ back (not including Apple's commission, which is 15% in my case). I might try other advertisement channels like TikTok next. I have no experience in that area yet, so if you have tips or tricks for TikTok ads, please let me know! I will keep iterating until the end of the year, then I’ll post my achievements again.\n\n",
