I understand that.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is that someone from Saudi Arabia started making calls through my app and literally asked the agent not to hang up, which kept the agent on the call longer. Of course, that drains my wallet, because the longer the AI stays on the call, the more I’m charged by the provider, Twilio.\n\nLuckily, I already implemented a time limit so users cannot exceed the call duration based on their balance. But this person kept creating new accounts just to make me lose money.\n\nTo that person, and I’m sure you saw my post yesterday, I genuinely hope you find a job and get a life.\n\n[Accounts created](https://preview.redd.it/v87gz8u3aybg1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee890b65d9e4a00cde3c4a2bfd5276bee27516ba)\n\n",

It will find that the same user is trying to create new profiles and ban the abuser on the 2 or 3 account depending on your limits. The library I suggested catches them even if they use VPN and etc. Note that we moved to their paid version as it provides more features. \n\n\\- Have very small usage limit for new accounts and increase it daily\n\n\\- Don't just block IP block their entire subnet /24.\n\n\\- For suspicias accounts require 2factor verification SMS, WhatsApp you already use Twillio.",

I do not have any reviews thought, but I'm planning on prompting users for reviews in-app. \n\nWhat I've seen that works for others though is to advertise the app as much as possible everywhere (reddit, facebook, linkedin, twitter, product hunt, etc)",

It really feels like the App Store algo is weighing social signals pretty heavily now. \n\nUS TikTok views specifically seem to correlate with ranking boosts in competitive categories.\nI kept it super simple. Just 12-second demo clips, literally just a swipe gesture leading to \"instant calm\".I used trending audio and hashtags like #appcalm. The biggest issue was that since I'm not in the US, the FYP wasn't pushing my stuff to Americans. I was stuck at like 12% US audience share no matter what I did.\n\nI ended up switching to a geo-verified setup (used tokportal for the US device provisioning) and my audience immediately jumped to 92% US. Impressions went up 4x without spending a dime on ads.\n\n\nAlso, weird finding: \"Free Trial\" on the landing page beat \"Download Now\" by 28%. We hit category rank #47 in the US within 10 days of the TikTok account taking off. Anyone else\nusing TikTok specifically for ASO?",

They’ll keep getting removed. Instead, show up in threads about language learning, self-study, flashcards, “how to learn Portuguese”, etc., and give genuinely useful answers. Only drop the link when someone explicitly asks for it.\n* The bottleneck is usually “value before install.” With language apps especially, people need to feel the result before they become an “app user.” A solid test is a web2app flow: short web quiz/onboarding (why PT, level, minutes/day) plus a quick preview of the outcome (your first deck or plan or sample cards), then payment on the web, then a deferred deep link into the App Store so the first open feels seamless and access is already active. You can set this up quickly with web2wave without building all the infrastructure yourself.\n* If you go TikTok, I wouldn’t run “app ads.” I’d run content ads around the pain: why vocab doesn’t stick, how spaced repetition works, etc. Then send people not straight to the store, but into that web2app flow where the promise is clear and the user is warmed up.\n\nGood luck. For a passion project you’ve already proven the hardest part: people will pay.",

You need both sides of the equation to match in location, because they wont drive a lot for this. So you need a location where maybe rich meets poor kind of neighborhood line, and target it aggressively. Maybe even pay waiters a higher bonus if they can find the clients themselves.\n\nI mean the problem of the payment is there. Clients dont know if the waiter is gonna run with the money, or wait around if they are paid afterwards. Same with the waiters, they dont know if the client is gonna come back and pay them. So its just a matter of forcing the matches.\n\nid say pay the waiters to make it happen, to find lines and offer their services, if not for then then for the next time. If that client uses the app he makes money, even if they didnt use him, like an affiliate plan, tho its tricky to have the new user download the app the way a stranger is telling them to do without a benefit for them, and even then its kind of sketchy to have a guy come up in the street and tell you to download an app a certain way.

It's entirely ad funded so free to the user. When you do the calculations you quickly realize that a million active users (so what, 8 million active downloads?) earns something like 15,000 a month. That kind of scale needs a million dollar marketing budget. The ROI is just not a business. But I knew this before I committed to the build.

Use our app and we will stand in line for you!”  Be friendly and entertaining — if it were me, I’d wear something crazy and colorful (purple top hat?) Have fun with it. If I could think of something that’s a play on the word “line” I’d use that but I can’t think of one :(. Wear a sandwich board with a LARGE QR code on it so people too shy to talk to you can just take photos. Also on the sandwich board — “send a text message saying LINES SUCK to 713-xxx-xxxx for a chance to win 5 free lineups!”  The key is to talk to people",

          "text": "\nTL;DR: Search Everything Optimization.\n\nI’ve just finished building a new app myself. I’m strong on building, weaker on marketing, and I’ve learned the same lesson you’re pointing at: a lot of “growth channels” sound good on paper but don’t move the needle in reality.\n\nWhat has worked for me so far is focusing almost obsessively on search optimization. Over the last ~2 weeks, this alone has brought in ~70 registered users with zero paid marketing. No ads, no promos. Just people actively looking for a solution and finding mine.\n\nWord of mouth absolutely compounds this once it starts, but search is what creates the initial surface area for that to happen.\n\nWhen I say search optimization, I don’t just mean classic SEO.\n\nWe’re now in a world of:\n\t•\tSearch engines (Google, Bing)\n\t•\tApp stores\n\t•\tAI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)\n\t•\tVoice assistants\n\t•\tAnswer engines and snippets\n\nSo I’ve been thinking of it less as “SEO” and more as search everything optimization:\n\t•\tMaking sure the app can be discovered wherever people ask questions\n\t•\tStructuring content so machines can understand and recommend it\n\t•\tAnswering very specific problems instead of broad keywords\n\t•\tReducing friction from “I have a problem” → “this is the solution”\n\nWhat surprised me most is how non-scalable this felt at first. Writing very targeted pages, FAQs, and explanations felt slow and boring compared to launching campaigns. But it compounds quietly, and unlike ads, it keeps working even when you stop actively pushing.\n\nThings I tried that felt promising but went nowhere:\n\t•\tGeneric social posting without a clear search or intent hook\n\t•\tBroad content without a defined problem it answered\n\t•\t“Growth hacks” before people could even find the product organically\n\nMy takeaway so far:\nIf people can’t find you at the moment they’re looking for help, nothing else really matters. Once they can, everything else suddenly works better.\n\nWould be curious to hear if others have seen similar results or if different channels kicked in only after search traction existed.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched my first ever app 3 days ago! It was purely organic and completely free (no paid plans yet). I'm mainly looking for feedback and data right now, and I’ve already hit **147 users**.\n\nBounce rate: 68%, returning users: 13\n\nI'm really happy with the number, but I honestly have no idea if that's considered \"good\" for a first launch? I'm also not sure if they are actively using it or just creating an account and leaving.\n\n**The Challenge:** My app is focused on **social accountability**. I realized that if a user joins but doesn't have friends on the app yet, they might leave. So, I think I'll add some \"single-player\" features so people can enjoy it alone while waiting to connect with others.\n\nI also created a Discord to help users find like-minded people, but no members yet\n\nNext steps: I'm going to start making content on social media and see what happens.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!",

Need a platform that handles opt-in properly and lets us send timely transactional messages plus occasional promotional ones.

Like what’s to stop the person from just not accepting the contract in the same way they don’t accept the venmo request. \n\nBut also as someone else said, the issue here is more social than financial. Like realistically in all of these scenarios the issue can be fixed if you’re willing to just be a dick and say “dude send me my money”. The problem is most people aren’t actually willing to do that, so they just settle and give up a few dollars. Similarly, I think people will run into a social issue where they feel weird asking to set up a contract of sorts and just settle for venmo because it’s socially easier. \n\nHowever, i mean all of that constructively because this is actually a great idea. If you can find a slick solution that allows people to bypass the social friction of asking for money this could be really neat. I’d personally be the first user because i run into this issue all the time.",

      "text": "# Hey everyone,\n\nA while back, I did a post like this and ended up breaking down content ideas and growth angles for a lot of people in the comments. It turned into real strategy discussions, so I’m doing it again, a bit more intentionally.\n\n**The deal:**  \nDrop **what you’re building** below:  \na mobile app, product, service, startup, or even just a niche   \nand I’ll reply with a **specific TikTok / Instagram Reels video idea** that could realistically work for you.\n\nThat can include:\n\n* a concrete video format\n* a hook + angle\n* the type of content that fits a **multi-account / organic scaling approach**\n\nSomething you could actually execute.\n\n**Why I’m doing this (and how I approach it):**  \nI run [socialscalehub](http://socialscalehub.com) built around **multi-account systems and organic distribution**. The tool itself is only one part of the equation, the real work happens in the strategy behind the content.\n\nI’ve spent **thousands of hours consulting with clients** just to make sure their content actually works inside these systems. That means:\n\n* figuring out what kind of videos can be repeated across accounts\n* what *looks* scalable but actually isn’t\n* and how to adapt content so it doesn’t die after 3 posts\n\nBecause of that, I’ve had to develop a very sharp filter for what works, what doesn’t, and what people *think* will work but usually fails in execution.\n\n**Why this matters (especially if you’re technical):**  \nSomething I’ve noticed again and again:  \nMost people are either confused by the strategy, or they’re great at building products but unsure how to actually **execute distribution properly**, especially with organic, multi-account setups.\n\nEven a solid product can struggle if the content angle isn’t right.\n\nThat’s why I’m happy to help you think through:\n\n* what kind of content could fit *your* product or service\n* how you might approach organic scaling\n* and how to be better prepared, whether you use my system, your own setup, or something else entirely\n\nNo pressure, no selling in the comments.  \nIf later you want to scale seriously, we can do it together. If not, you still walk away with a clearer strategy.\n\nSo yeah —  \ntell me what you’re working on, who it’s for, or where you feel stuck,  \nand I’ll help you think through a content angle that actually makes sense.\n\nWin-win ",

I've always wanted to build something and somebody writes about it, like those early Web 2.0 days in Techcrunch. It's like a rite of passage for me, and I finally did it. But I'm finding marketing an app is hard without spending substantial marketing dollars. But I think it just takes time before those overlord platforms feed me some rewards, unless of course I spend money which I can't afford, or make some content slop and publish on social media...",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a development/business decision I made recently regarding my AI image processing app [Rendrflow ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saif.example.imageupscaler)) and how it impacts unit economics.\n\nThe Problem with AI APIs:\n\nWhen validating ideas for AI apps (specifically Image Upscaling / Super Resolution), the standard route is to wrap an API (like Replicate or OpenAI).\n\nPros:\n- Easy to build.\n\nCons:\n- High marginal costs. Every user action costs money.\n- If a free user goes viral, you go bankrupt.\n\nThe Pivot to On-Device (Edge AI):\n\nI decided to engineer the app to run entirely locally using the device's NPU/GPU (via TFLite).\n\nBusiness Implications:\n\n1. Unit Economics:\nMy server cost per user is effectively $0. I don't pay for GPU compute; the user's phone does the work. This allows me to offer a Freemium model without worrying about burning cash on API fees.\n\n2. Privacy as a Marketing Hook (ASO):\nSince no images leave the device, I can market strictly to privacy-conscious users who don't want their photos on cloud servers.\n\n3. Retention:\nThe app works offline (Airplane mode), which is a significant differentiator from competitors who require a strong connection.\n\nThe Trade-off:\n\nIt was much harder to engineer. Handling OOM crashes on low-end Android devices is a nightmare, and the app size is larger due to bundled models.\n\nConclusion for Appreneurs:\n\nIf you are building an AI wrapper, consider whether you can move inference to the edge. It drastically improves margins and removes the middleman risk of API providers hiking prices.\n\nHappy to discuss the tech stack or the impact on retention metrics if anyone is interested.",

Since about 90% of mobile time is now spent in corporate apps rather than browsers, design has shifted from \"information hierarchy\" to \"glanceability.”\n\nWe’re seeing a massive rise in \"Billboarding\"—huge, high-contrast type and \"Glassmorphism\" layers—simply because content has to grab attention in a split second before a user swipes to the next video or post. It’s less about building a digital home and more about building a digital billboard that survives the algorithm.\n\nNote: This response was composed with the assistance of AI to synthesize 2026 digital trend data…as if you couldn’t tell. 😂",

I built [**Health Clarity**](https://healthclarity.dev) to solve a massive, high-urgency problem: **\"The Healthcare Surprise Bill.\"**\n\n**Validated Pain Points:**\n\n1. **The Patient's Fear:** They have a surgery coming up and are terrified of a \"surprise\" $5,000 bill. They don't understand their insurance and the hospital won't give them a straight answer.\n2. **The Student's Stress:** Thousands of people are studying for medical coding exams (CPC/CCS) right now. They are struggling to understand complex billing \"logic\" and need a simulator to practice.\n3. **The Professional's Burnout:** Medical billers are drowning in denied claims because of tiny coding errors. They need a \"second pair of eyes\" to audit their work.\n\n**The Solution:** I built an AI \"Financial Copilot\" that takes 100GB hospital price files and insurance rules and turns them into a simple, 3-second chat answer. It’s \"Google Maps for healthcare costs.\"\n\n**The Opportunity for You:** Healthcare is one of the most viral topics on TikTok (medical debt stories get millions of views). The \"hooks\" write themselves. I have the technical infrastructure and the AI logic ready to go—I just need the distribution engine to scale it.\n\nCheck out the live build: [**healthclarity.dev**](https://healthclarity.dev)\n\nIf you can turn \"medical debt anxiety\" into viral hooks, we can build a monopoly here. I'm also happy to discuss building your app idea, simultaneously. DM me!",

Install rate is increasing. I'm having more people install just through App Store Search & SEO.  \nOnce google starts recommending the app, then the installs become exponential. And it should be much easier to reach my ultimate goal of 500K+ users.\n\nI suspect end of this month, I should cross the 10K installs. Maybe even sooner?  \nWho knows.\n\nI'm finding though that once you approach a high install count, google takes longer to review. When I first started at 100+ installs, google just let the app through without even glancing at it.\n\nNow it takes them 3 days to approve a new build. It's expected though. The bigger your app is, the more impact it has on their own business. So I'm expecting longer review times. \n\nAnd once I reach 1B+ installs....mmm yes.\n\n**App link for anyone interested.**\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.aresdefencelabs.aresscan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.aresdefencelabs.aresscan)",

It's a collaboration you get consistent reach and user feedback while we handle the creative and strategy side.\n\nNo cost at all the reasons is we already produce hundreds of TikToks weekly and what we really need are real founders who can post them in return you get content that's customized for your app consistent posting without the burnouts and real reach that helps you find users and feedback faster\n\nYou could do it solo but this just save your time keep it consistent and gets you exposure with zero risk or learning curves.",

You can name the number of apps who were able to do so on your fingers: Spotify, Duolingo, Strava, maybe a couple others. Most mobile apps are losing tons of their margin on user acquisition to fill a leaky bucket.\n\nThat being said, for your products I'd say the resume reviewer niche is pretty competitive. There are a million of such products in the market so it's not clear how this one is differentiated. Prompt rewriting also doesn't seem like something anyone would pay for. You can tell any AI to rewrite your prompts for you for free.",

Short term for MVP this approach is okay, but long term you may want to think about an actual checkout flow.\n\nAs far as the admin panel, I assume you mean for yourself to modify users accounts? If so I would for sure go this route, it keeps errors down a minimum vs going in and changing database accounts directly. When I first started I used DB, but eventually I did switch to my own admin panel, it made the flow easy, especially if I was away from my pc I could just log in from my phone and make the changes. Although you can start out with DB directly as you build your admin panel.\n\nI would say whatever is stopping you from launching, don't let it, every new MVP will have pain points, you just need to make sure users are aware this is the first version and it will get better with time. As long as they find value and very little issues, they will continue to use it.",

I’ve used tools like Appfigures and Amplitude plus Pulse for Reddit to find threads where people complain about budgeting apps, then join those convos with real answers and invite them to try specific fixes.
