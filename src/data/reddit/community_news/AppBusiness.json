That will increase notification enabled users. If users getting real value from every single notifications, it would not feel spammy even if it’s 100 times per day.

You should make this a priority. \n* You mention that you have on average 100-150 downloads per day. This should be sufficient to do at least 2-3 A/B tests on the onboarding weekly. Obsess over it.

I started with Discovery campaigns to see what people were actually searching for. I’ve learned to avoid highly competitive keywords like 'dream journal' because the CPT (Cost Per Tap) is too high and doesn't guarantee a subscription. I lost quite a bit of money bidding on those high-competition terms early on; now, I’m focusing on lower-competition, more specific keywords where the intent is better, I've also started using tools like AppFigures to research keyword volume, competition, and ranking trends to find those “hidden keywords ” that are cheaper to bid on",

      "text": "I’ve been involved in growth for a large women’s health app (period tracking, ovulation prediction, pregnancy guidance), and earlier this year we ran a focused authority-building push. Starting point:\n\n* \\~2.3M monthly organic visitors\n* \\~490k ranking keywords\n* DR \\~75\n\nAfter 2 months:\n\n* \\~2.77M monthly visitors (+16.8%)\n* 726k ranking keywords\n* 32 backlinks built\n* Significant increase in traffic value\n\nNow, 16% growth on a 2M+ base isn’t easy - especially in health. Because this is medical/fertility content, it falls under Google’s YMYL guidelines (high scrutiny, strict E-E-A-T expectations). Shortcuts would have backfired. We handle most growth in-house, but for this specific push we decided to bring in an [external SEO/link-building partner](http://submittodirectory.com/) to handle outreach at scale. The goal wasn’t volume - it was consistent, high-quality placements in a sensitive (YMYL) niche.\n\n# The competitive landscape\n\nWe were competing with platforms like:\n\n* Clue\n* Natural Cycles\n* Everyday Health\n\nHealth SERPs are extremely competitive and heavily trust-driven.\n\n# What actually moved rankings\n\n# Relevance over volume\n\nOnly 32 links in 2 months. But they were contextual and topically aligned with fertility, pregnancy, and data-backed health resources. Some placements included sites like:\n\n* GWI\n* Superprof\n\nNo mass guest posting. No spam directories.\n\n# Utility pages were the growth lever\n\nInstead of pushing general blog content, we focused on strengthening:\n\n* Pregnancy probability calculators\n* Ovulation prediction tools\n* “Am I pregnant?” resources\n\nUtility-based pages tend to attract citations naturally when structured well.\n\n# E-E-A-T alignment\n\nFor medical niches, we made sure:\n\n* Content was expert-reviewed\n* Authors were clearly attributed\n* Medical claims were conservative and sourced\n* Anchor strategy remained natural\n\nAggressive tactics would have hurt more than helped.\n\n# Ranking impact\n\nDuring the campaign, the app ranked top 3 for competitive queries like:\n\n* Early pregnancy symptoms\n* When to take pregnancy test\n* Track my period\n* Early signs of pregnancy\n\nOrganic traffic value also increased significantly during this window.\n\n# Biggest takeaway for app founders\n\nAt scale (1M+ traffic), growth rarely comes from “more content.” It comes from:\n\n* Authority stacking\n* Strengthening high-intent pages\n* Precision link acquisition\n* Protecting trust signals\n\nShort, focused campaigns can work - but only if the foundation is already strong. Curious for other app operators here: Is SEO still a major growth lever for you, or have paid channels taken over as your primary acquisition engine? Happy to share more specifics if helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2y1f6z4noig1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e381d88689d1b9b8a3a947ae49d89e173861b0\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been in the app development threads for a few weeks now and I’m convinced we suck at marketing, or at least we don’t have the motivation to apply ourselves to marketing the way we do to development.\n\nMy biggest goal coming here was to learn how to market and grow my app. I’ve launched on the App Store like many of you, but over the last few weeks my marketing has barely moved while my development is through the roof. I have an app I’m genuinely proud of but no confident path to grow the user base. Meanwhile I can confidently structure a database and design an onboarding flow all day long — but what’s the point if no one’s clicking through it?\n\nDeveloping is fun. I love hanging out with Claude Code late into the night. Haha I’ve replaced Call of Duty with vibe coding till 2am and I don’t miss it.\n\nSo my question: how do you take that same excitement you have for building and channel it into marketing? I’m convinced my inability to market is really just an unwillingness to apply myself to it the same way.\n\nFor anyone who’s overcome that hurdle, how did you do it? Where are you and your app now?\n\nI need some motivation.",

Solo dev, built something I'm proud of, \nspent months hiding in code because it felt productive.\n\nThe shift for me was treating marketing like a \ntechnical problem to solve, not a \"creative\" thing \nI'm bad at.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n1. I set a hard rule — no coding before 9:30am. \nFirst hour of the day is distribution only. \nPost something, comment on 5 threads, reply to \npeople. Non-negotiable. Like a cron job.\n\n2. I stopped thinking \"marketing\" and started thinking \n\"show the data.\" I'm not a copywriter. But I can \nshare numbers, results, patterns I see in my product. \nTurns out that's what people engage with most anyway.\n\n3. The uncomfortable truth: nobody cares about your \nproduct. They care about their problem. Every post \nshould start with THEIR pain, not your feature list. \nThis was the hardest mindset switch.\n\n4. I track marketing the same way I track code — \nweekly metrics, what moved, what didn't, iterate. \nOnce I put it in a spreadsheet it started feeling \nlike engineering and my brain clicked.\n\nThe motivation thing is real but it's a trap. \nYou don't need motivation, you need a system. \nI post every day not because I want to, but because \nit's in my daily routine between coffee and standup.\n\nYou already have the discipline — you code till 2am. \nJust redirect 1 hour of that energy to distribution. \nThe product is never the bottleneck.

No budget for paid ads. So instead you’re posting reels. \n\nESPECIALLY now everyone is a lead. You’re broke and your app isn’t making $10k/m+ (just a reference number chill)\n\nHere’s the strategy:\n\nDm EVERY SINGLE FOLLOW AND COMMENT you get. \n\n“But I’m only getting 2 followers a day”. \n\nPerfect. That’s two FREE leads every single day. Have a conversation not just hard pitch. \n\nHeck even offer to hop on a call with them. \n\nIt’s for a $10/m app. LTV is $50. Close 5 of those per week that’s $500/WEEK in new customers. $2,000/month EACH MONTH. \n\nMeaning in 12 months we’re talking $24k/m assuming your reels don’t get better. \n\nDon’t tell me it’s not working. \n\nDon’t tell me you’ve tried everything. \n\nDon’t tell me it’s not worth it. \n\nIt’s hard work.

No big audience. No email list. No paid ads. Just me pressing “submit” and hoping at least a few people would care.\n\nI posted it on Product Hunt mostly to force myself to launch publicly. It’s not blowing up or anything. No crazy upvotes. No front page domination. Just a handful of people engaging and a few thoughtful comments.\n\nBut here’s the part that caught me off guard:\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the App Store charts… and right now it’s sitting at **#142 in its category in Germany**.\n\nThree hours in.\n\nI genuinely didn’t expect to see a ranking at all. I always assumed those charts were reserved for companies with marketing budgets and coordinated launches. Seeing my tiny, self-funded app show up there — even at #142 — feels surreal.\n\nWhat’s wild is realizing how small the early momentum actually is. It doesn’t take thousands of downloads to start moving the needle when you’re starting from zero. A bit of visibility, a few shares, some organic installs… and suddenly you’re “on the chart.”\n\nThe launch is still happening. I’m still refreshing everything way too often. I have no idea where it’ll end up by tonight — it might climb, it might disappear.\n\nBut right now, three hours after launching, something I built is ranking in the App Store. And that feels pretty incredible.\n\nIf you’re building something and waiting for the “perfect” moment — this is your sign to just ship it.\n\nHappy to answer questions while I sit here refreshing stats 😅",

It has a monthly subscription averaging $4.99 for \"rich\" countries (I localize and categorize my subscription fees based on the country's economy). I split it into 4 groups: $1.99 for lower-income countries, $2.99 for mid, $3.99 for high-mid, and $4.99 for countries like the US, UK, etc. The annual plan follows the same idea, ranging from $15.99 to $39.99.\n\n\n\nThe prices change occasionally since I’m constantly testing different price points.\n\n\n\nI haven't always been focused on this app since I have other projects, but what helped this app go from $0 to $100 is Apple Search Ads. What I noticed with Search Ads is that you can lose a lot of money at first, but once you learn how it works, you can turn those losses into earnings.\n\n\n\nNot counting my early mistakes (where I spent maybe $300+ learning the ropes), I’ve spent about $60 on ads since I figured it out. Apple Search Ads are like magic if set up correctly alongside a good product page. It can double your spend—for example, you spend $50 and earn $70+ back (not including Apple's commission, which is 15% in my case). I might try other advertisement channels like TikTok next. I have no experience in that area yet, so if you have tips or tricks for TikTok ads, please let me know! I will keep iterating until the end of the year, then I’ll post my achievements again.\n\n",

Clearly documenting your current tech stack (backend, frontend, hosting).\n2. Identifying whether the automation needs real-time processing or background jobs.\n3. Deciding if this is feature-level automation or core product logic.\n\nA lot of agencies will quote high without understanding your architecture. You might actually just need a senior backend engineer with AI integration experience rather than a full agency.",
