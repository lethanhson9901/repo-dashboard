      "text": "My first three apps were beautiful, polished, and completely useless. Six months of coding each, pixel-perfect UI, clever features I was proud of—zero paying users, zero revenue, zero traction. I never spoke to a single real user before building. I just trusted my \"product instincts\" and whatever seemed to be trending on Twitter and Product Hunt. Classic technical founder mistake repeated three times.\n\n\n\nThe turning point was studying real app founders who shared exactly how they got from 0 to 1,000 users with receipts: 20-30 customer interviews upfront before writing code, shipping ugly one-feature MVPs in 2-3 weeks not 6 months, multi-platform launches across 20+ directories not just App Store, and doing manual onboarding calls with the first 50 users to understand confusion points and actual needs.\n\n\n\nFor app #4, I forced myself to follow that exact pattern instead of jumping straight into code like always. Execution looked completely different: spoke with 32 people in my target niche (freelance marketers struggling with client reporting) about one specific pain point, killed two different ideas in week one before writing a single line of code because fewer than 10 people would commit to paying, finally validated a third idea where 14 people said they'd pay $19/month, then built just one core feature in 2.5 weeks using a React Native boilerplate instead of reinventing authentication and payments infrastructure for the fourth time.\n\n\n\nLaunch strategy was systematic not heroic: posted problem-first content in 5-6 relevant Reddit and Facebook communities before ever mentioning I had a solution, submitted to 20+ app directories and startup listing sites over 2 focused weeks, personally onboarded the first 40 users via 20-minute Zoom calls while furiously tweaking onboarding flow every few days based on where they got confused or dropped off.\n\n\n\nTimeline and numbers: month 1 had 19 paying users at $19/month ($361 MRR), month 3 reached $1.7K MRR after implementing annual pricing, month 8 hit $4.5K MRR with monthly churn under 4% because I'd built something people actually needed.\n\n\n\nThe app itself wasn't dramatically better than my failed ones. The difference was entirely the process: validate with real conversations, build the absolute smallest version that solves one problem, launch everywhere relevant systematically, and learn directly from the first paying users instead of guessing in isolation. All borrowed from founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) who were generous enough to share their exact playbooks, metrics, and timeline breakdowns publicly.",

I'm seeing 3-5x more organic installs than I ever got from just\nkeyword optimization. It really feels like the App Store algo is weighing social signals pretty heavily now. \n\nUS TikTok views specifically seem to correlate with ranking boosts in competitive categories.\nI kept it super simple. Just 12-second demo clips, literally just a swipe gesture leading to \"instant calm\".I used trending audio and hashtags like #appcalm. The biggest issue was that since I'm not in the US, the FYP wasn't pushing my stuff to Americans. I was stuck at like 12% US audience share no matter what I did.\n\nI ended up switching to a geo-verified setup (used tokportal for the US device provisioning) and my audience immediately jumped to 92% US. Impressions went up 4x without spending a dime on ads.\n\n\nAlso, weird finding: \"Free Trial\" on the landing page beat \"Download Now\" by 28%. We hit category rank #47 in the US within 10 days of the TikTok account taking off. Anyone else\nusing TikTok specifically for ASO?",

          "text": "\nTL;DR: Search Everything Optimization.\n\nI’ve just finished building a new app myself. I’m strong on building, weaker on marketing, and I’ve learned the same lesson you’re pointing at: a lot of “growth channels” sound good on paper but don’t move the needle in reality.\n\nWhat has worked for me so far is focusing almost obsessively on search optimization. Over the last ~2 weeks, this alone has brought in ~70 registered users with zero paid marketing. No ads, no promos. Just people actively looking for a solution and finding mine.\n\nWord of mouth absolutely compounds this once it starts, but search is what creates the initial surface area for that to happen.\n\nWhen I say search optimization, I don’t just mean classic SEO.\n\nWe’re now in a world of:\n\t•\tSearch engines (Google, Bing)\n\t•\tApp stores\n\t•\tAI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)\n\t•\tVoice assistants\n\t•\tAnswer engines and snippets\n\nSo I’ve been thinking of it less as “SEO” and more as search everything optimization:\n\t•\tMaking sure the app can be discovered wherever people ask questions\n\t•\tStructuring content so machines can understand and recommend it\n\t•\tAnswering very specific problems instead of broad keywords\n\t•\tReducing friction from “I have a problem” → “this is the solution”\n\nWhat surprised me most is how non-scalable this felt at first. Writing very targeted pages, FAQs, and explanations felt slow and boring compared to launching campaigns. But it compounds quietly, and unlike ads, it keeps working even when you stop actively pushing.\n\nThings I tried that felt promising but went nowhere:\n\t•\tGeneric social posting without a clear search or intent hook\n\t•\tBroad content without a defined problem it answered\n\t•\t“Growth hacks” before people could even find the product organically\n\nMy takeaway so far:\nIf people can’t find you at the moment they’re looking for help, nothing else really matters. Once they can, everything else suddenly works better.\n\nWould be curious to hear if others have seen similar results or if different channels kicked in only after search traction existed.",

That usually means tightening onboarding and in‑app loops until people come back on their own, then using focused channels like ASO, a couple of niche communities, and very targeted outreach instead of spraying content or ads everywhere.\n\nOnce you know who sticks and why, tools that give you ultra‑specific lead lists help a lot more than broad traffic - for example, if your app serves creators or small businesses active on Instagram, pulling verified emails from followers of niche accounts with IGScraping lets you talk directly to people already showing interest in your space instead of hoping they stumble across your app in a crowded store.",

A taxi app like Uber. They lean on SMS marketing which was already effective before apps came along (incredibly high open rates). However, they build their SMS list through traditional advertising. You can also then use push campaigns for win-back and re-engagement.\n\nWe also optimise ASO and experiment with paid ads continuously.

I'm mainly looking for feedback and data right now, and I’ve already hit **147 users**.\n\nBounce rate: 68%, returning users: 13\n\nI'm really happy with the number, but I honestly have no idea if that's considered \"good\" for a first launch? I'm also not sure if they are actively using it or just creating an account and leaving.\n\n**The Challenge:** My app is focused on **social accountability**. I realized that if a user joins but doesn't have friends on the app yet, they might leave. So, I think I'll add some \"single-player\" features so people can enjoy it alone while waiting to connect with others.\n\nI also created a Discord to help users find like-minded people, but no members yet\n\nNext steps: I'm going to start making content on social media and see what happens.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!",

      "text": "So my biggest problem was ads. I tried paying for influencers and paid for TikTok ads too, but the results were not great. It felt as if I was spending more on ads and was making a loss.\n\nSo I coded my own TikTok system with some research. This system that I coded is linked with a channel. On this channel I have 50 TikTok accounts which I bought. So now I create and upload a video to this channel and choose what account I want it posted to and schedule a time. I choose the peak times to maximise my reach.\n\nThat’s it. The system then logs in and posts for me. I have seen my sales increase massively because of this. Instead of 1 account you have 50, and all accounts have the link to my website in the bio.\n\nI am now planning to add more accounts and I am also planning to create a new system which will post on 50 YouTube accounts to maximise my reach.\n\nAlso it’s not spamming random videos it’s all entertaining videos that are related to my websites/apps. So if the website is selling football jerseys I post football edits and football related stuff.\n\nI ended up selling one system to a smma agency who had TikTok accounts to manage and was interested too.\n\nThe accounts that I use are either US or UK accounts.\n\nHopefully this can help you maybe build your own system to promote your apps",

          "text": "Main thing here: this kind of system works only if you treat it like a fragile asset, not a hack you can scale forever.\n\nI’ve run smaller TikTok “farms” (5–10 accounts), and the biggest unlock wasn’t just more accounts, it was treating each one like a semi-real creator: different niches, different hooks, different angles to the same offer. When all 50 look and act the same, bans and ghosting come fast. I’d A/B the funnel too: one clean landing page, one offer, then track which accounts/creatives actually drive installs or purchases, not just views.\n\nFor long term, I’d think: 1) build email/SMS off those clicks so losing accounts doesn’t nuke revenue, 2) test short organic UGC on TikTok + YouTube Shorts + maybe Instagram Reels using the same creative system, 3) use tools like CapCut and Notion for batching, and something like Pulse for Reddit alongside SparkToro to find niche subs and threads to validate hooks before rolling them out at scale.\n\nSo yeah, the automation is strong, but the moat is in creative testing and owning the audience, not just more accounts.",

It looks like you’re starting to get visibility, but the signup step is where things stall.\n\nFrom your Search Console screenshot: a **24% CTR is very strong**, so your titles/snippets are resonating. The bottleneck is **avg position \\~22.8**. You’re mostly sitting on page 3, so you won’t get many clicks or signups no matter how good the CTR is. What tends to actually move organic growth at this stage:\n\n1. **Stop “more content”, build one keyword cluster** Pick one topic where you can own 10–20 long-tail queries (how-to, templates, checklists, calculators), connect them with internal links, and build one solid pillar page. Your goal isn’t reach, it’s getting a few pages into the top 10 for narrow intent keywords.\n2. **Show value before signup** If people have to create an account just to understand what they’ll get, conversion usually stays low. Add a value preview on the landing page: an example output, a 30-second interactive demo, a template. Make signup the step for “save/export/personalize”, not “see what this is”.\n3. **Communities: comment-first, not post-first** On Reddit, the needle usually moves through helpful comments: quick audits, checklists, tactical answers tailored to the OP. Link rarely, only when it’s genuinely relevant.\n\nAlso, if your product is tied to a mobile subscription (or you’re planning an app), you can test a **web2app** entry: users get a personalized result on the web first (quiz/preview), then move into the app. You can build it yourself, or use **web2wave** to launch the web flow + payments + deferred deep links without getting stuck in integrations.",

          "text": "TL;DR:\nOrganic growth doesn’t come from “posting everywhere.” It comes from one repeatable acquisition loop you can measure. If you’re stuck at ~20 signups after 2 months, the issue is almost always distribution fit, not effort.\n\n⸻\n\nHard truth from having been here:\n\nPosting on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit = activity, not a growth strategy. Early organic growth usually comes from one of these three, not all of them:\n\n1) Search-driven intent (SEO / App Store search)\n\nThis is what finally moved the needle for me.\n\t•\tPeople already searching for the problem\n\t•\tLanding page or store listing answers that exact query\n\t•\tGrowth is slow at first, then compounds\n\nIf no one is searching for what your app solves, social content won’t save it.\n\n2) One niche community, deeply\n\nNot “Reddit in general.”\nOne subreddit, Discord, Slack, forum, etc where:\n\t•\tThe pain is obvious\n\t•\tYou answer questions without pushing the product\n\t•\tYour app becomes the obvious next step\n\nMost Reddit posts get removed because they lead with the product, not the problem.\n\n3) Manual, unscalable outreach (early on)\n\nUnsexy but effective:\n\t•\tDM 20–50 people who clearly have the problem\n\t•\tWatch where they drop off\n\t•\tFix that first\n\nIf you can’t convert humans 1-to-1, you won’t convert them at scale.\n\n⸻\n\nThe real diagnostic\n\nAsk yourself:\n\t•\tAre users coming back?\n\t•\tDo they finish the core action?\n\t•\tWould they care if the app disappeared?\n\nIf the answer is “meh,” growth tactics won’t matter yet.\n\n⸻\n\nTimeline reality\n\n2 months / 20 signups isn’t failure — it’s insufficient signal.\nWhat matters is:\n\t•\tAre signups increasing week over week?\n\t•\tIs retention improving after each iteration?\n\nFlat + no engagement = pivot\nSlow but improving = keep going\n\nOrganic growth isn’t magic. It’s distribution × relevance × patience.",

Short term for MVP this approach is okay, but long term you may want to think about an actual checkout flow.\n\nAs far as the admin panel, I assume you mean for yourself to modify users accounts? If so I would for sure go this route, it keeps errors down a minimum vs going in and changing database accounts directly. When I first started I used DB, but eventually I did switch to my own admin panel, it made the flow easy, especially if I was away from my pc I could just log in from my phone and make the changes. Although you can start out with DB directly as you build your admin panel.\n\nI would say whatever is stopping you from launching, don't let it, every new MVP will have pain points, you just need to make sure users are aware this is the first version and it will get better with time. As long as they find value and very little issues, they will continue to use it.",

Some get 10 likes, some get 4, but the reach never expands beyond that initial \"test group.\"\n\n**What I've tried so far:**\n\n1. **The \"Pain\" Angle:** Slides showing rejection emails and depressed job seekers (relatable content).\n2. **The \"Technical\" Angle:** Explaining how ATS bots parse resumes and why fancy designs fail.\n3. **The \"Visual Shock\" Angle:** Ugly resumes vs. Pretty resumes.\n\nI see other B2C apps getting thousands of views with seemingly simple slides.\n\n**My questions for those who have cracked it:**\n\n1. Is \"Photo Mode\" enough, or is video mandatory for SaaS growth now?\n2. Does the \"fresh account\" theory matter? (Should I warm up the account more?)\n3. For those targeting the US market from abroad (I'm posting from outside the US but targeting US audience), could location be the bottleneck?\n\nAny feedback or harsh truths are welcome. Thanks!",

Pick 1–2 channels max:\n\t•\tSearch (SEO / App Store / Play Store search)\n\t•\tA niche community where people already complain about the problem\n\nIf you can’t drive any targeted traffic in 30 days, that’s already a signal.\n\n2) Define pass/fail metrics before you start\nExamples:\n\t•\t% of visitors who sign up\n\t•\tDay-1 / Day-7 retention\n\t•\t“Would you be annoyed if this disappeared?” feedback\n\nIf users don’t return or don’t care, more marketing won’t fix it.\n\n3) Don’t confuse slow growth with no signal\nSlow but improving = keep going\nFlat + zero engagement = stop or pivot\n\n4) Build your next app in parallel, not instead\nMost first apps fail. The real skill is shipping fast and validating fast.\n\nRule of thumb:\nIf users pull you forward, double down.\nIf you’re pushing uphill with no traction, move on.\n\nThe biggest waste isn’t quitting early — it’s spending months without real signals.",

      "text": "One thing I’ve noticed across multiple app launches is that many teams obsess over acquisition metrics early on, while retention problems quietly build underneath.\n\nDownloads spike. Activation looks decent. Then week-4 retention falls off a cliff.\n\nThe root cause is often not marketing or ASO. It’s early product decisions that don’t age well.\n\nA few recurring patterns:\n\n**1. Performance debt shows up before feature debt**  \nEarly users tolerate missing features. They don’t tolerate:\n\n* Slow startup\n* UI lag\n* Crashes on mid-range devices Once these issues appear, retention drops faster than most teams expect.\n\n**2. AI features increase expectations immediately**  \nAdding AI to an app changes user behavior:\n\n* Users expect instant responses\n* Errors feel “smarter” and therefore more frustrating\n* Edge cases multiply fast If latency, fallback logic, and cost controls aren’t thought through, AI becomes a retention liability.\n\n**3. “We’ll refactor later” rarely happens**  \nMany apps ship fast with the plan to clean things up post-launch. In reality:\n\n* New features keep coming\n* Metrics pressure increases\n* Refactors get postponed The app becomes harder to change right when iteration speed matters most.\n\n**4. App store ratings lag the real problem**  \nBy the time ratings drop, retention damage is already done.  \nThe early signals usually show up in:\n\n* Session length\n* Background crash logs\n* Abandoned onboarding steps\n\nThe takeaway isn’t to over-engineer an MVP. It’s to be intentional about the few decisions that are painful to reverse later, especially around performance, data flow, and release discipline.\n\nFor those who’ve shipped and scaled apps:  \nWhat decision do you wish you had taken more seriously before launch?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a dad of two young kids (3.5 and 4.5 years old). Ever since they started daycare, it feels like someone in our house is **always** sick. Just when one recovers, the next cough or fever shows up.\n\nA lot of evenings end with me sitting next to a sleeping child, watching them breathe and wondering:  \n*Is this still normal? Should we wait it out, or call the doctor tomorrow?*\n\nGoogling at 2 a.m. usually doesn’t help — it either makes you anxious or gives you ten different answers. That frustration is what pushed me to build a small app for myself called **MalaDoc**:  \n👉 [https://maladoc.techtime-apps.com/](https://maladoc.techtime-apps.com/)\n\nThe app is **fully usable and in a solid state**, but I keep updating it and adding new features over time. It’s meant to help put symptoms into context — for kids, adults, and even pets. I actually use it myself for the whole family, including our dog.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t replace a doctor or a vet. But it helps me stay calmer and make more informed decisions instead of panic-googling in the middle of the night.\n\nI’d really appreciate honest feedback:\n\n* Would something like this be useful to you?\n* What’s missing?\n* Anything confusing or unnecessary?\n\nThanks for reading — and to all parents here: hang in there",

A couple quick thoughts: A simple “monitor at home vs. call the doctor” summary at the end would be really helpful. Adding a bit of context like “this is common in daycare kids” could reduce anxiety a lot. Keeping the language very plain (no medical jargon) feels key for tired parents. Overall, it comes across as genuinely empathetic and practical.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been talking with a lot of indie devs and bootstrapped founders lately, mostly in DMs here on Reddit, and I noticed a pattern that I didn’t expect. \n\nAlmost everyone I spoke to had:\n\n1. a finished product\n\n2. a live landing page\n\n3. no paying users (sometimes a few free signups)\n\nWhen I asked about Marketing, most said they weren’t really doing any — maybe a few Reddit posts, a couple of tweets, or “planning to start soon”.\n\nI asked them if they would like to start getting views today with AI Video Organic Marketing (Shorts, Reels, BrainRot), because that is what my app is doing (Landing Page -> Auto-Posted AI Videos.)\n\nTheir answers kinda surprised me. A lot of them said some version of:\n\n“AI content doesn’t fit my brand”, “AI videos aren’t good enough yet”, “I want real creators / influencers / UGC later”, “I don’t want to hurt the brand with imperfect content”\n\nWhich left me wondering:\n\nIf nobody knows your product exists yet… is no exposure really safer than imperfect exposure?\n\nFrom the conversations, it felt like many founders are just before marketing — not because they don’t know it matters, but because starting means shipping something that isn’t \"perfect\".\n\nI get the concern. AI content isn’t perfect. But neither is silence.\n\nFrom my own experience, even rough, value-first AI content — clearly not “brand polished” — produced more sign ups than months of doing nothing:\n\nNot viral growth. Just something instead of zero.\n\nSo I’m genuinely curious how others here see it:\n\n1. Do you think AI video marketing is worse than waiting until everything is “brand-ready”?\n\n2. Have you avoided AI content because of quality or perception concerns?\n\n3. At what stage does “protecting the brand” turn into avoiding distribution?\n\nNot trying to sell anyone — just trying to understand how other founders think about this.",

Which if they get any views organically its just riding on the \"Oh sh-t, that's ai\" rather than because of the product it talks about. \n\nI focused on AI Formats that people watch because of the contents rather then just because it is AI. \n\nLike do you know Full Stack Peter on IG? He does pretty well with the Format. SO right now it is only brain rot style. Example:  Rick and Morty talking about SEO strategies, and then dropping your site btw this exists. \n\nBut, I will be shipping AI UGC Avatar Pipeline and VEO/SORA for the ads you are talking about, because i got a lot of request for that. I personally believe the brain rot does better then the \"trying to hide its ai\" styles.",

If you’re pre-revenue or still validating your product, even “rough around the edges” AI videos can teach you what messages actually resonate.\n\nSilence gives you no feedback loop. Bad or average AI marketing still gives you *data*. You’ll know what people click, skip, or comment on, and that’s what shapes your real strategy later.\n\nSo yeah, I’d say imperfect AI marketing > no marketing.

I was performance marketer so I guess I am bias. \n\nBut I saw companies die while protecting their brand. \n\n1. 50% of apps and startups never see the light of the day waiting for the perfect storm for promoting without violating their brand they have in their head.\n\n2. I worked for B2B SaaS that had 100+ employees and they had 5 people in marketing. 4 were brand people, I was the only performance. So I was in charge actually bringing people in through ads. And like 80% of my ideas were shutdown because they were protecting the brand. \nFor example, they had money for real actors and actually creating video series to explain the product. But they were so conservative that they didn’t want to attach a face to their company, what if people start associating the face with the company and the a actor will have too much leverage. And it was like what are you even talking about ? You have 0.001% of the market that saw you somewhere maybe will be able to recall the name. You are not growing, actually ended up letting some people off, and are afraid of face having too much leverage. \n\nLike this doesn’t make any sense to me, but if most founders are like that, maybe I am the crazy one and should pivot to focus more on polished brand videos rather than reach and performance.",

The idea is to expose knowledge gaps early instead of discovering them too late.\n\nFrom a product/business perspective, I’m curious:\n\n* Do you see this as a real problem worth solving?\n* Is active testing a strong enough core value proposition on its own?\n* What would make a tool like this genuinely useful rather than “just another study app”?\n\nI’m not linking anything to avoid self-promotion, genuinely looking for feedback on the approach, not traffic.",
