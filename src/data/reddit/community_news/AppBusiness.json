I ask because I built something similar, but in the space for Veteran's mental health (as a combat veteran myself), and trying out having plain convos with ChatGPT and Claude, it can already act as a \"therapist\", an it can analyze a conversation as well, I tried with my own personal relationship issues, and it was pretty decent already. I tried it for veteran related help and it was pretty good, so I just adjusted for the specifics and nuances related to veterans and military personnel, and it's coming out nicely. Currently shopping for APIs centered around human behavior, psychology, therapy, etc that takes something like a broad AI like ChatGPT and Claude, and hones down to a specialty. Anyway, great work 💯",

I’ve checked apples guidelines 4.8 around login, and their verbiage is slightly unclear - hoping you and/or OP could clarify. \n\n“I only had Google and Apple login”\n\nAre you saying if I show 2 buttons, 1 apple and 1 Google auth, that this is not enough? \n\nPer Apple 4.8\n“Apps that use a third-party or social login service (such as Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Sign in with Twitter, Sign In with LinkedIn, Login with Amazon, or WeChat Login) to set up or authenticate the user’s primary account with the app must also offer as an equivalent option another login service with the following features”\n\nWhich notice, they do not list Apple as a social login service. So one could conclude, having Google (in the list) and also Apple federated auth (not in the list), would count as “an equivalent option” and thus suffice?\n\nI’ve seen mixed posts here, on SO, and in conversing with AI. Who’s got the goods? Give it up please!🙏",

The real signal comes in the next couple of days when App Store analytics fully update, especially impressions → product page views → conversion rate. That funnel will tell you if this is sustainable or just a launch spike.\n\nFrom my experience, the biggest driver long-term is maintaining revenue momentum. Apple tends to keep giving visibility to apps that consistently generate revenue. So the key isn’t just getting traffic, it’s making sure your conversion rate is strong enough to keep turning future impressions into paying users.",

Yesterday I had 121 people I think, today I have 139 and it seems like the new people are a mixed bag of people I reached out and \"strangers\"\n\nEdit: finished typing this out and now I'm at 141, it's still exciting for me to see it grow at this pace hahaha",

      "text": "Most people see a $250K MRR number and assume the founder got lucky, had an audience, or raised money. After going deep on 53 successful indie app businesses from $1K MRR to $250K MRR, the pattern is almost never luck.\n\nHere's what the top performers consistently share:\n\nThey monetize a workflow, not a feature. ChatBase ($250K MRR) doesn't sell \"a chatbot.\" It sells \"custom ChatGPT for your website\" a complete workflow outcome. CyberLeads ($50K MRR) doesn't sell \"a database.\" It sells \"find clients who just raised millions.\" Positioning is always about the outcome, never the technology.\n\nThey pick a monetization model that matches usage frequency. PDF.ai does $30K MRR on subscription because people interact with PDFs regularly. Senja does $26K MRR because testimonial collection is ongoing. Founders who struggle with LTDs usually have high-frequency use cases they're giving away recurring value for a one-time fee.\n\nIf you want to see the full breakdown of all 53 businesses with their MRR, monetization models, and what category they compete in, it's [inside toolkit](http://unicornmaking.com). Useful for spotting gaps before you build.\n\nThe ones who stall share one trait: they built for a nice-to-have instead of a must-have. If users don't notice when your app stops working, you're building a vitamin. The $250K MRR businesses are painkillers remove them and the workflow breaks immediately.\n\nThe most overlooked insight from studying these 53 businesses: idea quality matters far less than distribution timing. The founders who hit $10K MRR fastest had a distribution plan before they wrote the first line of code.\n\nWhat's the most important factor you've seen separate apps that scale from ones that plateau?",

I spent over half the year developing three WordPress products. Only this month, after I started doing some marketing, specifically YouTube videos, did I begin to see any signs that people are interested in the product. Without it, there was absolutely nothing. Though even $16 MRR is hard to call a success.\n\nMy advice is probably to consider offline businesses, though you can still give online a try.",

With enough effort put in and enough time, you can certainly get there as long as you are not making big fundamental mistakes. But not everyone has that much of a runway to do it.\n\nI am full-time solo developer for 2+ years now and I am just hovering around $2k a month (across 5 out of the 7 apps I built over the years). The first year and a half was extremely desperate because I spent a lot of time on building but not promoting. It takes trial and error even if you follow the best of the best.\n\nBest advice I could give is to learn how to prove an idea is worth building with cold hard facts (numbers), and to try everything you can learn in terms of promoting.\n\nIt takes a few times to find your own way, so expect to build more than one app to get to your target number. Also be patient because it is likely going to take a while. If you can do it part-time, do that so you can keep trying for longer. For me, I am using my savings for 2 years doing it full-time, so it is very hard and stressful.",

Your 55.5% conversion rate is excellent - that means your App Store page is working. 8.64 sessions per active device means people are actually using the app, not just downloading and deleting. 0 crashes is perfect.\n\nHere's what the numbers mean:\n\n**Is 154 downloads in 5 days decent?** Yes. Most apps get single-digit downloads on day 1. You're averaging 30/day organically with no marketing. That's legitimately good.\n\n**Is 55% conversion sustainable?** Probably not this high forever, but it means your screenshots and messaging are on point. As you get more impressions from broader searches, conversion will likely settle around 20-30%, which is still very strong.\n\n**What to focus on next:**\n\n1. **Growth:** You only have 544 impressions in 5 days. That's your bottleneck. Your conversion is great, but not enough people are seeing your app. You need more impressions, which means either (a) better ASO/keywords to rank higher, or (b) external traffic (Reddit, Product Hunt, social, etc.).\n2. **Localization:** You didn't mention what your app does, but if it has any international appeal, localize your App Store metadata NOW while you're still early. The App Store algorithm looks at initial download velocity per market. If you launch in Germany/France/Brazil/Japan with localized listings, you'll get way more organic impressions in those markets.\n3. **Retention before monetization:** 8.64 sessions per device is good engagement. Focus on keeping that number high. Don't rush monetization until you understand why people are coming back (or not). Get to 500+ active users, survey them, understand retention, THEN monetize.\n\n**The opportunity you're missing:** You're getting 544 impressions total in 5 days. If your app is localized in 10+ languages, you could be getting 544 impressions in EACH market. English-only apps miss 70%+ of the App Store.\n\nI built [shiplocal.app](https://shiplocal.app) for exactly this. $19 one-time lifetime Starter plan - you could have 10-15 locales live in 20 minutes and start getting organic downloads from markets where you have zero competition.\n\nYour conversion is great. Your engagement is great. You just need more traffic. Localization is the easiest way to 5-10x your impressions without spending a dollar on ads.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, but expand your addressable market while you're still early.",

      "text": "Launched our app three months ago banking on app store optimization to drive downloads. Optimized title, screenshots, keywords, description. Everything the ASO guides recommend. Got maybe 15-20 downloads per week, mostly from people who already knew about us. The problem was treating the app store as the only discovery channel. We were competing with millions of apps for attention in a crowded marketplace where the top charts get 90% of downloads.\n\n Built a parallel web presence to capture search traffic outside the app stores. Created a landing page explaining what the app does and why it solves specific problems. Then focused on getting that page to rank organically. Started with domain authority since the landing page domain had none. Used [backlink agency to establish baseline trust through directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to app directories and startup listings. This gave the web presence legitimacy separate from app store rankings.\n\n Then published 10 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to what the app solves. Not \"download our app\" content but actual helpful posts about the problem space. Things like \"how to solve X without Y\" or \"best way to manage Z on mobile.\"\n\n Month one showed minimal impact. Directory listings went live and the blog posts got indexed but downloads stayed around 20 weekly. The web presence existed but wasn't driving discovery yet.\n\n Month two is when organic web traffic started converting to downloads. Domain authority reached 18 and blog posts began ranking for longtail problem keywords. People found the content, read about the solution, then downloaded the app. Got to 60 downloads weekly. \n\nMonth three hit 120 downloads per week with 65% coming from organic web search rather than app store discovery. The conversion flow works because people arrive educated about their problem and our solution before hitting the app store.\n\n The interesting metric is retention. Users who find us through organic content have 3x better week-one retention than app store browsers. They downloaded with clear intent to solve a specific problem rather than casual exploration. The app business lesson is that the app stores are distribution but not the only distribution. Building organic web presence creates a discovery channel you control. People search for solutions on Google way more than they browse app store categories.\n\n If your app downloads are stuck relying on app store optimization, build a web funnel that captures search traffic and educates users before sending them to download.",

Well the main feature is the analysis of recipe videos, so no matter the cuisine style or if its a drink, starter, dessert or anything really, it’s very accurate. The only thing a bit more difficult to estimate are the quantities but it does a pretty good job at that too.",
