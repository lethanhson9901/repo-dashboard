          "text": "I've followed a similar path to achieve results like yours. Here's my perspective.\n\n# Organic Growth\n\n* ASO (App Store Optimization) is great because it brings free traffic. Be grateful when your app ranks well. But don't feel discouraged if it doesn't. It is not a reliable source you can fully depend on.\n   * The Apple and Google Store search algorithms are black boxes. No one truly knows how they work, and they can change anytime.\n   * New apps enter the market every day, increasing competition.\n* Daily posting on TikTok or Instagram works for some people. It didn't work for me. I tried, but creating content manually every day was exhausting and hard to sustain.\n* Posting on forums like Reddit works to some extent. You may get tens or hundreds of downloads occasionally, but it is not scalable.\n* Cold emailing website editors to feature your app can work too. You might get tens, hundreds, or even thousands of downloads once in a while. But again, it is not scalable.\n\n# Paid Ads\n\nFor me, the only channel that truly moves the needle is paid advertising. It works and it scales.\n\nHere is my experience:\n\n* Google Ads works well for Android apps, but not as effectively for iOS. Scaling can be challenging.\n* Apple Search Ads works well for iOS apps, but scaling is limited.\n* Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram) works very well for iOS apps and is extremely scalable.\n* TikTok Ads traffic, in my experience, is less likely to convert into paying users.\n* You need to create many different ad creatives. Hopefully, a few will emerge as strong performers.\n* Consider targeting non-English-speaking countries. These markets often have lower advertising costs due to less competition.\n* Be prepared to fail and to lose a meaningful amount of money while testing. For example, you may test ads in 10 markets, and only 2 become profitable. Even then, study why the other 8 failed. Use those lessons to refine your strategy or move on.\n* A/B testing and funnel analysis should be ongoing processes to improve profitability.\n* Tools like CapCut, Canva, and Nano Banana are great for beginners to create reasonably good ad creatives.\n* Some people are able to make it work by collaborating with influencers to promote their app. I haven't felt the urge to try that yet, as I believe it can be more expensive than paid ads and harder to measure performance effectively.\n\nCongrats and good luck. It is always inspiring to see an indie founder succeed after years of perseverance.",

Currently I'm testing Meta but my creatives are burning out very quickly (ad fatigue). And I don't see myself creating new creatives over and over again. What is your experience there?   \nTotally agree on that money burning aspect. Specially Meta felt like huge pain when testing creatives. Burned some hundreds within days just to figure out what might work for scaling.   \nFrom my experience it's also really hard to find some influencers. They barely answer my IG messages or emails. I can't understand how people manage to find dozens of influencer which are creating content for them. \n\nWhat you're working on at the moment? ",

For my music visualizer I recently saw decline in rankings + organic downloads and couldn't really figure out why exactly this was happening. Also what we see right now is a huge increase in apps which are released due to lower entry barriers (vibe coding and AI-powered coding). Releasing an app is so fast now. I recently started an experiment to develop + submit a vibe coded dev tool for color conversion and the hole process took 1 hour. From developing the concept over vibe coding it to submitting it to the AppStore for review. Back in the days when I started, that would have taken a hole day or so. But there are still opportunities out there. I started a MIDI Controller app end last year which works okay regarding organic downloads but majority of my newly released apps get less than 10 downloads a day. ",

Nice you finished it! \n\nI don't want to question your skills or offend you in any way but from my experience you'll generate nearly nothing from your first app (hope it's different for your first app). But keep going, your second app will be better and you'll also develop it way faster. \n\nMy recommendation is to see if there's interest for your app and you can get some downloads. Organic downloads are the most important thing in my opinion specially when you just started and don't have budget for paid marketing. I personally released MVP's for some apps completely for free just to get a feeling for the downloads I can get with it. If I'm unable to get some downloads, I usually move on to the next app. ",

Later you build processes for feedback, onboarding, retention, content, distribution, etc.\n\nThe companies that last aren’t necessarily the ones with the best launch.\n\nThey’re the ones that keep improving the boring internal loops for years.\n\n8 years of iteration is actually the impressive part here, not the number.\n\nThe internet loves overnight success stories, but most real ones look exactly like this. ❤️",

But this is really an individual thing and every buyer thinks different here.

That will increase notification enabled users. If users getting real value from every single notifications, it would not feel spammy even if it’s 100 times per day.

Starting point:\n\n* \\~2.3M monthly organic visitors\n* \\~490k ranking keywords\n* DR \\~75\n\nAfter 2 months:\n\n* \\~2.77M monthly visitors (+16.8%)\n* 726k ranking keywords\n* 32 backlinks built\n* Significant increase in traffic value\n\nNow, 16% growth on a 2M+ base isn’t easy - especially in health. Because this is medical/fertility content, it falls under Google’s YMYL guidelines (high scrutiny, strict E-E-A-T expectations). Shortcuts would have backfired. We handle most growth in-house, but for this specific push we decided to bring in an [external SEO/link-building partner](http://submittodirectory.com/) to handle outreach at scale. The goal wasn’t volume - it was consistent, high-quality placements in a sensitive (YMYL) niche.\n\n# The competitive landscape\n\nWe were competing with platforms like:\n\n* Clue\n* Natural Cycles\n* Everyday Health\n\nHealth SERPs are extremely competitive and heavily trust-driven.\n\n# What actually moved rankings\n\n# Relevance over volume\n\nOnly 32 links in 2 months. But they were contextual and topically aligned with fertility, pregnancy, and data-backed health resources. Some placements included sites like:\n\n* GWI\n* Superprof\n\nNo mass guest posting. No spam directories.\n\n# Utility pages were the growth lever\n\nInstead of pushing general blog content, we focused on strengthening:\n\n* Pregnancy probability calculators\n* Ovulation prediction tools\n* “Am I pregnant?” resources\n\nUtility-based pages tend to attract citations naturally when structured well.\n\n# E-E-A-T alignment\n\nFor medical niches, we made sure:\n\n* Content was expert-reviewed\n* Authors were clearly attributed\n* Medical claims were conservative and sourced\n* Anchor strategy remained natural\n\nAggressive tactics would have hurt more than helped.\n\n# Ranking impact\n\nDuring the campaign, the app ranked top 3 for competitive queries like:\n\n* Early pregnancy symptoms\n* When to take pregnancy test\n* Track my period\n* Early signs of pregnancy\n\nOrganic traffic value also increased significantly during this window.\n\n# Biggest takeaway for app founders\n\nAt scale (1M+ traffic), growth rarely comes from “more content.” It comes from:\n\n* Authority stacking\n* Strengthening high-intent pages\n* Precision link acquisition\n* Protecting trust signals\n\nShort, focused campaigns can work - but only if the foundation is already strong. Curious for other app operators here: Is SEO still a major growth lever for you, or have paid channels taken over as your primary acquisition engine? Happy to share more specifics if helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2y1f6z4noig1.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e381d88689d1b9b8a3a947ae49d89e173861b0\n\n",

      "text": "I launched my app 3 hours ago and I’m honestly still shaking a little.\n\nAfter months of building (mostly nights and weekends), I finally stopped tweaking and hit publish today. No big audience. No email list. No paid ads. Just me pressing “submit” and hoping at least a few people would care.\n\nI posted it on Product Hunt mostly to force myself to launch publicly. It’s not blowing up or anything. No crazy upvotes. No front page domination. Just a handful of people engaging and a few thoughtful comments.\n\nBut here’s the part that caught me off guard:\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the App Store charts… and right now it’s sitting at **#142 in its category in Germany**.\n\nThree hours in.\n\nI genuinely didn’t expect to see a ranking at all. I always assumed those charts were reserved for companies with marketing budgets and coordinated launches. Seeing my tiny, self-funded app show up there — even at #142 — feels surreal.\n\nWhat’s wild is realizing how small the early momentum actually is. It doesn’t take thousands of downloads to start moving the needle when you’re starting from zero. A bit of visibility, a few shares, some organic installs… and suddenly you’re “on the chart.”\n\nThe launch is still happening. I’m still refreshing everything way too often. I have no idea where it’ll end up by tonight — it might climb, it might disappear.\n\nBut right now, three hours after launching, something I built is ranking in the App Store. And that feels pretty incredible.\n\nIf you’re building something and waiting for the “perfect” moment — this is your sign to just ship it.\n\nHappy to answer questions while I sit here refreshing stats 😅",

      "text": "Yes actually. \n\n(Btw no I have no marketing software/course/saas/etc. to sell you. I’m sharing what I did for a Bible study app lol) \n\nI marketed the app. Showed zero screenshots of styles or features of the app. All I did was make an app that I really believed him and I knew solve the problem that people actually had.\n\nSo how?\n\nFraming and solving a real problem are really the two big aspects that allowed me to do this.\n\nFraming: let assume that you’re selling a cooking/recipe. Extremely popular niche and has a lot of opportunity for subscriptions. You can either mark this as a recipe app, which is boring and is not interesting to anybody. Or you could make some form of a game modified version of this where you have a timer inside of the app where people have to make all their meals and under 25 minutes to show how easy and simple your meals are. Or are you frame it like you’re just having a conversation with a chef and in 15 seconds you get your dream meal.\n\nThe big difference is you’re solving the actual pain point that people have by making a different version of pretty much the exact same app that everybody else would be making anyways, but the functionality makes all of the difference\n\nSolving a real problem: I’m in a lot of these different sub, edits and some of the different app ideas that people have just kind of made me scratch my head. I wanna clarify that any app can make money and all apps even if they’re ugly or monetizing if you’re good enough at marketing.\n\nThe issue I’m seeing a lot is most of you all suck at marketing and you’re building a mediocre product when it comes to the problem that you’re solving. Simply put your idea isn’t an irresistible idea.\n\nSo that leads you down two paths you can either just be really good at marketing and push through the noise by having maybe a mediocre idea but excellent marketing. Or the other option is you can have an incredible idea and maybe even be terrible at marketing, but it’s such a good idea that people wanna share it with their friends.\n\nSo my Bible Study app fixed this problem. There are plenty of Bible Study apps out there and mine is a bit of a hybrid of a few things mixed together. By the way, it is not the one that you’ll find in my profile that I’m referring to right now.\n\nSo now how did they get 250 Leads to sign up for the app before actually even having it in the App Store? Well, I already had the idea for the app and what all features would be in the app so when it actually came to vibe coating it full transparency, it took me around two hours and all to vibecode the entire app.\n\nSo then, because I’ve done this a few times now I was approving the App Store first try which obviously made the process a lot quicker and easier.  this was after dozens of rejections on other apps to be clear. \n\nSo all I did is, I went on TikTok and Instagram reels and told people that I thought my idea was probably gonna be stupid in a terrible idea and then just shared what the app would do and I said if you’re interested, the word yes.\n\nThen the automation software dm’ed everyone the sign up page. \n\nI asked for name and phone number so could text them when it was live. \n\nResults: \n\nWell, this will happen this past week and in the first 48 hours of the app actually being live in the App Store we’re currently at $1000 in revenue. This definitely exceeded my expectations, but I am very very grateful. Obviously it’s too early to tell, but I’m guessing in the first 30 days the apps gonna hit between $5000 and $7500.\n\nSo 250 leads and currently at ironically 25 customers. \n\nYou wanna know what’s even crazier? (Feel free to make fun) \n\nI’m only in the App Store. I’ve gotten around a dozen messages now from people asking me when it’s gonna be in the play store. Meaning that my numbers would probably already be doubled. If I had it in Google play store but my dingdong self just didn’t expect a lot of people from the play store to be interested in the first place honestly\n\nI’ll update you all in the next week or so once that is up and what that does to the amount of new customers as well\n\nTLDR stop wasting time on building your product and just go out there and market it like crazy. If people don’t like the app then stop wasting time marketing it or start marketing it in a way that people are actually interested in. This is real life results for me doing this for the very first time myself over the past two weeks.",

      "text": "I’ve been obsessed with how small teams are out-executing VC-backed companies lately. The growth of [Bible Chat AI ](https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6448849666?country=US)is a perfect example.\n\nThey essentially built a ChatGPT wrapper for the Christian niche, but they didn't just stop at a text box. They added journaling, streaks, and push notifications—turning a LLM into a sticky utility.\n\n**The 3 things they did differently:**\n\n* **Short-form Distribution:** They dominate TikTok/IG with reaction videos. It’s a dead-simple funnel: Viral Clip → App Tutorial → Download.\n* **The \"Investment\" Onboarding:** They use a multi-step quiz before the paywall. By the time the user sees a price, they’ve already invested 2 minutes into \"personalizing\" their experience.\n* **Hyper-Localization:** They didn't just stick to the US; they targeted high-growth Christian regions globally.\n\nIt’s wild that a dev and an entrepreneur can outperform massive studios now. I've been trying to replicate this \"lean\" flow myself. Honestly, with [Cursor](http://cursor.com) or better Claude Code for the logic and [Appthetics](https://www.appthetics.com) to spin up the UI/UX without hiring a designer, the \"time to market\" has basically dropped to zero.\n\nHas anyone else seen \"niche wrappers\" doing these kinds of numbers? I’m looking for more case studies to deconstruct.\n\n",

Clearly documenting your current tech stack (backend, frontend, hosting).\n2. Identifying whether the automation needs real-time processing or background jobs.\n3. Deciding if this is feature-level automation or core product logic.\n\nA lot of agencies will quote high without understanding your architecture. You might actually just need a senior backend engineer with AI integration experience rather than a full agency.",
