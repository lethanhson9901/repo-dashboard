Most are limited by prototype, but I've build MVP using Superapp AI, and it's has honestly done a great job on design and stability/ logic. Sometimes, when I was already working on V2, I was considering to get a dev to help me, but before i got customers honestly just use superapp, no need to waste money on a dev",

New icon, better screenshots, reworked description, keyword research… still stuck at 15-20 installs per week.\n\nWhat we didn't realize was that the app store was only part of the discovery puzzle. The real issue: zero web authority around the product.\n\nSo we ran a small experiment and treated the app like a SaaS by building a backlink foundation for the landing site.\n\nFirst step was building a simple landing page that explained the app, use cases, and FAQs. Nothing fancy, just enough to give people a reason to understand what the app does before they hit the download button.\n\nThen we submitted the site to 200+ SaaS, startup, and app directories using [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org) so we weren't manually filling forms for days. The goal was to create enough external signals that Google would start caring about our domain.\n\nWe also published five low-competition blog posts targeting \"problem-based\" queries related to the app's core job, not just the app name itself. These posts weren't getting traffic immediately but they were ready to rank once the authority kicked in.\n\nAfter 60 days, domain authority went from zero to a level where we started ranking for longtail queries around the problem space. Organic traffic to the landing page steadily increased week over week. Most importantly, app installs from search and referral started to surpass installs from our original paid experiments.\n\nThe lesson: if your app business treats the app store as the only front door, growth stalls fast. Giving the app a proper web footprint with backlinks and indexable content turned out to be the multiplier we didn't know we needed.",

App 2: Product Hunt got 94 upvotes, 48 installs, 1 paid user. Same pattern, tire-kickers who never convert. App 3: Didn't bother with Product Hunt. Went straight to niche communities, app directories, and SEO. Got 180 installs first month, 28 paid users. 10x better results.​\n\n\n\nWhat actually worked for app 3: Posted in 8 specific subreddits where target users hang out, providing value first for 2 weeks, then mentioning app. Got 87 installs, 18 paid. Submitted to 15 app directories nobody talks about, smaller platforms but higher-intent users. Got 52 installs, 7 paid. Started app store SEO with careful keyword targeting in title/description. Got 41 organic installs, 3 paid.​\n\n\n\nWhy Product Hunt fails for apps: Users browse for entertainment, not solutions. They upvote cool concepts but rarely become paying customers. You're competing with 50+ other launches daily. Spike dies within 48 hours, zero long-term value. Better to spend launch energy on high-intent channels where people actively search for solutions.\n\n\n\nControversial take: Product Hunt is a vanity metric. Makes you feel good with upvotes but rarely drives sustainable growth. Only worth it if you already have audience to support the launch. For unknown founders, niche communities and app store SEO crush PH every time.\n\n\n\nFound this in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) studying 75+ app launches successful ones treated PH as optional, focused on App Store optimization and targeted communities. Failed ones bet everything on PH launch day magic that never came.​\n\n\n\nAm I wrong? Did Product Hunt actually drive real growth for your app?",

Here are my 2 cents: \n\nFirst of all you are in competition with  like hundreds of similar solutions and most of them have big marketing money. So you need to compete with that!\n\nI go on your page, I don't see any samples. If want to sell sites/apps at least create 10 samples people can click through to see what your tool can do.\n\nI started with the free version, I can only choose Deepseek. Fine. I did use free Deepseek directly with the same prompt and the result is really better.\n\nPricing is really confusing: Free is $0 / month??? Weekly is $5 one-time? others also -one-time? w00t? So is it a subscription? You biy a package? No idea.\n\nYou sell credits with the packages. Good move. BUT, you don't explain anywhere, what I get for a credit. If I buy 39 credits, can I create 39 websites with it? Or do you charge a credit for every change you do on the page? I created a landingpage and it did cost me a credit. I clicked on a link in my landing page, it doubled your page inside your page and I only got 6 credits left. Makes no sense. It's also missing in the FAQ.\n\nSo, enough bashing 😉\n\nFrom my opinion, what would make it better:\n\nMake the page more friendly and use some pictures in it. You sell websites, make it visual then!\n\nExplain how it works. With credits explained. What do you get for what.\n\nYour USP is your Visual Editor. You need to realy point that out! Also that you can upload existing HTML templates to edit them. This is really cool also.\n\nMake a video (or better several) to show how your solution works and what you get as a user\n\nI would remove the free version, as you see people only use it to create or try some stuff. Not satisfied, no buy. Make a real trial version with all features available, all AI Models and full version of visual editor. If the result is cool, then you have a better chance for a buyer. \n\nAlso, you said you can download the HTML and I guess it is without the visual editor in it. So why not ad a hosting package to your soution. Peeps can host it right away.\n\nHope that helps!",

I am glad that you loved the product with Deepseek but believe me it gives far better results with Claude Sonnet 4.5 but sadly had to move that to paid tier. The API cost was huge. \n\nAnd I am from India where stripe is not available.

That's 2.8% of users paying anything. 97.2% freeload forever. App Store economics are completely broken for indie developers.\n\nThe math that kills apps is 12,000 downloads, 2,100 monthly active users (82.5% uninstall or ghost), 340 paying users (16% convert to any payment), average $1/month per paying user from mix of $3/month subscriptions and one-time $5 purchases. Six months of work generating $340 monthly is $0.56 per hour invested.​\n\nWhy App Store monetization fails, users expect free, won't pay for productivity apps they can replace with free alternatives, subscriptions feel predatory in crowded category, one-time purchases don't create recurring revenue. You're competing with venture-backed apps that are free forever trying to reach 100M users before monetizing.\n\nWhat actually works picked the wrong category (productivity is bloodbath), should've built for niche B2B use case at $10-30/month, focused on 100 paying customers not 10,000 free users. My friend's contractor management app has 400 downloads, 80 paying at $15/month = $1,200 monthly. Lower downloads, 10x revenue.​\n\nThe App Store dream is dead for indie devs in consumer categories. You need niche B2B or accept poverty. Found this studying app economics in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) successful indie apps charged $10-50/month for professional use cases, failed apps tried consumer freemium competing with VC-backed companies.\n\nHow many downloads vs actual revenue? Bet most ratios are equally depressing.",

A lot of the basic free checkers are kind of unreliable, and there are real issues with false positives, especially for non-native English speakers. It's more of a tool to start a conversation now, not a final verdict. I use detectors for work (SEO and content) and just for personal curiosity online. I've tried a bunch, and honestly, the results can be all over the place between different tools. For me, the key is finding one that's straightforward and gives you a clear breakdown, not just a scary percentage.\n\nI've been using wasitaigenerated lately because it handles more than just text, you can check images and video clips too, which is huge with deepfakes going around. The results come back fast and the confidence score they give has lined up pretty well when I've tested it against stuff I know I wrote. So, it’s not a solved problem. If you build something that’s transparent, handles different types of media, and is presented as a helpful signal rather than a punishment tool, there's absolutely room for it. The focus should be on giving people useful information to make their own call.\n\nWhat kind of different approach are you thinking about?",

Weekly trial-seekers often just want to test and churn immediately. Yearly trial-seekers have already mentally committed to a longer relationship with your app.\n\n  \n\\*\\*On lifetime:\\*\\* Double-edged. Good for cash burst, bad for LTV modeling. If you offer one, price at 3-4x yearly minimum—you want the \"never think about this again\" buyer, not the \"cheaper than yearly\" calculator.\n\n  \n\\*\\*Churn reality:\\*\\* Weekly subs typically see 40-60% monthly churn. Yearly: 15-25% at renewal. The math isn't close. But weekly \\*can\\* work if value delivery is fast (dating apps see results in days, fitness apps need months).\n\n  \nFor your case: I'd A/B test yearly + 7-day trial vs yearly + 3-day trial. Run minimum 2 weeks before drawing conclusions.\n\n  \nWhat's your app category? That usually determines which lever matters most.",

This is a deeply nuanced question so we’ll need more context to provide helpful answers. \n\nI recently decided to see if I like advising founders so I’d be happy to hop on Zoom with you (for free) and we can chat through the problem! DM me if you’re interested.",
