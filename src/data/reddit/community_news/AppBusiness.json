      "text": "this one's interesting. Alejandro and Mario built PushScroll, an app that blocks your social media until you do pushups, squats, or planks. Hit $30K MRR in 4 months with 300K downloads.\n\nthe crazy part: they validated the whole idea with a fake demo video before writing any code. Posted it on TikTok, it blew up, people were begging for the app in comments. Only then did they actually build it.\n\nthe MVP was embarrassingly simple. Just 3 screens. They charge \\~$30/year with a hard paywall.\n\ntheir playbook is pretty repeatable:\n\n1. warm up a TikTok account in your niche first\n2. post daily until something hits, that's your green light to build\n3. build a dead simple MVP (they used tools like [AppAlchemy](https://appalchemy.ai) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com) to move fast)\n4. keep posting organically until $5K MRR before paying influencers\n5. then scale with paid ads\n\nmost founders build first then figure out marketing. These guys flipped it completely.\n\nwhat other app ideas could be validated this way before building?\n\nbeen researching these viral app case studies at r/ViralApps if anyone's interested",

          "text": "Validating before building is the real takeaway here, not just fitness + screen time. The fake demo video is basically a compressed landing page test with way better emotional signal: you see comments like “shut up and take my money” instead of just email signups.\n\nStuff that could work with the same approach:\n\n\\- “Painful trade” apps: eg, you have to clear 5 emails or write 3 sentences in your journal before opening Instagram.\n\n\\- Micro-stakes money apps: eg, auto-move $1 into savings every 10 mins you stay off TikTok.\n\n\\- Social pressure tools: eg, friends see a log of your doomscroll time unless you hit a daily habit.\n\nYou could test all of these with fake-screen demos on TikTok/Reels first, then ship a 3–5 screen MVP using AppAlchemy, Glide, or a dead-simple Swift/Flutter shell. For discovery and comment research, tools like Similarweb and SparkToro help, and Pulse is handy for finding Reddit threads where people already complain about doomscrolling and motivation.",

      "text": "I spent months coding in Swift. Real months. iOS apps, backend, databases, APIs, Stripe, edge cases no one will ever notice.  \nRevenue: €**0**. Literally zero.\n\nMy days all looked the same. Wake up, open Xcode, coffee goes cold, 40 tabs open (docs, forums, Stack Overflow, some GitHub issue from 2017). ChatGPT open all the time, mostly to learn, not to copy-paste.  \nAt one point I was doing 16–17 hours a day. Not in a grindset way. Just “one more thing” over and over.\n\nAll of this for an app that’s actually useful. It helps manage your wardrobe. Simple idea, insane amount of work.  \nI won’t name it because this isn’t an ad. The app works, people like it… but no traction, no money, nothing. Just me refreshing App Store Connect like an idiot.\n\nThen one random night I’m doom-scrolling Instagram and I see a screenshot.  \nIt’s just the year shown as a progress bar. Like “you’re X% into the year”.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the whole idea.\n\nI stare at it, open Notes, then Xcode. About 20 minutes later the app is basically done. backend. No login. No Stripe. One screen. One idea.\n\nI submit it to Apple the same night. I even pay for expedited review (which I never do). No idea why, just had a weird gut feeling.\n\nApple approves it almost instantly.  \nI launch it as a paid app. €0.99. No free tier. No trial. Just “this is the app”.\n\nthen something surreal happens...\n\nIt climbs to #10 in the Entertainment category (paid apps). Not joking. REALLY. (Attach proof)\n\nThe funniest part? I don’t even know how many downloads it has yet. Stats haven’t updated.  \nSo I have no idea who bought it or why — I just know it was sitting there at #10 next to apps made by actual teams with budgets.\n\nI’m including screenshots as proof because I know how Reddit works and I’d call bullshit too.\n\nThat’s it.  \nMonths of “serious” work: nothing.  \nTwenty minutes on a stupidly clear idea: top 10.\n\nI’m still trying to process what this means.  \nJust want to share this story here to understand BEFORE looking at Apple Store Analytics :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h467s3xlkfg1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba09158e9739a9c6a3e51b80f6793ae75f2b11f\n\n",

      "text": "\nLaunched our app three months ago banking on app store optimization to drive downloads. Optimized title, screenshots, keywords, description. Everything the ASO guides recommend. Got maybe 15-20 downloads per week, mostly from people who already knew about us. The problem was treating the app store as the only discovery channel. We were competing with millions of apps for attention in a crowded marketplace where the top charts get 90% of downloads.\n\nBuilt a parallel web presence to capture search traffic outside the app stores. Created a landing page explaining what the app does and why it solves specific problems. Then focused on getting that page to rank organically. Started with domain authority since the landing page domain had none. Used [backlink agency to establish baseline trust through directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to app directories and startup listings. This gave the web presence legitimacy separate from app store rankings.\n\nThen published 10 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to what the app solves. Not \"download our app\" content but actual helpful posts about the problem space. Things like \"how to solve X without Y\" or \"best way to manage Z on mobile.\"\n\nMonth one showed minimal impact. Directory listings went live and the blog posts got indexed but downloads stayed around 20 weekly. The web presence existed but wasn't driving discovery yet.\n\nMonth two is when organic web traffic started converting to downloads. Domain authority reached 18 and blog posts began ranking for longtail problem keywords. People found the content, read about the solution, then downloaded the app. Got to 60 downloads weekly.\n\nMonth three hit 120 downloads per week with 65% coming from organic web search rather than app store discovery. The conversion flow works because people arrive educated about their problem and our solution before hitting the app store.\n\nThe interesting metric is retention. Users who find us through organic content have 3x better week-one retention than app store browsers. They downloaded with clear intent to solve a specific problem rather than casual exploration. The app business lesson is that the app stores are distribution but not the only distribution. Building organic web presence creates a discovery channel you control. People search for solutions on Google way more than they browse app store categories.\n\nIf your app downloads are stuck relying on app store optimization, build a web funnel that captures search traffic and educates users before sending them to download.",

Even if 90% of people bounce, a few legit business users who write it off as an expense can make the unit economics work.\n\n\n\nThe bigger risk is platform scrutiny and chargebacks if it feels scammy. I’d bet they’re A/B testing titles, keywords, and onboarding hard, maybe watching reviews and Reddit chatter through tools like AppTweak, Sensor Tower, and even something like Pulse for Reddit to see if users are calling them out.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, it can work, but it’s a narrow, kind of gray-area play that relies on rare but very high-value buyers.",

We’ve had a few get featured thanks to solid ASO and the organic momentum we create! \n\nApple really looks at things like great UX, design, innovation, but strong ASO makes a huge difference. You need optimized screenshots that show your core value and fit iOS trends, etc. The most important part is testing what people love and framing your app’s image to match what draws people in organically (without paid ads)! We train a community of 100+ creators to push out 600-1500 pieces of content for our clients and with that data you can truly understand what features/angles converts viewers into clients. and watch your revenue go up quickly. \n\nThe feature builds a ton of trust, but it fades quickly without the right hooks. That’s where our model comes in. We can then also use that App Store trust to build trust and reputation through VGC / UGC campaigns. We tested over 2000+ TikTok and Instagram posts per month to find the viral angles. \n\nHere’s our proof: Bible BFF, that scaled to 30,000 users and 150K MRR with zero paid spend at first. Organic users convert two times better after a feature, and we dropped CAC by 60 percent.\n\nApp Store features are great amplifiers, but VGC and UGC volume testing turns that trust into a real revenue engine.",

I did the same thing early on: paid a mid-tier IG fitness creator, got a bunch of likes, almost no paying users. What helped was flipping it: pick the exact problem your best users obsess over, then find where they already talk about it. For me that meant niche Discords, specific subreddits, and small creators on YouTube/shorts who do deep-dive, ugly-but-honest content, not glossy posts. Structure it like experiments: 3–5 tiny tests per week, each with one clear call to action, then kill what doesn’t move paid installs within a few days. Since you’re already posting in forums, I’d double down there with a feedback loop: offer “I’ll tweak your routine for free if you try the app and tell me what sucked.” You’ll get copy, objections, and maybe your next roadmap from that. On the discovery side, I’ve used AppFollow for ASO, TG Analytics for tracking social hits, and Pulse for Reddit to catch threads where people complain about exactly the problem the app solves. Your main win here is to stop paying for vague visibility and only pay for channels where you can actually trace the path from conversation to purchase.",

Then:\n\n\n\n1) Find where they hang out: specific subreddits (cscareerquestions, resumes, jobs, expats), Discords, FB groups, uni career servers.\n\n2) Offer 10–15 free “resume surgery” calls. Live-edit their CV + job ad while screensharing. At the end, ask: “If I turned what we just did into a product for $X/mo, would you pay for it?” That gives you pricing, copy, and testimonials.\n\n3) Turn those calls into tiny case studies: before/after resumes, messages like “got 3 interviews this week,” and put those front and center on FitYourResume.\n\n4) Ditch broad SEO for now. Write 3 ultra-specific guides like “How Nigerian junior devs can get past ATS at EU companies.” Share those in the exact communities above.\n\n\n\nFor outreach, send super targeted DMs: screenshot a broken resume line or missing keywords, give 1 specific fix free, then plug your tool as the “do this in 5 minutes” version. My rule was: show value first, link second.\n\n\n\nAlso, make one offer that’s hard to ignore: for example, “If you don’t get at least 3 more interviews in 30 days after using my tool, I’ll redo your resume personally.” Early on you’re trading time for proof.\n\n\n\nOn channels: I’ve used Apollo for lead lists and Loom for quick personalized breakdowns; Pulse for Reddit helped me catch niche job-hunt threads where people were actively begging for resume help. Your main point right now: brutally narrow ICP, hands-on help, and concrete proof of results. That’s what unlocks the first $100 MRR.",

We’ll need both iOS and Android apps, plus a backend that can handle growth if things go well. Good design and user experience are also really important for us, not just basic functionality.\n\nThe problem is every company online says they’re the best, fastest, and most affordable, which makes it hard to know what’s actually true.\n\nFor those who’ve hired a mobile app development agency before:\n\n* How did you choose the company you worked with?\n* What’s a realistic budget range for a quality app?\n* Did communication go smoothly during development?\n* Any red flags to watch out for before signing a contract?\n* Would you recommend the team you worked with?\n\nI’m not necessarily looking for the cheapest option I’d rather work with a team that understands product thinking, scalability, and long-term support instead of just delivering code and disappearing.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences (good or bad).

They spend real time on discovery, challenge assumptions, and help you decide what *not* to build in v1. That matters a lot once you start scaling.\n\nFor a serious iOS + Android app with backend and solid UX, realistic budgets usually start in the mid five figures. Be cautious of very low quotes without proper discovery. Big red flags: fixed timelines too early, “yes” to every feature, vague communication, or no clear product/tech owner.\n\nLong-term success usually comes from teams that treat this as a product partnership, not just code delivery. That’s what we focus on at Taazaa, and it’s where I’ve seen projects actually scale well.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "Hello everyone\nI am a full stack developer and a solopreneur.\n\nI built an app called Zolly and I’m honestly struggling to understand what I’m missing. It’s an app builder where people can generate simple web apps and tools just by describing what they want. No complex setup, no heavy learning curve. You type an idea, it builds something usable, and you can tweak it from there. \n\nWhat’s confusing is that people are finding it organically. They sign up on their own, explore the product, build things, come back again, and even message saying it’s cool or useful. From the outside, it looks like traction. From the inside, it feels empty, because nobody is paying.\n\n\nEvery signup gives me a small hit of hope, and every day without a single upgrade takes that hope away. It’s reached the point where I’m questioning whether I’ve built something valuable or just something interesting enough to play with for free.\n\nI don’t know if the issue is that the value isn’t clear, or if I’ve priced it wrong, or if app builders in general are seen as toys unless they solve a very specific pain. I provided a visual editor like Canva where to edit the application or website you just drag n drop images, click to add text. No prompt, no credit loss.\nAlso don’t know if I should be talking less about features and more about outcomes, or if the product itself needs a hard pivot.\n\nIf you’ve built something where users showed up but money didn’t, I’d really appreciate your perspective. How did you figure out what was broken? What was the moment that made things click, or made you realize it was time to change direction? I’m not looking for validation, just honest feedback from people who’ve been through this.\n\nIf you want to check the application for reference https://www.zolly.dev/",

Until you know *why* people aren't signing up, you don't know what the actual issue is so you don't know what to try to change.\n\nYou need to talk to those people, or find some other means of figuring out \"why did *you* not subscribe?\"",

Right now you’ve proven two big things: you can get attention (1k users in 2 days) and some people will pay. That’s more than most apps ever get.\n\n\n\nBefore pivoting, dig into who those early payers were and why they paid. Add one simple in-app survey and personally email a handful of users asking what problem it really solves for them, what’s missing, and what would make it a no-brainer subscription. You might find you need to narrow the target (e.g., outdoor workers, pilots, hikers) instead of go broader.\n\n\n\nOn marketing, I’d pause random TikTok spend and go deep where your niche hangs out: specific subs, hobby forums, maybe a simple landing page you drive people to from Reddit/Twitter. I’ve tried things like Buffer and Publer for consistency, and ended up layering in Pulse for Reddit to catch and join weather-related or niche threads without wasting time.\n\n\n\nMain point: don’t throw it away yet; validate the niche, refine, then either double down or kill it with confidence.",

My first business was an e-commerce brand that crossed $1M in its first year, and I built and scaled it entirely on my own. I’m confident I can translate what I learned there into the app space — and I’d love to build alongside others doing the same.\n\nWhat I want to create:\n\n\t•\tA free Discord community for people actively working on apps\n\n\t•\tA space focused on practical progress, not hype\n\n\t•\tFounders helping founders — sharing strategies, lessons, mistakes, and momentum\n\nThe goal isn’t growth for growth’s sake. It’s:\n\n\t•\tEncouragement when things get heavy\n\n\t•\tReal conversations about what’s working (and what isn’t)\n\n\t•\tUseful connections and actual friendships, not “networking” theater\n\nNo paid tiers.\n\nNo selling.\n\nNo flexing.\n\nNo competitive energy.\n\nJust people building and supporting each other while we figure this out in real time.\n\nIf something like this would be helpful to you, comment or DM me and I’ll start pulling together the initial group.\n\n(Disclaimer: I used ChatGPT to edit/refine this post.
