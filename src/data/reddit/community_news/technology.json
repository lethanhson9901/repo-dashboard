This happens because their perceived image of \"loving and caring parent\" crashes headfirst into the reality of \"I sent my child away to a place where s/he was abused in every way conceivable\". The two are irreconcilable so to protect their ego they just deflect at every step.       \n\nI'm 100% expecting the same reaction out of MAGA chuds: they'll be unable to cope with the reality of \"I helped elect a fascist government\" because it'd destroy their perceived image of \"proud American defender of democracy and the constitution\" and so they'll go full on Deflectionville mode.              \n\nHell, we've already seen that with the murder of Renee Good: they can't accept that they helped elect a government that can and will freely murder citizens and so cue all the \"she tried to run him over/she was obstructing the way/she should've obeyed\" deflections. With the latest killing they'll go into deflection mode even harder.       \n\nIf it's of any comfort, for both the parents of kids who survived the TTI and MAGA chuds, deep deep deep deep down, under literal mountains of copium, ***they know what they did.***",

Then, once one of their front line agitators are killed, they can say things have gotten out of control, and the military will be needed to regain control. They will point to the dead official and say the government must defend itself from Americans, and martial law must be instated. If martial law is declared BEFORE an agent dies, then the government will lose the trust of those on the fence. Especially after saying all this time through their propaganda networks that everything is under control and America has been the best it's ever been.",

They relaxed a lot of their rules to make it more welcoming to others. They didn't actually change anything country wide, they just tried to be a bit nicer during the event so people could come in, see how amazing they are and then leave.\n\nThe US is going the opposite route.

There's way too much money invested already. Much the same as the 1936 Olympics, we will see a few standing up and making a point to say the US didn't deserve the sport being hosted there and that's worth more, historically then any boycott. There was a \"boycott\" for the 36 games, even a whole different games set that year in Spain (didn't happen), but we don't talk about that...we sure as fuck know the image of Jesse Owens standing next to Nazi's geting his gold medal. Sometimes the best protest is run with the enemy and make your voice heard when the stage is yours.",

They're confident you've got a few decades of a reduction in standing before they have to consider American soft power something they need to take into account.\n\nThere's plenty of other indicators of American loss of soft power in the past few years, but the Catholic Church didnt survive a thousand years by taking risky bets.

Soft power is not *good,* and by its nature it's even more coercive than hard power.\n\nSoft power can be as much a cudgel as hard power. Soft power is most often like a mafioso coming into your shop saying \"wow, nice place here, shame if something happened to it.\"\n\nIn terms of soft and hard power, it's not \"carrot and stick.\" It's more like \"threat of stick and stick.\"\n\nAmerica's use of sanctions, weaponization of trade arrangements (e.g. twisting Canada's arm to impose their own massive tariffs on Chinese EVs,) withholding of funds, etc. are all examples of the, let's say, \"morally dubious\" applications of soft power.\n\nSoft power erodes the sovereignty of other nations just as much if not more than hard power. It just bypasses the fights by way of threats.\n\nFor instance, USAID was very much an organization designed to bully. That money was not unconditional. It was given first, then used to say \"hey, if you don't deregulate your own country's oil and gas exports and allow US corporate interests to further pilfer your nation's national resources, then this money we're giving you will go away and we'll destabilize your whole-ass regime in the process.\"\n\nPrivate entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do the same things. \n\nWhen Bill Gates says \"I want to eradicate polio!\" and the country says \"yeah, uhh, we don't really have that many problems with polio, but we could really use some malaria meds,\" Bill Gates will put terms and conditions on his \"aid\" such that it CANNOT be used for malaria meds.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, Bill Gates wants a headline saying \"King Dickhead Eradicates Polio,\" not to actually help people in need.

I still remember when I went in 2020, how awful the vibe was.\n\nThe convention itself was dead. There was way more interesting activity in the lobby of the St. Regis than there was at the center. When we got to the center, it was saturated with a bunch of “dead”, shit-tier web3 games and NFT marketplace platforms that we’re supposed to *”disrupt the market”* that were absolutely scams. No gamer who was there was satisfied with the offerings, and majority of the booths and kiosks were empty. I remember saying right then and there that *”This convention is dead.”* There was no reason to spend money on hotels, passes, and the bloated cost of the Bay Area to waltz around the Tenderloin and risk being approached by homeless people.\n\nNow? As if the prohibitive costs and low-participation from developers wasn’t bad enough, you could actually get arrested. Every developer has their own showcase now per platform, so there is no reason for the major players to go, either. The meetup is now almost exclusively for people pitching their games and trying to secure new rounds of funding; even then, if you are in that phase, there are cheaper and easier ways to secure deals than to attend the event. It is definitely going to go the way of E3 and die out, 100%\n\nThe other unrelated but relevant detail I remember; virtually everyone I knew who went that year caught COVID. It was a super spreader event, and the convention did virtually nothing to help prevent it from being that way. It is a weird value proposition to any developer: *”Hey, spend $3000 to come here for a few days, talk to some financiers and BD guys, leave with a chronic illness that can and will spread to your teams when you return and decommission for them for another 7-12 days!”* You combine it with the area being housed with a massive amount of homeless people who can and do steal as much as possible from convention-goers, and it just isn’t worth it.",

Firearm suicides in the USA account for nearly 27,000 deaths annually, representing over half of all gun-related deaths and approximately 55%–60% of all suicides in the country.\n\nIf we really wanted to do something measurable and tangible to \"reduce firearms deaths\".. logically and scientifically the best thing we could do would be to invest heavily in mental health and suicide-prevention resources.",

                  "text": "That would show up on the P&L as a return. The only conclusion to draw is that they saw a revenue drop along with the layoffs which combined with the AI service costs wiped out any return. It’s going to be a bit muddy because attribution is hard, but you’d expect to see a lift if it lived up to its promise. \n\nFWIW this is much more in line with what I’d expect — LLMs can be great productivity tools in some circumstances, but they’re productivity tools. The distribution of that productivity bump is invariably going to be lumpy, so without targeted application Id expect pretty low signal to noise when looking at  returns. They’re not replacing FTEs broadly across your org, which seems to have been some (most?) executives expectations. \n\nIf you look at organizations more broadly many haven’t even bothered rolling out old fashioned automation solutions for many tasks internally. Those organizations are likely the least well positioned to leverage LLMs, even though they have the most potential for a return. Their problems are mostly due to having weak technology orgs, and trying to roll out LLMs internally isn’t going to help them because they’ll have just as much issue with that as with rolling out the automation they could already have been leveraging for returns. \n\nLooking at the benefits of LLMs more specifically they’re just not suitable to be used unsupervised. Their output needs to be scrutinized by a real person, and if that validation takes as much or almost as much time as the person just doing the work in the first place then there’s no lift to be had either. It’s neat that an ML model can mostly do that work, but the benefits to the business are inherently limited by that need for supervision. \n\nSo while I think it’s obvious that LLMs will deliver increased productivity in the long term, I think the current market and investment are grossly disproportionate to those gains. We just aren’t going to see the wholesale displacement of workers by LLMs, absent some additional breakthroughs in model design and training. It’s going to be a loooooong time to get a return on investment at the current levels of spending in the industry. \n\nAll of that is a really long winded way to say that I’m just not surprised by this. There’s been far too much ‘irrational exuberance’ around LLMs and a correction is coming. We don’t know when, who will be impacted the most, or the full magnitude of the correction, but it is coming nonetheless.",

My grammar sucks and trying to untangle my inner thoughts into a nice straight pattern on paper actually makes me feel like I’m banging my head against the wall. Which is ironic given my major in TV Prod and minor in screenwriting.\n\nI got through high school and college by writing all my essays and then pasting them into grammarly, having it fix all my spelling, grammar, and word-vomit, and then submitting it. Simple, no AI involvement, no change in the points and arguments I made in my writing, just a simple clean up and mistake polishing.\n\nNow I try to use grammarly to do that same thing to help me write emails and cover letters for job apps and it’s practically all AI now. Just yesterday I tried using it to help me fix any mistakes in an email draft and the AI is trying to change everything I said and is actually making what I wrote worse than if I had just wrote it myself and sent it without trying to proofread it. It got to the point where I had to fix mistakes that the AI proofreader had made while also trying to fix my own grammatical errors. Defeating the purpose of me using it in the first place!\n\nWhat drives me up the wall even more though is the insistence of other people around me telling me “just ChatGPT it bro”. If I’m trying to write a tough professional email or message to someone I’d have my dad who works in sales help me out and give me ideas. Now I try to get his help and he’s like, “just ask ChatGPT to draft some up for you”. I don’t ***want*** to ask Chat to do it for me. I ***want*** to learn and figure it out for myself so I know how to better do it in the future.\n\nPlus, all the very few times I actually tried to have AI draft some written thing up for me it’s made so many mistakes and when I tell the people giving that advice to me they tell me, “well you just always have to proofread it and fix any mistakes it made. It’s a tool not a psychic”. That’s not how tools work though? A tool is a second hand that aids in you performing correctly on a task. It’s not supposed to make your task performance worse. That’s like saying you should use a shitty hammer to bang in a nail, and then use you’re bare fists to finish the job and fix the shitty hammer’s mistakes.",

This matters most where existing pollution levels were already high (nitrate pollution from agriculture is a pretty serious problem for many states).\n\nAnother thing to consider is that many water sources are reliant on pulling from aquifers, which many states are already drawing more out than is being naturally replaced. Additional water draws don't help that, even if the water usage is within legal limits.\n\nIt's still net bad. But I agree that the power issue is the more immediate and pressing issue.",

It absolutely can do things for *individuals* in workplaces, but the trouble is applying AI at large, \"introduce AI into our entire workflow\" type stuff. That's what a lot of CEOs expect, but without putting in any effort or investment to enable that.\n\nAnd even for the individual, using AI to help automate or speed-up one part of your job isn't some game-changing, insanely beneficial, high-return move that AI is expected to be. It just means you can do something marginally faster than you did before. You still have to do all the OTHER stuff that AI can't do, so it's super odd how many C-suite folks seem to be seduced by this as some massive productivity enhancer.\n\nThey want to implement AI, but they don't tell people how they want it to be used, and they won't(or can't) implement it at scale into full workflows across their business. So what do they expect? Nobody handed people Outlook and said \"There you go! Email! Now go be ultra productive!\". You had to change your business to operate around it over time, with significant investment into on-premises servers and staff and networking to support it. This is rarely done with AI as CEOs just want an \"out of the box\" solution, but have no idea *how* AI is supposed to fit into their business. Very few businesses are going to hire AI devs and technical experts to create in-house LLMs that are tailored for their workspace and sensitivity of company data.",

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the forced removal and incarceration of over 110,000 to 120,000 people of Japanese descent—two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens—from the West Coast into inland, guarded detention camps during World War II, driven by wartime panic and false claims of military necessity. \nKey Details of Executive Order 9066:\nPurpose: The order empowered the Secretary of War and military commanders to designate \"military areas\" and exclude any person from them.\nTarget: Although it did not name specific groups, it was used specifically to target Japanese aliens and American citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast.\nImpact: Over 120,000 people were forced to leave their homes, businesses, and lives, spending up to three years in relocation centers.\nDuration & Rescission: The order remained in effect for the duration of the war and was formally rescinded by President Gerald Ford on February 19, 1976.\nLegal & Historical Context: While challenged in court (e.g., Korematsu v. United States), the Supreme Court originally upheld the detention as a \"military necessity\". In the 1980s, these convictions were overturned, and the government apologized, admitting the actions were based on racial prejudice rather than evidence of treason. \n\nSame same but different meme***",

Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.”",

Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Brooks. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or buy less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to nonprofits fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect.

No doubt this was quid pro quo for Musk after he put up nearly 300 million dollars to help Trump win the election. In Trump’s mind, this was probably a small favor since he knew plans were already laid out for establishing a dictatorship. I feel kind of silly for saying things that seem a bit too obvious. Musk stole our nation’s sensitive info and secrets and he is connected with people like Putin. So.. that’s basically where we’re at right now. Please correct me if I’m wrong about something.",

I only know this because I've been doing a piece of work recently that researches into this.\n\nMisinformation generally isn't just considers to be \"getting it wrong\" because you can deliberately choose to spread misinformation. The difference is that you don't really have an agenda to influence you  with misinformation. Disinformation has an agenda though.\n\nFor example, I generate an AI video of a group deer running through an American town and share it online with the caption \"Woah, nature meets our little town!\". I'm only really doing this to try and go viral. This is misinformation.\n\nDisinformation would be if I generate the same video and claim the deer are in town because President Trump has authorised ten times more logging than any other President and it's driving animals into towns. That's disinformation.\n\nSo the OP is right this example is likely disinformation because it's being spread with an agenda to influence. However, I can see why you'd label it misinformation to prevent an argument \"I'm not saying you're lying on purpose, it's clearly a confusing and stressful moment, I'm saying you just got it wrong\" etc",

Disinformation seems far more serious than just lies, it casts a wider net over many conspirators, while lying is something that any one of us could easily do on the most minuscule to the grandest levels. \n\nI also imagine that you can lie without knowing everything, if you’re asked a question you know nothing about you can just make almost anything up on the spot even if it’s easily disproven later. Disinformation implies that you already had all the correct information, and what you knew for a fact was the truth, which gives you more leeway to craft a lie using small parts of what we know to be true in order to give it legitimacy. \n\nI’m not sure if this is shared amongst the general public, but that’s what it evokes for me. Lies just feels far too small to emphasize the fact that the entire government is rewriting reality with complete and absolute intention.",

If you're at all concerned about being made to use a Microsoft account that steals your encryption key, you *have* to start planning on leaving Windows.  If you keep putting it off, you can find yourself in a situation where the latest Windows update does something that crosses the line for you and you'll be stuck scrambling for a solution.\n\nEven if you don't plan on using Linux *today*, having it installed on a separate drive even if you don't use it right now means you have a plan B.  I recommend Bazzite as a very straightforward \"just works\" option, you don't really need to know much about Linux to get things working and it *really* will not let you muck it up in a way that can't be fixed with a reboot.  Install it on a second drive, and if Windows gets to be too much one day or you have time to kill you can play around with it and see what all you can accomplish.",

I actually much much prefer the windows management on Linux too.\n\nBut every time I launch a game on Steam I have terrible performance. Mind you my setup is outside the ‘norm’ and I run most of my games at 7,680 x 2,160. Under Windows I get great frame rates for pretty much all the games I care about on my 5080 but on Linux I get sometimes less than half the frame rates making it unplayable. Once that gets fixed I’m done with Windows. Just tried CachyOS this week with Octopath Traveler 0 and I would tank for no reasons while it’s super smooth on Windows.\n\nI want to switch so bad I’ve even considered putting the AMD rx590 from my NAS in my computer and passing the 5080 to a VM to run games that way, but I feel like that would push my power supply too much and heat up my case too",

An example being an app that knows if a PS2 formatted hard drive is connected, and is able to transfers files to it from the computer that otherwise cannot. Would wine be enough to do that? No idea, but I don't think it's likely.\n\nBoth of my other deciding factors have been tackled though. I stopped playing competitive multiplayer games, and I've now shifted career path from going to school for mechanical engineering to learning the electrician trade. Maybe i'll finally buckle down and learn how to code but that seems incredibly unlikely, so windows it is for the foreseeable future.

Thankfully Apple fought it in court and ultimately prevailed after the FBI managed to unlock the phone via a shady Israeli company's product (and after they failed to win public opinion).\n\nBut not all of Apple's systems or products are like that. For example, Apple can access data for iCloud accounts without ADP turned on. This is so they can recover accounts for customers who've forgotten their passwords. That's why there are warnings when you turn on ADP that if you forget your password and recovery key, your data is gone.\n\nBut it also means they can provide this data to law enforcement.

Those games that dont' work are *extremely* popular, of course, so that's cold comfort, but if you already don't play Battlefield 6 or Fortnite then the worst that'll heppen is that you'll have to look up what launch options you have to punch into Steam to get the game to work - annoying, but I think manageable for most PC gamers used to looking up workarounds for bugs in games.",

Market share? What the fuck do you think you're talking about?\n\n_Windows_ is a paid product, that supports a giant company with thousands of highly paid staff and shareholders. Microsoft certainly cares about user count.\n\n_Linux Mint_ is a community project, developed primarily by volunteers, given away for free. Which of the [three](https://www.linuxmint.com/teams.php) (3) staff members listed on their website do you think is head of marketing that will spearhead this new campaign? How much extra revenue do you think will be generated by pushing a $0 product to fund this endeavor? Are you currently seeing a lot of ads for Linux Mint? Do you expect to? I'm guessing not. The developers of a community Linux distribution are less like the executives at Microsoft and more like the moderators of a community subreddit.\n\nI see this kind of language all over the internet and I think it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what community developed Linux distributions even are. The truth is, almost universally among community distros, nobody actually involved in the project gives a shit about user numbers. If anything, a large userbase is a problem to be solved; since it still costs money to host repos, and forums, and all manner of infrastructure, each new user is a net negative monetary value to a distribution sustained by donations. If you've ever been to the community forums you should know that useless bitching about problems is readily met with snarky comments that you're entitled to a full refund of $0 and can just leave if you don't like it.\n\nThere won't be a Linux Mint \"marketing blitz\". There will be no campaign. Because they _can't_ make one, and even if they could, they _wouldn't_ because there's just no reason to care about user count. People evangelize Linux distros to their friends for the same reason they evangelize their favorite movies and books — it's why [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/6hur7u/do_you_recommend_windows_10_xpost_rtumblr/) has been a meme for years. People contribute to community distributions because they want the operating system _they_ use to improve, and to reflect their opinions and values about how it should function. A growing userbase is a side effect, not a goal.",

They don’t even get their updates from Microsoft, they have a security team that downloads the update, checks it out, and then pushes it out to their networks once it’s been deemed safe. They also get custom 0day patches, but those are largely handled by a unit in a special branch like USCYBERCOM so they don’t have to tell Microsoft about the bugs they want to hack other countries with. ",

          "text": "Did this not go without saying the *instant* they added the \"feature\" to store your encryption keys on OneDrive? If anyone but you has access to your keys then your encrypted data is not secure.\n\nIF you have a TPM chip AND you do not give MS your encryption keys AND you set a bitlocker pin (prevents the TPM to sending the key without the pin) AND Microsoft has not put any kind of backdoors into bitlocker, either \"just because\" or at the command of the NSA under threat of treason charges if they reveal it (if you're too young to know who Edward Snowden is Google him, this absolutely happens and all the time), if ***all*** of that then ***maybe*** bitlocker can actually be considered truly secure, even from a corrupt government?\n\nAlso let's not forget \n\nBut honestly this is just another reason to ditch Windows for Linux. There's never been a better time, with a handful of exceptions it's hard to even find modern games that don't run well on Linux either natively or via Proton.\n\nMy personal top 4 distro recommendations:\n\n* **Arch:** For giga-nerds who wanna get pretty good at Linux in the way Mozart was \"pretty good\" at playing a piano. Can be (*will* be) a PITA if you run into an issue that's beyond what you've learned how to do at that point but if you want the absolute most out of your hardware and want the highest level of assurance your computer isn't doing a damned thing you didn't explicitly tell it to short of designing your own PCB this is the distro for you. It's very well documented and there's a lot of community support, so you'll likely never be flying blind, but you'll always be flying with the assists turned off.\n* **Manjaro:** For middling nerds who want something that largely \"just works\" but still offers many of the benefits of Arch. It's Arch under the hood but with the creature comforts baked in instead of installed by you by hand one by one.\n* **Debian:** If you're somewhat techie and want to be able to customize and fiddle around with stuff, but mostly want your computer \"just works.\" Some will recommend other flavors of Debian, like Mint for example, but what I like about vanilla Debian is that it is unbelievably well documented and largely in a way that's a little more layman consumable than Arch's documentation. Chances are if you have a problem there is documentation on how to fix it or another user who's had the same problem and posted their fix.\n* **Ubuntu:** If you just wanna be off Windows and don't want to have to learn anything but a new GUI. You still can get under the hood and tinker if you want to, but you'll probably never need to. This is the Linux distro you put on your mom's computer if it is too old to still function well on Windows but she refuses to buy a new one.\n\n---\n\nEdit: just as an addendum to Arch; don't be intimidated. If you wanna try it out and esp. if you have a bit of Linux knowledge try it out. I'm in manglement (*executive* manglement, so even worse!), barely touch computers beyond sending emails anymore at work, but I daily drove Ubuntu for a few years a long while back, and have used it here and there on raspberry pi's for little projects. That was more than enough for me to figure out installing Arch to my tastes and having it reliably do what I want it to do. It is the PITA choice in many ways but if you think you wanna try it out try it out. Worst case you say \"Fuck this\" and pick another distro. I truly cannot recommend it if you don't want to learn at least the basic ins and outs of Linux. If you want something that just works with no need to fuck around with it it is *not* for you. But if you like learning stuff and tinkering with stuff and want that experience? You'll be fine.",

              "text": "The fucking short-sightedness of it is so absolutely pathetic. Any data harvested from Palantir operations in US allies will go right into US misinformation campaigns to support antidemocratic far-right movements. Which the US has explicitly announced it will do in its National Security Strategy and is run by an administration that is actively supported by Palantir.\n\n**EDIT:** Editing this post, in order to reply to the edit in the post below, because apparently that is a normal way of having a discussion. Just as an aside, a bot would likely be significantly more literate. For both the Gaza and Ukraine conflict, I used data from the OHCHR to have a comparable analysis with roughly equal methodology, from the same source:\n\nGaza: [https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026) (70,000 cumulative reported casualties)\n\nUkraine: [https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29\\_ENG\\_0.pdf](https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29_ENG_0.pdf) (50,000 cumulative civilian reported casualties)\n\nI'm willing to admit that the Ukraine figure is likely significantly higher, although then again so is the figure in Gaza. The war in Gaza remains a shorter conflict fought over a smaller territory with lower overall populations, with orders of magnitude smaller proportions of armed forces involved. The total figures of military casualties in the case of Ukraine is also significantly higher (2-3 million), even assuming the total number of civilian casualities is around 300.000. Even taking that lower estimate of military casualties (2m) and higher estimate of civilian casualties (300k) it would be about 15%, whereas the [estimated proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza can be as high as 83%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war), according to international scholars.\n\nPart of this is just the core mechanics of this war: Gaza is largely in an urban area, the War in Ukraine has been primarily fought in rural areas, with a meatgrinder doctrine employed by the Russian aggressor. But no international academics in conflict studies are actually claiming that the proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza are on the lower end for modern urban warfare. [Quite the contrary in fact.](https://www.972mag.com/israeli-intelligence-database-83-percent-civilians-militants/)\n\nUnder international law, deliberately withholding food and medical supplies from civilians in a war zone, and blocking foreign or NGO food deliveries as well, is a war crime. Specifically article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Rome Statutes of 1998. There are a range of other international humanitarian laws that can be applied to this as well (including additional protocols to the Geneva Convention), and it has formed [part of the mandate for the arrest warrants for Israeli government members](https://www.csis.org/analysis/starvation-crimes-and-international-law-new-era). Part of the inspiration for much of this international humanitarian law is Soviet Russia's Holodomor in Ukraine (I would recommend Anne Applebaum's Red Famine on this to anyone, also to get a broader idea for some of the historical origins of Ukrainian nationalism).\n\nLet's also be absolutely clear: in no way am I supporting Russia or sympathetic to Russia. One look in my post history will say enough. Unlike certain other people I'm also happy to be transparent about my post history, and don't hide past comments on my newly created profile. I'll give enough to grief to anyone who engages in apologetics for Russia, or tries to justify the Russian war as being provoked by NATO expansion. As a person of the left, I have had friendships broken over my support for (and personal involvement with) Ukraine, by people often upset that Ukraine receives military support and humanitarian aid, while Gaza is left to rot.\n\nBut **truth** matters. And pointing to Ukraine is not a justification for Israel's war of genocide on Palestine. The way you can tell it's a genocide (regardless of what u/AVolantScheme says) is because Israeli ministers such as Smotrich, Ben Gvir, and government coalition members in the Knesset have openly bragged about how it's a genocide and a war for extermination.",

                  "text": "It's literally being used in this article lmao\n\nTrying to call Israel defending itself against genocide as \"Violent US hegemony\" meanwhile Russia killed more Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol than Israel has killed total and Iran killed more civilians in the past 3 weeks due to the protests than Israel has in Gaza\n\nBe how the world is going\n\nEditing because the guy below me simply lies and because of how Reddit works the actual response disproving his blatant Pro-Russian lies gets no views:\n\nRussia killed \\~80k civilians in Mariupol, as reported by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. Kind of insane to argue that Israel is trying to eradicate Gaza yet to completely handwave away Russia's attempted eradication of Ukraine. 15k civilian deaths in Ukraine lmfaoooo. Civilian death toll is in the hundred thousands in Ukraine.\n\nIsrael has killed \\~70k, of which between 50%-66% have been civilians, the lowest ratio in urban conflict's history\n\nIsrael has has no been starving or indiscriminately bombing, as proven by the fact said above lowest civilian casualty ratio in urban conflict's history and the fact that yknow, multiple >SINGULAR< actual indiscriminate bombings the USA did killed more civilians during WW2 than Israel has killed total\n\nOn starvation, that a complete lie. According to the World Food Programme: [https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023) 951 MT feeds 488k people for a week. 951 x 4.5 (a month) x 4.3 (getting 488k to 2.1m) is 18401 metric tons of food per month, convert metric tons to tons to get 20283 tons\n\n. According to the UN's own numbers: [https://app.un2720.org/tracking](https://app.un2720.org/tracking) In the nearly 2 month period (From May 19th to July 31st) Gaza has been given \\~37000 tons of food, nearly enough for two months worth of supply. Call it not perfect, sure. (Ignoring the fact that Israel has no legal obligation to do this). Just ridiculous how the blood libel is. \"Intentionally starving people\". It also directly conflicts with what COGAT has stated the past few days. The UN site states only 222 trucks were offloaded into Gaza from July 19th to July 26th, COGAT has stated that over 600 trucks were dropped off in that period. And I trust COGAT over the group that has actively blood libeled Israel since the Holocaust was finished.\n\nBut okay, you don't like that, let's get into the daily stuff then. Just a simple browse of Twitter account ImShin shows Palestinians posting their lives. Oh. So from the source they have food and tons of it. Ok. But that's not enough. Ok. So let's go over the Hamas statistics: According to the Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza) 68 total starvation deaths before July 2025 according to the \"Gazan Health Ministry\" (who gain nothing from lying about how low said numbers are)\n\nOk, let's establish a baseline: Illinois. Illinois had 625 deaths from starvation/malnourishment in 2023. Illinois' population is \\~12.7m, Gaza's is roughly \\~2.1m divide 625 by 6, 104 divide 68 by 1.66 (18 months) 41. Illinois's starvation death rate is 2.5 times Gaza's. Illinois.\n\nNo other nation in the world has EVER been expected to feed their opposition, rebuild their enemies. Israel continues to do so despite the blatant genocidal policies and attitudes. of the Palestinians.\n\nSo anecdotally, statistically, and analogically. There is no evidence that Israel is starving Gaza.\n\nBut hey, if you think Israel is doing all this and is trying to \"eradicate Palestine\" while the Palestinians >DIG UP THEIR OWN WATER PIPES AND FIRE THEM AS ROCKETS AT ISRAEL< you may not be using fact based evidence.\n\nAlso forgot to include the tens of thousands Ukrainians abducted by Russia too. But hey. Pro-Palestinians'll do bloody anything to glaze Russia lmao",

I should be able to sue them for having used it in their training data.\n\nEvery person who posted their early stories to LiveJournal as a teenager would never have allowed a larger corporation to come along as use that data for training without some sort of compensation.  Not to mention LiveJournal probably had a bunch of terms and conditions for reading the site, and all content posted to LiveJournal was owned by LiveJournal and could not be used by any other entity.\n\nEvery musician who posted their music to MySpace and Bandcamp (who again have their own terms and conditions about use) would never have said \"oh yeah sure use that to train an AI band which sounds just like me.....I'll make all my money off live performances.\"  \n\nThey are scraping literally _everything_ they can from the internet to get as much data as possible.  Do you think they look for what license the data was published under?  Of course not.\n\n\"Stolen\" or \"Broke the terms and conditions\" whatever you want to call it.  When I **personally** do it to businesses, they take me to court for repirations (see any RIAA or MPAA case in the past two and half decades regarding torrents and illegal downloads).\n\nAnthropic at least purchased copies of books (which hopefully ended up paying royalties to the authors, but really how many of those books were purchased used or wholesale from libraries discontinuing editions, etc?), https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/, but even then the argument was \"they were having the AI read them just like a human would\".  I bet if you read the copyright at the beginning of most of those books and they don't explicitly license for training AI, and probably say \"for personal use only\" (which if you've ever noticed, all movies / TV programs say for personal use only, not for showing to groups, which again I would get sued for if I do that).\n\nAI should have been it's own, new, completely different license from regular human use.  But then \"oh no Country <X> doesn't follow US Intellectual Property Law\" so they will get ahead of us in AI design / training / modelling if we have to follow some new US law to obtain training data.\n\nFuck that.  Every piece of data used to train AIs was stolen if it wasn't in the public domain, which Disney and other companies keep pushing that further and further back.",

But if the industry norm is that your performance can be used to train an AI, which will replace you, that lifetime career turns into one single job, and then you're permanently out of the industry.

They were filming, something unplanned occurred, bedlam ensued, and a perfectly imperfect moment of pure human chaos was captured. And now we had a way that we could all share in it.\n\nI remember watching a documentary of the making of the show, and they had a segment where they aired a few of the reject videos. Why were they turned down? They had obviously staged some grand catastrophe and filmed it with the hope of gaining fleeting mainstream fame. And it was painfully obvious which ones were faked. There was no spontaneity. It just felt forced. They weren't captured moments, they were constructs, and the end result reeked of it. More recently I've seen people try to fake internet videos of things like \"jewellery store heist gone wrong\". They're infuriatingly unfunny, and they're pretty obvious to spot.\n\nNow, everyone is trying to create \"funny\" with AI, and it is failing miserably. AI can only force moments to happen. It doesn't capture that moment when our humanity blows up in our faces. It crafts it. And what it crafts will never be anywhere near as good.\n\nI'm watching these companies that have pumped trillions of dollars into AI circle the drain, and I'm not mad at it.",

Many Photos hope users aren't even aware they are using AI.\n* A fun video I watched a while back was where two programmers had AI's and had them play Geogesser. One had a general-purpose AI they had spent a lot of time training. The other took responses from his chat in real time and tried to determine the correct answer based on hundreds of human inputs. The result was a mixture of silly mistakes and groups of humans in the chat fighting over giving silly results or trying to win.

Once the era of technical slop recedes, we'll get a generation of new vision, in which the barriers to making art will fall back. I don't think actors are going to disappear: no matter how good the tools gets, humans are probably easier for creating the base data you'll manipulate using AI, as you can't create video in real time, so using actors generates the data you want faster. \n\nBut you won't need $10m to make a low budget film. You can take a couple people to a stage or shoot in a warehouse with simple drywall standups and fill-in props, and get exactly what you need. It's going to be interesting.",

It's going to be decades before we even have a glimpse at actual AI, and that's being generous. AI won't actually make an appearance until many of us are long gone. \n\nWhat we have now are nothing more than glorified data scrapers, and that's exactly what these companies pushing AI so hard are using it for. To scrape data from every possible metric related to every man, woman, and child alive today and those to come in the future. It's why we're seeing \"AI\" elements being forcefully shoved into products that simply don't need it. Why more and more products are being bundled together with apps. None of it is for our benefit. None of it improves the user's experience. It's all about swindling as much data as possible about each and every individual on the planet so it can be sold for a profit and then shoved back into our faces as ads.\n\nThe government should be sued. I'm so freaked out and paranoid to type anything online, go outside, run errands, or enjoy anything these days for fear of constantly being under surveillance, and it's absolutely affected my health negatively in multiple ways. So not only are they stealing my info to make a profit, but they're also destroying my mental and physical well-being. And I know I'm not the only one. Far from it. And yet, we're trained to believe that such things are perfectly acceptable and that we have zero power or say over any of it. \n\nIf a company wants to track my info, then they're going to give me 80% of the profit they make when they sell that info to data centers. And all companies should be forced to make dumb versions of every smart product they sell. Versions that have no internal elements that connect to any networks or any apps. Products that have zero tracking or use statistics. \"MAYBE\" some on-board basic diagnostics that \"WE,\" the people who own the product, can easily access to do our own troubleshooting. \n\nI used to think we were well on our way to the greatest timeline in history. Now I fear we're well into the worst timeline. And it's only going to get worse.",

Your voluntary neighborhood watch footage becomes part of something much bigger.\n\n>The partnership works through Ring’s existing [“Community Requests”](https://ring.com/support/articles/uds27/Community-request?srsltid=AfmBOopukxUzsJ6_KUL22s3P1pPPJ0BlMEzOxENQuwhFou6G-kpV6K9-) feature, where police ask users to voluntarily share footage. But once you click “yes” to help solve that package theft, your footage enters Flock’s ecosystem where federal access is built into the system’s structure.\n\nThis is an important distinction for current users: as described, this only affects video clips you choose to share on the Community Requests, your regular footage is not defacto shared with Community or put up for viewing by your local law enforcement agency or by extension, the flock expansion. Users who don't opt to share anything to Community shouldn't (at least, by current appearances) be concerned that everything that your camera sees is being shared to Flock/ICE. \n\nThat said, this is Amazon we're talking about, so stay vigilant with your privacy and watch the space for any further changes beyond this. If you're going to use a doorbell camera etc. be cognizant of how it may affect your privacy in your future - you know, don't do lines of coke or pimp hookers in front of the cloud enabled thing.",

A cults effect on the mind is to change the very way you see and understand truth itself. When these people, including their leader, look at this situation they simply do not see the same thing you see.\n\nThey use confirmation bias to later reinforce their warped view. “Well he had a gun. Why does he need that gun? Surely he planned to use it. Ergo, he is a terrorist.” This is obvious confirmation bias being used to reinforce and double down on a warped view of truth.\n\nIt is so important to me. I am in fact begging all of you to understand: this has gone beyond reason, beyond peaceful protest, beyond diplomacy. It is already too late and we are going to lose if something more significant is not done. You’re trying to reason with, and send messages to, an impotent government led by warped minds that are not seeing reality. They are indoctrinated.\n\nI have A LOT of experience with cults. I am not just baselessly saying this. I am making an informed and educated observation and desperately want everyone to pass this along before we completely lose the country. What government we have left that has any sense clearly doesn’t understand what we are dealing with. No amount of reason or pleading or intelligent speech is going to change anything.\n\nFor the love of god please get this through your heads before it’s too late.",

This is our reality. Google \"phone farms\" and \"bot farms\". READ the recent reports and research. Even corporate America and VCs are involved in the mass astroturfing of the web to drown out real citizens while fomenting violence and pushing anti-democratic narratives that benefit their own political and financial agendas.\n\n\nThis warfare is low cost. High impact. And very hard to detect and prevent. The result: we destroy ourselves from within or give up and tune out.\n\n\nThis is what is happening and we all need to wake up to it, and wake up quick. The only solution I see is taking to the streets for months and engaging in general economic strikes for months. Join the revolution or join the new axis of fascist regimes.

I do not even live in Denmark.\n\nI fully thought I was just living in my own filter bubble though, until I realized that even the 50- 60-somethings in my family have been leaning to the non-American product whenever feasible, and that even for them, who are not exactly people who spend time on Reddit, while it not being a full boycott, it is starting to look like the natural decision to try and avoid fuelling the American economy unnecessarily. If there is a non-American alternative to the same thing, they'll probably take it.\n\nWhat should worry America the most right now is the loss of public opinion and consensus around them. The speed at which the USA went from being glazed by everyone in the world and considered a trustworthy entity, to starting to be compared to Russia and China in perceived trustworthiness - sometimes even unfavourably - needs to be studied. And I mean, I don't think I can be surprised either: the entire world is on Ukraine's side, and now the White House is evidently allied to the Kremlin. On top of all that's happening, there is now a perceived association between the USA and not one, but two, countries which have been committing war crimes in attempts to conquer a territory. You start to lose the cool factor. And here's the thing: people don't like wars. People are afraid of wars, people like stability and prosperity. If you wanted to be liked, war mongering is not it.\n\nAs it turns out, if you keep reading on the news that Trump wants to impose sanctions on you and is now even threatening some member countries of the Union you are part of, you will not really feel safe with that entity having such an important role, and you will not want to be personally responsible in fuelling their economy.",

As long as the economy's semi-okay, politicians won't do anything, because they and the big businesses that fund their careers are unaffected by recessions in the long run.

The important part is doing something. Use your connections and/or strengths and the things you do on a regular basis, you can work activism into your daily schedule.",

You'll see a lot of propaganda crying out that it's pointless and it won't work.\n\nYou see it for strikes and unions. Then, you always see they get results. You see it for boycotts - it's so ingrained that even some of your friends will tell you it's pointless. Time and time again, companies cave and start listening to the complaint after a good boycott campaign.\n\nAt a minimum, boycotting damages the image of a company, and that in itself has a snowball effect.\n\nMost purchase decisions are done with an irrational component. When two products are comparable, people mostly tend to like with the company that they like the better: track record, brand identity, any cool ads they've seen that have stuck, etc. A brand that is under boycott will start to have this unpleasant aura around them. You won't order a Coca Cola when you're out with friends and some of them feel very strongly about Palestine. You will be more reluctant to order Coca Cola alone, too.\n\nBoycotting works, both because it tarnishes brand reputation, and because we are social animals who go with the herd and tend to want to get approval from the pack, involuntarily. Boycotting works great because it plays exactly on that aspect of humans.\n\nThis is why they want so desperately to make you give up. They don't want us to wake up and realize that we actually hold a huge amount of power. See all those banks, insurance companies, enterprise B2B companies? At the very end of the pipeline, there's us. There is B2C. The end goal is always controlling where we decide to put out money. If we stop putting in our money, the entire thing goes belly up. We are quite literally the weak link of the entire supply chain, and they don't want us to realize that we are the table on top of which the castle of cards was built.",

          "text": "Every technology investment follows the same basic principles. First you have a small group explore the technology and do some demonstrators. Then you measure how well it functioned and stack it up against comparable technology/products/processes. You look at things like learning curve, support in the community, commercial support, cost to train, cost to migrate, and all your normal ROI estimates. Then maybe you have some pilot users try out the tools in the real world and closely monitor the outcomes. Plan for an 18 month to 3 year transition (or longer because of holdouts, entrenched legacy tech stacks, prioritization, and leadership turnover). \n\nInstead everyone went with \"feels like 20%\" and assumed they'd be quickly into some gains because AI is so interactive and conversational. They're not treating it as infrastructure intensive, training intensive, or realizing there's still a learning curve and a time to proficiency to deal with. Meanwhile they're also laying off seasoned developers who are pointing out the flaws in the strategy and foregoing hiring on junior devs because the savings is just one more quarter away. \n\nThen there are the costs. Companies always have this bait and switch on costs. First you go free tier, get individuals using the product on their own. Maybe you have a low cost license, low enough that some hobbyists and professionals might buy in just to \"get a leg up\". Once they spread the gospel to their friends and companies you start demoing it and giving out some free licenses for evaluation purposes. Maybe you renew those licenses a few times to get teams hooked and further into the sunk cost side of things. They invest their time and when it comes down to the end of the evaluation they don't want to give up the last 6 months of work they've done and the production code they shipped (even though they weren't supposed to). Nor do they want to tell the other teams that were adopting on the side that they'll have to stop. \n\nSo now the product has a foothold and the contract negotiations start. Maybe the sales people go easy and it's a cheap license $20 bucks a month per dev, or 100-250k for the whole enterprise. Company leadership thinks it's a steal and worth the investment. Then after the contracts are signed the product gets slated for use in all the major parts of the company's product line. Once entrenched it will be hard and expensive to get rid of.\n\nIn the meantime the company who sold the product is BLEEDING cash because they're taking a loss in trade for higher adoption and a growing client list. The client list, even if those clients are only demoing the product, is what draws in investors and new clients. At some point though they have to start balancing the books. That means 1. Selling to a competitor 2. Increasing licensing costs. Regardless this often means big bumps to companies who are using the product after the initial contract ends and has to be renegotiated. Sometimes those bumps are massive, doubling or tripling the cost of use. Imagine if you had a floating license for 25 users spread across the company and the vendor does away with that option and starts charging by CPU/GPU use, number of requests, or volume of data, how many end-users your product interacts with, or any number of other metrics that turns a $100k license into a $1m+. Drop in the bucket for a large company maybe, but devastating to smaller companies. Plus it comes at a huge cost now if you want to switch to a comparable cheaper product because either you didn't abstract yourself enough from the service and/or you'll have to maintain contracts on two product lines for the duration of the migration process (not a simple, oh just flip this on and that off). \n\nThis is why some companies spend 5-10 years trying to get out from under old technology and some keep old technology around for decades because it's too big, too old, and too critical to swap. Plus telling the story to investors is hard without numbers to say how it will benefit the company to do such a swap. If you tell an investor \"we need to spend $2m to unwind from this stack that will now cost us $1m in licensing\" they say pay the licensing and save $1m now, they don't care about next year or even next quarter necessarily. They want their return now. If you tell them you won't make their targets this quarter with the new tech like they wanted then they'll trigger a sell off and you'll lose millions or billions in equity. \n\nThe result is you end up in shitty and expensive contracts you can't get out of or you do some calculus to do the hard thing to get onto something else. This often means cutting labor to hit quarterly targets. And you justify the labor cuts by talking up the benefits of the technology shifts you are taking on and how it will (eventually) improve productivity. \n\nWhen that doesn't happen you reorg.",

          "text": "Mini executives are not seeing any ROI on AI usage and integration because it’s also coupled with firing in getting rid of a lot of of employees and practices used to conduct business. They can’t even do a sensitivity analysis looking AI it’s efficiencies because there are so many more inefficiencies being brought to light and exemplified because of their trash hiring and firing systems that they employ. The way our economy works now is new hires make more than 10 year employees and then they get surprised when those 10 year employees finally leave and they’re just left with in adequate staff that cost a lot and it takes 4 to 5 people to do the job of that one person who just left. The American economy does not reward good workers skilled workers efficient workers. It just makes some random number the bar and punishes those who can’t meet that expectation. Everyone can’t be the most efficient worker. The bar should not be the most efficient worker that is unrealistic. Instead of doing any critical, thinking into how their labor forces are adapting to AI executive leadership are doing the same things being looking at some numbers that can give them indications on certain trends using that as an excuse to fire people or re-organize and then going from company to company doing the exact same thing while siphoning off a portion of the companies revenue as resources for them only. When companies do great employees don’t get rewarded. They get pizza parties, cupcake parties, and maybe the occasional day off but for executive employees they directly benefit monetarily when people who are not them work hard harder, more efficient meat numbers and do better every quarter. These people can’t even indicate where they would even see efficiencies from AI and yet statements like this or just thrown out there. Everything doesn’t need AI in AI won’t fix every problem, especially in the state now. Most programs are integrated with AI at most mini coding platforms are integrated with AI. It can help turn out solutions but most jobs mean work by most employees in America are not Microsoft or internet search based.  \nMost programs that employees used to do their work are either standalone applications or Internet applications that are not integrated with AI. This is another example of how leadership doesn’t even know what they’re talking about is some are going to make decisions to get rid of AI when in reality that’s not even the issue.",

I don't believe for one second that the data hadn't already transferred well before that. I also don't believe for one second that the data actually gets deleted even after the 30 days. But I DO believe that deleting it is still the better option. Stop feeding your data to these people where you can. Or at the very least look at it from the standpoint of \"he/they just spent x dollars buying the app for control and you can be a part of the numbers of people that immediately left and hopefully create a large hole in their pockets (probably not) but also are working towards making it harder for them to know every little thing about you",

          "text": "TLDR: this isn’t new. It still sucks and you should delete the app if you have it. \n\n\n“With the change in TikTok ownership, TikTok users in the U.S. are collectively freaking out over the company’s updated privacy policy after being alerted to the changes through an in-app message. The revised document details the U.S. joint venture’s conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are also posting to social media about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.”\nBut despite the panic, this disclosure isn’t new — and it doesn’t mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy before the ownership deal closed, and it’s primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California’s Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what “sensitive information” is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps’ policies.\n\nTo understand why users are concerned — and why the policy reads this way — it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.\nSpecifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users’ content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their “racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.”\nIt’s not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.”",

That I understand\n\nBUT\n\nThey only bought some of the company, and only get exclusive rights to Khaby's brand partnerships/endorsements etc. for 3 years - so it sounds like they paid 900Mil to just manage Khaby for a bit - but now Khaby is a controlling stakeholder in Rich Sparkle, so they gave this dude 450mil to... Let him have a say in his own company? It reads like they invested, but is being branded as a sale, so I'm confused. \n\nAlso, it seems they also purchased his likeness for AI \n\n>the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\n>Rich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\n>\n\nThat makes more sense. Khaby sold his likeness and a bit of his company so now he gets to sit back, still have SOME day, and not actually be in front of camera's unless he wants",

A $900 million valuation for a guy whose entire business model is reacting to other people’s videos in silence? We are officially living in the \"Vaporware Economy.\" \n\nIf you look at standard multiples, for a $900M price tag to make even a lick of sense, this \"company\" should be clearing $60M to $90M in annual net profit. That is roughly $7.5 million a month in pure, cold hard cash after everyone is paid. Does anyone honestly believe a shrugging reaction video, something people only watch while they’re literally sitting on the toilet scrolling, is generating that kind of recurring revenue? It’s not. He’s not a software company with 90% margins; he’s a human being with a shelf life, and that is the definition of a non-scalable asset.\n\nThe whole thing is a blatant grift orchestrated by management teams and consultants who are just looking to extract their 10% fee and vanish before the bubble pops. It’s a classic wealth transfer where VCs with too much cheap money in the system are playing \"Greater Fool Theory\" with a meme. But the real kicker, the part that actually makes me feel like I'm losing my mind, is how this move completely nukes his own brand. \n\nKhaby became a global icon because he was the \"anti-influencer.\" He was the silent, common-sense critique of the over-the-top, billionaire-grindset absurdity that defines social media. By selling out for a nearly billion-dollar valuation, he hasn’t just \"made it,\"(congratulations btw) he’s become the final boss of the exact nonsense he used to mock. He didn’t just sell a company; he sold the punchline, and in doing so, he made himself culturally irrelevant to the very people who put him there. \n\nWe are valuing \"attention extraction\" higher than actual utility, and when this inevitably collapses into the digital ether, everyone’s going to act surprised despite the fact that the math was screaming at us the whole time.",

Below is a summary with some more context.\n\n\"In January 2026, Khaby Lame executed a strategic reverse merger using Rich Sparkle Holdings, a tiny Hong Kong printing firm with only $6 million in revenue, as a Nasdaq-listed shell to take his brand public. By issuing 75 million shares to Lame, the company abandoned its original business to become a \"super commercial entity\" where Lame is the controlling owner, while the Chinese Three Sheep Group provides the operational engine. This structure allowed the Chinese operators to gain a backdoor into U.S. capital markets to export their \"industrialized\" e-commerce and AI digital twin models globally. Although the deal was initially valued much lower, the $1 billion valuation was only reached after the announcement, when speculative trading triggered a 250% stock surge. This pivot transforms Lame from a brand ambassador into the owner of a scalable retail empire built on his 360 million followers.\"",

I have to put my phone in airplane mode so I can bypass the t&c pop-up, to get to the menu part to delete my account. Turned off airplane mode and I tried three times last night because they send an authorization text to your phone in order to delete. I didn't get the texts until 3-4 hours later, and they're only valid for 5 minutes.\n\nEdit: For those who want to delete, it was much easier on desktop than in-app. The T&C banner is at the top and you can still get into your account to delete without accepting.

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:\n\nMany in the US have found it impossible to upload videos over the last day or so, which are sitting “under review” indefinitely. One video we uploaded from a US account last night has yet to go live, nearly 12 hours later, while a video uploaded from the UK is published — but it’s only visible to our editors who aren’t in the US. Similarly, accounts for pages like the BBC and *The Guardian* only show new uploads for those of us who live outside the US, while viewing the same account from the US shows only videos uploaded before Sunday morning.\n\nGiven the timing, many drew a link between TikTok’s issues, its US operation’s new Trump-friendly owners, and this weekend’s anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, exacerbated by the killing of a second local resident, Alex Pretti, by federal agents. The combination of publishing errors and previously political For You Pages that are suddenly filled with generic content has led many to assume the worst when their videos about ICE wouldn’t publish, but at the moment, the problems appear to be much more extensive.\n\nGift link: [https://www.theverge.com/news/867625/tiktok-down-weekend-broke-fyp-video-uploads-review?view\\_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImFZTWV3dHl3WFQiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY3NjI1L3Rpa3Rvay1kb3duLXdlZWtlbmQtYnJva2UtZnlwLXZpZGVvLXVwbG9hZHMtcmV2aWV3IiwiZXhwIjoxNzY5ODcwMDEzLCJpYXQiOjE3Njk0MzgwMTN9.Ch\\_QLN8pwyDChk4G1x6yn5cowpM1cwLLF3Qm\\_sWj53A&utm\\_medium=gift-link](https://www.theverge.com/news/867625/tiktok-down-weekend-broke-fyp-video-uploads-review?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImFZTWV3dHl3WFQiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY3NjI1L3Rpa3Rvay1kb3duLXdlZWtlbmQtYnJva2UtZnlwLXZpZGVvLXVwbG9hZHMtcmV2aWV3IiwiZXhwIjoxNzY5ODcwMDEzLCJpYXQiOjE3Njk0MzgwMTN9.Ch_QLN8pwyDChk4G1x6yn5cowpM1cwLLF3Qm_sWj53A&utm_medium=gift-link)",

          "text": "I'm gonna use this moment right now to explain how all these apps work. \n\nYour front facing facial scan and camera is capturing your emotions and you're engagement with what you watch. It mapped your face and knows when you feel sad, anger, happy, etc. It knows where you're looking on the screen and what you're engaging with the most. \n\nWhen you are not using your phone, the microphone is listening to you and when you open these apps again, it makes suggestions based off of casual conversation that you don't even remember. \n\nBecause of those two features, YouTube reels, Facebook reels, TikTok's, Instagram, even this app knows exactly what to put in your feed. \n\nIt's called a \"feed\" like what they put in pig troughs!  It's legitimately \"slop\" that is made just for you to \"consume\" it because it's easy to make. \n\nYou're being tricked that you are making your algorithm. when in fact, your algorithm is controlling your baseline emotions and making you. It's made and formatted to give you rushes of cheap dopamine to make the \"slop\" addictive. And without it, the lack of quick cheap dopamine is what's leaving you feeling withdrawal. \n\nand I can prove it.\n\nPut your phone down, and start talking about something you have never been interested in, something completely out of your character. \n\n\"I've been really interested in tennis lately\"\n\"when's the last time you watched horse racing?\"\n\"I don't think I love my significant other anymore\"\n\"my coworker was telling me about something called side shows\"\n\njust some examples \n\nTalk about some random subject for a min and then open your phone and start scrolling.\n\nEvery single time it will start showing you things that you have no interest in, but will start pumping you content and start soft launching ideas into your algorithm to get you pulled into those subjects even deeper. \n\nView time is money, they want you to keep scrolling. Everything you see a content creator show off is actually advertisement for a product. they sell you everything from food, diets, vacations, clothing and they wrap it in better words like aesthetic, lifestyle, travel. Everything is actually a commercial. If it wasn't for a content creators would any of you even know what a lalabubu is? \n\nPeople scroll on their phones, the same way as people light up cigarettes back to back. Think of every time you close an app to open another app to scroll different reels is the same as lighting a cigarette with the end of another cigarette. \n\n That should tell you how addictive it really is. \n\nThat's why when people are having relationship issues suddenly they're getting a bunch of relationship tiktoks. \n\nThat's why when you start feeling old or insecure about the way you look you start getting a bunch of skin care or fashion TikTok's.  \n\nThat's why you decide you're suddenly going to make a capsule kitchen and prep all of your ingredients.\n\nThat's why everybody was eating dubai chocolate bars.\n\nand you're probably thinking well that's not me. I'm smarter than that and I know all of this. Well congratulations you're on Reddit, which is currently dying with the rest of the Internet. But the other sides of the Internet are dead. Everyone's basically just sitting in front of a TV 24 hours a day watching commercials. \n\nNow think of the stupidest person you've ever met, realize there are people dumber than that and THEN realize there are more of them then there are of you. \n\nThis comment is not going to leave Reddit, if you tell people about what you're reading right now they're not going to believe you. even if the New York Times publishes a article on a study about this and they put it on the news. No one's going to believe you.  \n\nHow do you convince people that consuming an artificial substance with your eyes is just as bad as consuming an artificial substance like cigarettes with your lungs. That you're restricting neurological flow in your brain and creating shorter road maps that are making you dumber. That your thoughts are not your own, that you've been conditioned that all that counts=right is you have the top comment or the highest up vote. Because they made a voting system to give you an illusion of choice as a contingency to platform misinformation to keep you in the cycle.\n\nEven if you put it all the way out there in the simplest terms, lack of comprehension will keep them from ever understanding.",

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\nTikTok has suffered from extensive problems on its first weekend after completing a transaction that changed the ownership of its US arm. According to Downdetector, the issues initially spiked in the early hours of Sunday morning, but many users, including editors here at The Verge, are still reporting errors.\n\nOn Monday morning, TikTok USDS head of communications Jamie Favazza responded to our inquiries, pointing to a post on a newly-created X account for the US joint venture that said its current issues are the result of a data center power outage.\n\nTikTok USDS:\n\nSince yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.\n\nMany in the US have found it impossible to upload videos over the last day or so, which are sitting “under review” indefinitely. One video we uploaded from a US account last night has yet to go live, nearly 12 hours later, while a video uploaded from the UK is published — but it’s only visible to our editors who aren’t in the US. Similarly, accounts for pages like the BBC and The Guardian only show new uploads for those of us who live outside the US, while viewing the same account from the US shows only videos uploaded before Sunday morning.\n\nRelatedWhat TikTok’s new owners mean for your feed\nIssues that thousands of people have reported and we’ve been able to confirm include difficulty logging in, the inability to upload or publish videos, a For You Page algorithm that isn’t personalized, problems loading comments, as well as errors flashing for other features, and problems with the CapCut video editor.\n\nGiven the timing, many drew a link between TikTok’s issues, its US operation’s new Trump-friendly owners, and this weekend’s anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, exacerbated by the killing of a second local resident, Alex Pretti, by federal agents.",
