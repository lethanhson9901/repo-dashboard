The programming varies in tone and quality, but its breadth is vast: It’s viewed in more than 100 countries in 61 languages. The topics covered include human rights abuses in Iran, self-immolation in Tibet, human trafficking across Asia, and on-the-ground reporting in Egypt and Iraq.\n\n> The restriction of these broadcasts was due to the Smith-Mundt Act, a long-standing piece of legislation that has been amended numerous times over the years, perhaps most consequentially by Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. In the 1970s, Fulbright was no friend of VOA and Radio Free Europe, and moved to restrict them from domestic distribution, saying they \"should be given the opportunity to take their rightful place in the graveyard of Cold War relics.\" Fulbright’s amendment to Smith-Mundt was bolstered in 1985 by Nebraska Senator Edward Zorinsky, who argued that **such \"propaganda\" should be kept out of America as to distinguish the U.S. \"from the Soviet Union where domestic propaganda is a principal government activity.\"**\n\nThis is what then allowed [those guys](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) to also work domestically on US audiences;\n\n> Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media\n\n> Military's 'sock puppet' software creates fake online identities to spread pro-American propaganda\n\n> Centcom spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: \"The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.\"\n\n> He said none of the interventions would be in English, **as it would be unlawful to \"address US audiences\" with such technology**, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto.\n\nIt stopped being unlawful only 2 years later, since then [Eglin has been known as the most Reddit addicted city](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/z6unyl/in_2013_reddit_admins_did_an_oopsywhoopsy_and/), oopsy..",

There is no evidence that they are actually able to track lost dogs but the fact that they have the data and technology to possibly implement it and are willing to market the product shows their hand a bit too much.

Then they changed the laws so no one needed to babysit the van.  \n\nGame on.\n\nIf Canadians know to do one thing right, it's arson. After the locals torched a dozen vans, the government decided it needed to 'read the room' and it got rid of photo radar .\n\n2 decades later they did bring back some photo radar at traffic lights, but it has signage, it is in a fixed location and it seems to be set around 19kph over the limit. Waze and Google maps reminds me before I drive through them. It's a non issue. If you are doing 20 over through an intersection you deserve what you get. \n\nThe moral of the story?

I wouldn’t be surprised if cities were using those to watch the bigger ones. They wouldn’t be that good for identification, but they would be able to see when the camera went offline and which direction the people came from and left in and if they used cars, bikes, skateboards, etc… Obviously checking for what phones were in that area would be the first step. But, assuming you took all precautions, just knowing how many people of approximate height and my details about them would be used by other cameras. In some cities, you can’t walk or drive through without being picked up on dozens of cameras, so you need to avoid being spotted by any others than the one you disabled, especially if you’re carrying something in a bag or knapsack. \n\nA better idea would be for everyone to dress in identical clothing and masks with same shoe slightly higher than the other and be all over the city at the same time and then ditch the outfits out of sight of any cameras. At some point, we’ll all be screwed and only drones could take them out if they didn’t take the drone out first.",

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation. \n\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w34836",

Does the AI bias us towards bad structure/ideas?\n\nIt kinda goes back to when do you design something yourself vs rely on a library? Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware. It forces software developers to stop assuming every increasing hardware capability can makeup for sloppy and inefficient code -- forces us to actually go back and optimize things.",

I reorganized a few tasks to balance the workload but i'd need 10+ processes all done this way and enough transferrable tasks to consolidate before I could lose a person from it.

Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.\n\nLOL, I just LOVE that they make the connection to 1987 and folks wondering why the computer revolution hadn't happened yet.  We humans always expect change to be this dramatic thing, same as now with articles about AI replacing all jobs by the end of 2024.  LOL.  That's not how new technology rolls out.  It's slower and more gradual.\n\nAnd yes, in 1987, we weren't even in the infancy of computer age yet.  Same as we are today with LLMs.",

If he had 2 people and a computer could replace 40% of one, productivity wasn't improved by 40%, he fired one of them and made the other person pick up the slack.\n\nOn my team, it was 3 developers and me 60-40 product owner/developer.  Then I lost 2 developers, one to layoffs and the other to cover a different product.  So now I'm at 1 full-time developer, and me getting burned out to cover the slack, while getting less done overall.  On other teams, requests that used to take 3 weeks are now taking 6.\n\nThat is what AI is fueling, not a productivity boon, but a chance for the higher-ups to get paid more, while wondering why things are failing.",

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

The right consistently puts other people in serious physical danger. They are pro-pollution, pro-climate change, pro-gun deaths, anti-vaccination now, anti-medical research, anti-foreign aid, etc. DOGE has already killed hundreds of thousands and will end up killing millions of people in the long run.\n\nAnd this is the fault of ordinary, normal Republican voters. 77 million people saw Trump's disasterous first term, saw him lose a civil suit about rape, saw him convicted of dozens of felonies, saw his treasonous insurrection, and said, \"He's our guy.\" Now we have people being shot dead by masked secret police in the streets.\n\n  \nThis is right vs left, and the right are the bad guys (so are the communists too, but they don't have serious political power. Even AOC and Mandani actually have a lot of center left, market based reforms). I have nothing in common with the average Republican except that I'm unlucky enough to have to live near them.",

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term.

Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George Bush, Guiliani, Bernie, Harris, Desantis, Ramaswamy, Haley etc etc have all been on talk shows during campaigns. However, the 'case by case basis' nature of the exemption is a huge flaw and now being weaponized by this administration.",

Sometimes quite literally to the detriment of the outcomes they are meant to be pursuing. \n\nIn this case, it’s probably seen as much easier for the teachers to hand out work, grade work, track usage, etc. with very little thought to how it actually impacts a child’s ability to learn. \n\nI’ll give you a good example I just ran into. I had a home remodeling client that hired us to fix their inbound lead problem. After going through the whole process I identified that the system they were using for inbound leads was designed in such a way that it deterred customers from using it. We’d run ads, social media, you name it and find that people would hit this one particular page, but never actually complete the process. The problem stemmed from asking way too much of a potential lead, basically they wanted all the information needed to produce a quote. In theory this seemed fine, but in practice most people were overwhelmed or not knowledgeable enough to actually complete the lead form. \n\nSo I present these findings and their response was that it was a system designed by the person managing leads to be more convenient. She didn’t want to spend all the extra time interacting with potential customers to get the info needed to produce a quote. The real crazy part is that they never fixed the system and ended up needing to sell one of their commercial buildings to pay us and all the other people they hadn’t paid that year.",

PDFs are still expensive and through the same bullshit gatekeepers, the computers get damaged all the time because kids aren't being taught to be responsible with the stuff (or are too young to be expected to be), and upcoming generations are less computer literate so clearly it's not even helping there.\n\nSo once again something that imo had good potential behind it was ruined by scumbags who see education not as a social necessity but as yet another industry for pure profit with no concern for the actual quality of the education being provided.\n\nYou also of course then run into the issue of school funding in varying districts and the costs associated.",

The kids have ten times more books than I had when I was in peak graduate school. \n\nThey are rarely bored and when they are it doesn't last long. Kids need space to stretch their imagination and the engages all kinds of metacognitive skills. Outsourcing that to technology only makes sense if you're using this skills ELSEWHERE. But you don't want to raise children this way as they'll never develop them properly. \n\nI see more problems with motivation related to phone over usage than anything else in my practice. Across all ages. My main tips:\n\n\n1) use screen time, yes, you can circumvent it but it acts as a speed bump. Gives you time to reflect not just go into autopilot\n\n2) remove problematic apps (any social media that isn't connecting you to people IRL, Buh bye)\n\n3) delete short form video (TikTok and YouTube Shorts are the absolute worst)\n\n4) if you can't uninstall YouTube you can set shorts limits in the settings\n\n5) move apps around and hide them in folders if you don't want to uninstall. Again we're trying to slow you down to give you a chance to ask \"what do I really want/need right now?\"\n\n6) desaturate the color on your phone (go to accessibility options and turn on gray scale filter--don't go full B&W just dull the colors to the point where it feels bland but not garish)\n\n7) remove all mobile games from phone. These will never be more GENUINELY satisfying than a real video game. Just play on the switch/PC/PS etc. They're not designed for fun. You're not having actual fun. You're just experiencing boredom with delayed micro gratification. Once you see this is how mobile games work you can't unsee and they'll lose their luster very fast but only if you provide a higher quality alternative. It's like eating shitty strawberry candy for years and then eating a real strawberry for the first time in forever. \n\n8) if it's your kid you're worried about, walk them through it! Don't just lock things down and not explain it to them. They need to understand every human struggles with this including you and that there's a process for healthier behavior. \n",

I first heard that quote twenty years ago from a computer scientist at Stanford who was addressing a room full of colleagues—all highly educated, technically proficient, motivated experts who well understood the import of McLuhan’s warning and who probably thought about it often, as I have done, whenever they subsequently adopted some new labor-saving technology. Today, quite suddenly, billions of people have access to AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow conversations among professional educators who all report the same phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and in consequence learn nothing. We may end up with at least one generation of people who are like the Eloi in H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine, in that they are mental weaklings utterly dependent on technologies that they don’t understand and that they could never rebuild from scratch were they to break down. Earlier I spoke somewhat derisively of lapdogs. We might ask ourselves who is really the lapdog in a world full of powerful AIs.\n\n> To me this seems like a downside of AI that is easy to understand, easy to measure, with immediate effects, that could be counteracted tomorrow through simple interventions such as requiring students to take examinations in supervised classrooms, writing answers out by hand on blank paper. We know this is possible because it’s how all examinations used to be taken. No new technology is required, nothing stands in the way of implementation other than institutional inertia, and, I’m afraid, the unwillingness of parents to see their children seriously challenged. In the scenario I mentioned before, where humans become part of a stable but competitive ecosystem populated by intelligences of various kinds, one thing we humans must do is become fit competitors ourselves. And when the competition is in the realm of intelligence, that means preserving and advancing our own intelligence by holding at arms length seductive augmentations in order to avoid suffering the amputations that are their price.\n\n> Neal Stephenson – Remarks on AI from NZ\n\nWe must turn everything off from time to time and instead read, ponder, and memorize the ideas of those who came before us; especially those who came centuries, or even millennia, before us. \n\n> Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind.\n\n> Frank Herbert, The Orange Catholic Bible, *Dune*,",

Why are you filling your head with dune and Reddit when you should be memorizing the Iliad... Oh because remembering a whole book would give you zero benefit but learning lots of different books which you can reference back is much more useful? Huh. \n\nThe only advantage the illiterate have is they won't read the book 'this fantasy world is horrible for everyone' and start preaching the religion used to make that fantasy world horrible. \n\nThe only slightly less deranged colonialist guy that's part of a breeding program from powerful families who treat people as property kills billions upon billions of people then his incest descendent turns into a worm physically to kill even more people (via poverty not worn attacks) as a metaphor for how humanity hasn't evolved (the famous 'and much of you is still worm' from nietzsche, and yes Paul exists to criticize religion which is why jrr who was going the same' current time drama time displacement' thing but pushing a pro Christian ethos was so mad about it, hobbits are innocent people who win always because faith and magic while for Herbert those things are only used to destroy and control\n\nUsing the religion he very very explicitly created to cause social problems in his fantasy horror as a 'look at me I'm so clever to believe this also' is not a smart or sensible thing. \n\nAnd oh boy could we have a big chat about hg wells the time machine, I know you haven't read the story and certainly don't want to engage with hg wells actual beliefs about the topics involved (the racism, classism, etc he was sometimes against but also lived inside) but using it as 'this could happen' is like me warning the hungry hungry caterpillar could devour the planet if it keeps eating everything. The book is not a factual account of reality, had no concept of how evolution actually happens and is not intended to - like dune it's a social parable about the current situation in Europe (i.e. the inevitable colonial crawl to ww1,  and dune the post wars slide back towards colonialist ideology) \n\nPlease don't drag us back to being worms, or worse make us space worms - I don't want to be a laughing stock a thing of shame, I want to create something more then myself like all those people you mentioned actually did in their real lives, you know what plato was doing when matey was remembering every line of those books? He was devising the platonic forms, getting friendzoned and all the other stuff with his name on it today. \n\nYou seem to like human specialization carried to extremes and I'm not even going to tell you that it's evil child abuse, which it is, but if you want to live an aesthetic life then you can do that with AI, you can still dedicate your life to memorizing books, you can still sleep in the cold...\n\nThough your references all happen to be people who like eugenics / strict biological class division I'm going to assume that's just a coincidence but I will say that just like platon in Republic it's always the others who need to be treated like cattle and denied freedom because you don't want a simple life you want control - you see yourself as the quizat haderach rather then choosing to dwell in a cave, you want to control others and impose upon them horrors you avoid yourself.",

A scientist does not proclaim \"this is how the world *is*\" and expect their audience to trust unquestioningly; a scientist publishes their methodology, and ideally their data too, so that others can replicate their conclusions. The only place for absolutes is in the classroom, learning the foundational knowledge that's been well-tested-enough to be effectively true, and even there with the understanding that it's often a simplified/outdated model to help you build up to later lessons.\n\nBut the social media right's been taught to blanket-distrust science, while the social media left treats it as a religion that must not be questioned (not even in a quickly evolving area with conflicting statements and retractions everywhere. Once social media settles on a *particular* idea of truth, even scientists with different opinions are seen as secretly right-leaning and no-true-scotsmanned until they can be 'safely' ignored). Two suspiciously-opposite views, *almost* as if each group looks to the other and decides to be as different as possible. Neither properly scientific, as neither cares about the process by which things are found out, and both become utterly toxic when anyone doubts the group's deeply-held beliefs and wants to try replicating their methodology and data to see if that belief actually holds up. I'd reference examples that come to mind, but knowing this community, I already expect to get a negative score.

They do more reading at home and have more complex conversations in the home.  And they are better equipped to help children with their homework.  They also buy their kids more things, like books, making access easier.\n\nThey provide stability.  Like, moving house to house (apartment to apartment) less often.  Fewer school changes.  Steadier routines.  And often being in districts with more school funding.  And those school \"choices\" change who their peers are.  It sorta raises the bar to be around other kids whose parents fall in those same categories.\n\nAccess to healthcare and not being shorted on food really helps.  Making sure they have glasses, hearing checkups, ADHD evaluation and treatment, tutoring... that sort of stuff adds up.  I remember when we figured out that I needed glasses.  It changed my life.\n\nAnd even on the devices, there's stuff to say.  They have more money to control what the kids see and do.  Nanny software and the like.  They pay to have ad-free experiences.  Where lower income families get straight-up cheap dopamine internet experiences to a higher degree.\n\nI'm sure we could workshop this and come up with plenty more.

It used to be parents, if they needed a break for a few hours could shove their kid out the door and tell them to play outside. Then karens started calling to complain about those things. All it takes is one parent in your circle dealing with the hell of cps over letting their kids play unsupervised in their fenced in yard to aecond guess doing so yourself. \n\nYou need look no further than the multiple families who have gotten criminal charges  - not only the hell of cps but actual criminal charges- for letting their kid walk a mile to the store. One poor family is facing manslaughter charges because their kid got run over and killed in a crosswalk.  The driver that hit him, mind you, didnt even get a ticket.  \n\nThe further elimination of free third spaces, and free respite care in the form of family doesnt help. Parents dont have grandparents living nearby to go \"i need to clean the house, the kids want to 'help' but i really just need an hour of peace and quiet to get it done right\" like we used to - i remember a lot of hanging out with aunts and grandparents so my mom could get a break.  But at the same time, it was the 90s, and i was a laptop kid, because as a single mom who couldnt always find a sitter it was a way to keep me quiet when she had to go do something and had no choice but to bring me along ahe could park me in a corner with an old toshiba satellite her work had liquidated.  \n\nWhat free option do parents have now to get an hours peace and quiet from their kid so they can do grown up things like chores and scream into the void, and have a vent session about the ways parenting sucks out of earshot of the kids cause yeah, parenting sucks but you embrace the suck out of love for them and dont want them to get the wrong idea, you just need quiet.\n\n\nWe did this to ourselves",

          "text": "In 1950, 34.3% of Americans aged 25 and older were high school graduates, and 6.2% had a bachelor's.    \nBy 1970 it was ~55.2% high school and 11.0% bachelor's.   \n1980 it was ~68.6% high school and 17% bachelor's.   \n     \nIn 2020, 90.9% of Americans 25 or older had a high school diploma, and 37.5% had  bachelor's degree.\n   \nWithout any deeper analysis, we're the most educated we've ever been. \n   \nRealistically, we're in a weird place where the standards are simultaneously lower and higher than they've ever been.\n    \nIt used to be that a person could be barely literate, but still be able to provide for a family with one income.     \nNow, two college educated working adults can barely afford to make ends meet, let alone buy a house, raise 3 kids, or go on yearly vacations. \n   \nIn most of the 1900s, kids would just be held back if they couldn't do grade level coursework. Now we have \"no child left behind\", and kids get shuffled along despite not being able to read.  \n   \nBack in the 1920s, most physicists were unfamiliar with matrix math.  \nWhen Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics, his math was seen as strange (despite mathematicians already being familiar with matrices).\n   \nThese days, most high school students will have been exposed to more matrix math than the average theoretical physicist of 1920. \n   \nThe cutting edge stuff that earned PhDs and nobel prizes in 1900~1950 is now stuff that an undergraduate learns in upper division of a bachelor's degree.  \nEssentially every field of science is like that.  \n   \nA bachelor's of science covers a breadth of study that is almost unconscionable; it's truly problematic in that, because there's so much breadth that students no longer get depth into a subject, they never get the same grounding that older generations got when they could focus on a single theorem and develop intuition from first principles. Now, information is handed down from on high, and students are thrown into academic binge and purge cycles.   \nIn my entire time at University, we *never* really got through all the material in a course. Never. Not one single course did we ever hit a point where it was like \"that's all the material we had planned\", it was always \"that's as much as we could cram in, but we're 3 chapters behind; You'll just have to catch up in the next course.\"   \n   \nAnd the universities keep requiring so many units of general ed because of archaic pre 1900s ideals of what \"well rounded\" means, while simultaneously being too lazy to come up with meaningful courses that would cover culture and history in a way that would also supplement the understanding of mathematics, science, and technology.  \nSo every decade or two, the list of things a bachelor's of science degree needs to cover increases, but it still needs to be a \"4 year degree\".  \nFor my degree, Computer Engineering, the *average* graduation time was 5 years. The university standard was 180 units for a bachelor's, with a 216 unit \"cap\". I graduated with 278 units because they granted an \"exception\", but it was an exception that everyone with my degree gets, because it's literally not possible to do all the coursework in 216 units or less.  \n    \nThe whole education system is fucked, and seemingly no one with the power to change it, wants it changed.  \n   \nWhatever the problem is, tablets are just one small component of a bad system that's had problems for decades.  \nAcademia continues despite itself, through the sheer willpower of a handful of extremely dedicated people.",

They spend SO much time on a screen. \n\nThey CONSTANTLY want to simply \"look it up online\" via Google or AI to get an answer rather than sit there and think about it.\n\nReading isnt heavily emphasized both in school and at home. States emphasize teaching small paragraph excerpts to focus on testing skills rather than full novels/stories to focus on reading skills. Then, lets be honest, lots of parents dont have kids put down their tech and read. Even from early ages, kids simply arent reading enough at home. The average reading level in the US is around a 7th-8th grade level, including adults, and thats just embarrassing. \n\nState education systems push kids through due to funding issues.\n\nI teach high school (AP at that) and have so many kids who can barely read and write on grading level.

          "text": "I graduated high school in '99. I grew up with black boards and projectors that used transparencies. In the last couple years of high school we had white boards. We took notes with pen and paper, copying whatever was written on the board. We had four computers in the school that connected to the internet, by the time I graduated I could count on my hands the number of times I'd ever been online.   \n  \nI went to college during the great recession when my career imploded. Everything was different. There were smart boards. Lectures were generally given with powerpoint (more often than not just the slides that came with the teacher's edition of the text book). Everybody used laptops to take notes, I used a tablet. Homework was often the online crap directly from the texbook publisher that required an extra $60 for a key.  \n  \nHaving been on both sides of the technology divide I found that all the extra tech in the classroom hasn't added much benefit. The smart boards were pretty cool as was my tablet I used for taking notes. The ppx lectures were terrible. It's too easy to overload the slides with information or to rely on visuals which made effective note taking difficult. Too many teachers don't even bother creating their own lectures and just use the slides that came with their book. I'm far from a Luddite, I love tech and have worked in IT. We just need to stop trying to fix problems that don't exist. More tech isn't always the answer. There are great uses that can improve the learning experience but a lot of what we do now is just distracting and unnecessary.",

But there is another formation very similar to monopolies called oligopolies. An oligopoly is a \"small number of players in a market\" instead of a **mono**poly, which is just one player.\n\nHow we know if a market is an oligopoly or a healthy competitive market is based on how much power each individual player has. If a single player can completely warp a market, then the market is not a healthy competition, and it requires more players.\n\nBillionaires have so much power, enough to buy entire industries, just to shut them down if they feel like it. Their power is so disproportionate compared to the average Joe. We would never accept this in a healthy business market. But it's totally normal (for a lot of people) on a citizen level.\n\nAlmost all of our modern problems is due to the fact billionaires are treating countries like their playgrounds. Tax them until they're no longer billionaires would fix a fuckload of our problems, while also allowing our government to y'know, do things again. I'd much rather a government handle these things than billionaires for the simple fact, if a billionaire is evil, you can't do shit. If a government is evil, you can vote them out.\n\nIf a politician isn't talking about taxing billionaires, they're trying to \"go along to get along.\" When ANYONE can see how fucked up they are making the world.",

He stole the presidency. Exactly like he tried to do in 2020, just this time with the already compromised tabulator machines tuned more aggressively to guarantee it.\n\nDo not take my word for it, here's the actual data (and even though this video is now several months old and there is much more they've found, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as you might expect with criminals). Please see for yourself and if you trust the data (not simply conspiracy theory talk) share with anyone who still thinks \"America got it wrong\" or we need to get out and vote more.  We did, and Kamala would have won, decisively, had our votes actually been counted correctly. It's the compromised, privately owned tabulators (vote counting machines) that turned votes for Kamala into votes for Trump in all the swing states, after a certain threshold of votes were counted on each machine. These folks and other independent teams of analysts like them, are doing us a great service:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ru8SHK7idxs?feature=shared\nelectiontruthalliance.org\n\nAnd we've been on that road for a very long time which, unfortunately, is not surprising. This journalist research article, written just before Obama's 2nd term, dives into the long history of election fraud in the US and how, especially in the digital tabulation age, it has been setup to get us to the point where whomever has control of them can literally steal an election:\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/\n\nSo, whenever Maga or Republicans say they want to investigate Election Fraud (\"by the Dems\"), it's to accuse and look in the right, yet as we know, and as the data evidence demonstrates, their accusation is yet again projection.",

Sorry, not sorry, but if you're still relying heavily on ABC, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, etc. you are playing into their hands. Every single one of those is owned by someone who has the exact same class interests as Donald Trump, and as such, will not meaningfully challenge him at the cost of their own position in society. When push comes to shove, they *will* align themselves with him. There is no reason for a billionaire to own a news empire or a social media network that isn't to sanitize their own reputations, and to curry favor for themselves among the centers of power in the world. \n\nIf we REALLY want to deal them a blow, then we need to take our views to non-profit and ideally (because non-profits rely on donos which can be and almost always are from powerful, wealthy individuals who expect a return on that investment) journalist-owned media. The Associated Press is arguably the best \"major\" network, as it is not \"owned\" by any one group - but the controlling members are the major networks who ARE owned and controlled by billionaires. Better sources of news would be, like, 404 Media (tech), Aftermath (gaming), Drop Site News (politics), Hell Gate (New York news), ProPublica, etc. Where we can, we should be giving these sites your membership fees, views, clicks, web hits, etc. These are good journalists, usually a diaspora from some old mainstay website's \"restructuring\". They're not just randos who threw together a website, but real, dogged journalists with real work behind them and they can do BETTER work when they've got food in their bellies, a healthcare plan, a safe and secure place to live, etc. For we who have SOME means, that means it's up to us to not just use these sites, but kick over a little monthly dono as well.\n\nAs long as we depend and expect these news sources owned by people who are actively working against us, to work FOR us, we can continue to expect disappointment. They own these outlets and these platforms for a reason, and that reason is *specifically* to undermine our power and to divide us. Also, like, I know I mentioned the traditionally \"liberal\" news outlets and declined to mention Fox, Newsmax, OANN, but that's because... like, I expect conservatives a.) not to care and b.) generally to be willingly obsequious serfs on the modern digital feifs. They don't care that billionaires own these, because they're deliberate simps to power. I expect liberals, in theory, aren't.",

Just set aside a part of federal taxes for political campaigns, you get the amount based on the elected position and market you're in (it's cheaper to campaign in Alabama than California, or should be). \n\nTo quality you just need to get a certain amount of signatures to be on a ballot (again varying by position and states [a senator candidate from California would need more signatures of support than one from North Dakota]). \n\nNo need for ~~bribes~~ campaign contributions from multi billion dollar international conglomerate companies this way.",

I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years.

Pay me £3m and I'll build you a doomsday bunker and after it's built the maintenance fees will be £100,000 a year\" over the course of 10 years they are paying less for their doomsday bunker than the average British person is paying for their home insurance proportional their income.\n\nOn top of that, what else are you going to do with the money anyway? Make more money? You already have everything you already want. Sure there is competition with other billionaires but they also have doomsday bunkers which they talk about and show off.\n\nMost billionaires aren't wanting or even expecting armageddon, it's just having a bunker costs so little to them it doesn't make sense to not have one.\n\nThis insane level of wealth is one of the reasons they go relatively untaxed. They are so insanely wealthy people can't even begin to comprehend how much poorer than the they are.",

At least they do tend to step away and still young enough to want to do things with me if I offer. Husband's perspective is being home alone with kids and tasks to do, he uses the tools he has available, to get everyone through the day.\n\nI'm sure this is playing out in most families.

Unless it's something super egregariously positive, the news that gets reported/ things you remember are more often going to be negative things. \n\nThink about driving, walking, and human interactions throughout your day. You likely see hundreds, if not thousands of examples of positive interactions. People driving predictably so traffic flows, people moving over to let you walk past, someone holds the door for you politely. \n\nYet you generally don't remember that, you will remember the *one* driver that didn't move over to let you merge, the one walker that stopped and blocked your path, or the one person that didn't hold the door. \n\nThe news media gets more interaction out of negative and, doom and gloom, and ragebaiting than they do out of happiness and rainbows reporting. They do need to report **some** good things, otherwise if it's all negative thing their viewers will get burned out and not bother to view anymore, but the negative reporting is still the biggest main draw.",

Kuhl took a moment to issue a stark warning to anyone wearing AI glasses in the courtroom: stop recording with them and delete the footage, or face contempt.\n\nMany courts generally forbid recording during trials, though there are exceptions. However, while the judge did seem to be worried about recording in general, she also had another concern: the privacy of the jury.\n\n“If your glasses are recording, you must take them off,” the judge said, per the *Los Angeles Times*. “It is the order of this court that there must be no facial recognition of the jury. If you have done that, you must delete it. This is very serious.”\n\nCurrently, Meta’s AI glasses do not include the ability to identify the names of the people a wearer views through them, but that’s not likely what the judge meant in her concerns about “facial recognition.”\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91495248/meta-ai-glasses-court-judge-threatens-wearers-contempt-mark-zuckerberg-testimony)",

You could search a problem, land on a thread from 2009, and actually find an answer. Now everything gets shoved into Discord and basically disappears from the open internet.\n\nNone of it is indexable. You can’t just search and read. You have to join some random server, give them your email, download the app, then dig through a million channels hoping the garbage search finds anything useful. Half the time the answer is buried in some 3-year-old thread with broken context anyway.\n\nWe traded messy but accessible knowledge for locked rooms and scrollback hell. It’s awful for documentation, awful for troubleshooting, and great if you enjoy wasting time asking the same questions over and over because nothing is discoverable anymore.\n\nI get why communities like it, real time chat is easy, but as a knowledge base it’s complete trash.\n\nYeah, I hate it.

The only thing even slightly unique about Discord is the way it broke things out into searchable channels and topics.  \n  \nDiscord only really exists because it got momentum and maybe even a bit of brand loyalty from a group of people who have never really had to migrate between internet services before, so the whole thing just comes off as a bit amusing to people from the ICQ/AIM/mIRC era.",

For most of the world, privacy-abusing and pointless face verification isn't required by law, and a lot of people will not put up with it-- the question is how many people won't put up with it and whether it's justly fatal to the company.

My experience is that very few people are actually talking about where they are going to migrate to, which signals to me that most people are here to be outraged and not do anything about it. If people actually cared, these posts would have tons of people discussing where to migrate their social circles to.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dinosaur that remembers the days of having TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and Skype all installed to play with different friend groups. Discord has been awfully convenient for consolidating the different gamer groups, but for me, the time has come to move on and return to the days of having multiple platforms installed to keep in touch.

I basically had to throw a tantrum to get them to change their minds on it, and even then they didn't understand what was wrong with it. \n\nOh, no the best one at that company was they wanted to have show a QR code on the screen that contained the user's credentials, so if they scanned it on their phone, they would automatically be logged in.",

All it does is create an illusion of safe spaces for others across the site and put your personal information at risk of falling into the wrong hands. Imagine having your home address leaked. Imagine something you say is taken out of context and used as a premise to investigate or arrest you. Imagine Discord gets hacked (like they did 4 months ago) and your ID is stolen. Imagine somebody commits crimes while posing as you. It's all much easier to do when somebody else has all your info at their fingertips.",

                  "text": "Nearly every service in existence that has persistent chat history stores your messages you send in plain text. There are very few that instead store encrypted messages. Those that do are typically using E2EE. And the reason most services don't use E2EE is because it's incredibly inconvenient.\n\nUsers typically want to be able to do useful things like search through their past messages, which is something you cannot do if the messages are stored encrypted unless you load all of the messages onto your device to decrypt them before performing the search, which becomes a massive drain on both client and server resources as chat histories grow larger. Additionally, if the keys are lost, then depending on the implementation, you could end up losing access to the entirety of your message history. These are generally considered problematic by the majority of end users.\n\nE2EE sacrifices convenience for enhanced privacy and security. If you need that enhanced privacy and security, then you'll usually be happy with the trade-off of losing convenience, but most users don't need the enhanced privacy and security and would much rather have convenient functionality. Thus messages tend to be stored in plain text so as to facilitate that functionality (developer laziness notwithstanding).\n\nPasswords are a different matter entirely. Any service not run by an imbecile will neither store them encrypted nor store them in plain text, they're stored hashed. And this is fine because you don't need to know what the password is, you just need to know if the password someone gives you is the correct one, so scrambling the password in the exact same way and comparing the scrambled results is sufficient. Anyone storing passwords in plain text in 2026 needs to be executed.",

You’re just moving the same problems to a new service.\n\nStaut looks strong but it’s missing screen sharing and that’s a feature too many people utilize and undoubtedly, people are just going to go back to Discord when they want to screen share and can’t anymore. Because all the righteousness only works for the moment but if people experience inconvenience or feel they could do things on Discord they can’t do on Staut, then they are just going to go back to Discord when the fire fizzles out.\n\nFluxer is the closest thing to a feature complete transition from Discord and I think that’s the route we should go. It has stability issues for the moment and the dev is working to refactor their code but it’s open source in all the right ways, the dev is very responsive to requests from users and he recently just changed their Contributor License Agreement to be more open source friendly. It’s also based out of Sweden and adheres to GDPR and allows you to self host. It’s the culmination of all the best aspects of Discord without any of the bullshit. It’s only problem right now is it’s not quite ready for the big stage and needs more time in the oven but it’s blatantly the closest thing you’re going to get to an open source Discord and that’s really what you need if you want people to leave Discord and stay off Discord. \n\nIt’s not dissimilar to Signals success. It was enough likes What’sApp and had most of the features people actually used from WhatsApp so the transition was easy. If we are going to pick alternatives to Discord then Fluxer is probably the most analogous.\n\nFor the mainstream, you only really get one shot at migrating users to a new platform. If the alternative sucks or doesn’t have the features people use daily, then undoubtedly people are going to roll back over to Discord over time. Further, if it takes too long and you let this moment pass where people are up in arms and they slowly come to accept the reality, then the moment will be lost and most people you know will stay on Discord and that’s how Discord will get away with all of this. It’s like the Reddit API stuff all over again. People just got used to the new rules and moved on to being angry about something else. If the transition to a new platform is inconvenient, not feature complete and gives people a reason to stay on the old platform, then humans being creatures of comfort and convenience will learn to deal and stay on Discord. That’s just reality.",

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

Even if you just compare the cars, who all make more than 3 models, it's not good for Tesla, but then also throw in that they're not particularly good at doing car company things like QA, customer safety, or having a usable service dept. And that's completely forgetting that the antics of their CEO basically pissed off their target market and wouldn't drive a Tesla if someone gave it to them for free.",

It was explained in a way that basically suggested that the auto pilot computer is in “seeing” anything… It’s literally just using the cameras to compare the image to its training data.\n\nI have no idea if this is true, but if it is, it’s very concerning.",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

And they can afford these failures because they'll still have money left over even if some of them fail.\n\nTo add to that, they have networks of rich friends and family who do the same thing, so if they start a new business, they've got some investors available to instantly give them capital to get it started. So an idea tried on a whim — such as an online book store that could potentially expand to other products — can have instant success over the competition just because a bunch of rich buddies poured money into it and kept it running even when it wasn't turning a profit.\n\nSo there's no genius involved in wealth, nor anything clever at all. It's just the aristocracy keeping themselves in power through the only thing they have: too much money.",

I get that basically this demographic is the hardest for them to push back on, but there's no evidence that when you turn 14, 18 or any other age their incessant attempts to extract every ounce of your data to keep you there and sell ads stops. And what age verification is bringing is institutionalized, mandated, surveillance for everyone as companies count down the minutes until you become an adult that can be legally hacked. Your brain doesn't gain defenses with age. Just ask your parents. Their pursuit of young people is because that's where \"growth\" is. We're already captured. Not exempt.",

That's the extent of shaming that I'd do.\n\n\nYou're legally allowed to pollute your lungs, my and everyone else's lungs, and support big tobacco companies who literally are bane to society in everyway, but I am also legally allowed to show absolute disdain for that habit.\n\n\nNow if you have a problem with that - tough.",

The algorithm he created is horrible, he can be bought for political means, he has turned the app into literal trash compared to what it was. I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved. It has no originality no design and no practicality anymore, it's a mess.",

Someone on business tv said, that a known community bank gets 1000+ applications for some back office jobs that net 60k. The demand for (lower) middle class life outstrips the real job market 1:10 already. Organisations like [lisep.org](http://lisep.org) track this for ages, they call it \"underemployment\", that means you have the smart people but they are \"not needed\", so people give up, live in the basement or deliver food with their run of the mill MBA degree.

I'm a developer with 5 years of experience outperforming those with 10 and even 15 years on them who are refusing to use the tools they have available to them.  The code is passing their code reviews even when they fully know I'm not actually writing a line, because there isn't a single thing they can fault with it, much as they'd like to argue it.  And they're becoming resentful because I'm blowing past them in not only KPIs but in being able to take initiatives they wish they had time to tackle.\n\nMaybe as a whole I could see it all averaging out to being net zero.  Maybe.  There are loads of people who still completely fail to know how to use a search engine or text editor, so those same people flailing around with AI and getting nowhere wouldn't be a shock.

We are hearing the same things from other companies. Mid and senior developers are producing 5 to 10 times more output.\n\nAlso seeing early signs in other areas. BLS reported nonfarm business labor productivity +4.9%, with output up much more than hours worked.  \n\nThe Kansas City Fed also published some research on this recently that showed industries with higher AI adoption tend to have faster productivity growth and that productivity has moved further above its pre pandemic trends.\n\nI think what’s going to happen is more and more businesses, particularly small and medium size will start implementing Agentic AI. That is they will use these agents that hook into LLMs to either make the back office more productive or to eliminate workers. We are sort of in a transition period now.  Not full AI where all white collar work is eliminated. I actually don’t believe that will ever happen. You need true AGI that can think and reason. And set goals for itself, etc.\n\nBut we are going to end up with a scenario where these AI agents are doing lots of things both at businesses and for consumers. We will all have a smart agent on our devices that can do things for you. Schedule appointments. Move money around. Alert you that you need to reply to someone. In the end it means we are all more productive.\n\nYes it also means fewer entry level jobs most likely.

Most AI models atm suffer from being more expensive to run than the companies charge for, as there’s an industry-wide bet that consumers will become dependent on it before they increase the prices. Very likely, these features will be dead and buried within 1 year, if not less.\n\nIt’s worth it to use it yourself and see if it can actually save your workers any time. My personal recommendation would be to run a survey in your company to see where your users stand, and then target your efforts based on the results. If people are generally uninterested or even hostile to the idea, it won’t be worth it to train. If a significant proportion of your employees is already using it without the proper training, that is a liability for you and you should definitely train those that are interested in using them.\n",

Big tech absolutely needs this hype, because they are otherwise  creatively finished and they need this hype to maintain their growth stock status. They do this in spite that it is a serious threat to their profitability and even existence, something that is completely against the interest of their shareholders in the long run. Oracle is a great example, but if you look at what is happening to CAPEX of many other companies, bills are just starting to really flow in. And all the big data center providers (Coreweave etc) are laughably in debt and on the brink of collapse already.\n\nYeah, AI is extremely harmful in many ways, but the revolution and all that ridicilious threat of super intelligence speak is a sham spread by the very same people and companies who again are heavily invested in this scam. It is part of the story to push this shit absolutly everywhere and my bet is that they very well know that the music stops at some point, but they will be bailed out.",

Months for LLMs might as well be decades.\n\nWhen I show the latest coding demos of our latest frontier model to other devs at my company, they come in smiling and leave anxious. It’s to the point where we can point it at a code base, point it at work items, and describe how we want work to be done… and then the agents take over and do some really insane things. We pointed it at a well known internal code base for our cloud and within a few days it had done most of our work items. We gave it a few more days to make improvements elsewhere in the project “where it saw fit”, and it generated code and review requests that would have taken an architect and many months previously… basically it improved our async infra to move from polling to a callback trigger model, and it’s a huge performance boost. We all wanted something like that, but the code base is so huge, we knew it would take human engineers a year or more just to get a POC running in a safe way.\n\nThe AI did it in days and had everything behind feature flags, tests, fallbacks, etc.\n\nI think AI is moving from “that’s cool” territory to “that’s scary” territory. \n",

Limited investments in data centers, power, and whatever else.\n\nThat's what we're asking for so let's consider a world where that happened.\n\nAny number of other countries have absolutely no compunction to do that.

It's a gross, messy, unfair, unethical, deeply flawed world and the only way to survive is to try and be as ethical as we can and still compete. Slowing down isn't going to fix it, unfortunately. \n\nI don't see a strategy that includes deep regulation that allows us to not get destroyed by other nation states in the AI arms race if we take our foot off the gas.

Of course AI totally screwed it up and didn't even have a clue how gravity worked and got it totally backwards. Yes AI is going to kill lots of people who follow their stupid suggestions...\n\nYou said\nGravity doesn't help pull UP\n\nGemini said\nYou are absolutely right. I see the confusion—I flipped the physics in that last bit.\n\nLet's clear the air: Gravity pulls DOWN. * When mounted at the bottom: Gravity is fighting the spring. The spring has to be strong enough to pull the heavy seal UP into the housing against gravity.\n\nWhen mounted at the top (Upside Down): Gravity is now your friend. It is helping pull the seal DOWN into the housing.\n\nHere is why that actually makes your idea more viable:\nSince gravity is helping pull the seal back into the \"retracted\" position, the spring doesn't have to work as hard. You won't have to worry about the seal \"sagging\" out and catching on the frame as much as you would in a standard bottom-mount setup.\n\nThe mechanics check out:\n\nDoor Closes: The plunger hits the frame.\n\nInternal Linkage: The plunger pushes the internal bar, which overcomes the spring and gravity to push the seal UP into the header.\n\nDoor Opens: The plunger is released. The spring and gravity work together to pull the seal DOWN back into the housing.",

Companies actively push divisive content specifically because they found it increased engagement.\n\nEdit:\n\nFor anyone in the comment section who says “it’s the parents fault” - in what way is that ever a good excuse that explains how [an algorithm ended up showing 2,100 posts about self harm to a vulnerable individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Molly_Russell), regardless of their age?\n\nWe hold parents accountable for making sure their kids don't drink, but we also hold the booze store accountable for not selling to them because we know kids are going to try and buy some anyways.\n\nIf literal booze stores can take more accountability than social media platforms, then social media needs regulation.",

Young people need to be educated as to what is acceptable social protocol, especially when learning to date, and unfortunately so many of them deal with parental ineptitude with regard to socialization and learn from the internet how to relate. And it SHOWS.\n\nShe blocked the boy after I told her to but I worry. Some people think that liking someone else means you are entitled to them, and that kind of behaviour can turn obsessive quickly. Teaching the youth about respect, dignity and honour are crucial aspects to relating to one another that are just often obliterated in this current performative, selfish time.

They would always be like \"get on voice chat\" and we would be like \"no girls don't voice chat with you because youre all a bunch of dicks\" and rape and death threats would just come out like WTF\n\nI have always known that girls have a horrible experience in those games but this article kinda opened my eyes to what it really is like for a young person, its honestly heartbreaking",

My first response was kind of a \"Hey now I'm not *that* much older than any of you\" but then I found out it was because I had a deeper male cis hetero sounding voice and they had noticed that people were less likely to be abusive in voice to them after hearing my voice and less likely to continue if it was my voice telling them to knock it off. This was to the point where some of them wouldn't even join voice unless I was there. It kinda broke my heart to hear that.",

Changing my name to a boy's name made a HUGE difference to how much I enjoy the game and how much my teammates show me decency and respect. The only time I admit to being a girl is when other girl teammates do it first and I can see that they didn't receive any backlash for it. \n\nAnd the thing is, it doesn't matter if I'm playing good or bad. If my teammates think I'm a girl, about 30-50% of the time they will start harassing me for it. If I mute and ignore them, which is the usual advice in this situation, they often start cornering me, blocking me, throwing grenades at me, or even typing my location into the chat for the enemy to come find me. They will sabotage their own team just to harass some girl because she's better at them at the game. It's pathetic and sad. I often only play with girl teammates now, or a few respectful male friends who I've added along the way.",

Just like \"rock music\" or \"D&D\" or \"violent video games\" of past decades.\n\nKids want to communicate with each other and should be allowed to do so. It's a vital part of participation in modern society. Even the Australian \"ban\" excludes primarily-chat-based services like WhatsApp, Discord, Facebook Messenger (not sure how that's usable without a Facebook account?), etc. Since these support \"group chats\", \"channels\", image posts, etc. there's still _plenty_ of scope for posting objectionable content and inappropriate interaction between kids and adults. If anything, content on these platforms is less \"visible\" and _harder_ to properly regulate.\n\n\"Bans\" on particular platforms just push people to other, less regulated platforms, often those based in less-friendly countries with all the concerns over influence that that entails. There's already some evidence of an uptick in use of \"WeChat\" (Chinese social media platform, already significant in the Chinese-Australian community) in Australia since they \"banned\" kids from the better regulated \"Western\" platforms. [WeChat has its own history in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#2023_Australian_Indigenous_Voice_referendum), but it's proven politically difficult to regulate and it seems unlikely to be added to the \"ban\".\n\nThen, of course, there's the massive privacy and data protection issues that come from trying to implement such a \"ban\".",

And shouldn't go outside, because men who would harass them are out there. And shouldn't have anyone over, since even family members can harass or assault a young woman. They should all just be locked in their rooms with a slot to push meals through until they're 18, at which point sexual harassment becomes totally fine no big deal and it's totally cool and ok if they get harassed on the internet.",

Men who love their Moms and respect their Fathers.  Men who have a clear and clean sense of who they are without the blame game.  Men who look inside for solutions instead of blaming the outside.  And we need women to be valued and respected and to value and respect themselves.  And all of us need to learn to integrate our shadows so we may carry them with grace.

Taking anything mentioned in the story as fact can be incredibly misleading.  There's a strong likelihood it wasn't even written by a teenager but someone wanting to push their agenda.  At best you have to treat this as a fictional short story that conveys a message.  A topic charged like this is meant to provoke an emotional response in people and that message could be for a myriad of reasons both good and bad.  \n\nNow again, I'm not trying to discount the message in the story.. but I think it's important to at least realize that this essentially can be no different than targeted advertising.  It's ironic in a sense that the article itself about this specific danger of social media is most likely a product of social media, and now that auto-generated AI is the new kid on the block I think it's even more important to recognize the likelihood fictional material that you see on a day to day basis.\n\nOne of the best age old phrases is still relevant today.

(i'm sure you remember hearing about how embarrassing boyfriends are) so it cuts both ways.\n\nand here’s the bigger thing: social media isn’t a neutral town square. It’s an outrage machine. It feeds you the most emotionally activating garbage because anger = engagement = money. The worst 5% of people end up representing “all men” or “all women” because that’s what goes viral. The algorithm doesn’t show you normal teenage boys quietly doing homework. It shows you the loudest idiot calling girls “foids.”\n\nThe danger isn’t just misogyny or misandry. It’s the manufactured sense that the other sex is a hostile monolith. That’s what that 15-year-old is describing: she’s starting to resent boys as a category. And boys reacting to seeing women bash men as a category. That’s the same psychological damage pattern, just mirrored.\n\nThe internet flattens nuance and amplifies extremes. If you live inside that feed, it warps your perception of reality. most people are just normal, flawed human beings trying their best in this imperfect world. the internet doesn't show that\n\nthe best solution here is for people to just stop using these social media sites and yes, touch grass more. interacting with people in real life will show that most of them aren't like this\n\nalso, not to sound like a dick, but if you post photos of yourself on the internet, yeah people are going to comment on it and often say not nice things. that's why i don't share personal things about myself on the internet.\n\nif you don't like how the machine works, stop feeding it",

The cloud either already sells or will soon sell solutions for everything like gaming, office work, corporate projects, data storage, software development, image and video editing, etc.\n\nModern computers are grossly overpowered.  All of our computers sit closer to being turned off than on when they're actively being used.  I have 50 chrome tabs open, a web video stream playing, a game running I'm tabbed out of running in the background, and a video editor open and my cpu usage *sometimes* hits 25%.  You might value a computer build at 2000$, but only spend 30 minutes a day using more than 10% of what it's capable of.  A cloud service provider can use almost all of that processing power, 24 hours a day.  They can sell that same machine as a subscription to 20 or even 50 people each for 20$/month.  At the price you're willing to pay a cloud service provider can have their investments get paid back in months.  Cloud SAAS companies are willing to accept much higher hardware prices because even with those higher costs, they still get paid off practically instantly.",

Security is often addressed reactively, minimized to compliance requirements, or handled after a security incident.\n\nEven when software security engineers are on a team/org, their impact depends heavily on the org's structure. If they are in an advisory role, they are limited in their enforcement, and any improvements may be filtered through their ability or lack of ability to influence. They don't always have direct ownership, and if they aren't good at influencing people, their contributions are diminished or only compliance/policy driven.\n\nThere are good orgs out there; it's just not most orgs. Not even the big ones that make a lot of money.\n\nSo, none of this surprises me. AI Coding LLMs are just a path of least resistance, and if an engineer didn't apply security principles before, they sure as hell won't now. The difference is that now they can mindlessly do it.",

Rolling out messy, inefficient and insecure code to thousands, or millions, of users is just a recipe for disaster. Looking at comparisons, keep in mind I am an electronics/radar technician, by actual programmers between AI code and human written stuff. It seems like the AI code is always massively fat in comparison. It runs worse, and seems to be far less stable.\n\nBut it's fast. Especially if you do no actual QC or bug testing. That seems to be what is happening. AI slop code is just being pushed live because it didn't immediately crash.\n\nYou can't fix, or improve something if you have no idea how it works. I can see the utility in having AI puke out a working base, but are you saving any time by fixing that mess rather than writing it yourself? I'd imagine not. Same issues I run into with my job. We have systems with aggressively poor documentation. If it fails it's a guessing game once you get through the basics.

Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component—accidentally or intentionally—that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.\nhttps://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/260",
