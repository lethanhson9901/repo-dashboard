The pretense of \"F-f-for the children!\" is paper thin at best. \n\nThis is just one of many steps into digital surveillance and gross overreach that are going to be taken in the near future as the Technocrats and Governments around the world realize how much they can get from us. \n\nPrivacy is vanishing before our very eyes.\n\nGod, I hate to sound like a tinfoil-hatter but it's becoming impossible to ignore just how much we're being surveilled in our daily lives. \n\nThere is no space that they will not try to take.\n\nEven if I were to pretend they were sincere about PROTECT THE KIDS it still isn't the job of the Government or any Corporation to do so. That's what their parents are for. \n\nIt isn't anyone else's fault that Deborah threw an iPad at her 9 year old to shut them up. That's her failure and her responsibility.\n\nEDIT: This blew up and my notifications are a circus of bad faith morons making some Olympic leaps so here's a few little clarifiers for you.\n\n-Sit your asses down and have a thorough conversation (or several) with your kids/teens about online safety. My parents did this with my brother and I and they didn't even grow up in the internet age. You can do it. You know more than your parents did, and have access to more tools than they had, too. Teach your kids about boundaries and how to set them. When and how to walk away. How to identify and report inappropriate content, and how to Block people. Teach them about identifying information and stress the importance of never ever sharing it. Stranger danger. Let them ask questions and make sure they know that they can and should come to you if something feels off.\n\n-Just don't put them onto the unrestricted internet. Little Jacob doesn't need an iPad. If you must put a screen in front of him, make it something safe like a goddamn Nintendo. \n\n-I am not American but I see what's happening there and understand that the rise of Fascism and this increasing demand for surveillance are not coincidental. The role of Discord in Nepal's recent revolution should be something to consider in the conversation about Discord wanting your ID.\n\n-For the love of God, no, I am not a Pedo Defender. Just a gal who doesn't feel the need to fork over every last piece of identifying information she has to faceless corporations and whoever they want to forward it to. Or, you know, occurrences like the data breach Discord Dearest suffered in October. I can remember that far back and so can you! \n\n-If I refuse to submit my ID, my account gets labeled as a Teen Account. I'm 30something. That doesn't protect kids.\n\n-The Government and Corporations don't give a damn about you or your kids. \"Protect the Children!!\" And \"THIS IS TO FIGHT TERRORISM!!\" are smokescreens used to sneak other, more sinister agendas under your nose. God fucking dammit I sound like a Hatter again.\n\n-The Trojan Horse looked like a Pretty Pretty Horsie. It was more than that. Go read about it and then do some thinking, ok?",

Then we got Nitro, features nobody asked for, updates pushed faster than the QA team could work, pressure from governments to regulate things and give their spies backdoors into the platform, and just gradual enshitification.\n\nThe only way we can move on from Discord is to go back to self hosting small web forums and wait for Discord to die and another platform to take its place.",

Requiring users to submit even more sensitive personal data under these circumstances is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates a serious lack of awareness of the trust you have already damaged.\n\nBefore demanding additional identification from users, your organization should first explain—clearly and transparently—how such a breach was allowed to occur, what accountability measures were taken, and why users should believe their data will be handled safely this time. At present, there is no credible justification for asking users to assume even greater risk.\n\nTrust is not restored by collecting more data. It is restored by demonstrating competence, accountability, and respect for user security. Until those standards are met, this policy change feels less like a security measure and more like a liability transfer from your organization onto your users.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this requirement or, at minimum, provide a secure alternative that does not involve submitting highly sensitive identification documents.\n\nThis policy, as it stands, is unacceptable.\"",

We do not use any age restricted features at all and will be fine with 'teen mode.' \n\nhonestly it is kind of pathetic from the global software industry.

          "text": "Let me tell you all a little Discord story. Back in 2017 I was attending Blizzcon as I had for many years. One thing about Blizzcon people don't realize is how many epic after parties there are in the area. Heat Ultra Lounge is one of the closest nightclubs and usually has a party hosted by one group or another. Usually a private party where the host is a Blizzcon regular or a PC vendor running promotions (for example in 2015 the party was sponsored by Predator). It's known for being one of the best after parties of the con.\n\nSo in 2017 when I was attending Blizzcon with a friend who had never been before, I wanted to make sure she got the chance to go to this party. But this particular year in typical corporate fashion, Discord rented out the entire venue so they could control who got in. Fortunately I have a friend who's married to a pro gamer and the pro gamers were all given VIP passes. Since they had the VIP passes they didn't need their regular tickets and offered to give them to me and my friend which we gladly accepted.\n\nBut when we got to the door, Discord (not Heat's own bouncers) turned us away. The reason? Our names weren't on the tickets. I asked why that mattered, I could have the ticket owners come vouch and the club would still check our IDs anyway. Still they argued and refused. So I reached out to Mallory Loar, the head of Discords events who I had previously been in contact with. But now when we had a problem, suddenly crickets. We never got in.\n\nNow at the end of the day, it's just a party, not a big deal. But it's more the principal of the thing - that a big company can come and just reserve a venue that usually hosts fan-run or sponsored parties, then decide themselves who has access to a Blizzcon tradition. And adding bureaucratic rules that make no sense with an unresponsive support team.\n\nIt showed me just how corporate Discord had become. I've long since been done with them.",

It's just asking for a giant identity theft scandal. This isn't to protect children at all.\n\n  \nAddon: I grew up on the internet when I was 11 years old in the 90s. It's not hard to protect yourself. Just stop giving out your age, sex and location, stop posting photos of yourself. Stop joining VCs with your high pitch squealing and, worse case, parents need to actually learn what being an adult is and PARENT. Remove their internet access. Period.",

Have fun.\n3.\t⁠⁠Go to r/homeassistant and learn about how you can replace ring with a private alternative hosted on your own home assistant server. No subscription fees and very affordable! You can even install home assistant for free on an old computer - completely local and doesn’t even need to be connected to the internet.\n4.\t⁠⁠Delete your ring account.\n\n**Do NOT passively support ICE or the US federal government subjugating your neighbours and community, do NOT allow them the ease of access to a turnkey nationwide surveillance system to further enable a police state.**\n\nEdit: For the knuckledragging cavemen below *“Wah it’s toooo hard”.* No… it’s really not. If you want dead simple, there’s options for the average tech-fearing Luddite. Doesn’t involve the black magic of Linux or satanic prayer.\n\nHome Assistant Green works out of the box: https://www.home-assistant.io/green/\n\nPre-built and ready to go, just set up wifi and basic setup. You can also build your own home server or use an old PC (almost anything can run HA!) and install HA for free. This is a starting point for full local control of your smarthome ecosystem. Highly configurable - but you dont need to if you want to keep it basic.\n\nThen paired with the Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 (there’s several other great options too!) - allows local storage on-device and connects to HA, but you can upload to a local NAS storage with HomeAssistant. Aqara is very easy to setup and get working with HA - just plug-and-play.",

I downloaded the app, made an account and used it for a while, but eventually stopped looking at it because I don’t really need to see videos of my driveway.  \nFast forward to this ad, which made me want to be sure I’ve disconnected the camera from the Internet. I downloaded the app and tried to log in. Even though I had my password, it insisted on sending a code via email. But then the email said I was using a different device so I would have to “verify”\nMy account. Keep in mind I already have a password and the ability to receive a code through my verified email.\nTurns out the only ways I can get into the account now are to give them a copy of my government ID, or let them do a biometrical scan of my face.\nI’m considering just ripping the camera down.",

We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on.

At that point you just have your account with \"the\" big central authority, except with way lesser functionality vs competitors.  You can do E2EE but I think more people care about functional screen sharing, which pretty much no Matrix client really has compared to Discord.\n\nJust to give you an idea, joining a room of 2k+ people can take well over a minute because of how the protocol works.

              "text": "They 100% are, and have been being used to track and search for people, there is zero doubt about that. While the government can't surveil directly without justification (that gets slimmer every year), *private companies* have much more relaxed restrictions with their own products. Then all of the data they collect, including video, facial recognition, audio, etc, just just winds up sold to anyone who can afford to buy it. The US government is just another customer, bypassing regulation (including the Constitution) by purchasing access to the surveillance data from private companies or brokers. \n\nThis is not a new thing or a future concern, it is already happening even if a big chunk of the public was only recently made aware of it.\n\nOne of the more egregious offenses in this field is with Flock Safety. They have close to 1 million AI cameras already set up around the US to identify and track *all* passing vehicles. They identify the license plate, make/model, color bumper stickers, dents/damage, etc. creating a digital profile of your vehicle that will be referenced every time you pass any of their cameras and cataloging the location and time data. This data is then sold to law enforcement who are able to use it for dragnet surveillance without a warrant. They can essentially search for whoever they want, whenever they want, for whatever reason they want or no reason at all. It has been for things like [a jealous police chief repeatedly spying on his ex-girlfriend](https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article291059560.html) \n\nor for [tracking down people who get abortions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down)\n\n or for [identifying and cataloging peaceful protesters and activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists).\n\n The \"customers\" then have the right to distribute and use this data as they see fit, with little to no privacy regulation applying yet. [Here is a map of reported cameras so far](https://deflock.org/map), though since they are individually reported only by a fraction of the population that sees the need to catalog them, there are likely more, and new ones being added every day. Flock makes a big PR stink about \"not working directly with the federal government\", but the way their data rights are structured they are easily able to get access through those they do work with. For instance, it is known that ICE and DHS have access to them, so likely every agency does if they want to. Not to mention they are [trivially easy to hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY).\n\nHere are a few resources to learn more, and have it explained better than I did:\n\nhttps://www.stopflock.com/\n\nhttps://eyesonflock.com/\n\n[ACLU on ICE usage](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-pushback), and [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup)\n\n[EFF investigation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis turned into a bot of a specific digression, but you get the point. It is already happening. Also consider how Palantir is fascillitating similar privacy violations. Amazon/Bezos has already been working closely with the federal government this administration, who have shown themselves to be particularly interested in bot AI and surveillance. There is basically no chance that these aren't already being used for tracking, or at least searching people. That is likely one of the primary objectives of setting it up this way to begin with. Lots of data to sell for the company, and civil rights workarounds for the government, a win-win.",

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.",

The operator is not actually controlling the steering.\n\n\nThe concern from the Senate hearing and the Techspot article is about outsourcing. Waymo's plan is for this outsourced role to eventually be reduced to almost nothing. It would be better to use Americans, but then they'll be laying off Americans later.\n\n\n\nFor people concerned about foreign drivers, a Philippines tourist is allowed to visit the US and drive here with their Philippines driver's license plus an international driver's permit, which is just bureaucratic paperwork. A trained Philippines operator should be able to choose maneuvering options that the car provides and executes.",

Holy hell man so offbase.\n\n\n\"Waymo vehicles are not directly remote-controlled or \"joysticked\" by human operators in real-time. Instead, they use a \"fleet response\" system where remote specialists provide high-level guidance or navigation, such as clearing obstacles or directing the car to take alternative routes, while the vehicle handles all driving, steering, and braking itself. \"\n\nKey details regarding Waymo's remote assistance include:\n\n - No Active Driving: Remote agents cannot directly take over, steer, or brake the car.\n\n - Contextual Assistance: When a vehicle encounters a confusing situation (e.g., road construction), it may stop and request help, and a remote human agent helps the system understand the scene to continue safely.\n\n - Safety Rationale: Waymo believes remote driving is unsafe due to potential wireless connection latency (lag).\n\n - Human Intervention: If the vehicle cannot resolve a situation, human roadside assistance is sent to the physical location\n\nWaymo Driver and Remote Assistance has been [third party verified by TÜV SÜD](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/independent-audits) as recently as Nov 2025 and [Automated Vehicle System Consortium](https://avsc.sae-itc.com/publication/avsc-04-2023)\n\nThey don't \"take over\". The car gets into a trouble spot where the safest choice is to stop. That can be remotely monitored and observe what is making them stop and only suggest things to do. This is a security measure and again if Tesla is doing remote driving they are even further behind than thought.\n\nYou can tell people that upvote this have never been in a Waymo. Lots of Tesla boy turfers that hide their history.\n\nWaymo remote assistance is clearly defined. There is CLEARLY a concerted turfing effort to pump remote controlling probably to try to cover for when people find out Tesla does that probably from the control car.\n\nThere is no other reason this type of info would be pumped. Just five minutes of research would tell you why remote control is a horrible idea.\n\nIf Tesla boys are pumping and turfing this \"claim\" on Waymo, Tesla has to be stuck in that mode. Name another reason why this would even come up? It is misinformation and a bad product choice.",

It knows to turn around and go a different route if the way is blocked or hazardous.\n\nBut in those edge cases where it can’t tell what to do*, these people “provide guidance”. They aren’t driving the cars, they look at the video and LiDAR feeds and explain to the AI model what it is seeing, and sometimes to suggest a route to pick. Then the existing decision system uses that additional info to make a decision and keep driving. The AI is still driving the cars.\n\nhttps://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\n\n*As an example, this week they published about handling extreme edge cases, like what the car should do if it encounters a tornado.

          "text": "This is actually pretty common in the \"AI\" industry and highlights something important: the gap between what companies market as autonomous AI and what's actually happening under the hood. Remote human operators handling edge cases or difficult scenarios isn't necessarily bad engineering—it's often the pragmatic solution when full autonomy isn't reliable enough yet. The issue is the lack of transparency about it.\n\nWhat's interesting is this mirrors the early days of a lot of automation. Even Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" has always had the disclaimer that it requires active supervision. The difference is Waymo marketed itself as truly driverless, so finding out there are remote operators (whether in the Philippines or anywhere else) feels like a bait-and-switch. That said, remote assistance for stuck vehicles is different from remote *driving*—if they're just helping with routing decisions or confirming it's safe to proceed in ambiguous situations, that's still way more autonomous than a human driving the whole time.\n\nThe Philippines angle also opens up the labor economics question. If we're outsourcing the \"human in the loop\" part of AI to lower-wage countries, we're essentially just offshoring the jobs rather than eliminating them. It's the mechanical turk problem all over again, except now it's dressed up in Silicon Valley marketing speak about revolutionary AI.",

Below are the steps that google provide when I searched how to set up voice channels in Steam. Hope this helps someone. \n\n\n1. Setting Up Voice Options\nBefore using voice chat, configure your microphone to ensure it works correctly: \nAccess Settings: Open the Steam client, click on Friends & Chat in the bottom right corner, and click the gear icon (Settings) at the top of your friends list.\nConfigure Microphone: Select the Voice tab.\nSelect Input/Output: Choose your microphone and headset/speakers from the dropdown menus.\nTest Microphone: Use the microphone test feature to ensure audio is detected.\nSet Transmission Type: Choose between Push-to-Talk (recommended to filter background noise) or Open Microphone.\nAdjust Threshold: Adjust the voice transmission threshold to filter out background noise. \n\n2. Starting a Voice Chat (Desktop)\nWith a Friend: Right-click a friend's name in your friends list and select Start Voice Chat. Alternatively, open a chat window and click the microphone icon in the top right corner.\nGroup Chat: Open a group chat window, then click the + icon or select the arrow next to the group name to create a voice channel.\nAnswering: When someone calls, a notification with a sound will appear, allowing you to answer or ignore the call. \n\n3. Using Voice Chat in Big Picture Mode\nGo to your friends list and select the friend you want to chat with.\nSelect the Start Voice Chat option. \n\n4. Troubleshooting\nIf the voice chat is not working:\nCheck Windows Settings: Ensure your microphone is enabled and set as the default device in Windows Sound settings.\nCheck Privacy Settings: Ensure Microphone access is allowed for apps like Steam in Windows Privacy settings.\nFirewall: Ensure your firewall is not blocking UDP traffic on ports 27014 through 27020.\nRestart Steam: Sometimes restarting the Steam client can resolve connection issues. \n\n5. Steam Deck\nUse the quick access menu (the \"...\" button).\nSelect the Friends icon (second from the top).\nSelect a friend and click the microphone/chat icon to start a call.",

I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

If you look at servings based on calorie needs available at realfood.gov it suggests 4-5 servings of protein per day if you are at the highest caloric intake of 3200 per day. 1 egg or 3oz of cooked meat is a serving. Grok suggests 3 eggs for breakfast, a 4th egg as a snack and more protein from lunch and dinner. The protein servings are lower for everyone else. It does suggest like 8 teaspoons of butter or olive oil per day to get your health fats in which is weird, but overall not egregious because it also notes that healthy fats exist within some foods already like avocados for example.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More here:\n\nAt Sunday’s Super Bowl, Ring advertised “Search Party,” a cute, horrifyingly dystopian feature nominally designed to turn all of the Ring cameras in a neighborhood into a dragnet that uses AI to look for a lost dog: “One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in the Super Bowl commercial. “Search Party from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs.” Onscreen, an AI-powered box forms around a missing dog: “Milo Match,” it says. “Since launch, more than a dog a day has been reunited with their family. Be a hero in your neighborhood with Search Party. Available to everyone for free right now.”\n\nIt does not take an imagination of any sort to envision this being tweaked to work against suspected criminals, undocumented immigrants, or others deemed ‘suspicious’ by people in the neighborhood. Many of these use cases are how Ring has been used by people on its [dystopian “Neighbors” app for years](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs/?ref=404media.co). Ring rose to prominence as a piece of package theft prevention tech owned by Amazon and by forming partnerships with local police around the country, [asking them to shill their doorbell cameras](https://www.vice.com/en/article/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement/?ref=404media.co) to people in their neighborhoods in return for a system that allowed police to request footage from individual users without a warrant. \n\nChris Gilliard, [a privacy expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBgnjn5cC0&ref=404media.co) and author of the upcoming book [*Luxury Surveillance*](https://www.techpolicy.press/through-to-thriving-protecting-our-privacy-with-chris-gilliard/?ref=404media.co), told 404 Media these features and its Super Bowl ad are “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\nRing’s poorly defined partnership with Flock in particular has been the subject of various viral posts and public backlash. Many people have suggested that this partnership is evidence that Ring camera footage will be shared with ICE. At the moment there’s not enough evidence to explicitly say that that’s the case. \n\nThe supposed vector goes something like this: Ring says it will partner with Flock, which is used by thousands of local police departments. As we have reported, some of those police [departments have performed Flock license plate lookups for ICE](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/). It’s too early to say whether Ring footage will eventually end up with ICE, but the fact that people immediately drew that conclusion and understood the possible method of information sharing shows that surveillance companies can no longer hide behind viral videos of delivery drivers dancing. It’s a mask off moment, and people know it: “In Amazon’s alliance with this administration, it’s become more clear than ever that Ring is an extension of the carceral state,” Gilliard said. “An emotionally charged Super Bowl ad won’t change that.”\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)",

I may be understanding the story wrong though; it's possible it was magically recorded during the 3 hours of 'free' footage you can have, but if the rumor about the footage being corrupted and the company having a backup is true, I'm still concerned about data storage.\n\nBest wishes to that family, btw.",

Buy this and, at best, get advertised to through our 1984 style listening device, at worst DIE!\". \n\n\nImagine a car ad where where the driver imagines, with due concern, all the ways it can explode and crash into shit, but then jumps in and sees cupholders and is like, \"ah well, those are convenient, might as well take this Ford Pinto for a spin round the block at top speed\", and there's no 5 star crash rating or anything about safety mentioned in the ad. \n\n\nThe tech bros and the ad men have been sniffing their own farts for too long. Those two ads just immediately made me say, oh no, never buying one of those. ",

There are a bunch of YouTube tutorials out there. It’s pretty easy to do, if you’re tech savvy. If not, look at closed systems like Reolink or Eufy.  They are local DVR or you can even do SD Card recording right on the cameras themselves.  I’m considering how I can start up a side business doing these custom builds for other people.  Could be good income doing some installs and managed services.",

Web interface to manage WiFi etc. like a traditional router but it has security first settings in mind. When a new device joins a network it joins a default vlan with no egress and no access to the home network. The user must use the app to click the drop-down and assign the device to a group. Groups have very simple config: egress enabled, ingress enabled, and lan access. All your IP cameras can live in one group, with egress, ingress and lan disabled. All your smart devices in another gorup. Think guest wifi network but dynamic for any group that you want. That was several years ago and I still wonder why the heck consumer routers don't offer this. I know certain routers offer vlan capability, but I'm talking about dead simple for the everyday consumer.",

They stonewalled Tiktok until they conceded to hand over control of american branches to american sources and are now using those algorithims to help ice track immigrants and instigators.\n\nThe remaining social media hubs that could be used by people who are seeking to organize and unify to oppose the regime are Discord and Reddit.   as a result Reddit has been absolutely flooded with AI bots  posting propaganda and misinformation and discord is being attacked as an enabler for extremist organizations that needs to submit to government control.\n\nThe absolute last thing I want to be doing is submitting identifying information to Discord.\n\nGod I sound like a conspiracy theorist.  I never once believed things like this would come out of my mouth.  But in our current political upheaval online anonyminity is more important than it's ever been.",

You have a setting in the OS for the device where you put a birth date (or any date close enough to your age) and that information stays local to your device. Then when a piece of software or a website asks \"are you over x age?\" The device says yes/no without communicating personal information.  \n\nIt puts the responsibility on parents to set up their kids devices properly and not grant them any admin privileges, and if you're an adult you can just put in any information that registers as over 18. It also helps protect kids because it can age gate people over a certain age from spaces, and if you try to put yourself in a lower age bracket in this system then that becomes pretty suspicious. And it doesn't create any undue burdens on software developers or people who host web content. In theory it can be used to curate individual users experiences on news, entertainment, and social media sites because individual page elements can be age gated. It creates a frame work where the served up software can say \"this is mature content\" and the operating system can say \"I'm not allowed to view mature content\" and the served up software can say \"okied dokie, not displayed\" and the user doesn't have to do anything.",

It's an open source software and you can self-host it, the main developers are from the United Kingdom and Canada. Meanwhile Discord is a closed source app confirmed owned by the US *and* the Chinese. Yeah, I'll take my chances with Stoat, thanks.\n\n**Edit2:** Steam voice is another surprisingly good alternative for small friend groups who are happy with just one chat.",

It worked really well and there just wasn't anything like it, and it was much more tightly focused on providing cross platform text and voice chat and that was about it.\n\nNow it's gotten extremely bloated and I don't think it knows what it's supposed to be, and using it has turned into a very strange experience - I would venture it was never really designed to be a forum hosting platform and people have kind of shoehorned it into that role. Also there SO much porn, I'm not really that surprised they're doing age verification because giving pornography to kids is a crime in a lot of places",

My examples are what I use and have setup for friends and family for years. You can get remote access many ways that exclude anyone but you from accessing.\n\nI chose Reolink because I did not want to be forced to use an app to connect or have to use a products app to view. I used both Foscams and Amcrest cams until they made it nearly impossible to view or setup without using a proprietary app. Now most of the cams will \"phone home\" many times, hence the reason for a separate IoT vlan. If your router does not have that ability, look into setting up pi-hole, a fantastic full house ad/popup blocker, of course open source. I know it can be overwhelming if you're not into the tech, but to make it easier there are plenty of good sites that will walk you through setting this up and chatgpt or claude can be invaluable.

As time goes on it is the Database it builds that becomes increasingly a threat to personal rights. I feel bad for those people that don’t maturely make their own inquiries to see that this is very real. Abuses & violations of individual rights are happening almost daily. You just have to be brave and research it or continue living with your head in the sand. It wont be long til someone comes along and smacks you in your ass.\n\nI’ll give you a head start:\n\nhttps://www.wjfw.com/news/flock-safety-faces-privacy-concerns-cancelled-contracts-across-u-s/article_a9671d6e-014d-4c4c-b726-cd5be21a037e.html\n\nSummary Flock Safety, a company operating tens of thousands of surveillance cameras across the U.S., faces privacy concerns and contract cancellations. Critics argue the company’s AI-powered cameras infringe on privacy rights and lack public consent, while security flaws and unauthorized use have raised further concerns. Despite these issues, some law enforcement agencies continue to support their contracts with Flock Safety.\n\nhttps://www.blackrosefed.org/benn-jordan-interview/\n\nSummary Benn Jordan, a musician and audio engineer, discusses his interest in surveillance technologies, sparked by the prevalence of Flock Safety cameras in Atlanta. He highlights vulnerabilities in Flock’s systems, including unprotected Android devices and potential for misuse. Jordan advocates for privacy practices like lying online and resisting data collection, and emphasizes the importance of DIY projects to empower individuals and foster innovation.\n\nExcerpt: There are a lot of vulnerabilities. I believe over 70 at this point. In my opinion, the most concerning one is that the cameras and compute boxes are unprotected Android devices. I could push a button 3 times on a Falcon and it’ll give me a WiFi access point to connect to. From there, it takes a matter of seconds to infiltrate the device to access the video footage, data, and even some of the server credentials. What’s much worse is that I can “root” the device, which means that I can have control of it outside of the operating system.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/video/2026/01/06/staunton-resident-files-petition-ordinance-banning-license-plate-readers/\n\nSTAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - After the City of Staunton announced its’s canceling its contract with Flock Safety, the company behind the license-plate–reading software that popped up over the last year, some residents rejoiced, but others in the Queen City said more still needs to be done.\n\nLastly, Here’s an Ai internet scrape of examples:\n\nInvestigations by privacy advocacy groups and news organizations in 2025 and early 2026 have exposed multiple instances of law enforcement misusing the Flock Safety camera system, which operates a vast network of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) across the United States. Here are examples of articles and reports exposing these abuses, categorized by type of misuse:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Surveillance Related to Reproductive Rights and Abortion \"A Texas Cop Searched License Plate Cameras Nationwide for a...\" (Truthout/404 Media): This report detailed how a Johnson County, Texas, deputy used the Flock system to conduct a nationwide search, logging the reason as \"had an abortion, search for female\". The investigation highlighted how cross-state data sharing puts abortion seekers at risk. \"Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose...\" (University of Washington Human Rights Center): This analysis discussed how Texas law enforcement tracked a woman who had self-administered an abortion, with data generated by Flock networks in Washington state.\n2.\t⁠⁠Personal Stalking and Harassment by Officers \"Georgia police chief, arrested for using Flock cameras for stalking...\" (Lookout): This article reports on the arrest of a Braselton, Georgia, police chief for allegedly using the city's Flock cameras to stalk and harass private citizens.\n\n\"Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says\" (NBC News): This article highlights a lawsuit regarding a Virginia police department using the system to track a specific driver hundreds of times.\n\n\"Wisconsin Case Exposes Misuse of Flock Traffic Cameras by Police Officers\" (Yahoo News/Wisconsin Examiner): A Menasha police officer was charged with misconduct in office for using the department's Flock system to search for vehicles belonging to a private individual.\n\n\"Police Surveillance is Ripe for Abuse\" (ACLU of Wisconsin): Reports on a former Kansas police chief who used cameras to track his ex-girlfriend 228 times and a North Charleston officer who used them to track his estranged wife.\n\n3. Biased Policing and Profiling \"EFF's Investigations Expose Flock Safety's Surveillance Abuses: 2025 in Review\" (Electronic Frontier Foundation): An analysis found that over 80 law enforcement agencies used the Flock network to conduct searches using racial slurs and biased language, targeting the Romani community without evidence of specific crimes.\n\n\"Flock Enables Surveillance of Protesters\" (EFF): The same report documents how law enforcement used the system to track participants in various political demonstrations.\n\n4. Unauthorized Data Sharing and Immigration \"Flock's Aggressive Expansions Go Far Beyond Simple Driver Surveillance\" (ACLU): This article exposes how local law enforcement has used Flock data to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in immigration enforcement, violating sanctuary policies in some regions.\n\n\"Mountain View, California, pulled the plug on its entire license plate reader camera network\" (Malwarebytes): Following investigations, this report details how Flock cameras were sharing data with federal agencies without the city's permission.\n\n5. Inaccurate Investigations and Privacy Risks \"Public Interest Law Firm Responds to Flock Safety Pausing Federal...\" (Institute for Justice): This article discusses a federal lawsuit against Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the use of Flock cameras, noting that the system captured, \"photos of an innocent family's driveway and part of their front yard every time a vehicle drove by\".\n\nThese reports have led to nearly 30 jurisdictions cancelling or refusing to renew their Flock Safety contracts in 2025–2026, citing privacy violations, surveillance overreach, and illegal data sharing.",

And that's probably dependent on competitors (Apple, Tidal) being unable to cut their costs.  Most likely those guys are also saving money, and so all three would end up cutting costs equally, leading to no net gains for anyone.\n\nSo we are basically in a situation where the cost is limited by the consumers' willingness to pay.

I used AI heavily at my last job, at my current job due to a custom code base that's millions of lines AI has no context and you quickly realize you spend hours trying to get it to work on a problem, or to correct it when it's wrong.\n\nI stopped using it for doing the work, and more for research like Stackoverflow was used in the past. A breakpoint is all I need to identify the problem quickly. \n\nIt's really entertaining to watch AI spit out the same code over and over when you tell it that it's incorrect, and if you diff the output you'll see almost no changes.\n\nAI is a great tool - but, I don't really feel threatened by it. Coding is only maybe 30% of my job.\n\nEdit: clarity, and the millions of lines of code are Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and Python + a custom API",

Just all works so well.\n\nPeople get so defensive and draw lines and start yelling \"fanboi!\" and everything else. But honestly choices make everything better.

It’s not necessarily the fastest solution, and it won’t be able to transfer platform-specific songs… but everything else is genuinely safe and it does a good/accurate job.",

When you first get a laser cutter, everything starts looking like a problem that can be solved with a laser cutter, and you look for solutions with one where you normally wouldn't. After a while, things return to normal, and you only use the laser cutter when it makes the most sense. AI is a worse tool for most things than a laser cutter, but it is a new tool. Everyone is still in the \"AI is the solution\" phase, and only just starting to get back to the \"Well, maybe not for everything\" phase.",

I'd be midway through testing something to be told it was getting merged and released to prod and any issues could be picked up post release.\n\n\nIt was my first experience of a company that leveraged AI tooling across all aspects of the business, it was horrendous. \n\n\nWith the increases in productivity coming I'm a bit worried the old 1:4 QA to dev ratio is just going to get blown out the water ",

Just because an AI makes it possible for a PM to start doing engineering work during their lunch break doesn't mean they should. We're seeing the typical early adopter frenzy where everyone thinks they need to be doing 10x the work just because it's technically possible.\n\n\nBurnout happens when management expects 10x output for the same pay, or when workers don't have the discipline to log off. Blaming the software for “intensifying” work is like blaming a faster car for a driver’s speeding ticket. We need better boundaries not fewer tools but people will only read the headline and think this is yet another “AI bad” situation.",

It should only be used for large dataset analysis and maybe meeting minutes. Otherwise whatever content it makes is pure slop, no matter what platform it is.

It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.\n\nIt's the same thing that happened with all other automation that led to productivity gains. When people think work is easier to do, they expect you to do more of it, but there's mental fatigue involved in jumping from task to task to task even when they only take an hour of work. You have less time for long-form thinking and problem solving, you're just doing shallow bits of work that don't let you get into a cognitive groove.",

The bear fight was not even a fight, it looked so strange and the Jurassic Park actor did not even look like himself when he changed expressions.

There's a natural rhythm of intensity and relaxation in the professional coding cycle. One gets \"in the zone\", and codes like a maniac, and then into a phase of consolidation and thougthful review.\n\nCoding with AI is like working with the worlds most knowledgeable and fast working amateur, junior dev. My job is to know what we're trying to do, to express it in a way the AI can successfully operate with, Understanding how the current results differ from the desired ones (which includes testing and code review), and the time to iterate. And as we all know, LLMs are \"sticky\", and particularly by asking leading questions at the end of any task: \"Do you want me to <various suggestions about what it could do next>\". \n\nThis tends to keep one in active mode. There is no downtime to think, unless you are disciplined enough. The constant prompting tends to erode that.\n\nAnd FWIW, despite being specifically for coding, Claude falls into the same problematic ruts that every AI I've tried using for real work  does - once it gets something wrong, it then will \"loop\", when you point it out. It'll undo the change, resulting in the return of the prior problem, which it will \"solve\" in exactly the same failed way. I've let it go through three complete iterations of this to verify it won't break out on its own. I have to point out it already tried something, which is very strange, since it's own output becomes a part of the context it keeps so there *can* be a \"conversation\". You'd think looping would be something the AI would notice, but none do, and that's across 5 major LLM offerings.\n\nAll this adds up to non-stop work. This type of work has been extensively studied and written about, and anybody who thinks they are a resource manager should know about things like \"critical chain\", in which slack time refers to the amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the project's overall timeline, which is managed through buffers to ensure timely project completion. Slack time is consideered absolutely necessary, as they've shown throughput (the actual amount produced) *decreases* without slack time, sometimes catastrophically.\n\nUnfortunately, some managers will think \"non-stop work\" sounds like a dream for their stats. They're going to be very confused, disappointed, even angry when the opposite occurs.",

So far, they haven’t.\n\nAt the same time, some of the enthusiastic early adopters have had to go back and clean up errors made by AI, and others are discovering how it makes us legally vulnerable. The bosses have adjusted their advice accordingly.\n\nMeanwhile, I’ve built a library of articles that document how poor an investment AI tools have been for large companies.

Faster output → higher expectations → less recovery time. Rinse, repeat.\n\nA few patterns I keep seeing with early adopters:\n\n* **Cognitive overload**: juggling prompts, tools, workflows, and constant context-switching\n* **Identity pressure**: “If I’m not using this well, I’m falling behind”\n* **Invisible labor**: experimenting, refining, validating AI output—work that doesn’t always count on paper\n* **Acceleration guilt**: when you *can* do more, resting starts to feel unjustified\n\nIronically, the people most resistant to burnout are often the ones using AI *selectively*—as a boundary, not a badge. They automate the boring stuff, then stop. No constant optimization spiral.\n\nThere’s a weird lesson hiding here:  \nBurnout isn’t about tools. It’s about **who feels obligated to extract maximum value from them**.\n\nIf you want, we can unpack what “healthy AI usage” actually looks like in practice—because it’s way less impressive than Twitter makes it sound, and way more sustainable.",

It’s coming from the work structures that expand to fit available employee time.\n\nCapitalism will never, ever say “let’s have Bob work half the time to do the same work” when it could say “let’s make Bob work twice as efficiently and accomplish twice as much” (spoiler: Bob does not actually accomplish twice as much, especially while AI tools suck). It’s fundamental: employees are *tools* “employed” for some task; the dehumanization is *built-in*. AI is appealing to capitalism simply because $30k of computation is necessarily cheaper than $50k or whatever of Bob.\n\nCapitalism is a fucking paperclip maximizer, and we’re hitting the point where it stops working well as an engine for economic growth because there *is* no more growth to wring out of the system much of the time. We’re spinning our wheels with a “once-in-a-lifetime” market busts every damn decade because the system is repeatedly crashing up against bounds that should be common sense.\n\nSociety needs a priority shift, and the priority should be to improve the plight of the least among us. We have the resources to give everyone the option of a free basic home, free nutritious, basic food, free basic clothing and such fit for the climate, and free healthcare (among other things). We just allocate these resources awfully because some people are very, very good at playing social games that give them power and money. We should be investing in society. We should be *teams* working to mutual benefit, but we’re still falling for dumb fucking tribal-warfare games to drag each other down while the rich enjoy unlimited crabs in their solid-gold bucket.",

In an eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a U.S.-based technology company with about 200 employees, we found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so.",

My company is forcing the AI motion down our throats. I think I spend more time cycling through prompts as I am doing a task to get to the preferred outcome as opposed to just spending the time building it. Working on a ppt for example right now, for at least two hours I have fucked around with this thing - refinining the content over and over before even putting it into my actual slides. This then leads to me being overwhelmed with options, spending more time reading back through the answers. It's great for some things, however, I do think in some aspects I am less productive because I am just burning time expecting perfection or attempting to have it do the work for me whereas I am likely better off building it then having it review and refine it. \n\nI am glad I read this article. I have been at a loss for months now about why I am not enjoying my job anymore. I just feel tired and overtasked and my workload hasn't changed. It's almost if using AI has been an additional workload itself which is slowing me down.",

But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called [QuitGPT](https://quitgpt.org/). \n\n>The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January. \n\n>For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.\n\n>QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions.",

Having Custom Instructions (and having them be much bigger than ChatGPTs) is really useful to me.\n\nCustom Gems are good, too. I know ChatGPT can do something similar, but being able to easily make a \"VentBot\", a \"WorkBot\", a \"OrganiserBot\" etc, and have them all on the screen, at the ready whenever I need, just generally makes my work much easier to accomplish.\n\nI've also found that the current free version of ChatGPT is incredibly poor... I did a comparison for the free versions of Gemini and ChatGPT and gave them both a PDF to read. GPT hallucinated like half of it. Was ridiculous. Gemini was MUCH better in this regard.\n\nLastly, the ChatGPT desktop app is horrendous... it crashes regularly, stops getting proper responses, and is terribly organised.\n\nSo yeah, Gemini isn't perfect, but it's suiting me better than ChatGPT, and I'm happier than I was paying for it than GPT.

Which basically amounted to issuing a blanket notice that stories from some preferred news sources could no longer be flagged. \n\nIssue solved. ",

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

Eventually purchased a Chevy Bolt EUV. \n\nThe vehicle is rich with features that I really enjoy. Lane assist, adaptive cruise, heated front and back seats, cooled front seats, heated steering wheel a very large infotainment screen (with android and apple auto). 360 camera view when parking or backing up, the rear view mirror is a camera as well, so no blind spots when using it.\n\nIt is so quiet and at the same time such a get up and go vehicle when needed. I got it new for about 27k. You can find used ones for much less now and the studies are showing that the new batteries are holding up very well. The 2023 was not part of the earlier battery recall, but those earlier models should almost entirely be fixed now. A few people have gotten their Bolts over the 100,000 mark and testing shows they lost 1-2% of battery capacity during that time. \n\nI use it to move around town mostly, occasionally I take it on a 2.5 hour drive to my mothers. It makes it there without needing any topping off. I charge it at home on a plain Level 1 charger. Sitting at 115 MPGe combined. Its paying for itself in fuel savings, as I barely notice any change in my electric bill. \n\nSo yeah. I think some companies are going the wrong direction with these 60,000 dollar beasts. A lot of people in the EV space want to be frugal. After all, the fuel savings are the biggest reason for buying it. Lean on that, design things that really stretch the kilowatt.",

The infrastructure for home charging is way WAY too expensive to install and maintain.\n5.) Fixing major issues is 50% more expensive, but maintenance is 30% less expensive; says \"studies\".\n6.) For some unknown reason, EV interior design with full electronics is far worse than analog buttons. They lag, they need software updates that wipe all custom settings, and heating/cooling functions cannot be accessed when the screen is slightly dirty.\n\nAnd of course:\n7 ) they look really, really dumb in comparison to other vehicles, which is polarizing to a population that is historically opposed to major changes.\n8.) Did i mention that they look really stupid? Because most do. And yes, aesthetics matter. A lot....\n\nIt's not a mystery as to why they are losing money. They want to hide every detail of their new vehciles until they come out. Which is hilarious because they fired all of their QA departments; the only people who would have told them that these features are terrible. \nThey need to hire honest/normal people to critique new product ideas, not echo chambers of yes-men pandering to their bosses whims. \n\nAlmost feels like all of the car company CEOs got together 10 years ago and hatched a plan to screw over EVs so they can keep reaping oil benefits. \n\nDon't u dare talk about my tin foil hat... it's shiney.",

That’s a recipe for disaster. If they want a better public image they need to keep their side of the street clean, as the saying goes.\n\nThe history of border patrol has an era where they brought on way to many people way to fast, did little to no background checks or training, and sent them out into the world with a new gun and badge to round people up. Countless rights violations and crimes ended up being committed (eg, murders, rapes, using detainees for sex (aka rape), drug dealing, etc). [This is a good episode about all of that](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-the-us-border-patrol-69755319/), there’s a part 2 as well.\n\nYou’d hope dhs would look at this dark history as a lesson, and do whatever they need to do so that they didn’t make the same mistakes again with ice. Even moderate people that support detaining or even deporting felons that are here illegally look at these lapses in background checks and training as an issue, and anyone that knows how this turned out in the past can see it increases the chances of problems in the future.",

[Communities with increases in immigration tend to see decreases in crime.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/debunking-myth-immigrants-and-crime/) [Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they receive in benefits.](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/immigrants-pay-taxes-benefits-study/3973064/?amp=1) And there have been studies showing that [immigrants boost the economy overall.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy).\n\nSo, even if there was a magic button you could press to make all the immigrants, or all the illegal immigrants, go home, without hurting anyone in the process, it would actually make our country poorer and more dangerous to live in, rather than safer and richer.\n\nBut there isn’t a magic button to do that, and ICE’s enforcement actions are hurting and sometimes even killing, not just immigrants, but US citizens as well.  Renee Good and Alex Pretti were both US citizens who ICE murdered on the street during “enforcement operations”, Keith Porter was a US citizen killed by an off-duty ICE officer, and 6 people have died in ICE facilities in 2026 alone: Heber Sanchaz Domínguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, and Geraldo Lunas Campos all died, or in some cases, were murdered, while in ICE custody.\n\nSo if you are a DHS agent or ICE agent reading this, whether you’re spying on me because I criticized the king, or whether you just happen to be on reddit, please resign.  Start looking for work elsewhere.  They are going to ask you to do horrible things, to follow orders that are blatantly illegal, and it is going to be a lot harder for you to defy them than you think it will be.

Then go on to say \"...when it's Wi-Fi connection goes out\", so you don't \"unplug\" Wi-Fi.  You would disconnect power to the camera but if it has a battery then the Wi-Fi would still be running unless that is a fallback feature to turn off Wi-Fi to conserve battery which shouldn't be but either way it doesn't say that.\n\nUnless they had a signal jammer Wi-Fi and internet connectivity would still have been going and the device SHOULD have triggered an alert in the dashboard that the unit has lost power and is running on battery.  I say SHOULD because I'm not sure how that one works, Ring does this and it honestly SHOULD.\n\nIt is just written weird like \"disconnecting\" it would somehow turn off the Wi-Fi.  Now, what he should have done, and all people moving forward will do is bring a jammer, knock the thing off the wall, and take it with them and as soon as they leave, remove the battery OR factory reset the thing.  Safer to remove the battery and just take it with you. ",

The problem exists only when you turn your attention to social media and that's a problem that you can easily fix.\n\nThe same shift happened when printed press became available to the masses and propaganda ended up being rampant. Despite that, people adapted and eventually learned to spot and ignore it.\n\nThe same happened again with radio, tv and later on with the internet. AI slop is no different. No matter how much they'd try, tech bros cannot replace real life with AI slop. And let's face it, we're not getting manual labor robots that can do work cheaper than a poorly paid human. Human greed is the ultimate barrier against IRL AI slop because robots will forever be more expensive to create and maintain than humans.\n\nWe just have to touch more grass and scroll less social media in order to win the fight against AI slop. :)",

Their main concern was bioterrorism, [which seems reasonable](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9). Although LLMs are less relevant in that context, rather it's more a concern for advances in reinforcement learning, so not sure how or why this relates to them resigning from Anthropic who are utterly irrelevant in that field.\n\nHe did also mention AI sycophancy in his resignation letter though which is more relevant to Anthropic but, whilst it's obviously bad, hardly seems world ending.",

              "text": "This is more futurology, but one aspect of advanced AI is that it can assist researchers toward any ends. Optimistically they'll be used for positive ends, but it's obvious that they have dual-use capabilities.\n\nSoftware security is one of the first areas often mentioned. Given the compute one can use multiple AI tools to [search for vulnerabilities](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/google-says-its-ai-based-bug-hunter-found-20-security-vulnerabilities/). It's not clear to what extent this could cause actual harm (other than basic financial losses). Ideally it's used to find and report vulnerabilities and that's probably what we'll see.\n\nMedical/biological R&D is another, it's often framed as being mostly positive. Bioinformatics is still a relatively young field and lacks the data, so this danger is potentially closer to the 2060s. We're already seeing [fine-tuned medical AIs](https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/) and are aware of [dual-use software](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-drug-discovery-systems-might-be-repurposed-to-make-chemical-weapons-researchers-warn/). I'd generally put this high up the list of potential dangers as this will be more approachable for small labs (or countries) that had ill-intentions.\n\nLastly another area mentioned is just general bot misinformation/scams/etc. We've seen in many communities that people can become attached to LLMs and are somewhat easily influenced by them. It's still so early that the effect of this is not clear. (It could be transient in that newer generations build mental barriers that protect them. Even wide-scale public service announcements could thwart a lot of these dangers). When image/video/voice is flawless and real-time we can probably get a better idea to the extent of the harm and who it affects.\n\nI will point out that in my opinion it's largely impossible to change the pace of this or \"slow down\". Given the compute, multiple discovery tells us that researchers will largely advance the technologies. There are drastic steps one could take, but they aren't really feasible.",

According to his website, the team he formerly led at Anthropic researches how to mitigate risks from AI. In his resignation letter, Sharma said some of his work included developing defenses against AI-assisted bioterrorism and researching AI sycophancy, the phenomenon where AI chatbots overly praise and flatter a user. According to a report published in May by Sharma’s team, the Safeguards Research Team had focused on researching and developing safeguards against actors using an AI chatbot to seek guidance on how to conduct malicious activities.”\n\n“According to a study Sharma published last week, in which he investigated how using AI chatbots could cause users to form a distorted perception of reality, he found “thousands” of these interactions that may produce these distortions “occur daily.” Severe instances of distorted perceptions of reality, which Sharma refers to as disempowerment patterns, are rare, but rates are higher regarding topics like relationships and wellness. Sharma said his findings “highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”",

Our adversaries already knew full well that the primary impact of social media in the long term was the destruction pf the global order and resurgence of authoritarianism. Ai would predictably cause an exponential level of disruption to society with the potential of toppling the United States.\n- Elon's sattelite launches via Spacex\n- Elon's Starlink\n- The Butler assassination attempt theatrics in 2024\n- The list goes on. The objective of Trump's allies remained the same.\n\nKeep in mind that if Trump has been under blackmail by America's adversaries since before 2016, he has been a traitor for that entire time. That would have made his loss in the 2020 election a devastating blow to the strides America's adversaries made to get him into office for his 2016 term. They would have been willing to do anything and everything to return him to office in 2024, and they certainly wouldn't have paused their efforts simply because Biden was President.
