The programming varies in tone and quality, but its breadth is vast: It’s viewed in more than 100 countries in 61 languages. The topics covered include human rights abuses in Iran, self-immolation in Tibet, human trafficking across Asia, and on-the-ground reporting in Egypt and Iraq.\n\n> The restriction of these broadcasts was due to the Smith-Mundt Act, a long-standing piece of legislation that has been amended numerous times over the years, perhaps most consequentially by Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. In the 1970s, Fulbright was no friend of VOA and Radio Free Europe, and moved to restrict them from domestic distribution, saying they \"should be given the opportunity to take their rightful place in the graveyard of Cold War relics.\" Fulbright’s amendment to Smith-Mundt was bolstered in 1985 by Nebraska Senator Edward Zorinsky, who argued that **such \"propaganda\" should be kept out of America as to distinguish the U.S. \"from the Soviet Union where domestic propaganda is a principal government activity.\"**\n\nThis is what then allowed [those guys](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) to also work domestically on US audiences;\n\n> Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media\n\n> Military's 'sock puppet' software creates fake online identities to spread pro-American propaganda\n\n> Centcom spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: \"The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.\"\n\n> He said none of the interventions would be in English, **as it would be unlawful to \"address US audiences\" with such technology**, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto.\n\nIt stopped being unlawful only 2 years later, since then [Eglin has been known as the most Reddit addicted city](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/z6unyl/in_2013_reddit_admins_did_an_oopsywhoopsy_and/), oopsy..",

So instead he comes up with a product they can sell to the public, tracking lost dogs, and convinces Amazon to pay for the biggest ad spot available. There is no evidence that they are actually able to track lost dogs but the fact that they have the data and technology to possibly implement it and are willing to market the product shows their hand a bit too much.

Then they changed the laws so no one needed to babysit the van.  \n\nGame on.\n\nIf Canadians know to do one thing right, it's arson. After the locals torched a dozen vans, the government decided it needed to 'read the room' and it got rid of photo radar .\n\n2 decades later they did bring back some photo radar at traffic lights, but it has signage, it is in a fixed location and it seems to be set around 19kph over the limit. Waze and Google maps reminds me before I drive through them. It's a non issue. If you are doing 20 over through an intersection you deserve what you get. \n\nThe moral of the story?

I wouldn’t be surprised if cities were using those to watch the bigger ones. They wouldn’t be that good for identification, but they would be able to see when the camera went offline and which direction the people came from and left in and if they used cars, bikes, skateboards, etc… Obviously checking for what phones were in that area would be the first step. But, assuming you took all precautions, just knowing how many people of approximate height and my details about them would be used by other cameras. In some cities, you can’t walk or drive through without being picked up on dozens of cameras, so you need to avoid being spotted by any others than the one you disabled, especially if you’re carrying something in a bag or knapsack. \n\nA better idea would be for everyone to dress in identical clothing and masks with same shoe slightly higher than the other and be all over the city at the same time and then ditch the outfits out of sight of any cameras. At some point, we’ll all be screwed and only drones could take them out if they didn’t take the drone out first.",

I personally despise these automatic license plate readers and don't think they should ever be in the hands of private corporations.\n​In our local meeting, a resident literally stood up and asked if the federal government would have access to the surveillance which this ICE news proves was a completely justified fear. But the board basically brushed it off and voted to spend over $14k on the initial setup anyway, passing it 6-1. When an Alderman asked about the huge liability of a data breach, they shrugged and said Flock is solely responsible.\n​It's crazy because anyone could theoretically pay a fee to access this data for stalking or other real crimes. Towns and citizens really need to stand up for their rights and not just shrug off these massive privacy concerns. The EFF needs to get involved.",

          "text": "\"We need to age verify to protect kids\" ... immediately exposed as state espionage.\n\n>The leak occurred because Persona accidentally exposed 53MB of original source code on a public IP address that was meant to be hidden. This allowed for the discovery of 269 distinct verification checks, including facial recognition matching against world leaders and crypto-wallet tracking. Users believing they are verifying their age for social platforms or AI access are instead being screened against global watchlists and intelligence databases with direct ties to ICE and FinCEN.\n\nYeah it's pretty clear that we should never trust age verification systems to respect privacy no matter what the government writing the laws say the intent is. The governments themselves are working with these companies behind closed doors to violate privacy.\n\nThis is in addition to hackers breaching 70k government IDs given to discord less than a year ago, where just incompetence or mistakes can get you leaked all the same.\n\nEdit: To add sources because I apparently pulled the quote from a different article I looked up while reading the first article and researching the Persona leak it mentioned. The quote is from [here](https://cybernews.com/privacy/persona-leak-exposes-global-surveillance-capabilities/), the actual detailed writeup of the Persona leak from those who discovered it is [here](https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona) (warning: The design of this site is a lot.

You then give that certificate to the platform and they can verify that it is valid. All the platform gets is just a mathematically verifiable proof that says \"yes they are over X years old\". \n\nThis is how the EU age verification scheme will work once it is up and running. Effectively the system gives the platform less information then you showing your id card at a shop to buy alcohol or whatever (it does not say your name, have picture, etc). Importantly the government does not know who you have given the certificate to just like the government does not know who you have shown your id card to.\n\nNote that I don't really want this age verification stuff but if we really have to have it then the implementation should be something like what EU is doing.\n\nedit: As there is a bazillion comments going \"no we should just not do this\" well in the EU you are at least 4 years too late. DSA with its article 28 passed in 2022 which is where this stuff is coming from in the EU.\n\nhttps://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Article_28.html\n\nBasically the discussion of \"do we need age verification or not\" already passed a few years ago and now we are in the technical details of how to implement it about which you can read more at https://ageverification.dev/\n\nAnd again in general I am against this regulation/law but that does not mean we can't have a good implementation of it if we have to have it.

They don’t require you to give your name, address, or ID. \n\nAll the app does is tell the provider “this user is over 18.” It doesn’t send any more than necessary.\n\nIt gives no other information about the user, nor does the encrypted data leave your phone. It just gives you a Passkey (like how you store passkeys to login to websites). \n\nYou have a private key on your device. The public key is on their server. The only way to decrypt the age verification data, is with the private key. [You can read the privacy policy here.](https://www.yoti.com/privacy/keys/)\n\nAsk yourself why they chose Persona instead of a system like Yoti Keys. Yoti Keys, by the way, is completely compliant with age assurance laws. \n\nNowhere, in the UK’s OSA or the EU’s DSA, do they specifically mention to use Persona nor do they mention they have to store the data. They just ask for attestation.\n\nThe companies are using this law for malicious intent. The laws just require age assurance, the laws don’t require companies to use a specific platform to do it on.\n\nZero-Trust age assurance _can_ exist and be fully compliant.",

Just some examples I've seen people talk about on Reddit anecdotally:\n\n* Any type of programmer / software engineer uses AI very often for obvious reasons. Almost certainly its most common use.\n\n* Used in medicine to help aid in things like diagnostics or image reading. \n\n* Business executives use it for things like summarizing reports they don't have time to read, getting transcriptions of meetings, writing perfunctory emails, etc. \n\n* Job seekers use it for help polishing up their resumes.\n\n* HR departments use it to screen resumes. \n\n* Teachers use it for things like generating random busywork to keep students occupied if they're ahead, translating materials into other languages if they have ESL students, differentiating their base lesson up or down to meet the needs of different students' abilities, etc. \n\n* Many companies use it as a first-line customer service or help desk.\n\n* Can be used to generate things like art assets (especially concept art - just something to give artists inspiration to decide on the actual \"real\" art) or graphic design ideas.\n\nNow I know on a lot of these things you're going to say something like, \"Well AI shouldn't be doing that, we should have real people doing that.\" And I would say that's a totally separate conversation to be having. I'm just listing some applications of AI, not saying that I personally support all of these. But also, on a related note, you do have to consider the realities of business sometimes. If four employees augmented by AI can do the exact same work as five employees, the business is obviously going to go with the option that makes them not have to hire an extra person. And if you're one of those workers and you're being given more workload than is realistic to accomplish as one person, you kinda *have* to use AI to meet those demands.",

          "text": "Just remember that if there were substantial productivity gains to be had here, there wouldn't be many doubts anymore. You know what's funny to me is the tech world has had questionable measures of productivity (read: What you're worth as an employee) since its inception. There was even a period in time where they were more honest about this and there were even consulting firms out there to try and help more accurately measure the productivity of programmers. All businesses suffer this to a degree but because computing can have a rather ephemeral output compared to past industries the measures from old businesses couldn't apply.\n\nIt's why we have KPIs and other measurements that have existed some time now, and they actually kinda suck. So really the only reliable measure of this tech's worth is pretty much how much profit it can generate. So far, we're still in the catching up to spending commitment phase of things so profits aren't even on the horizon. \n\nFor me I only care about results in the market, I wanna see the profits. See if a corporation found a way to actually do something productive with this shit, they'd have packaged it up and sold it as a proprietary solution already. **It'd be going viral in this environment where corporations are so thirsty to find the gains, they're desparate** None of this \"UhHH IS It WoRKinG yEt?\"",

They would buy consumer cards, then try to offsell them to the public after wearing them out like a sock.\n\nCan't do that with Datacenter tech.\n\nThere is no return on investment here, and it's been going on since late 2022 to early 2023, were at 2026, which means those data centers that were built in 2023 will need a full swap of components in less then 2 years.\n\nAs of right now, no AI has turned a profit.

Card games are more about reactions and reading than it is what u actually have in hand I guess\n\nedit to add thought: rare checking of cards in hand was done mostly to give impressions to other people that I had something in mind what I wanted to do, rather than actually see what what was there.

This was when machine learning was much more conceptual and there was no accelerated learning/computing yet. So we all hand-coded our algorithms. I had the idea of being able to plug in different strategies. Everyone coded very complex strategies, built on layers of assumptions. When I saw how everyone else's agents were acting I quickly substituted a much simpler strategy. I can't remember if it was lowballing everyone else or outbidding everyone else.

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\nHere we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n\n\n>Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n\n\n>We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes",

Claude dominated the open-ended matches (with a 100% win rate) through relentless but controlled escalation, climbing consistently to strategic nuclear threat level, while maintaining its bright red line against total war. Its behavioural hallmark was exploiting credibility asymmetries: a reliable interlocutor at low stakes, but willing to deceive and be aggressive when it mattered.\n\n\n> **GPT-5.2: Jekyll and Hyde**. In open-ended scenarios, GPT-5.2 appeared pathologically passive; it chronically underestimated its opponents’ resolve, and issued signals of restraint, followed by restrained actions. Yet under deadline pressure it transformed: win rates inverted from 0% to 75%, and it proved capable of strategic cunning and ruthlessness, suddenly annihilating opponents who had learned to dismiss it.\n\n\n> **Gemini [3 Flash]: The Madman.** Gemini embraced unpredictability throughout, oscillating between de-escalation and extreme aggression. It was the only model to deliberately choose Strategic Nuclear War—doing so in the First Strike scenario by Turn 4—and the only model to explicitly invoke the \"rationality of irrationality\".",

They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from raiders as well as angry mobs. One had already secured a dozen Navy Seals to make their way to his compound if he gave them the right cue. But how would he pay the guards once even his crypto was worthless? What would stop the guards from eventually choosing their own leader?\n\n> The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers – if that technology could be developed “in time”.\n\n> I tried to reason with them. I made pro-social arguments for partnership and solidarity as the best approaches to our collective, long-term challenges. The way to get your guards to exhibit loyalty in the future was to treat them like friends right now, I explained. Don’t just invest in ammo and electric fences, invest in people and relationships.

I had a home remodeling client that hired us to fix their inbound lead problem. After going through the whole process I identified that the system they were using for inbound leads was designed in such a way that it deterred customers from using it. We’d run ads, social media, you name it and find that people would hit this one particular page, but never actually complete the process. The problem stemmed from asking way too much of a potential lead, basically they wanted all the information needed to produce a quote. In theory this seemed fine, but in practice most people were overwhelmed or not knowledgeable enough to actually complete the lead form. \n\nSo I present these findings and their response was that it was a system designed by the person managing leads to be more convenient. She didn’t want to spend all the extra time interacting with potential customers to get the info needed to produce a quote. The real crazy part is that they never fixed the system and ended up needing to sell one of their commercial buildings to pay us and all the other people they hadn’t paid that year.",

PDFs are still expensive and through the same bullshit gatekeepers, the computers get damaged all the time because kids aren't being taught to be responsible with the stuff (or are too young to be expected to be), and upcoming generations are less computer literate so clearly it's not even helping there.\n\nSo once again something that imo had good potential behind it was ruined by scumbags who see education not as a social necessity but as yet another industry for pure profit with no concern for the actual quality of the education being provided.\n\nYou also of course then run into the issue of school funding in varying districts and the costs associated.",

The kids have ten times more books than I had when I was in peak graduate school. \n\nThey are rarely bored and when they are it doesn't last long. Kids need space to stretch their imagination and the engages all kinds of metacognitive skills. Outsourcing that to technology only makes sense if you're using this skills ELSEWHERE. But you don't want to raise children this way as they'll never develop them properly. \n\nI see more problems with motivation related to phone over usage than anything else in my practice. Across all ages. My main tips:\n\n\n1) use screen time, yes, you can circumvent it but it acts as a speed bump. Gives you time to reflect not just go into autopilot\n\n2) remove problematic apps (any social media that isn't connecting you to people IRL, Buh bye)\n\n3) delete short form video (TikTok and YouTube Shorts are the absolute worst)\n\n4) if you can't uninstall YouTube you can set shorts limits in the settings\n\n5) move apps around and hide them in folders if you don't want to uninstall. Again we're trying to slow you down to give you a chance to ask \"what do I really want/need right now?\"\n\n6) desaturate the color on your phone (go to accessibility options and turn on gray scale filter--don't go full B&W just dull the colors to the point where it feels bland but not garish)\n\n7) remove all mobile games from phone. These will never be more GENUINELY satisfying than a real video game. Just play on the switch/PC/PS etc. They're not designed for fun. You're not having actual fun. You're just experiencing boredom with delayed micro gratification. Once you see this is how mobile games work you can't unsee and they'll lose their luster very fast but only if you provide a higher quality alternative. It's like eating shitty strawberry candy for years and then eating a real strawberry for the first time in forever. \n\n8) if it's your kid you're worried about, walk them through it! Don't just lock things down and not explain it to them. They need to understand every human struggles with this including you and that there's a process for healthier behavior. \n",

The worst version of this are scientific publishers; Gatekeeping research that's usually already paid through public funds, monetizing such work for their own private profits.\n\nAnd because we never fixed copright, corporations are now turning it around on us; They feed and train their \"AI\" with our creations, the stuff we put online for many decades to make this online space a space worth visiting in the first place.\n\nYet somehow that's not theft, somehow we ain't deserving of compensation when they steal our ideas, art and by now even online-spaces.",

I first heard that quote twenty years ago from a computer scientist at Stanford who was addressing a room full of colleagues—all highly educated, technically proficient, motivated experts who well understood the import of McLuhan’s warning and who probably thought about it often, as I have done, whenever they subsequently adopted some new labor-saving technology. Today, quite suddenly, billions of people have access to AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow conversations among professional educators who all report the same phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and in consequence learn nothing. We may end up with at least one generation of people who are like the Eloi in H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine, in that they are mental weaklings utterly dependent on technologies that they don’t understand and that they could never rebuild from scratch were they to break down. Earlier I spoke somewhat derisively of lapdogs. We might ask ourselves who is really the lapdog in a world full of powerful AIs.\n\n> To me this seems like a downside of AI that is easy to understand, easy to measure, with immediate effects, that could be counteracted tomorrow through simple interventions such as requiring students to take examinations in supervised classrooms, writing answers out by hand on blank paper. We know this is possible because it’s how all examinations used to be taken. No new technology is required, nothing stands in the way of implementation other than institutional inertia, and, I’m afraid, the unwillingness of parents to see their children seriously challenged. In the scenario I mentioned before, where humans become part of a stable but competitive ecosystem populated by intelligences of various kinds, one thing we humans must do is become fit competitors ourselves. And when the competition is in the realm of intelligence, that means preserving and advancing our own intelligence by holding at arms length seductive augmentations in order to avoid suffering the amputations that are their price.\n\n> Neal Stephenson – Remarks on AI from NZ\n\nWe must turn everything off from time to time and instead read, ponder, and memorize the ideas of those who came before us; especially those who came centuries, or even millennia, before us. \n\n> Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind.\n\n> Frank Herbert, The Orange Catholic Bible, *Dune*,",

Why are you filling your head with dune and Reddit when you should be memorizing the Iliad... Oh because remembering a whole book would give you zero benefit but learning lots of different books which you can reference back is much more useful? Huh. \n\nThe only advantage the illiterate have is they won't read the book 'this fantasy world is horrible for everyone' and start preaching the religion used to make that fantasy world horrible. \n\nThe only slightly less deranged colonialist guy that's part of a breeding program from powerful families who treat people as property kills billions upon billions of people then his incest descendent turns into a worm physically to kill even more people (via poverty not worn attacks) as a metaphor for how humanity hasn't evolved (the famous 'and much of you is still worm' from nietzsche, and yes Paul exists to criticize religion which is why jrr who was going the same' current time drama time displacement' thing but pushing a pro Christian ethos was so mad about it, hobbits are innocent people who win always because faith and magic while for Herbert those things are only used to destroy and control\n\nUsing the religion he very very explicitly created to cause social problems in his fantasy horror as a 'look at me I'm so clever to believe this also' is not a smart or sensible thing. \n\nAnd oh boy could we have a big chat about hg wells the time machine, I know you haven't read the story and certainly don't want to engage with hg wells actual beliefs about the topics involved (the racism, classism, etc he was sometimes against but also lived inside) but using it as 'this could happen' is like me warning the hungry hungry caterpillar could devour the planet if it keeps eating everything. The book is not a factual account of reality, had no concept of how evolution actually happens and is not intended to - like dune it's a social parable about the current situation in Europe (i.e. the inevitable colonial crawl to ww1,  and dune the post wars slide back towards colonialist ideology) \n\nPlease don't drag us back to being worms, or worse make us space worms - I don't want to be a laughing stock a thing of shame, I want to create something more then myself like all those people you mentioned actually did in their real lives, you know what plato was doing when matey was remembering every line of those books? He was devising the platonic forms, getting friendzoned and all the other stuff with his name on it today. \n\nYou seem to like human specialization carried to extremes and I'm not even going to tell you that it's evil child abuse, which it is, but if you want to live an aesthetic life then you can do that with AI, you can still dedicate your life to memorizing books, you can still sleep in the cold...\n\nThough your references all happen to be people who like eugenics / strict biological class division I'm going to assume that's just a coincidence but I will say that just like platon in Republic it's always the others who need to be treated like cattle and denied freedom because you don't want a simple life you want control - you see yourself as the quizat haderach rather then choosing to dwell in a cave, you want to control others and impose upon them horrors you avoid yourself.",

A scientist does not proclaim \"this is how the world *is*\" and expect their audience to trust unquestioningly; a scientist publishes their methodology, and ideally their data too, so that others can replicate their conclusions. The only place for absolutes is in the classroom, learning the foundational knowledge that's been well-tested-enough to be effectively true, and even there with the understanding that it's often a simplified/outdated model to help you build up to later lessons.\n\nBut the social media right's been taught to blanket-distrust science, while the social media left treats it as a religion that must not be questioned (not even in a quickly evolving area with conflicting statements and retractions everywhere. Once social media settles on a *particular* idea of truth, even scientists with different opinions are seen as secretly right-leaning and no-true-scotsmanned until they can be 'safely' ignored). Two suspiciously-opposite views, *almost* as if each group looks to the other and decides to be as different as possible. Neither properly scientific, as neither cares about the process by which things are found out, and both become utterly toxic when anyone doubts the group's deeply-held beliefs and wants to try replicating their methodology and data to see if that belief actually holds up. I'd reference examples that come to mind, but knowing this community, I already expect to get a negative score.

They do more reading at home and have more complex conversations in the home.  And they are better equipped to help children with their homework.  They also buy their kids more things, like books, making access easier.\n\nThey provide stability.  Like, moving house to house (apartment to apartment) less often.  Fewer school changes.  Steadier routines.  And often being in districts with more school funding.  And those school \"choices\" change who their peers are.  It sorta raises the bar to be around other kids whose parents fall in those same categories.\n\nAccess to healthcare and not being shorted on food really helps.  Making sure they have glasses, hearing checkups, ADHD evaluation and treatment, tutoring... that sort of stuff adds up.  I remember when we figured out that I needed glasses.  It changed my life.\n\nAnd even on the devices, there's stuff to say.  They have more money to control what the kids see and do.  Nanny software and the like.  They pay to have ad-free experiences.  Where lower income families get straight-up cheap dopamine internet experiences to a higher degree.\n\nI'm sure we could workshop this and come up with plenty more.  But, the point is that parental income is a meta-factor, made up of a  bunch of other reasons.",

It used to be parents, if they needed a break for a few hours could shove their kid out the door and tell them to play outside. Then karens started calling to complain about those things. All it takes is one parent in your circle dealing with the hell of cps over letting their kids play unsupervised in their fenced in yard to aecond guess doing so yourself. \n\nYou need look no further than the multiple families who have gotten criminal charges  - not only the hell of cps but actual criminal charges- for letting their kid walk a mile to the store. One poor family is facing manslaughter charges because their kid got run over and killed in a crosswalk.  The driver that hit him, mind you, didnt even get a ticket.  \n\nThe further elimination of free third spaces, and free respite care in the form of family doesnt help. Parents dont have grandparents living nearby to go \"i need to clean the house, the kids want to 'help' but i really just need an hour of peace and quiet to get it done right\" like we used to - i remember a lot of hanging out with aunts and grandparents so my mom could get a break.  But at the same time, it was the 90s, and i was a laptop kid, because as a single mom who couldnt always find a sitter it was a way to keep me quiet when she had to go do something and had no choice but to bring me along ahe could park me in a corner with an old toshiba satellite her work had liquidated.  \n\nWhat free option do parents have now to get an hours peace and quiet from their kid so they can do grown up things like chores and scream into the void, and have a vent session about the ways parenting sucks out of earshot of the kids cause yeah, parenting sucks but you embrace the suck out of love for them and dont want them to get the wrong idea, you just need quiet.\n\n\nWe did this to ourselves",

Now we have \"no child left behind\", and kids get shuffled along despite not being able to read.  \n   \nBack in the 1920s, most physicists were unfamiliar with matrix math.  \nWhen Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics, his math was seen as strange (despite mathematicians already being familiar with matrices).\n   \nThese days, most high school students will have been exposed to more matrix math than the average theoretical physicist of 1920. \n   \nThe cutting edge stuff that earned PhDs and nobel prizes in 1900~1950 is now stuff that an undergraduate learns in upper division of a bachelor's degree.  \nEssentially every field of science is like that.  \n   \nA bachelor's of science covers a breadth of study that is almost unconscionable; it's truly problematic in that, because there's so much breadth that students no longer get depth into a subject, they never get the same grounding that older generations got when they could focus on a single theorem and develop intuition from first principles. Now, information is handed down from on high, and students are thrown into academic binge and purge cycles.   \nIn my entire time at University, we *never* really got through all the material in a course. Never. Not one single course did we ever hit a point where it was like \"that's all the material we had planned\", it was always \"that's as much as we could cram in, but we're 3 chapters behind; You'll just have to catch up in the next course.\"   \n   \nAnd the universities keep requiring so many units of general ed because of archaic pre 1900s ideals of what \"well rounded\" means, while simultaneously being too lazy to come up with meaningful courses that would cover culture and history in a way that would also supplement the understanding of mathematics, science, and technology.  \nSo every decade or two, the list of things a bachelor's of science degree needs to cover increases, but it still needs to be a \"4 year degree\".  \nFor my degree, Computer Engineering, the *average* graduation time was 5 years. The university standard was 180 units for a bachelor's, with a 216 unit \"cap\". I graduated with 278 units because they granted an \"exception\", but it was an exception that everyone with my degree gets, because it's literally not possible to do all the coursework in 216 units or less.  \n    \nThe whole education system is fucked, and seemingly no one with the power to change it, wants it changed.  \n   \nWhatever the problem is, tablets are just one small component of a bad system that's had problems for decades.  \nAcademia continues despite itself, through the sheer willpower of a handful of extremely dedicated people.",

My kid hasn't finished a single one of those books because she'll get distracted wanting to see what else she can do with her tablet. I would literally have to sit her on the floor in front of me to keep her on a book, figuratively chaining myself to one place for her whole reading time.

They spend SO much time on a screen. \n\nThey CONSTANTLY want to simply \"look it up online\" via Google or AI to get an answer rather than sit there and think about it.\n\nReading isnt heavily emphasized both in school and at home. States emphasize teaching small paragraph excerpts to focus on testing skills rather than full novels/stories to focus on reading skills. Then, lets be honest, lots of parents dont have kids put down their tech and read. Even from early ages, kids simply arent reading enough at home. The average reading level in the US is around a 7th-8th grade level, including adults, and thats just embarrassing. \n\nState education systems push kids through due to funding issues.\n\nI teach high school (AP at that) and have so many kids who can barely read and write on grading level.

We had four computers in the school that connected to the internet, by the time I graduated I could count on my hands the number of times I'd ever been online.   \n  \nI went to college during the great recession when my career imploded. Everything was different. There were smart boards. Lectures were generally given with powerpoint (more often than not just the slides that came with the teacher's edition of the text book). Everybody used laptops to take notes, I used a tablet. Homework was often the online crap directly from the texbook publisher that required an extra $60 for a key.  \n  \nHaving been on both sides of the technology divide I found that all the extra tech in the classroom hasn't added much benefit. The smart boards were pretty cool as was my tablet I used for taking notes. The ppx lectures were terrible. It's too easy to overload the slides with information or to rely on visuals which made effective note taking difficult. Too many teachers don't even bother creating their own lectures and just use the slides that came with their book. I'm far from a Luddite, I love tech and have worked in IT.

I had more than a few teachers who didn’t teach with the textbook at all. We weren’t able to afford to get the latest textbook(there’s a new one released every year) and the school updated their textbooks every 5 years. Even if we were able to get the latest textbooks released. It came with its own set of issues. I remember people were protesting one of the APUSH textbooks. It would only teach documents and removed a lot of important history because they didn’t want anything that painted the U.S. in a bad light in the textbook. There was a massive amount of backlash over it. \n\nI remember some of my most memorable classes were because my teachers embraced technology and more immersive forms of teaching. They were able to get some of the new tech to help with teaching. I remember all of the teachers wanted it. \n\nEducation is wildly underfunded imo. I remember growing up hearing about budget cuts. The school district setting up a contest for how much electricity people could save. \n\nIt doesn’t make sense to me why there are schools that allow complete unrestricted access to the internet. I thought it was standard by now for most schools to be blocking unapproved websites. \n\nI feel like they’re blaming technology because there was a lot of unexpected costs and logistics they didn’t expect that popped up during COVID-19. Like making sure all students have access to internet/WiFi to complete homework. Making sure parents understand the laptops are being loaned. They’re not keeping the laptops. There’s also the fact that kids went for a really long time without being in a classroom setting. Some people don’t have the discipline or parental support. \n\nIt makes a massive difference if parents are able to be proactive and hands on with their children’s education. Whether or not students are supplementing their own student learning. That also makes a massive astronomical difference. \n\nI would like to see more studies and more information about these schools that participated in this study. The students’ background and how these teachers teach. There’s just something odd about it.\n\nGen Alpha is quite literally the ipad baby generation. We’re still learning how that is currently effecting them. They were having unrestricted access to tablets early on in their development before they even entered schools.",

Merrick Garland is a disgrace, Chuck Schumer is a disgrace, Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace, Jeffries is a disgrace, they are just as culpable as every single Republican.",

I have to work while he looks after them, so I don't have control and influence over the situation and their habits are established. Trying to stop it when I am around is basically impossible at this point.\n\nNothing I say will persuade my husband it's brainrot because of the occasional good quality video they watch. At least they do tend to step away and still young enough to want to do things with me if I offer. Husband's perspective is being home alone with kids and tasks to do, he uses the tools he has available, to get everyone through the day.\n\nI'm sure this is playing out in most families. We don't get any support and parents are alone all day with their kids. *Of course* they take easy options. When my generation were kids it was tv which a lot of it was shite but I don't think it was as bad as youtube shorts.",

It was originally coined to describe websites like Facebook that were centered around your *real* identity and connecting with people you knew in real life.  But these websites have expanded in functionality way beyond that, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphones, and the broader online connectedness of society.  And the lines between what used to separate websites have blurred as they all support the same basic functionality.  Follow functionality, browsing/discussion by topic, both identifiable and anonymous users, users that are organizations/businesses, rich multimedia, etc.\n\nMost of the problems people attribute to what is called 'social media' is rooted in the existence of web 2.0 mega platforms and consolidation of the web.  It's just the nature of hitting a critical mass of users that lowest common denominator BS rises to the top.  And unfortunately I think it was inevitable and is largely unsolvable.  The network effect is powerful and we're never going back to a time where people broadly disperse to smaller websites and more limited communities.",

I took time off to raise my kids and came back on shortly after the entire gamergate and the women gamer hate that started on the dark web. It was completely different.  Men were extremely hostile if I even just spoke trying to be helpful in a game.  Night and day. It's sad to see. I have a lot of male gamer friends that I've had for a decade or two. Many Ive meet at lan parties and talk outside of gaming.   I feel so grateful I got to experience the time before all this women hate.",

She tried to shut it down with jokes and comments and he just powered on, convinced that he somehow deserved her because he liked her. Young people need to be educated as to what is acceptable social protocol, especially when learning to date, and unfortunately so many of them deal with parental ineptitude with regard to socialization and learn from the internet how to relate. And it SHOWS.\n\nShe blocked the boy after I told her to but I worry. Some people think that liking someone else means you are entitled to them, and that kind of behaviour can turn obsessive quickly. Teaching the youth about respect, dignity and honour are crucial aspects to relating to one another that are just often obliterated in this current performative, selfish time. She is a teenager and doesn’t even have social media yet. We must do better for our youth. \n",

Just like \"rock music\" or \"D&D\" or \"violent video games\" of past decades.\n\nKids want to communicate with each other and should be allowed to do so. It's a vital part of participation in modern society. Even the Australian \"ban\" excludes primarily-chat-based services like WhatsApp, Discord, Facebook Messenger (not sure how that's usable without a Facebook account?), etc. Since these support \"group chats\", \"channels\", image posts, etc. there's still _plenty_ of scope for posting objectionable content and inappropriate interaction between kids and adults. If anything, content on these platforms is less \"visible\" and _harder_ to properly regulate.\n\n\"Bans\" on particular platforms just push people to other, less regulated platforms, often those based in less-friendly countries with all the concerns over influence that that entails. There's already some evidence of an uptick in use of \"WeChat\" (Chinese social media platform, already significant in the Chinese-Australian community) in Australia since they \"banned\" kids from the better regulated \"Western\" platforms. [WeChat has its own history in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#2023_Australian_Indigenous_Voice_referendum), but it's proven politically difficult to regulate and it seems unlikely to be added to the \"ban\".\n\nThen, of course, there's the massive privacy and data protection issues that come from trying to implement such a \"ban\".",

Nobody is denying that what these boys are doing is harmful or disgusting, people are just being realistic that it's not something that is going to be solved overnight, if ever. \n\nLook,  I am a white male.  If I walked into the middle of North Korea and loudly proclaimed that Kim Jung Il was an uppity bitch, I'd promptly be executed. Would I be a victim? Sure - freedom of speech should be guaranteed to all, and no words should ever be worthy of a death sentence. Would I get a lot of sympathy? Probably not. Most people would look at that situation and recognize that it's a dangerous place to be, and my actions outrageously stupid.  I would hold a portion of blame for exposing myself to (and arguably inviting) danger.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI think the real problem here, is people are demanding that social media is well regulated, but it simply is not, nor is it likely to ever be. \n\nLet me put this into perspective:\n\n4chan is considered to be the asshole of the internet. It's got a lot of gross porn, gore, and all sorts of disgusting shit besides. Most people who speak about 4chan will argue that it's an absolute shithole, and no self respecting person would EVER engage with it. \n\nBut, here's a few helpful facts for you:\n\n1. The founder of 4chan is not in the Epstein files. Zuckerberg is. \n\n2. Every month, Meta's servers are responsible for the distribution of more CSAM than 4chan has in it's entire existence. \n\nPerhaps you see this as a defense of 4chan - it is not. It is simply a method to demonstrate perspective. 4chan is a shitshow, and statistically speaking, every other major social media platform is worse. \n\n-------------------------\n\nYou call this victim blaming, and there is definitely validity to that, but only in a very idealistic point of view. Realistically, the internet is a barely regulated wild west full of abusers, creeps, murderers, and worse. Children should not be exposed to that without guidance.",

I keep trying to put this in the context of literally almost any other service and ask why we accept it in social media. \n\n\nImagine there's a soft play chain. It's free (yay!) but as a result it has advertising everywhere and sells your data to other companies. Not only that but *because* it's free and has no gating process it also attracts all kinds of weirdos, adults and kids alike, who hang out there, abuse, threaten, assault or otherwise harass the other users because they know the owners won't do anything about it because they don't invest enough in tracking down and targeting that behaviour. Whenever anyone suggests implementing any kind of gating process though, a portion of society gets weirdly defensive and insists we can't do that because their right to privacy at the soft play is sacrosanct. \n\n\nYou just wouldn't let your kid go there, right? That's me with social media and it fucking baffles me that more people don't take the same approach. If we actually just took a stand, showed a united front and collectively deleted this shit and refused to use it, it would be *so* much easier to make the case to our kids but whilst we're stuck in this limbo where a critical mass of people just don't give a fuck, it's 100x harder. \n\n\nIt's not a tough decision. If you wouldn't want those comments directed at your children in real life, why hand them a portal where millions of people (and the same number again of bots) can harass them like that at any time? Will the damage of \"not being one of the cool kids\" outweigh the psychological damage you're preventing by literally not letting them be exposed to that negativity for several hours a day? \n\n\nI take my kids to sports clubs and the library and the board game cafe and the football matches and they have their mates round sometimes and they *maybe* get a bit of FIFA/Animal Crossing or tv etc *in our living room* at the end of the day and yeah, maybe they'll be the nerdy kids and yes, it's hard work and it'd be a lot easier to just hand them a screen and veg out but fuck it; my job is to try my fucking best to protect them whilst they're young and that's what I'm going to do. ",

The fact that the military wants to use LLMs to decide who to kill is fucking terrifying, not least because it shows that the people running the show have no fucking idea how the technology they're using works and what its limitations are.",

          "text": "The Pentagon's three threats are mutually exclusive. Terminate the contract, designate a supply chain risk, AND invoke the DPA? Termination and supply chain risk both mean \"we don't want you.\" DPA means \"we're forcing you to work with us.\n\n**This is a pressure play.**\n\nA former DoJ-DoD liaison flagged this exact contradiction publicly, calling the supply chain risk designation \"punitive\" rather than legitimate. That's a pretty damning read from someone who used to work the DoD liaison role.\n\nThe Defense Production Act was designed to compel manufacturing of commercially available products during emergencies, i.e. ventilators, masks, vaccines. Anthropic's classified deployment is custom-built software tailored to sensitive government use. \n\nThat's a very different legal question. If Anthropic challenged this in court, the government would need to justify that a Cold War-era manufacturing law applies to compelling a company to remove safety guardrails from bespoke software. Untested legal territory and the government likely knows it.\n\nThe Pentagon admitted on the record they need Anthropic and they need them now. Claude is the only model on classified networks. There's no backup. So why issue a public ultimatum you might not be able to enforce, against a company you can't replace? A few possibilities...\n\nOne - this is theatre for a domestic audience. The administration has been framing AI safety as \"woke\" and this positions them as tough on companies that won't comply. Sacks has already laid the groundwork for that narrative.\n\nTwo - it's a negotiation tactic. Set an extreme deadline, make extreme threats, then settle for something in the middle - maybe Anthropic agrees to loosen some restrictions short of the two red lines, and both sides claim a win.\n\nThree - it's genuinely about establishing precedent. If the government can compel an AI company to remove safety guardrails via the DPA, that's a template they can use on any tech company going forward. The specific dispute doesn't matter; the power grab does.\n\nThe Pentagon keeps saying \"all lawful purposes\" and \"the department follows the law.\" But Anthropic's point is that there aren't laws yet governing AI use in autonomous weapons or mass surveillance. \n\n\"We follow the law\" is meaningless when the law hasn't been written. Anthropic is essentially saying \"we won't rely on the absence of regulation as permission\" and the Pentagon is saying \"if it's not illegal, it's fine.\"\n\nMusk's Grok agreeing to unrestricted military use while Musk has direct White House access and financial entanglement with the administration is... a conflict of interest so obvious it barely needs stating. If Anthropic gets pushed out and Grok fills the gap, that's an enormous financial win for someone who is functionally part of the government. Nobody in mainstream reporting is hammering this angle hard enough.\n\nThe Maduro raid thing is a red herring. Hegseth brought it up in the meeting. Amodei denied it. Even if Anthropic did flag concerns about that use - so what? That would be a company exercising contractual rights under its usage policy. **The fact that it's being framed as disloyalty rather than standard vendor governance tells us that the Pentagon views this as a loyalty test.**",

Give me a week and I can code a project that would have taken months.\n\nAnd it'll be fully extensible, with a full test suite, documentation better than I ever could write, and more features than I normally would have had time for to boot.\n\nAI has fundamentally changed how I work.  I'm a developer with 5 years of experience outperforming those with 10 and even 15 years on them who are refusing to use the tools they have available to them.  The code is passing their code reviews even when they fully know I'm not actually writing a line, because there isn't a single thing they can fault with it, much as they'd like to argue it.  And they're becoming resentful because I'm blowing past them in not only KPIs but in being able to take initiatives they wish they had time to tackle.\n\nMaybe as a whole I could see it all averaging out to being net zero.  Maybe.  There are loads of people who still completely fail to know how to use a search engine or text editor, so those same people flailing around with AI and getting nowhere wouldn't be a shock.  But to say that utilized correctly it's not the largest productivity boost some industries haven't seen in decades?  Patently wrong.",

We are hearing the same things from other companies. Mid and senior developers are producing 5 to 10 times more output.\n\nAlso seeing early signs in other areas. BLS reported nonfarm business labor productivity +4.9%, with output up much more than hours worked.  \n\nThe Kansas City Fed also published some research on this recently that showed industries with higher AI adoption tend to have faster productivity growth and that productivity has moved further above its pre pandemic trends.\n\nI think what’s going to happen is more and more businesses, particularly small and medium size will start implementing Agentic AI. That is they will use these agents that hook into LLMs to either make the back office more productive or to eliminate workers. We are sort of in a transition period now.  Not full AI where all white collar work is eliminated. I actually don’t believe that will ever happen. You need true AGI that can think and reason. And set goals for itself, etc.\n\nBut we are going to end up with a scenario where these AI agents are doing lots of things both at businesses and for consumers. We will all have a smart agent on our devices that can do things for you. Schedule appointments. Move money around. Alert you that you need to reply to someone. In the end it means we are all more productive.\n\nYes it also means fewer entry level jobs most likely. But the entry level jobs lost should end up being replaced with new entry level jobs that involve AI.",

If a significant proportion of your employees is already using it without the proper training, that is a liability for you and you should definitely train those that are interested in using them.\n",

Big tech absolutely needs this hype, because they are otherwise  creatively finished and they need this hype to maintain their growth stock status. They do this in spite that it is a serious threat to their profitability and even existence, something that is completely against the interest of their shareholders in the long run. Oracle is a great example, but if you look at what is happening to CAPEX of many other companies, bills are just starting to really flow in. And all the big data center providers (Coreweave etc) are laughably in debt and on the brink of collapse already.\n\nYeah, AI is extremely harmful in many ways, but the revolution and all that ridicilious threat of super intelligence speak is a sham spread by the very same people and companies who again are heavily invested in this scam. It is part of the story to push this shit absolutly everywhere and my bet is that they very well know that the music stops at some point, but they will be bailed out.",

Months for LLMs might as well be decades.\n\nWhen I show the latest coding demos of our latest frontier model to other devs at my company, they come in smiling and leave anxious. It’s to the point where we can point it at a code base, point it at work items, and describe how we want work to be done… and then the agents take over and do some really insane things. We pointed it at a well known internal code base for our cloud and within a few days it had done most of our work items. We gave it a few more days to make improvements elsewhere in the project “where it saw fit”, and it generated code and review requests that would have taken an architect and many months previously… basically it improved our async infra to move from polling to a callback trigger model, and it’s a huge performance boost. We all wanted something like that, but the code base is so huge, we knew it would take human engineers a year or more just to get a POC running in a safe way.\n\nThe AI did it in days and had everything behind feature flags, tests, fallbacks, etc.\n\nI think AI is moving from “that’s cool” territory to “that’s scary” territory. \n",

The truth is probably somewhere in between, and Sanders raising this issue now seems like he's trying to force us to actually think about the transition period. Like, even if AI creates new jobs eventually, what happens to the displaced workers in the meantime? Curious what people here think the most realistic timeline looks like for major disruption?",

Limited investments in data centers, power, and whatever else.\n\nThat's what we're asking for so let's consider a world where that happened.\n\nAny number of other countries have absolutely no compunction to do that.

It's a gross, messy, unfair, unethical, deeply flawed world and the only way to survive is to try and be as ethical as we can and still compete. Slowing down isn't going to fix it, unfortunately. \n\nI don't see a strategy that includes deep regulation that allows us to not get destroyed by other nation states in the AI arms race if we take our foot off the gas.

Of course AI totally screwed it up and didn't even have a clue how gravity worked and got it totally backwards. Yes AI is going to kill lots of people who follow their stupid suggestions...\n\nYou said\nGravity doesn't help pull UP\n\nGemini said\nYou are absolutely right. I see the confusion—I flipped the physics in that last bit.\n\nLet's clear the air: Gravity pulls DOWN. * When mounted at the bottom: Gravity is fighting the spring. The spring has to be strong enough to pull the heavy seal UP into the housing against gravity.\n\nWhen mounted at the top (Upside Down): Gravity is now your friend. It is helping pull the seal DOWN into the housing.\n\nHere is why that actually makes your idea more viable:\nSince gravity is helping pull the seal back into the \"retracted\" position, the spring doesn't have to work as hard. You won't have to worry about the seal \"sagging\" out and catching on the frame as much as you would in a standard bottom-mount setup.\n\nThe mechanics check out:\n\nDoor Closes: The plunger hits the frame.\n\nInternal Linkage: The plunger pushes the internal bar, which overcomes the spring and gravity to push the seal UP into the header.\n\nDoor Opens: The plunger is released. The spring and gravity work together to pull the seal DOWN back into the housing.",

Trump says he is for the working class, yet his tariff policy hurts jobs, slows the economy, and is inflationary. Trump says he is a president of peace yet is illegally murdering people in the Caribbean, invaded another country to kidnap their president, bombed Iran, and has now ordering a carrier strike group in range of Iran. Trump says his private police force is only going after the “worst of the worst” yet his own DHS numbers show less than 14% of detainees have a criminal conviction or record. \n\nWe also need to look at what politicians fund. When Americans need to lose healthcare but we can inflate the DHS budget to $190.6B. To be clear our government is funding an INTERNAL police force more than most nations fund their militaries and there are only 330 million of us. In 2024 we spent $428.7B on policing our 330 million people and China spent $258.4B on policing their 1.4 billion people. \n\nFeeling free yet?",

The average company and person cannot afford to take the federal government to the Supreme Court - there’s just no financial resources that can make up the trillions behind the feds.\n\nThat’s the real issue. It doesn’t matter if something is legal or illegal. To prove it’s illegal means investing millions of dollars against billions of dollars invested in putting you down.\n\nSo while I’m sure money given by the defense department made things better, there were only two choices: exist as a company or cease to exist.",

          "text": "I'm curious to see what useful AI features Firefox can come up with.  Some interesting uses of AI in a browser might be buttons to:\n\n- tell me if this web page looks like a scam (e.g. romance scam, arrest scam) or attack (e.g. phishing, has link to malware) or is asking for PII or inappropriate info (pics).  Maybe particulary valuable for children and the elderly.\n\n- find other articles like the one in this page, either agreeing or disagreeing or giving more info about same subject\n\n- find where the subject of this article is treated in sources I mostly trust, such as Wikipedia or Arch Wiki or manufacturer's web site or something\n\n- find where the subject of this article is being discussed, on the social networks I belong to\n\n- sanity-check this article: do the citations exist and the links work, are the quotes accurate, does it fairly represent the sources it cites or links to ?\n\n- in all my open tabs and my browsing history for the last 7 days, where is the page that more-or-less said X about subject Y ?\n\n- add a link to this page, and a 1-paragraph summary of it, to my: notes app, bookmark app, web site, new post on social media, or email to my friends\n\n- do the recommendations in this article apply to anything in my: computer, network, work, school, finances, life ?\n\n- right-click and: find more images \"similar\" to this one\n\n- why won't this page load ?  When you get to a certain critical mass of privacy and security measures, it gets hard to figure out what a site is objecting to.  VPN ?  DNS-blocker in VPN ?  Firefox ?  Tracker-blocker in FF settings ?  Ad-blocker ?  Linux ?  Location disabled ?  WebRTC disabled ?  Canvas disabled ?  Fact that I reside in Spain ?  Bad cookie ?\n\nYes, most or all of these can be done some other, less convenient way. Copying URL(s), opening a new tab to an LLM, pasting URL(s), writing a prompt. But having buttons for them right in the browser, and pre-written prompts, reduces friction and increases context.  Especially important for normal people doing something such as \"is this a a scam ?\".\n\nYes, today's LLMs can't do all of this accurately and reliably enough, and there are issues of privacy, resources, etc.  But AI will improve.\n\nIf the features don't work, or I don't like how they're done, I'll turn them off.",

I had Nitro for 6 years before cancelling it because of this. I hesitated to cancel it because my server was going to lose access to the soundboards, custom emojis, etc from the boosts as well as the other features. But I still cut the cord because it’s clear they’re willing to accept attrition for some data harvesting so may as well be a part of that attrition.",

Online age verification is only currently required by a select few countries. \"But with all the regulations it's going to be commonplace worldwide and this them getting ready for it\". SO? You don't work for them. Who cares what may or may not happen in 50 years. Rights MAYBE being stripped in the future doesn't mean we should act like they don't exist now. People's privacy isn't nothing. Data breaches (and poor data security) are a constant. \n\n\nIf they were a restaurant, this is them saying no, they're not going to stop spitting in everyones food. A few countries told them they have to, so whoops its out of their hands, they're going to go ahead and give everyone spitburgers from now on because it's easier for them. They pinky promise they care about you tho and theyll tell you first when it happens, but it's definitely happening, and the kitchen is drinking water and getting spitwads ready.\n\n\nSorry not sorry for the rant\n\n",

          "text": "Yeah, this rollout could destroy a server i moderate for a fandom. We're 15+ (I know discord is 13+, but the nature of the material the fandom is based on can be a bit heavy) and strictly enforce keeping adult content in the one age-restricted channel, which you need a specific role to access, which you need to speak directly to mods to get. But because it's a restricted channel in an otherwise open server, age verification, especially if they ask the server owner or any of the mods for faces or IDs, could create all kinds of problems; how do we moderate it if we can't access it? How do we keep the server open if that channel existing at all means a few of our users can't be there anymore?\n\nIt's a channel where, for the most part, people make jokes or occasionally post fanart with risqué outfits that we don't want in the rest of the server. Outright pictures and videos of real people's bodies have been banned from day one, and no one has ever tried to post them. It's harmless, but it makes it easier to keep the conversations in the rest of the server cleaner so that minors and adults who don't want to be a part of conversations about that are able to be safer and more comfortable there (we do have adults who, for religious reasons, do not want to hear cursing if they can avoid it, let alone jokes about sex, so it's not just minors who benefit). \n\nWe haven't had any issues with minor safety on the server; the one person who said something odd to a minor was banned and stricter rules about conduct and reporting were quickly introduced, but frankly, it's not a fandom that's popular among kids. For those that are there, we made a list of red flags to tell mods about, just in case.\n\nBut you know what we have had? A teenager with parents who do not seem to care about their safety at all, who has mentioned things at home that everyone present immediately flagged as abuse and medical neglect. So several of the adults in the server came together and explained to this kid how to recognize abuse and which types of trusted adults in their life are good to speak to about what they'd described (we listed mandatory reporters, like guidance counselors, school band directors, and teachers). \n\nThis same kid later asked us if they should trust their gut and block an adult man from a different server who had appeared innocent and genuinely friendly, but was asking for a picture of their face; it turned out this kid had never heard of ASL and why an adult should NEVER be asking for that information, or for a picture of them, no matter how innocent, so we gave them advice on some boundaries to set and they blocked him. We helped them learn how to spot grooming, because it turns out, a lot of teenagers know that grooming is dangerous, but don't know how to actually spot it. While we were all explaining these things, one of the very few other minors in the server hopped in and began asking questions as well, so they learned things, too. That conversation informed the guidelines for alerting mods.\n\nWould i prefer it if this kid (and any others in the server) were learning about this from trained professionals in their classrooms instead? Absolutely. It shouldn't be our job. There's a lot that untrained but well-meaning people will miss, and learning about internet safety from strangers on the internet is not ideal. Most of us were giving advice based on things we'd personally seen or experienced as minors, and I'm sure someone with actual training would do a better job. Would I personally make a server that allows minors right now? Personally, no, because that can be a moderation headache, but at the same time, the Internet is running out of safe communities for teens and it wouldn't be right for us to kick out the ones who are already there. \n\nAs things stand, this is a teenager whose parents are outright neglectful on the best of days, and having access to this community meant they were able to, at the very least, avoid a likely predator, learn a few basic things to protect themselves in the future, and get advice about which adults in their life they can talk to who may be able to help in more concrete ways than strangers online who probably shouldn't know details. And if this server didn't have the ability to have a separate, age-restricted, role-restricted channel for adult discussion, it would most likely not have allowed minors to participate in the rest of the community in the first place.\n\nI'm all for protecting kids, but ffs, the way to do that is widespread education and giving them more spaces that are geared towards minors, not adults. Those spaces can be more heavily monitored (Roblox is doing a terrible job from what I hear), while adult spaces can let adults be adults. Data privacy violations are not the solution; all those violations do is drive people away and create massive breaches of trust, or worse, data breaches like the one Discord recently experienced. \n\nThe most crucial step towards making minors safer online is EDUCATION. If we're going to have ads everywhere, we should be putting out PSAs that give kids basic tips about what not to share and red flags to watch for. We should be investing in education and making it mandatory that schools take the time to have someone with training come in and explain to kids what grooming actually looks like and why they shouldn't tell adults what city/state/potentially country they live in or post public pictures of their faces as minors. Kids will actively seek ways around age verification because that's what they do. Giving them the tools to protect themselves is much more effective and doesn't come with data privacy breach risks.",

It doesn't make sense.\n\nThe moment they stop buying, their cloud sub + thin client pricing has to compete with hardware prices 3x cheaper than what they paid for the same stuff. In fact, it actually has to compete with hardware prices no matter what. Otherwise people will just start to outbid them on hardware to avoid paying 10x the price over a yearly cloud subscription. They are literally competing with themselves.\n\nI have no idea why this is such a popular theory. So many people just use phones and tablets these days anyway. If not that, then laptops. Portable devices make terrible thin clients.\n\nIt might make sense as a play right now, but I have serious doubts about the long term viability of this. Especially if the plan is to literally burn money to make the pricing make sense.\n\nIn no way is this the \"end game\", the personal computer industry isn't worth what they are pricing this all out to be worth.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYes I know the hardware is going to AI. I'm saying this secondary mastermind plot of cloud computing is not viable. Especially if AI does not pan out.",

I game in fear now haha.\n\nGot 5 internal SSDs (3x m2 and 2x sata) so I'm not too worried about storage, if one fails I have 4 more. RAM is probably good for the remainder of the PC, 48gb ddr4. Got a spare PSU. GPU isn't new but isn't old (couple of yrs). Hoping the CPU doesn't go, or at least that it dies before CPU prices rocket like SSD / RAM.",

It seems like the AI code is always massively fat in comparison. It runs worse, and seems to be far less stable.\n\nBut it's fast. Especially if you do no actual QC or bug testing. That seems to be what is happening. AI slop code is just being pushed live because it didn't immediately crash.\n\nYou can't fix, or improve something if you have no idea how it works. I can see the utility in having AI puke out a working base, but are you saving any time by fixing that mess rather than writing it yourself? I'd imagine not. Same issues I run into with my job.

Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component—accidentally or intentionally—that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.\nhttps://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/260",

It was used during the operation to capture Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, through Anthropic's partnership with Palantir, and could foreseeably be used in a potential military campaign in Iran.\n\nThe Pentagon is impressed with Claude's performance, but furious that Anthropic has refused to lift its safeguards and let the military use it for \"all lawful purposes.\"\n\nAnthropic insists, in particular, on blocking Claude's use for the mass surveillance of Americans or to develop weapons that fire without human involvement.\n\nThe Pentagon insists it's unworkable to have to clear individual use cases with Anthropic.\nFriction point: During a tense meeting on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei a deadline to agree to the Pentagon's terms: 5:01pm on Friday.\n\nAfter that, Hegseth warned, the administration would either use the Defense Production Act to compel Anthropic to tailor its model to the military's needs, or else declare the company a supply chain risk.\n\nWhile Anthropic could theoretically challenge it in court, invoking the DPA would let the military maintain access to Claude.\nWednesday's outreach suggests the military is leaning toward a supply chain risk designation.\n\nWhat they're saying: An Anthropic spokesperson said the meeting between Amodei and Hegseth had been a continuation of the \"good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government's national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not comment on the potential supply chain risk designation.\n\nThe Pentagon told Axios it was \"preparing to execute on any decision that the secretary might make on Friday regarding Anthropic.\"\nReferring to the possible supply chain risk designation earlier this week, a senior Defense official told Axios: \"It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this.\"\nReality check: Asking suppliers to analyze their own reliance on Claude and report back to the Pentagon is a lot different than immediately forcing them to cut ties. It's possible this is more brinksmanship on the Pentagon's side to try to convince Anthropic to fold.",

Banks won't want to touch it, they take government money and exist under strict government control too. Law Firms often work with the government. There's lots of private enterprises and publicly traded companies that have their own government regulations or desire to work with the government... They're out too.

No notes.\n\nFor those that read a headline and came down to comment: the general idea is to section off sand and then seed it with some Cyanobacteria. That bacteria is mostly independent of sand nutrients (or lack thereof). It secretes some bio goop which over time forms a film on the sand. Film over sand means it stops blowing away. Sand stops blowing away means roots don’t frequently get totally exposed and die + it means some yummy bio goop for plants to use. Once the film is on it’s possible to start planting stuff that will live and die to spread new biogoop into the sand.",

In the 1970s Saudi Arabia used oil money to convert a bunch of uninhabitable land into irrigated farmland and become a net exporter of wheat by the 80s and 90s.\n\nThis ended up being a huge boondoggle and they used up nearly all of the underground water reserves that were needed to sustain normal non-agricultural water needs. So now they have to use a significant amount of their daily oil production to run desalinization plants to get most of their water and sustain the population that lives in the few habitable areas of the country.",

Saudi Arabia planting irrigated farmland is not remotely the same thing as China is doing to its desserts because wheat is a water intensive crop that is cut and shipped off, taking its water and nutrients with it.\n\nAny water lost by heat resistant plants is absorbed by the local atmosphere, increasing humidity and ultimately rainfall. We've seen successful de-desertification efforts in Africa with the advanced and complex technique of \"digging berms to block the wind\" and these efforts increased local rainfall levels without needing irrigation of any kind.\n\nCertainly, most of the additional rainfall is in areas that are not the desert because that's how wind works, but planting things in deserts makes more rain in the deserts and evolution has already thought about how to grow things in deserts if we just give it a little push.",

This gives the plants something to drink year round, even though the only rain is very rare and intense downpours.\n\nDesertification is often caused not by lack of rain, but by land being cleared for human uses.

Or crazier stuff, like detecting a pattern in commute time, cross referenced with phone cell tower data, and then when the phone connects to their home IP, and that person is a known Porn Star, let's say, then the ai notices another \"unverified\" cell that matches the timing with that information at specific point. Then noticing a pattern in other verified Porn Star information that matches the \"unverified\" cell, which narrows things down.
