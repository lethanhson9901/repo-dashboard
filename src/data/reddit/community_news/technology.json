              "text": "AI actually decreases traffic to Wikipedia. The content is stolen and integrated into the AI model's weights. So if you ask the AI something it will draw from all the training on Wikipedia, but there's no more traffic to the website. That means people don't know the knowledge is from Wikipedia, they think it's from ChatGPT (or whatever chatbot they're using) and they will not go to Wikipedia, because the chatbots don't source their claims. And if they don't go to Wikipedia to check the sources there, they may be misinformed, but they also don't donate or understand the labor that has gone into assembling that accurate information.\n\nWikimedia has released a few numbers and it shows that while the internet has grown in traffic overall, traffic to Wikipedia has actually decreased in recent years. This means people get their information from elsewhere and without attribution to Wikipedia, why wouldn't it have the destiny of StackOverflow soon?",

The public only became aware of the problems with Scots wikipedia after a Reddit post went viral and was picked up by national newspapers. \n\nI have over 1500 edits on wikipedia - mostly actually writing original content, and none of them automated edits (which is common when people use tools to fix grammar or capitalisation) and I pretty much quit completely a few years ago because it's so frustrating when someone decides they want to revert your edits or when you butt up against bureaucracy.

OK wiki internal hyperlinks kinda suck and are often leading you to pages that are too general, regarding what words in what context you clicked, but the essence is right.

One year I managed to fully donate almost every month even when it ment going hungry for a few days and that's money I truly felt was actually going to a good cause and not wasted, i do realize it was irresponsible and unhealthy but at the time i was really depressed and suicidal (truth be told i kinda still am, especially with the state of the world and personal stuff right now) and was looking for any purpose to feel something, trust me i know how fucked up and weird that was too. \n\nI mostly did it to spite fascist pieces of shit like Elon Musk and Trump but eventually I realized donating to places like Wikipedia and PBS was more important than trying to piss off pos billionaires that were trying to control information. I actually started to learn how to use wikipedia. Eventually I started to learn things i never thought I would ever think about in a million years, I even learned things about myself reading articles.\n\n I firmly belive things like Wikipedia and PBS are humanity's single greatest achievements, they should be protected at all costs. If any one reading this feels like they want to help the world and humanity, this is a start in my opinion. Everyone should have access to all the worlds information and Wikipedia is providing us just that FOR FUCKING FREE WITH NO ADS OR ANY OTHER BULLSHIT!!! OF COURSE IM GONNA GIVE THEM MY MONEY IF THEY NEED IT!!!!\n\nTruth be told wikipedia is sort of like my beacon of hope for humanity.",

This happens because their perceived image of \"loving and caring parent\" crashes headfirst into the reality of \"I sent my child away to a place where s/he was abused in every way conceivable\". The two are irreconcilable so to protect their ego they just deflect at every step.       \n\nI'm 100% expecting the same reaction out of MAGA chuds: they'll be unable to cope with the reality of \"I helped elect a fascist government\" because it'd destroy their perceived image of \"proud American defender of democracy and the constitution\" and so they'll go full on Deflectionville mode.              \n\nHell, we've already seen that with the murder of Renee Good: they can't accept that they helped elect a government that can and will freely murder citizens and so cue all the \"she tried to run him over/she was obstructing the way/she should've obeyed\" deflections.

Many conservative echo chambers are filled with plants from russia, india, china, etc, and toxic ideas are encouraged and responded to via AI and bots quite a bit.  \n  \nEven though I probably wouldnt agree with those posts if I *did* see them, I would also have to take them with a grain of salt. The remainder is a bunch of sociopathic edgelords who like to sit on reddit and jerk themselves off.  \n  \nPeople go there and will read all the comments and ideas without any proper context on the medium and absorb the ideas as if they're reality. *This last part is exactly what the plants, bots, psychos want. Its not reality, but they are hoping to slowly change the narrative and color the way we all see each other.*  \n  \nDont fall for it. Be smarter than that.",

They are still \"in control\" of things from an outsider perspective until an agent of the government is killed. Then, once one of their front line agitators are killed, they can say things have gotten out of control, and the military will be needed to regain control. They will point to the dead official and say the government must defend itself from Americans, and martial law must be instated. If martial law is declared BEFORE an agent dies, then the government will lose the trust of those on the fence.

I'm watching videos of people being shot in the street, children abducting and wailing from \"detention centers\", massive protests in multiple cities.  This is beyond horrific, and from what I have learned through history, the first steps -towards- a dictatorship.\n\nWhat we're doing is not working.  They're chipping away at us, while we aren't making even a dent.  The rest of the world is completely fed up with us.  Is it really still reasonable to keep playing nice and legal and politically correct at this point?  Does it still seem -safe- to do so?",

NASA’s Artemis program has their manned lunar landing program set in 2027. China has their manned lunar landing set in 2030, and they have been nailing every single one of their intermediate missions in the meantime.\n\nAsk yourself why China doesn’t try to cut corners and beat the US back before 2027. Because they know we won’t make it, thanks to MAGA and the growing anti-science movement in the US. That’s why. You may think “oh, but we were there first, so who cares?”. Strategy. We won the initial 100 yard dash in the first space race, but China will win the marathon. And when they do it, in high definition for the world to see, they will use it to stoke the fires of nationalism and Chinese superiority. And when they control the Helium-3 market in the latter half of this century and hold the world by the balls economically due to us having to kiss their ass for access to quantum computing, nuclear fusion and even the ability to continue using magnetic resonance imaging, we probably *still* won’t have learned our lesson.",

Initially, the company I was at was targeting applications that require USA made hardware, such as grid infrastructure, and critical military power backup. CCP back doors into critical infrastructures no joke, it’s a real problem, not just a political dog whistle.\n\nThen, investors wanted to target a bigger market so they moved manufacturing to China. After that all the engineers remaining left on their own accord, seeing which way the wind was blowing. Now with the escalating trade war, I think they’ve effectively boxed themselves out of the US market.\n\nEdit: there was a general economic theory that we could keep the high paying engineering and design jobs here while outsourcing manufacturing to China. More and more it seems that you get better products and faster innovation when engineering and manufacturing are in cahoots and under the same roof, and China has plenty of great engineers.

          "text": "One interesting thing to ponder is that, with oil, there is a \"thing\" that the world absolutely requires to generate energy and that \"thing\" can be controlled and used to manipulate economies and policies or to control and intimidate other countries.\n\nFor example, Oil is fueling Putin's war and if oil was, all of a sudden not valuable, he'd be screwed and the rest of the world would lose a way to control or influence Putin (as in \"don't do this or that or we'll stop buying your oil).  But that's not necessarily easy when you also need that oil.  And it doesn't help when countries still buy his oil, regardless.\n\nWhen energy transitions fully (or mostly) to solar and wind (which will require good batteries), energy will no longer be something that can really influence geopolitical events.\n\nThere are going to be a LOT of people who will lose money and power or just don't know how to react in that sort of reality.\n\nGoing to renewable energy with good storage (which, right now means batteries) is the right thing to do for the world.  But there are a lot of people who will lose out when it happens.\n\nOh, and China doesn't have any oil to speak of.  Right now it depends on Russian oil (which is why Putin still has money) but it's got great incentive to develop alternative energy that it has access to (wind, solar, hydro) vs stuff it needs to buy from Russia (or wherever).  They need to keep all that oil to fuel their military planes as that's not going to transition to battery power anytime soon.\n\nI don't think China likes Russia or is really even an ali; they are partners of convenience and if Putin continues to weaken Russia and it's already clearly known that the Russian military is not strong, there is a possibility China will start incursions into Siberia.",

One car can be fine with the electronics but have panel gaps you can literally stick your finger in. One car can be sealed water tight but have mechanical problems. One car can be rock solid with all that stuff but drive on a gravel road and trim just falls off because why the fuck not. Across the board they have shit reliability.

It’s going to be a bit muddy because attribution is hard, but you’d expect to see a lift if it lived up to its promise. \n\nFWIW this is much more in line with what I’d expect — LLMs can be great productivity tools in some circumstances, but they’re productivity tools. The distribution of that productivity bump is invariably going to be lumpy, so without targeted application Id expect pretty low signal to noise when looking at  returns. They’re not replacing FTEs broadly across your org, which seems to have been some (most?) executives expectations. \n\nIf you look at organizations more broadly many haven’t even bothered rolling out old fashioned automation solutions for many tasks internally. Those organizations are likely the least well positioned to leverage LLMs, even though they have the most potential for a return. Their problems are mostly due to having weak technology orgs, and trying to roll out LLMs internally isn’t going to help them because they’ll have just as much issue with that as with rolling out the automation they could already have been leveraging for returns. \n\nLooking at the benefits of LLMs more specifically they’re just not suitable to be used unsupervised. Their output needs to be scrutinized by a real person, and if that validation takes as much or almost as much time as the person just doing the work in the first place then there’s no lift to be had either. It’s neat that an ML model can mostly do that work, but the benefits to the business are inherently limited by that need for supervision. \n\nSo while I think it’s obvious that LLMs will deliver increased productivity in the long term, I think the current market and investment are grossly disproportionate to those gains. We just aren’t going to see the wholesale displacement of workers by LLMs, absent some additional breakthroughs in model design and training. It’s going to be a loooooong time to get a return on investment at the current levels of spending in the industry. \n\nAll of that is a really long winded way to say that I’m just not surprised by this. There’s been far too much ‘irrational exuberance’ around LLMs and a correction is coming. We don’t know when, who will be impacted the most, or the full magnitude of the correction, but it is coming nonetheless.",

My grammar sucks and trying to untangle my inner thoughts into a nice straight pattern on paper actually makes me feel like I’m banging my head against the wall. Which is ironic given my major in TV Prod and minor in screenwriting.\n\nI got through high school and college by writing all my essays and then pasting them into grammarly, having it fix all my spelling, grammar, and word-vomit, and then submitting it. Simple, no AI involvement, no change in the points and arguments I made in my writing, just a simple clean up and mistake polishing.\n\nNow I try to use grammarly to do that same thing to help me write emails and cover letters for job apps and it’s practically all AI now. Just yesterday I tried using it to help me fix any mistakes in an email draft and the AI is trying to change everything I said and is actually making what I wrote worse than if I had just wrote it myself and sent it without trying to proofread it. It got to the point where I had to fix mistakes that the AI proofreader had made while also trying to fix my own grammatical errors. Defeating the purpose of me using it in the first place!\n\nWhat drives me up the wall even more though is the insistence of other people around me telling me “just ChatGPT it bro”. If I’m trying to write a tough professional email or message to someone I’d have my dad who works in sales help me out and give me ideas. Now I try to get his help and he’s like, “just ask ChatGPT to draft some up for you”. I don’t ***want*** to ask Chat to do it for me. I ***want*** to learn and figure it out for myself so I know how to better do it in the future.\n\nPlus, all the very few times I actually tried to have AI draft some written thing up for me it’s made so many mistakes and when I tell the people giving that advice to me they tell me, “well you just always have to proofread it and fix any mistakes it made. It’s a tool not a psychic”. That’s not how tools work though? A tool is a second hand that aids in you performing correctly on a task. It’s not supposed to make your task performance worse.

It absolutely can do things for *individuals* in workplaces, but the trouble is applying AI at large, \"introduce AI into our entire workflow\" type stuff. That's what a lot of CEOs expect, but without putting in any effort or investment to enable that.\n\nAnd even for the individual, using AI to help automate or speed-up one part of your job isn't some game-changing, insanely beneficial, high-return move that AI is expected to be. It just means you can do something marginally faster than you did before. You still have to do all the OTHER stuff that AI can't do, so it's super odd how many C-suite folks seem to be seduced by this as some massive productivity enhancer.\n\nThey want to implement AI, but they don't tell people how they want it to be used, and they won't(or can't) implement it at scale into full workflows across their business. So what do they expect? Nobody handed people Outlook and said \"There you go! Email! Now go be ultra productive!\". You had to change your business to operate around it over time, with significant investment into on-premises servers and staff and networking to support it. This is rarely done with AI as CEOs just want an \"out of the box\" solution, but have no idea *how* AI is supposed to fit into their business. Very few businesses are going to hire AI devs and technical experts to create in-house LLMs that are tailored for their workspace and sensitivity of company data.",

Why are we using “may” in the headline?\n\nThere were tons of reports from government workers about forced entry and demands for access to very sensitive information, but the Trump admin basically said “just let it happen” and green-lighted everything. No doubt this was quid pro quo for Musk after he put up nearly 300 million dollars to help Trump win the election. In Trump’s mind, this was probably a small favor since he knew plans were already laid out for establishing a dictatorship. I feel kind of silly for saying things that seem a bit too obvious. Musk stole our nation’s sensitive info and secrets and he is connected with people like Putin. So.. that’s basically where we’re at right now. Please correct me if I’m wrong about something.",

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the forced removal and incarceration of over 110,000 to 120,000 people of Japanese descent—two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens—from the West Coast into inland, guarded detention camps during World War II, driven by wartime panic and false claims of military necessity. \nKey Details of Executive Order 9066:\nPurpose: The order empowered the Secretary of War and military commanders to designate \"military areas\" and exclude any person from them.\nTarget: Although it did not name specific groups, it was used specifically to target Japanese aliens and American citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast.\nImpact: Over 120,000 people were forced to leave their homes, businesses, and lives, spending up to three years in relocation centers.\nDuration & Rescission: The order remained in effect for the duration of the war and was formally rescinded by President Gerald Ford on February 19, 1976.\nLegal & Historical Context: While challenged in court (e.g., Korematsu v. United States), the Supreme Court originally upheld the detention as a \"military necessity\". In the 1980s, these convictions were overturned, and the government apologized, admitting the actions were based on racial prejudice rather than evidence of treason. \n\nSame same but different meme***",

Some went on to lead very well known companies and  weild a lot of political power  in Chicago to my personal knowledge.\n\nTerrorism Database?

If you're at all concerned about being made to use a Microsoft account that steals your encryption key, you *have* to start planning on leaving Windows.  If you keep putting it off, you can find yourself in a situation where the latest Windows update does something that crosses the line for you and you'll be stuck scrambling for a solution.\n\nEven if you don't plan on using Linux *today*, having it installed on a separate drive even if you don't use it right now means you have a plan B.  I recommend Bazzite as a very straightforward \"just works\" option, you don't really need to know much about Linux to get things working and it *really* will not let you muck it up in a way that can't be fixed with a reboot.  Install it on a second drive, and if Windows gets to be too much one day or you have time to kill you can play around with it and see what all you can accomplish.",

I actually much much prefer the windows management on Linux too.\n\nBut every time I launch a game on Steam I have terrible performance. Mind you my setup is outside the ‘norm’ and I run most of my games at 7,680 x 2,160. Under Windows I get great frame rates for pretty much all the games I care about on my 5080 but on Linux I get sometimes less than half the frame rates making it unplayable. Once that gets fixed I’m done with Windows. Just tried CachyOS this week with Octopath Traveler 0 and I would tank for no reasons while it’s super smooth on Windows.\n\nI want to switch so bad I’ve even considered putting the AMD rx590 from my NAS in my computer and passing the 5080 to a VM to run games that way, but I feel like that would push my power supply too much and heat up my case too",

An example being an app that knows if a PS2 formatted hard drive is connected, and is able to transfers files to it from the computer that otherwise cannot. Would wine be enough to do that? No idea, but I don't think it's likely.\n\nBoth of my other deciding factors have been tackled though. I stopped playing competitive multiplayer games, and I've now shifted career path from going to school for mechanical engineering to learning the electrician trade. Maybe i'll finally buckle down and learn how to code but that seems incredibly unlikely, so windows it is for the foreseeable future.

That's why there are warnings when you turn on ADP that if you forget your password and recovery key, your data is gone.\n\nBut it also means they can provide this data to law enforcement.

Depending on the edition (home or pro), it may be the user directory only or the entire drive thats encrypted (if pro, go to control panel instead of settings). Regardless, settings should indicate where the recovery key is (if pro, click \"backup recovery key\" and if the \"save to my MS account\" option is greyed out then its in the account).\n\nTo remove keys from the MS account, go online (theres a URL to the specific page but I'm on my phone rn) to the page to manage recovery keys. Find the one which matches your computers name, and from there you should be able to view and delete it. **Make a backup of the key locally** (like a physical usb stick) before deleting it. And remember where the backup is! Keep it with you like on a keychain, and dont tell anyone you have the keys on that usb stick. In thw event youre being forced to unlock your device, destroy the usb stick.\n\nEven better, store the backup encrypted online- the easiest way to do this without command line or specific services (like a password manager), is to use a file compression program like 7zip, store any recovery keys into files, and package the files with 7zip into a format that supports encryption (I believe the .7z format can be encrypted; .zip could apply a password but I dont think its fully encrypted, could be wrong). Always use strong passwords, ideally a password manager with transparent encryption protections, even self hosted if inclined, and wherever possible, enable 2fa (the PIN/password able to be set in bitlocker is technically a form of 2fa but for complex reasons its not as effective as the 6 digit codes)",

Those games that dont' work are *extremely* popular, of course, so that's cold comfort, but if you already don't play Battlefield 6 or Fortnite then the worst that'll heppen is that you'll have to look up what launch options you have to punch into Steam to get the game to work - annoying, but I think manageable for most PC gamers used to looking up workarounds for bugs in games.",

Market share? What the fuck do you think you're talking about?\n\n_Windows_ is a paid product, that supports a giant company with thousands of highly paid staff and shareholders. Microsoft certainly cares about user count.\n\n_Linux Mint_ is a community project, developed primarily by volunteers, given away for free. Which of the [three](https://www.linuxmint.com/teams.php) (3) staff members listed on their website do you think is head of marketing that will spearhead this new campaign? How much extra revenue do you think will be generated by pushing a $0 product to fund this endeavor? Are you currently seeing a lot of ads for Linux Mint? Do you expect to? I'm guessing not. The developers of a community Linux distribution are less like the executives at Microsoft and more like the moderators of a community subreddit.\n\nI see this kind of language all over the internet and I think it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what community developed Linux distributions even are. The truth is, almost universally among community distros, nobody actually involved in the project gives a shit about user numbers. If anything, a large userbase is a problem to be solved; since it still costs money to host repos, and forums, and all manner of infrastructure, each new user is a net negative monetary value to a distribution sustained by donations. If you've ever been to the community forums you should know that useless bitching about problems is readily met with snarky comments that you're entitled to a full refund of $0 and can just leave if you don't like it.\n\nThere won't be a Linux Mint \"marketing blitz\". There will be no campaign. Because they _can't_ make one, and even if they could, they _wouldn't_ because there's just no reason to care about user count. People evangelize Linux distros to their friends for the same reason they evangelize their favorite movies and books — it's why [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/6hur7u/do_you_recommend_windows_10_xpost_rtumblr/) has been a meme for years. People contribute to community distributions because they want the operating system _they_ use to improve, and to reflect their opinions and values about how it should function. A growing userbase is a side effect, not a goal.",

The US military for example still primarily uses Microsoft, and they’re not using the base Windows Premium installation with a hope and a prayer that Microsoft never gets hacked. They don’t even get their updates from Microsoft, they have a security team that downloads the update, checks it out, and then pushes it out to their networks once it’s been deemed safe. They also get custom 0day patches, but those are largely handled by a unit in a special branch like USCYBERCOM so they don’t have to tell Microsoft about the bugs they want to hack other countries with. ",

If anyone but you has access to your keys then your encrypted data is not secure.\n\nIF you have a TPM chip AND you do not give MS your encryption keys AND you set a bitlocker pin (prevents the TPM to sending the key without the pin) AND Microsoft has not put any kind of backdoors into bitlocker, either \"just because\" or at the command of the NSA under threat of treason charges if they reveal it (if you're too young to know who Edward Snowden is Google him, this absolutely happens and all the time), if ***all*** of that then ***maybe*** bitlocker can actually be considered truly secure, even from a corrupt government?\n\nAlso let's not forget \n\nBut honestly this is just another reason to ditch Windows for Linux. There's never been a better time, with a handful of exceptions it's hard to even find modern games that don't run well on Linux either natively or via Proton.\n\nMy personal top 4 distro recommendations:\n\n* **Arch:** For giga-nerds who wanna get pretty good at Linux in the way Mozart was \"pretty good\" at playing a piano. Can be (*will* be) a PITA if you run into an issue that's beyond what you've learned how to do at that point but if you want the absolute most out of your hardware and want the highest level of assurance your computer isn't doing a damned thing you didn't explicitly tell it to short of designing your own PCB this is the distro for you. It's very well documented and there's a lot of community support, so you'll likely never be flying blind, but you'll always be flying with the assists turned off.\n* **Manjaro:** For middling nerds who want something that largely \"just works\" but still offers many of the benefits of Arch. It's Arch under the hood but with the creature comforts baked in instead of installed by you by hand one by one.\n* **Debian:** If you're somewhat techie and want to be able to customize and fiddle around with stuff, but mostly want your computer \"just works.\" Some will recommend other flavors of Debian, like Mint for example, but what I like about vanilla Debian is that it is unbelievably well documented and largely in a way that's a little more layman consumable than Arch's documentation. Chances are if you have a problem there is documentation on how to fix it or another user who's had the same problem and posted their fix.\n* **Ubuntu:** If you just wanna be off Windows and don't want to have to learn anything but a new GUI. You still can get under the hood and tinker if you want to, but you'll probably never need to. This is the Linux distro you put on your mom's computer if it is too old to still function well on Windows but she refuses to buy a new one.\n\n---\n\nEdit: just as an addendum to Arch; don't be intimidated. If you wanna try it out and esp. if you have a bit of Linux knowledge try it out. I'm in manglement (*executive* manglement, so even worse!), barely touch computers beyond sending emails anymore at work, but I daily drove Ubuntu for a few years a long while back, and have used it here and there on raspberry pi's for little projects. That was more than enough for me to figure out installing Arch to my tastes and having it reliably do what I want it to do. It is the PITA choice in many ways but if you think you wanna try it out try it out. Worst case you say \"Fuck this\" and pick another distro. I truly cannot recommend it if you don't want to learn at least the basic ins and outs of Linux. If you want something that just works with no need to fuck around with it it is *not* for you. But if you like learning stuff and tinkering with stuff and want that experience? You'll be fine.",

I should be able to sue them for having used it in their training data.\n\nEvery person who posted their early stories to LiveJournal as a teenager would never have allowed a larger corporation to come along as use that data for training without some sort of compensation.  Not to mention LiveJournal probably had a bunch of terms and conditions for reading the site, and all content posted to LiveJournal was owned by LiveJournal and could not be used by any other entity.\n\nEvery musician who posted their music to MySpace and Bandcamp (who again have their own terms and conditions about use) would never have said \"oh yeah sure use that to train an AI band which sounds just like me.....I'll make all my money off live performances.\"  \n\nThey are scraping literally _everything_ they can from the internet to get as much data as possible.  Do you think they look for what license the data was published under?  Of course not.\n\n\"Stolen\" or \"Broke the terms and conditions\" whatever you want to call it.  When I **personally** do it to businesses, they take me to court for repirations (see any RIAA or MPAA case in the past two and half decades regarding torrents and illegal downloads).\n\nAnthropic at least purchased copies of books (which hopefully ended up paying royalties to the authors, but really how many of those books were purchased used or wholesale from libraries discontinuing editions, etc?), https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/, but even then the argument was \"they were having the AI read them just like a human would\".  I bet if you read the copyright at the beginning of most of those books and they don't explicitly license for training AI, and probably say \"for personal use only\" (which if you've ever noticed, all movies / TV programs say for personal use only, not for showing to groups, which again I would get sued for if I do that).\n\nAI should have been it's own, new, completely different license from regular human use.  But then \"oh no Country <X> doesn't follow US Intellectual Property Law\" so they will get ahead of us in AI design / training / modelling if we have to follow some new US law to obtain training data.\n\nFuck that.  Every piece of data used to train AIs was stolen if it wasn't in the public domain, which Disney and other companies keep pushing that further and further back.",

But if the industry norm is that your performance can be used to train an AI, which will replace you, that lifetime career turns into one single job, and then you're permanently out of the industry. And then we'll get less talent entering the industry because they know they'll just get a one and done job, and the entire entertainment industry stagnates and becomes what ai slop is already - more ai slop",

Not in the least bit funny.\n\nAnd here's why: anyone here old enough to remember the absolute cultural phenomenon that was Americas Funniest Home Videos? Millions of Americans sending in moments captured on video.\n\nBut there's the key word. CAPTURED. They were filming, something unplanned occurred, bedlam ensued, and a perfectly imperfect moment of pure human chaos was captured. And now we had a way that we could all share in it.\n\nI remember watching a documentary of the making of the show, and they had a segment where they aired a few of the reject videos. Why were they turned down? They had obviously staged some grand catastrophe and filmed it with the hope of gaining fleeting mainstream fame. And it was painfully obvious which ones were faked. There was no spontaneity. It just felt forced. They weren't captured moments, they were constructs, and the end result reeked of it. More recently I've seen people try to fake internet videos of things like \"jewellery store heist gone wrong\". They're infuriatingly unfunny, and they're pretty obvious to spot.\n\nNow, everyone is trying to create \"funny\" with AI, and it is failing miserably. AI can only force moments to happen. It doesn't capture that moment when our humanity blows up in our faces. It crafts it. And what it crafts will never be anywhere near as good.\n\nI'm watching these companies that have pumped trillions of dollars into AI circle the drain, and I'm not mad at it.",

To give you a few examples of ways I think it can enhance human creativity:\n\n* Small uses of the erase tool and the select tool in Photoshop and similar programs to help isolate foreground subjects. Many Photos hope users aren't even aware they are using AI.\n* A fun video I watched a while back was where two programmers had AI's and had them play Geogesser. One had a general-purpose AI they had spent a lot of time training. The other took responses from his chat in real time and tried to determine the correct answer based on hundreds of human inputs. The result was a mixture of silly mistakes and groups of humans in the chat fighting over giving silly results or trying to win. [Here](https://youtu.be/JmoFvtBBDJw?si=5ToPMhSb94yBPvT_) is the video in question.\n\nI don't think this generally works for comedy.

Ditto for many film classics that later followed in the decades to come. \n\nOnly real change in the 2000s was the shift towards building up IPs and trying to make franchises of them",

Companies like Disney conveniently ignore that, and these rich assholes will ignore that as well as long as they get paid. This whole technology is vile and based on theft and should be banned, but this website is just arguing for licensing deals.

I'm sure the matte painters didn't like the rise of full CGI, and it's an art that I do miss, but the reality is that we do get more by embracing technology than we lose.\n\nRight now, our machines are mostly hallucinating: but you can guide them with additional data. Once the era of technical slop recedes, we'll get a generation of new vision, in which the barriers to making art will fall back. I don't think actors are going to disappear: no matter how good the tools gets, humans are probably easier for creating the base data you'll manipulate using AI, as you can't create video in real time, so using actors generates the data you want faster. \n\nBut you won't need $10m to make a low budget film. You can take a couple people to a stage or shoot in a warehouse with simple drywall standups and fill-in props, and get exactly what you need. It's going to be interesting.",

It's going to be decades before we even have a glimpse at actual AI, and that's being generous. AI won't actually make an appearance until many of us are long gone. \n\nWhat we have now are nothing more than glorified data scrapers, and that's exactly what these companies pushing AI so hard are using it for. To scrape data from every possible metric related to every man, woman, and child alive today and those to come in the future. It's why we're seeing \"AI\" elements being forcefully shoved into products that simply don't need it. Why more and more products are being bundled together with apps. None of it is for our benefit. None of it improves the user's experience. It's all about swindling as much data as possible about each and every individual on the planet so it can be sold for a profit and then shoved back into our faces as ads.\n\nThe government should be sued. I'm so freaked out and paranoid to type anything online, go outside, run errands, or enjoy anything these days for fear of constantly being under surveillance, and it's absolutely affected my health negatively in multiple ways. So not only are they stealing my info to make a profit, but they're also destroying my mental and physical well-being. And I know I'm not the only one. Far from it. And yet, we're trained to believe that such things are perfectly acceptable and that we have zero power or say over any of it. \n\nIf a company wants to track my info, then they're going to give me 80% of the profit they make when they sell that info to data centers. And all companies should be forced to make dumb versions of every smart product they sell. Versions that have no internal elements that connect to any networks or any apps. Products that have zero tracking or use statistics. \"MAYBE\" some on-board basic diagnostics that \"WE,\" the people who own the product, can easily access to do our own troubleshooting. \n\nI used to think we were well on our way to the greatest timeline in history. Now I fear we're well into the worst timeline. And it's only going to get worse.",

Your voluntary neighborhood watch footage becomes part of something much bigger.\n\n>The partnership works through Ring’s existing [“Community Requests”](https://ring.com/support/articles/uds27/Community-request?srsltid=AfmBOopukxUzsJ6_KUL22s3P1pPPJ0BlMEzOxENQuwhFou6G-kpV6K9-) feature, where police ask users to voluntarily share footage. But once you click “yes” to help solve that package theft, your footage enters Flock’s ecosystem where federal access is built into the system’s structure.\n\nThis is an important distinction for current users: as described, this only affects video clips you choose to share on the Community Requests, your regular footage is not defacto shared with Community or put up for viewing by your local law enforcement agency or by extension, the flock expansion. Users who don't opt to share anything to Community shouldn't (at least, by current appearances) be concerned that everything that your camera sees is being shared to Flock/ICE. \n\nThat said, this is Amazon we're talking about, so stay vigilant with your privacy and watch the space for any further changes beyond this. If you're going to use a doorbell camera etc. be cognizant of how it may affect your privacy in your future - you know, don't do lines of coke or pimp hookers in front of the cloud enabled thing.",

If there is a non-American alternative to the same thing, they'll probably take it.\n\nWhat should worry America the most right now is the loss of public opinion and consensus around them. The speed at which the USA went from being glazed by everyone in the world and considered a trustworthy entity, to starting to be compared to Russia and China in perceived trustworthiness - sometimes even unfavourably - needs to be studied. And I mean, I don't think I can be surprised either: the entire world is on Ukraine's side, and now the White House is evidently allied to the Kremlin. On top of all that's happening, there is now a perceived association between the USA and not one, but two, countries which have been committing war crimes in attempts to conquer a territory. You start to lose the cool factor. And here's the thing: people don't like wars. People are afraid of wars, people like stability and prosperity. If you wanted to be liked, war mongering is not it.\n\nAs it turns out, if you keep reading on the news that Trump wants to impose sanctions on you and is now even threatening some member countries of the Union you are part of, you will not really feel safe with that entity having such an important role, and you will not want to be personally responsible in fuelling their economy.",

You'll see a lot of propaganda crying out that it's pointless and it won't work.\n\nYou see it for strikes and unions. Then, you always see they get results. You see it for boycotts - it's so ingrained that even some of your friends will tell you it's pointless. Time and time again, companies cave and start listening to the complaint after a good boycott campaign.\n\nAt a minimum, boycotting damages the image of a company, and that in itself has a snowball effect.\n\nMost purchase decisions are done with an irrational component. When two products are comparable, people mostly tend to like with the company that they like the better: track record, brand identity, any cool ads they've seen that have stuck, etc. A brand that is under boycott will start to have this unpleasant aura around them. You won't order a Coca Cola when you're out with friends and some of them feel very strongly about Palestine. You will be more reluctant to order Coca Cola alone, too.\n\nBoycotting works, both because it tarnishes brand reputation, and because we are social animals who go with the herd and tend to want to get approval from the pack, involuntarily. Boycotting works great because it plays exactly on that aspect of humans.\n\nThis is why they want so desperately to make you give up. They don't want us to wake up and realize that we actually hold a huge amount of power. See all those banks, insurance companies, enterprise B2B companies? At the very end of the pipeline, there's us. There is B2C. The end goal is always controlling where we decide to put out money. If we stop putting in our money, the entire thing goes belly up. We are quite literally the weak link of the entire supply chain, and they don't want us to realize that we are the table on top of which the castle of cards was built.",

          "text": "Every technology investment follows the same basic principles. First you have a small group explore the technology and do some demonstrators. Then you measure how well it functioned and stack it up against comparable technology/products/processes. You look at things like learning curve, support in the community, commercial support, cost to train, cost to migrate, and all your normal ROI estimates. Then maybe you have some pilot users try out the tools in the real world and closely monitor the outcomes. Plan for an 18 month to 3 year transition (or longer because of holdouts, entrenched legacy tech stacks, prioritization, and leadership turnover). \n\nInstead everyone went with \"feels like 20%\" and assumed they'd be quickly into some gains because AI is so interactive and conversational. They're not treating it as infrastructure intensive, training intensive, or realizing there's still a learning curve and a time to proficiency to deal with. Meanwhile they're also laying off seasoned developers who are pointing out the flaws in the strategy and foregoing hiring on junior devs because the savings is just one more quarter away. \n\nThen there are the costs. Companies always have this bait and switch on costs. First you go free tier, get individuals using the product on their own. Maybe you have a low cost license, low enough that some hobbyists and professionals might buy in just to \"get a leg up\". Once they spread the gospel to their friends and companies you start demoing it and giving out some free licenses for evaluation purposes. Maybe you renew those licenses a few times to get teams hooked and further into the sunk cost side of things. They invest their time and when it comes down to the end of the evaluation they don't want to give up the last 6 months of work they've done and the production code they shipped (even though they weren't supposed to). Nor do they want to tell the other teams that were adopting on the side that they'll have to stop. \n\nSo now the product has a foothold and the contract negotiations start. Maybe the sales people go easy and it's a cheap license $20 bucks a month per dev, or 100-250k for the whole enterprise. Company leadership thinks it's a steal and worth the investment. Then after the contracts are signed the product gets slated for use in all the major parts of the company's product line. Once entrenched it will be hard and expensive to get rid of.\n\nIn the meantime the company who sold the product is BLEEDING cash because they're taking a loss in trade for higher adoption and a growing client list. The client list, even if those clients are only demoing the product, is what draws in investors and new clients. At some point though they have to start balancing the books. That means 1. Selling to a competitor 2. Increasing licensing costs. Regardless this often means big bumps to companies who are using the product after the initial contract ends and has to be renegotiated. Sometimes those bumps are massive, doubling or tripling the cost of use. Imagine if you had a floating license for 25 users spread across the company and the vendor does away with that option and starts charging by CPU/GPU use, number of requests, or volume of data, how many end-users your product interacts with, or any number of other metrics that turns a $100k license into a $1m+. Drop in the bucket for a large company maybe, but devastating to smaller companies. Plus it comes at a huge cost now if you want to switch to a comparable cheaper product because either you didn't abstract yourself enough from the service and/or you'll have to maintain contracts on two product lines for the duration of the migration process (not a simple, oh just flip this on and that off). \n\nThis is why some companies spend 5-10 years trying to get out from under old technology and some keep old technology around for decades because it's too big, too old, and too critical to swap. Plus telling the story to investors is hard without numbers to say how it will benefit the company to do such a swap. If you tell an investor \"we need to spend $2m to unwind from this stack that will now cost us $1m in licensing\" they say pay the licensing and save $1m now, they don't care about next year or even next quarter necessarily. They want their return now. If you tell them you won't make their targets this quarter with the new tech like they wanted then they'll trigger a sell off and you'll lose millions or billions in equity. \n\nThe result is you end up in shitty and expensive contracts you can't get out of or you do some calculus to do the hard thing to get onto something else. This often means cutting labor to hit quarterly targets. And you justify the labor cuts by talking up the benefits of the technology shifts you are taking on and how it will (eventually) improve productivity. \n\nWhen that doesn't happen you reorg.",

          "text": "So what im getting from this article is 12% did achieve improvements and 56% didn’t lose any money but also didnt gain any. How exactly is that a sign that AI is useless to implement? If im a business man, im just going to compare what those 12% did to what i did and adjust accordingly. I mean AI is only just recently good enough to do actual work with so of course early adoption is going to lead to a large portion of businesses not using the tech to its full effect. Everyone in the comments seems very short sighted and pessimistic because of their inherent anti-AI bias. But unless you fell for the obvious marketing hype, these numbers are really not bad. AI is a tool like every other technology. Some things are instantly helpful like the internet but other tech needs time to settle in. Actually, even the internet needed time to settle in but no one remembers that i guess",

They can’t even do a sensitivity analysis looking AI it’s efficiencies because there are so many more inefficiencies being brought to light and exemplified because of their trash hiring and firing systems that they employ. The way our economy works now is new hires make more than 10 year employees and then they get surprised when those 10 year employees finally leave and they’re just left with in adequate staff that cost a lot and it takes 4 to 5 people to do the job of that one person who just left. The American economy does not reward good workers skilled workers efficient workers. It just makes some random number the bar and punishes those who can’t meet that expectation. Everyone can’t be the most efficient worker. The bar should not be the most efficient worker that is unrealistic. Instead of doing any critical, thinking into how their labor forces are adapting to AI executive leadership are doing the same things being looking at some numbers that can give them indications on certain trends using that as an excuse to fire people or re-organize and then going from company to company doing the exact same thing while siphoning off a portion of the companies revenue as resources for them only. When companies do great employees don’t get rewarded. They get pizza parties, cupcake parties, and maybe the occasional day off but for executive employees they directly benefit monetarily when people who are not them work hard harder, more efficient meat numbers and do better every quarter. These people can’t even indicate where they would even see efficiencies from AI and yet statements like this or just thrown out there. Everything doesn’t need AI in AI won’t fix every problem, especially in the state now. Most programs are integrated with AI at most mini coding platforms are integrated with AI. It can help turn out solutions but most jobs mean work by most employees in America are not Microsoft or internet search based.  \nMost programs that employees used to do their work are either standalone applications or Internet applications that are not integrated with AI. This is another example of how leadership doesn’t even know what they’re talking about is some are going to make decisions to get rid of AI when in reality that’s not even the issue.",

          "text": "Some key issues:\n\n>Efforts to gut the federal workforce by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency significantly derailed operations at a Pentagon tech team with a key U.S. military role, according to materials reviewed by The Intercept.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Defenders of DOGE, including Musk, have claimed the project solely ferreted out fraud, waste, and abuse. But according to a December 2025 contracting memo from the Defense Information Systems Agency, DOGE’s tactics caused major problems at the Pentagon’s IT office — which is core to the operation of the U.S. military.\n>\n>The memo describes how DISA’s Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Enterprise Directorate, known as J6, was hobbled by DOGE cuts to such an extent that it was unable to obtain necessary software. This unit is responsible for maintaining secure channels that keep the Pentagon connected to military assets around the world, including nuclear capabilities.\n>\n>“During calendar year 2025, the DISA/J6 program office has been unexpectedly and significantly impacted by Government programs that incentivized personnel separation or extended periods of leave,” the memo reads, “e.g., Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments, Paid Parental Leave.”\n>\n>A second DISA memo notes that the Deferred Resignation Program resulted in the departure of an officer responsible for an important Pentagon cloud-computing contract, resulting in that contract expiring entirely. The DOGE-induced staffing shortage resulted in a situation, according to the memo, where DISA’s systems faced “extreme risk for loss of service” across the Department of Defense.\n>\n>While DISA operates behind the scenes, its globe-spanning networks are critical to the armed forces, explained DISA J6’s then-director Sharon Woods in a Pentagon-produced June 2025 interview: “Command, Control, Communications, and Computers — it is what underlies everything and the department’s ability to communicate with itself.” Asked what would happen on a day where DISA J6 couldn’t operate, Woods replied, “In my mind, it cripples the Department [of Defense]… This is really a mission where failure is not an option.”\n\nGiven how central information technology is to modern conflicts, slashing and burning the departments and people who are tasked with providing these critical connections and infrastructure is foolhardy to say the least. \n\nIt looks like this approach is almost the same approach as Elon took with Twitter when he took over. The difference here of course is that Twitter was a useful but ultimately optional social media platform for information where outages and bugs are annoying but rarely life threatening whereas with DISA there is far more at stake.",

I constantly get pumped with propaganda that I say I’m “not interested” in, full of thousands upon thousands of comments with thousands of likes saying the most vile things. It’s just getting worse, the other day I saw a few hard-rs as top comments with plenty of likes. A culture has slowly grown in which they pride themselves on being as racist/sexist/homophobic as humanly possible like gamers did in the Modern Warfare days, but just like then some of the edgelords were actually being 100% serious and so now they all are. Pictures of women, even if they’re literal children, get unbelievably sexualized and people fantasize about doing things to them in the mainstream comment sections. \n\nI’m not even gonna mention Twitter, but to me TikTok still remains the least cesspool-esque option we have.",

Today I see what that endless forgiveness and looking away does. We need a backbone to stop this hate from indoctrinating the world while the rich and powerful laugh at our despreration and deaths because to them we were never anything more than potential numbers in their bankaccount.\n\nThis is considered woke today. Woke has always been about equality, awareness and standing up for rights. If you use woke as an insult you're a biggot. We want to live together in peace as equals. How is that ever considered wrong? Why is your life worth so much more than anyone elses? \n\nIt isn't. Never will be, never has been. Money and power aren't a true indicator of how much you are worth. How much good or harm you bring does. And unless you are willing to change your path, to do good and to be better, you are worth no more than the poo underneath our shoes that made us fall ill. \n\nThis shouldn't be forgiven or forgotten. We need to learn from this. That peace is sadly something you have to fight for because if you don't it will be the wrong people taking advantidge of our want for peace just like so many are doing now. We need to stop forgiving. Stop looking away. And start giving people the punishments they deserve and never ever let them get away with this every again.",

The \"Lunarinskaya\" uranium mine collapse that occurred just outside Novosibirsk in southern Siberia has concluded with a happy ending. As you recall, thirty-five miners became trapped deep underground following a high-magnitude earthquake. But thanks to their Suslik-2 hibernation implants, the miners were able to survive without access to food and fresh water for two weeks. Fortunately, after their rescue and following a brief rest for technical evaluation, the miners were able to immediately return to work. \n\nMoving from below the earth to above it, Militech has announced plans to establish a new colony on the Red Planet. The proposed base will be subdivided into three areas - industrial, scientific, and residential. Ten residential modules are already available for purchase at a starting rate of one hundred million eurodollars. A hefty price, yes, but can you truly put a price on your security? \n\nIn New Mexico and Oklahoma, a new bout of unrest has erupted in the wake of suicide blasts at New United States bases. President Myers has openly blamed the Republic of Texas for the attacks. In a swift reprisal, NUS forces carried out a series of bombings on Texan airports in Wellington and El Paso. Although both sides have expressed a desire to avoid further escalation of the conflict, bookies have put the odds of a full-blown border war at 3 to 1. That concludes today's world news segment. Please, join us again next time.\"",

The critical question becomes not \"who made the csam?\" but \"why does it exist?\". \n\nAsking \"who\" would only catch a potential Twitter user who could have made an honest deep fake (the sarcasm is heavy here) and the user didn't intend for the generated image to be 30% from actual csam that was fed into grok.\n\nAsking \"who\" could also not find the customers of the illicit material, as it could have potentially been digitally sent and perhaps fed into another ai to be more edited. \n\nThere are so many difficult things to unwind from that it would take investigators years to find each and every perv. But by that time, those years of only payed users still being able to create the same stuff would continue to proliferate. \n\nThe most obvious thing to do is to turn off the feature and have the logs be made public, so the criminals can be stopped. And a precedent lawsuit for grok so other llm's would be scared straight so they don't make *millions of illegal images*",

The fact that it can make porn at all let alone child porn means they designed it specifically to be able to make porn and specifically hold those already existing porn images the AI uses on their servers. The fact Elon hasn’t shut Grok down to investigate and fix the issue means he is 100% complicit. He wants people making these images. Because he knows he can’t be touched.

                  "text": "This is part of the natural Silicon Valley cycle rotation. Silicon Valley investors have the expectation that most ideas fail but that 1 out of 20 is worth 100x the value so by stacking the occasional good bet on a bunch of bad bets they will eventually end up ahead. Also the major players in Silicon Valley are worried that their existing business would be worthless if the promise of AI is realized so they are in an arm’s race to outspend their competitors with the hopes that they can win the arms race. Therefore there is a self fulfilling problem that tech companies need to outspend each other to justify their share prices, but investors keep pouring money into the shares of these companies which causes them to spend more building the next model and next AI center so that investors will choose their company. The companies then need to justify their share price by promising even greater future revenue that will come eventually. Microsoft is no longer selling an operating system and software suite but they are selling the ability for entire industries to become dependent on computers and programming that they own and then can make people dependent on their technology.\n\nThe Silicon Valley model for the companies that are building AI since the advent of the Internet has been to give their product away for free until they create a user base they can exploit and either charge a monthly fee or selling ads through harvesting personal data. However systems like AI require so much more computing power to run. Which means that they require factory sized buildings that allow them to operate at optimal temperatures. Running the equipment and keeping them at the optimum temperatures is incredibly energy intensive and new facilities are being build faster than new he energy capacity to run these facilities. This is why energy costs rise. The companies are operating at a loss because they need to train new models (basically letting an entire warehouse of computers become better at recognizing parameters) and because each prompt takes an incredible amount of processing power. AI is going to try to make money however they can, but the costs that have gone into building each model and data center makes the costs astronomically too high to become profitable through a monthly subscription or ad based model. So they need to promise to solve problems that would justify enough revenue to cover their investment costs. \n\nIMO the main issue we are seeing with AI today is that the majority of gains in the stock market are coming from companies attached to AI and the US economy is largely being propped up by spending to build AI infrastructure. This creates incentives for everyone to want the technology to succeed at any costs because a failure of the technology means that the entire stock market craters and the economy suddenly looks stagnant. Therefore government doesn’t want to regulate AI, large corporations don’t want to say they can’t justify the cost, and the companies building the technology can’t say that they’re essentially burning more money while getting less returns. AI will solve some problems, but I don’t see how the current trajectory of industry will be able to justify enough investment or become profitable in the near term.",

AI-generated pictures are cute and all...  But I'm not sure that warrants all the money being poured into this endeavor.  Show me something impressive.  Something amazing.  Something Earth-shaking.\n\n> Workers should learn AI skills and companies should use it because it's a \"cognitive amplifier,\" claims Satya Nadella.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with that \"cognitive amplifier\" bit...  I mean, yeah, in theory it can correlate a lot of data...  But we've got two major problems with that in a useful, productive sense.\n\n1)  AI still hallucinates.  It's still just basically pattern-matching.  It doesn't actually *understand* anything.  This routinely results in garbage output - so everything has to be checked for accuracy.\n\n2)  People often misunderstand what AI is/does.  They *think* it understands things.  They trust its output, don't check it for accuracy, and wind up using bad data to make bad decisions.\n\nThis combination makes me incredibly skeptical of how much cognitive amplification is happening.  I suspect people are putting just as much time/effort into the work with AI as without...  It's just maybe shifting the workflow from correlating data to verifying results.  Or maybe to remediating damage.\n\n---\n\nI don't **hate** AI.  I use agentic tools like OpenCode almost daily...  But it's not really saving me a lot of cognitive work.  I'm still having to carefully understand what I'm trying to accomplish, how the codebase works, what the issue is and where it's coming from, what the resulting code does...  It's basically saving me the actual typing and generally avoiding stupid syntactic errors.  But my output hasn't suddenly doubled thanks to AI.\n\nAnd this is in a very specific, very AI-friendly context.  Writing code is very pattern-based.  We've got strict rules about what does/doesn't work.  We've got a carefully-curated repository of code to reference.  We've got error logs and test suites to verify the output.\n\nI can't imagine trying to do anything useful with AI in a less-structured context.",

There are no regulations on it. There is no wide spread practical use for it yet. It does good work on a lot of tasks but not enough to justify the amount of money being pumped into it and the infrastructure it needs. \n\nNow we just have this bubble that’s going to pop unless someone makes something world changing with it in the next few years. \n\nHad they not made it a buzz word with empty promises so fast this entire invention would be a lot more amazing. \n\nIt’s most common use at the moment is just a really fast Google search. It’s great but it’s missing the intelligence part of artificial intelligence. It’s only as good as what it can find. It cannot differentiate between good info, old info, and misinformation.

They hesitate to tell you “no.”\n\nAs someone that also works in the tech sector you see a wave of posts of young engineers in a panic of “help me, I can’t code without AI.

Maybe they could've built tools that supplemented the artist or musician's workflow if they'd bothered to ask them, but they tried to leapfrog over them entirely. Because of all this, AI does not allow anyone to stand tall on the shoulders of giants.

That toothpaste isn't going back in the tube. We have to hope they don't come up with use-cases that ruin the world. Maybe if the economic crash that follows the AI bubble is dire enough it'll force a wave of legislation that curbs large data center proliferation.

Google and Nvidia can pivot. But LLM’s were a magic trick that should never have happened.\n\nI made an unsupervised learning tool with data sets in my 2014 AI class as part of my bscs. We thought it was magic and the only limitation was the data you can feed it. Enter OpenAI and Microsoft scraping copyrighted material to create GPT-3. \n\nLogarithmic returns means this technology will always result in average results with unpreventable hallucinations. It’s been in scientific papers throughout all the fanboys. It’s not proper to replace automation that is 99.99% accurate with something that specializes in everything and is good at nothing.\n\nIntelisense has been running code completion at a higher acceptance rate than LLM’s when they started; showing that the technology existed without LLM’s scraping broken and abandoned projects. LLM’s found design patterns, but if you were doing multi-line cursor inserts and using Intellisense, adding an LLM like copilot slows you down.\n\nThe industry has to reduce standards to let AI LLM’s be helpful. Microsoft knew this first as it offshored thousands of jobs to India including their AI engineers. And they were positioned to be the main proprietor of OpenAI, but tossed AI in their products and lost market share.\n\nNow you have OpenAI, xAI, and Meta putting up data centers and it feels like the rockets club of yesteryear. Rich, nonintellectual, men trying to rush nuclear reactors to run their graphics card rigs to build a better LLM. I don’t know a single engineer who bets on this or heavily invests in AI companies. \n\nThey might be wrong. \n\nBecause as another poster has pointed out- we’ve funded their development through subscriptions, but the product never turned helpful besides rewriting emails for people who have the time to write, proofread, and analyze prompts before sending that email. There’s no business case. \n\nChina, alternatively, poked a hole in AI with Deepseek. Showed you could do it for a couple $million. Their society has continued to push for automation over AI and ours is sitting patiently waiting for Mark Zuckerburg to figure it out while his main business is drowning in AI generated news, pics, and videos.",
