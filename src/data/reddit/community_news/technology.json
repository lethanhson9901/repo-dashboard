How would Elon know Trump was involved in sorted stuff with Epstein? And why would Elon have been silent about it and ok with it for so long? And why would he then delete his tweet and never talk about it again?\n\nElon being a pedophile creep, just like Trump, is the least surprising news ever. I just hope we get a real investigation and people finally go to jail, but it'll have to be after the Trump admin is out of office. By last count, we are currently up to eight Trump admin members being named in the files as visiting Epstein's island.",

You’ll owe at least 2.5% import duty, state use tax when you register it, and fees. The real problem is compliance and tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese cars that will be sold in Canada are not certified to U.S. DOT (FMVSS) and EPA standards, which means you’d need a Registered Importer to modify and certify it, often $10k+ or outright impossible. On top of that, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to Section 301 tariffs, which for EVs can effectively double the vehicle’s cost (100%+ duty).\n\nUnless the car is 25+ years old (exempt) or already U.S.-certified, you can easily end up paying more in tariffs and compliance than the car is worth. As mentioned in the begininng, it’s usually not worth it.",

Our national neighbors to the north have already caved, setting off alarm bells in some U.S. operations, and now NADA is hoping to amplify that warning.\n\nGo absolutely fuck yourselves drive.com. Canada didn’t cave on shit. \n\nThe Biden administration wanted to put tariffs on Chinese EVs, but thought it would be even better to have North America united as a bloc on those tariffs. So Canada imposed the exact same tariffs, despite the fact that NA EVs are almost exclusively in the American market. \n\nChina imposed disproportionately heavy tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports. Because they recognized that Canada wasn’t benefiting from the EV tariffs the same way America was. So Canada took the biggest hit, and got the smallest benefit. But we stood by our decision. \n\nThen Trump tariffed us, told us he didn’t need us, threatened to invade us, and members of his government started having meetings with Alberta separatists to break up our country. \n\nSo Canada said “why are we taking this hit for Americans if this is how they treat us?” Carney made a deal to lessen the Chinese EV tariffs and remove the hurt on our agricultural exports. THAT ONLY EXISTED BECAUSE WE WERE BEING GOOD ALLIES TO AMERICANS!!!!\n\nFuck all you people.",

Some people consider this to mean they are \"enabled by default\", because to them any mention of AI whatsoever, having a \"do you want this?\" prompt means it's on.\n\nThis is also misleading though, at least for the link preview thing. You make it sound like they show you a \"do you want this?\" prompt once then hide it if you say \"no\". In reality the AI \"key points\" thing always shows up in the link preview even if it's disabled, and if you click it it will tell you it cannot work because it's disabled. The only way I could ever find to completely remove it is to disable link previews completely, even though they work fine without AI \"Key Points\".\n\nI think it's very hard to argue that it's \"off by default\" if I can't turn it off individually without disabling another feature even by manual action. I would agree that the current design is actually somewhere in the middle, but it's definitely hostile and annoying.\n\nI really hope this new AI killswitch actually disables prompts for all upcoming AI features as claimed and isn't a similar \"you can disable it except it will keep popping up anyway\" kind of thing. If any of the new AI features are actually good I'll find out about them and enable it, like the built-in translation which is actually a good use of ML IMO.",

Global Entry/Pre are revenue generating sources for getting around the  TSA/HS generated problem of delaying access to your paid transportation because they didn't enforce the existing laws once 25 years ago. \n\n\nSo now if enough citizens complain about overreach and make it to the secret Naughty List, maybe they'll soon offer PrePrePre for $3k a year to make you only have to run the final three blocks to the gate before missing your connection because they decided to 'randomly' screen you on a connecting flight. Joy.\n\n\nA traveler having their travel experience (that they paid for, in both cash and privacy) diminished because some masked thug scanned her plates while she watched others engage in intimidation is embarrassing. If you're so ashamed of your job that you're afraid to show your face, maybe the problem isn't the observer. \n\n\nThis nonsense is punitive and petty retaliation. It makes me sad to have no faith in our legislative for recognizing it or our judicial for correcting it.",

Also told my supervisor that it was their job to already know the answers to the questions I was being asked. Then I said that if they contacted me again before my leave was up I was going to file a case against them with the labour board. And finally said I was disgusted by the lack of basic human decency. \n\nI talked to my doctor about how stressed out I was and my medical leave was extended from two weeks to six months, which entitled me to six months of half pay Employment Insurance. I am up for retirement months before my medical leave ends. I provided a return to work date so my position has to be held for my return which I am not compelled to do. So now instead of gutting it out for a few months until I retirement I retired early, and because I went on medical leave while still working I get Employment Insurance benefits on top of my pension.\n\nIf that message from my supervisor had not pushed me over the edge I would not have ended up in a much better financial position which included early retirement and me witnessing karma in action.",

Common sense and decency are fatal to conservative ideology. Literally can't have either and want what conservatives have been selling. Even the non-racist stuff like their trickle down tax policies fall apart after a person's first math lesson. The average 1st grader is like \"they said 2-1= 5? That doesn't make any sense!\" which is why the right wing fights so hard against education and the teaching of problem solving skills.

That is, if we fix the problems like executive overreach, ICE and DHS, restore the 4th amendment that protects us from unreasonable search and seizure etc...

In this case it's entirely individual employee donations (they have ~200k) under the then federal maximum of $3,000, so entirely worthless as some sort of demotivational \"both sides\" evidence that Alphabet controlled Harris. Also there's no accelerationist silver-lining to Trump coming to power.

They wrote an 8-page suicide note...surely that wasn't the only thing in there.\n\nI went looking for some other articles about this and found some other interesting tidbits:\n\n* The girls dropped out of school in 2020, 5-6 years ago. They weren't doing well in school when they were attending. [This source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) claims the girls dropped out because their father was deeply in debt and could no longer afford to send them.\n* The family lived in a gated community and none of their neighbors knew them. One said “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents.\"\n* According to one source, the girls never had their own phone - they were using their parents' phone to get online. And the parents didn't just take the phone away - they also threatened to marry off the girls.\n* The father, Chetan Kumar, actually has two wives who are sisters. The source linked above says \"two of his partners walked out\" and disappeared for a few days; he filed a missing persons report and they came back within a few days. (Unclear if those two are the same as the two wives...)\n* [This source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece) says there wasn't even any evidence of a game found on the device(s) they were using, and said that they mostly cited TV shows. But [this source ](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2026/02/04/three-sisters-jump-to-their-death-after-parents-cut-off-their-video-gaming-time/)says evidence was found on their devices of long gaming sessions (and also contradicts the other article, which said they didn't have their own phones). However, literally no one has been able to name the game itself, and the description of the game changes from source to source - some say it's a \"love game\" (I assume a dating sim), others a task-based game, and one even claimed that the last task in the game was suicide.\n* Although the suicide note does mention their love of gaming and Korean culture, it also talks about the girls' loneliness. Interesting how that hasn't become part of any of the headlines.\n* Their diary/suicide note also [referenced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) beatings (\"Did we live in this world to get beaten by you… death would be better for us than beatings.\")",

The phone was taken away two weeks ago, and sold. There was ongoing conflict about their obsession with Korean culture, and the quote from their writings published in that article is about him taking that away from them, in general, not the phone, or the phone game specifically. The father is quoted as saying: *\"All three girls wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour towards us changed and they went into a shell. They lived in their own world.\"* \n\n\nThere were also apparently writings found on the walls of the room, relating to their loneliness. They were not homeschooled, and they didn't interact with neighbourhood kids either. \n\n\nOh, and they're actually half sisters - and also cousins? Idk if that's the right word for it, but their father lives with and claims marriage to 3 sisters, with the eldest sister being his first wife. Biologically, one of the girls had one mother, the other two had another. There are 2 surviving siblings. ",

The way this is being reported (as of now) is setting off my alarms that those girls were likely dealing with a much more concerning reality than a mere loss of access to a game. Especially the fact that the eldest daughter was part of it all. Generally speaking, whether pressured to or not, eldest daughters tend to take on a secondary mothering role to younger siblings. If death seemed to be preferable to whatever life she and her siblings were facing as a result of losing contact with the outside world, I think that's a pretty big sign that the conditions of their daily life need to be looked into.",

The three sisters last attended Green Valley School, where their academic performance was sub-par,” said the officer.\n\nInside the gated society, several neighbours told The Hindu that they only knew the family from a distance. “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents,” said Gaurav Kohli, a neighbour.\n\nRahul Jha, the secretary of the apartment who accompanied the police during the investigation, told The Hindu that he learnt the family faced financial troubles. “The family lived on rent, and they did not speak to anyone much or participate in any activities. A day before this happened, Mr. Kumar handed me ₹700 for maintenance, but he never delayed any payment,” M.R. Jha said.\n\nAt present, the police have recovered Ms. Sujata’s cell phone and sent it for forensic analysis. The police have also seized the handwritten note left by the girls. ***The DCP said that a case has not been registered yet as the parents have not filed a complaint.***\n\n😒\n https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece",

According to news reports the police have the device(s) the girls were using to play the game. How could you not just pull the name of the game from whatever app they were using? Their suicide note was 8 pages and contained specific references to other Korean and East Asian TV shows, anime, manga, singers and groups - which they called out by name - but not the actual game they were playing?\n\nI call bullshit.",

Exemptions are typically only granted under rather extraordinary circumstances.\n\nApparently the reason he wanted to enter Canada was to attend a TED talk in Vancouver.\n\nBut, here's where things get pretty interesting, at least to me, is that other documents suggest he was able to enter Canada in 2014.\n\nIt's not clear if he applied for and received the same type of permit, or if he was here illegally, but I find both concerning- the former actually more than the latter.\n\nIf he got the exemption, that's very troubling to me, because if so the only difference between 2014 and 2018 would be which political party was \"in charge\" at the time; 2014 it was Harper and the Conservatives; 2018 was Trudeau and the Liberals. But in both cases his 2008 indictment would have made him inadmissable except in rather extraordinary circumstances.\n\nI hope Occam's razor applies here and he simply entered illegally. But, with everything- well, I can't help but lend myself to conspirational thinking, and it really makes me wonder about the possibility that the CPC, like the American Republican Party, have links to Epstein. PP's Trumpsucking certainly doesn't disavow me of the notion. Back then, did they let him in the country on purpose? Did they pull strings to allow him a permit? Was it planned? Was he trafficking in Canada, too? did he have Canadian victims? Were Conservative politicians in Canada participating in this? were they blackmailed to allow the exemption?\n\nAmid all this we have a rather brutal irony as well, in that the exemption process was partly created specifically to provide protection and assistance to victims of human trafficking and abuse.",

But projects die on the vine without expertise, funding, and interoperability. And governments beating their chests about \"sovereignty\" simply aren't donating in amounts that affirm their statements on the importance of it.\n\n  \nFor example, there's a reason Rust is all over the major open source projects right now, and it isn't because it is more popular than C/C++/etc.. It's because Big Tech is forcing it by way of their paid employees who sit on, and steer, governance boards for open source projects. It's risky to say here because so many people treat it like a political statement. It is, but from a corporate-influence standpoint where the minor change in license and the control over compilers lets them really put their hands around the neck of any project they wish.\n\n  \nSo what are seeing now is that Tech firms embed their employees into governance -> governance decides to stop supporting X technology in favor of Y (which just so happens to align with the Tech firms' financial interest and own corporate mandates) -> forced disassociation and repudiation of forks.  \n\n\n\nTech firms have totally taken over a few keystone groups who are able to force corporate-demanded changes in other projects via threat of disassociation. It sometimes gets covered here on an American political level, but that's just a distraction from the corporate takeover of open source in reality (not intentional, but easier for emotional people to focus on rather than the insidious corporate maneuvers happening in front of them inside of projects).\n\n  \n\"Use Open Source\" is basically the 2026 version of this sub's cry to \"use Firefox.\" Sounds good on the surface, but it isn't a panacea because corporate interests are unfortunately prevailing. Just in a less upfront way unless one is actually deeply involved in open source both as a user and contributor.\n\n  \nI don't trust any project effectively run by Alphabet/IBM/Apple/Oracle/etc.. And yet, those are the same projects these supposedly sovereign governments are turning to. And the same projects people here are beating their chests about using, while the paid corporate employees push ahead with EEE.",

He’s got a bunker in Hawaii, meaning somewhere in his mind be believes that his behavior will cause a lot of harm to the world. The American government has pretty explicitly stated that they are targeting people for innate characteristics too, whether that be race, medical history, nationality, or personal beliefs. Honestly it’s probably like, 80% of Americans they’re targeting on some level\n\nGiven all that, why on Earth would I ever willingly give any of my data over to Zuck?

Elon's nazi salute was shocking and unnacceptable, but since I never used any of his products, it didn't change anything for me personally. I just assumed from that moment that everyone using X or buying his cars was complicit of the rise of a new fascism. \n\nNot so long after that, I started noticing a shift in Instagram with more ragebait, more fake accounts commenting extreme opinions, more ads, more AI generated content... What's the point of spending time there if at the end of the day it just makes me angry ? It felt kind of clear the algorithm was tailored to divide people and I ended up deleting my account.\n\nAside of that, I'm a long time Windows user and the obsolescence of every version feels so forced (one could say it's programmed???), each getting worse with every update... Also the fact that Bill Gates was recently mentioned in the epstein files truly disgusts me. I may finally take the plunge on Linux soon\n\nThen Google which feels more and more like a giant spyware network every day. There's something about that company I don't trust at all (also because of the hard push of AI features), because I imagine it's working hand in hand with Palantir and god when you put all the pieces together it quickly gets creepy\n\nIn general, I am watching all the US tech take a part in the rise of a new fascist regime, and that's not something I want to support, with neither my money or my time... I'm trying to talk about it around me, my family, my friends, etc. and I imagine I'm not the only one, but I also imagine there's a big majority that is too comfortable with the paradigm in place to be willing to change their habits. The EU seems like it's finally acknowledging that the lack of alternatives may be dangerous for us, and it gives me hope somehow",

We *appear* to have a lot of product choice, but they're all owned by just a few firms in every industry. As a result, there really isn't any competition. This drives prices up and wages down. \n\nIf you need proof, just go look at the average S&P500 profit *margin* over time. It's basically doubled in the last 2 decades. Note that I said profit margin, not dollar amount. If the margin of the average corporation is going up, that means they have price power, which means there is less meaningful competition. \n\nYou might be tempted to say it's just a reflection of higher margin business, like software. But that's wrong, because if there was meaningful competition in those spaces then the prices would go down, reducing the margins. Instead, the boost in productivity that high margin business like software commands is passed along to shareholders instead of customers. If there were competitive markets, that value would transfer to customers.",

Systems used to require gateway software to access the internet, you controlled when the gateway was on. Now?

That's not the point I'm trying to make, you should still have access to the internet without every component and software installed on your computer constantly phoning home, but that's always been part of the plan.

Their “security” system was that each city had a few people who personally knew each other. They never talked about their work on the phone or wrote anything down. Their national leader was a young man who lived entirely off-grid and basically had no recorded address or bank account or anything like that. He did not own a car, and traveled by hopping on and off freight trains. When he went to a city where members of the group were, he would look for a little notebook hidden someplace (like a hollow tree or an abandoned car). The notebook would just indicate the time of the next meeting (in a simple code). No substantial info about who would attend or what would be discussed. The group was discovered by a federal agent working undercover within the voluntarily homeless, dumpster diving (“freegan”) community.",

The infiltrations into signal are primarily due to lax security by the users, not the protocol itself. I'm willing to bet they have ways of breaking open signal chats, but I would be surprised if they did not require physical access to the device to do so.\n\n\nIf you have biometric authentication, turn that shit off. Make sure your phone's passkey is not just 4 digits that happen to be some form of your birthday. \n\n\nPractice better security. Perhaps don't speak plainly in your messages to others if you are discussing something you may not want the federal government to know. \n\n\nIf you are going to be engaging in protests, think about leaving your phone behind or get a burner that you only use for recording and is mostly removed from your identity. \n\n\nSecurity is often described as an onion. Signal is only one layer.\n\nEDIT: Something I forgot. If your phone has been confiscated by LE of any flavor, it should no longer be considered safe. Intelligence agencies and defense contractors have developed software that can root a phone and then return it to normal state. The device will remain compromised and may even periodically report back to the hackers. This is one way that signal message groups can be broken. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellebrite",

I remember years ago when I was a Detective and I had attended a training seminar pertaining to online predator “hunting” / locating adults online that were engaging in grooming tactics with children. \n\nDuring the training, there was a segment on facial recognition technology. The instructor was saying that Facebook had better FRT than the FBI and to prove it, the instructor presented a video of fans leaving an arena after an NHL championship final game. As fans were leaving, they were being recorded from a camera on a building across the street from the arena. As soon as they were in view of the camera (pretty much as they exited the arena) FB’s technology was identifying them by name, like “tagging” them as one does when making a FB post. The instructor then used the FBI’s tech with the same exact video, and the results were staggering in that FB had faster and superior FRT than the Feds. \n\nThe point being is that social media companies and the Feds have been studying this technology for years, w/o letting us know that in a way, we are being recorded, and identified, rather quickly, without our consent. \n\nI had retired from law enforcement in 2016, but had been medically forced to stop working in 2015. I was a Detective until the end of 2014 (had went back to being a patrol officer for nearly a year before I got injured). I bring this up because I cannot remember the exact year that I went to this training. I believe however that I would have attended this training around 2010’ish or slightly before as I became “that guy” for our agency after a major predator case I handled that began in 2007, ending in 2008ish. After that case, the agency started sending me to specialized training - different training sessions for a couple of years.",

What makes this particularly effective is that each layer was built for a different purpose--facial recognition for finding missing persons, Palantir for counterterrorism, geofencing for marketing--but when combined, they create a persistent surveillance capability that didn't require any new technology. It's the integration that's new, not the tools. The legal gap is that most of these data sources are technically \"public\" or were collected with user consent (buried in app terms of service), so Fourth Amendment protections don't clearly apply. Courts are still figuring out whether aggregating public data at this scale constitutes a search.",

The VPN is another layer of protection so that they can’t track down your location by your IP address. Just doing those two things makes it a lot more difficult for someone to associate any political comments/posts you make with your personal information. There might be ways to still figure out who you are, but it would take a lot of effort and someone looking to doxx people is just going to move onto an easier target.

The calculation of social media in 2016 as a vector for conducting successful psyops on the general public and AI, particularly Palantir, in 2020 was a now-or-never moment for these bad actors. They HAD to win the 2024 election to prevent the possibility of being regulated out of existence and so the bet was made that while the moment was imperfect, the time was now to double-down on AI and pray it would deliver Project 2025 to a level of success that would crush opposition.\n\nIt‘s important to understand because now everybody realizes the threat, but it was always sitting there right in the open for anyone to see whose eyes weren’t blinded. So if you didn’t see the threat then or you didn’t vote or you voted with luxury on a non-winnable third-party, take this as a wakeup call. Far too late, but since we’re still alive step it TF up and do something more to defend what’s left.",

They will have made the US a much weaker, less preferred trading partner, and will eventually crash the dollar. They will drive up poverty, homelessness, and health related issues, which will increase crime. Things *will* become less safe for these elites, and they will ultimately have less power and their fortunes worth far less due to being accounted for in US currency. It honestly would not surprise me if the more logical assholes behind all of this have been secretly planning how to de-escalate this situation once Trump is dead and he cannot turn his rabid base on them.",

These billionaires want you to believe that the reason things are bad for us every day Americans and why affordability is low is because of the 20 million (so they claim) undocumented people in our land. Let's do some math.\n\nThose hypothetical 20 million people would need to be taking in $125,000 in services, housing and other costs *per person* in order to be doing as much harm as these 10 individuals are by their wealth hoarding. If you spent the $125k on these 20 million people, their dollars go back into their communities, creating jobs and opportunities throughout the country. \n\nIf you expand it to the top 100 individuals, they have a combined \\~$6.3 Trillion hoarded. There are 100 people with over $11.7 BILLION dollars in the US. That's higher than the GDP of Japan ($4.1T) and three times the GDP of Canada ($2.1T). There are nearly 1000 people with a net worth over $1B, giving the top 1000 earners a combined net worth of $8.2T.\n\nThe US has about $160 trillion in private wealth. These 1,000 people (0.0003% of the population) hold over 5% of the nation's wealth. 5% of the nations population is 16.5 million people. That's between the population of Pennsylvania (13M, 5th most populated state) and New York (20M, 4th most populated state). Think about that for a second. \n\nLet's say you get lucky and you find a job that pays you $100,000 per hour. Surely, you would joint his list, right? Working 40 hours a week, you would only make $208m per year. Elon Musk saw his net worth balloon to over $700B recently, earning him over $300B in just one year. That is the equivalent of earning over $34.2 million dollars **per hour**...for every single one of the 8,760 hours in a year, whether he's taking a shit, shitposting on X, or shitting on the American people. \n\nThat means that Elon Musk earned $1m every two minutes. Making $50k a year, around the median personal wage, you would need to work 20 years to earn what Musk earned in 2 minutes.\n\n**The combined net worth of the top 1000 richest people grew by over $1 trillion dollars in 2025. Do you know how much we spent on SNAP, Unemployment, housing assistance and child tax credits? $650 billion. They are telling you that the problem is all of these welfare queens and undocumented people while they are stealing nearly double that.** \n\nSo you tell me? Who is robbing us? The people who occasionally use a social service like welfare, the undocumented people sending their children to school and driving on our public roads, or the uber wealthy? Even if you assume there are 50 million leeches in this country (about 15% of the population), they would each need to be costing us over $20,000 to match the wealth hoarded by these monsters.\n\nAnd the sad part is that they are not done yet. They will never have enough. They will not stop until you die.",

An oligopoly is like a monopoly but with a few players instead of just one. But it's still anti-competitive, because they often act as a cartel and we get the exact same downsides as a monopoly.\n\nHow do we measure whether an industry is an oligopoly or not? Well, the common way is if one industry member died, how big would the effect be on the market? Using an analogy, if a grocery store closed, if people can just use the grocery store next to it, it's not a big deal, but if there are no grocery stores nearby, people are deeply affected.\n\nSo in a perfectly competitive system, no entity should be able to negatively affect the entire market in such a dramatic way.\n\nBillionaires, can buy ENTIRE industries and delete them from existence, for the lulz if they want.\n\nThere is no good argument why any INDIVIDUAL should be able to affect the market in such a dramatic way, the same way no one entity should in a market. It's unhealthy, it's anti-competitive, and it's bad for everyone.\n\nThis of course is only referring to a billionaire's affect on the market, of course, in the US of A, we decided money = speech, so billionaires can just buy entire governments if they want to. There's no argument to why they should be able to do that.\n\nThank you for coming to my 'fuck billionaires and all their defenders' TED talk.",

          "text": ">23\nDonald Trump and his allies raised a record $429mn in donations last year, as tech billionaires and companies lobbying for policy changes helped build a war chest for the president ahead of the midterm elections.\nA single political action committee controlled by Trump allies, Maga Inc, is sitting on $304mn — more than any Pac has ever held heading into a midterm election year, FT analysis found. The sum is tens of millions more than any group connected to the Democratic Party has on hand.\nThe haul, highly unusual for a term-limited president who can no longer fund his own campaign, proves that Trump continues to dominate his party, even as polling shows some swing voters have soured on the president over his immigration crackdown and foreign interventions.\nIt also underlines megadonors’ eagerness to bankroll an administration that has championed the crypto and AI industries, axed or eased regulations and ended legal probes into political allies.\nTrump has not indicated how he will deploy his financial firepower, but allies have already used separate funds to go after Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who has clashed with the president over budget bills and the release of the Epstein files.\nSuper Pacs such as Maga Inc can raise unlimited funds but cannot co-ordinate directly with campaigns.\nIf Trump and his allies do decide to fund loyal candidates in the midterm elections, they have “a lot of money to potentially spend on a handful of competitive Senate and House races,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. Trump could also use the funds “to make himself politically relevant after he leaves the White House,” Conant added.\nIn the past few months, Maga Inc has raised tens of millions of dollars from the crypto and AI industries, as well as from investors and corporations with business before the White House.\nThe largest disclosed contribution came from crypto exchange Crypto.com, which funnelled $30mn into Trump’s main Pac last year. An investigation into the company by the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched during the Biden administration, was closed in March 2025. Crypto.com has also inked several deals with crypto businesses run by Trump’s family.\nA spokeswoman for Crypto.com said the company had been “engaged in discussions regarding the culmination of the SEC’s investigation against the company prior to President Trump’s inauguration” and an agreement had been reached during the Biden administration.\nThe White House referred questions to Maga Inc, which said: “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, Maga Inc will have the resources to help candidates who support President Trump’s America First agenda of securing our border, keeping our streets safe, supercharging our economy, and making life more affordable for all Americans.”\nOther significant donors included Greg Brockman, the co-founder and president of OpenAI, who gave $12.5mn to the group in December, while his wife Anna donated a further $12.5mn.\nBrockman has also backed a group lobbying for restrictions on state AI regulations and funding campaigns against candidates who favour stricter rules for the sector. He has visited the White House in recent months.\nIn December, Brockman, who had never before spent large sums on politics, wrote that his contributions were made to show “support for policies that advance American innovation and constructive dialogue between government and the technology sector”.\nInvestor Jeff Yass, a long-time political donor, gave a total of $16mn to Maga Inc in 2025. His trading firm Susquehanna has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, which the Trump administration helped to avoid a US ban in a deal that favoured existing shareholders.\nFounders of venture capital powerhouse A16Z, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, each gave $3mn to Maga Inc last year. Their company has been at the forefront of lobbying efforts to pass legislation that would benefit crypto start-ups and has led efforts to thwart states from continuing to pass a patchwork of AI legislation.\nTrump signed an executive order in December ordering his administration to review state-level AI laws and threatening to withhold federal funds from states that pass “onerous” legislation. Andreessen celebrated its signing, writing “It’s time to win AI”.\nYass and A16Z did not respond to requests for comment.\nTobacco company RAI Services donated a total of $3mn to Maga Inc in 2025, after the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era plan to ban menthol cigarettes and flavoured cigars. \nExtremity Care donated $5mn to Maga Inc last year, while its co-owners Scott Madden and Oliver Burckhardt also donated $2.5mn apiece. So did its affiliated companies Collie Paw Holding and Buco One.\nA Biden-era plan to limit Medicare coverage of paper-thin bandages made from human tissue was paused by the Trump administration soon after the donations. Extremity Care is a leading provider of the bandages.\nRAI Services and Extremity Care did not respond to requests for comment.\nMore than $21mn of Maga Inc’s haul came from a group called Securing American Greatness, a so-called “dark money” group which does not disclose donors.\nAside from attracting corporate donors, Trump has received donations from individuals looking for clemency.\nIn one example, Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian banker charged with bribing Puerto Rico’s governor, was pardoned earlier this month after his daughter Isabela Herrera donated a total of $3.5mn to Maga Inc since Trump’s re-election. Velutini did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump also remains by far the largest magnet for cash from individual donors. The president’s joint fundraising committee attracted tens of millions of dollars in donations made via WinRed in 2025, according to FEC records, eclipsing all other Republican fundraising vehicles.\n“Trump is the only thing that gets Republican voters excited,” strategist Conant said. “He is really the motivating factor within the party right now and that is reflected in the fundraising.”",

Yes, Tolkien devised these languages pretty much single-handedly (at least as far as they got before he wrote LOTR), but the fruits of philology aren't treated as intellectual property the same way as the products of fiction are. I can't claim ownership of words I made up like \"salientize\" or \"salienate\" (meaning \"to make something more noticeable or attention-grabbing\") even though it doesn't look like anyone has ever published anything with those words before, because they are obvious and natural conclusions of philological development. It would be different if Tolkien just made those languages up from scratch with his imagination, but he basically \"discovered\" them in the ether of fictional reality and brought enough receipts for other people to check his work.",

They seem to keep profiles around forever even when the person cancels their account. So many dead profiles.",

It's all rotten, elites will do anything to realize their goals, they will allow most disgusting things and they won't care about law or ethics. When we notice something weird, suspicious, it might be not just coincidence, it might be part of some psy-op, and now we have empirical evidence that's the case with 4chan or Reddit, it's no longer just conspiracy theory.\n\nNow take a look at democracy, be it US or other country. Is there even democracy in this spectacle? Personally, I don't believe it exists anymore. I don't believe that democracy can exist in this system, because elites are writing the rules, they shape what we think, they have power over our lives and they keep us disempowered, blind, ignorant.\n\nThink about history. Historical events that seem barbaric, alien, we learn about them and think that it wouldn't happen today, because this time it's different, we progressed as civilization, right? We choose explanation that is safe and cozy, because in that way we don't have to face brutal reality.",

That was thoughtful engineering. The BMW has the volume button and the infotainment dial at two different ends and then a recessed gear shifter. The lag between the iPhone and the infotainment system is substantial. When it snows, the trunk door will drop a significant amount of snow into the trunk when opening. \n\nIn general, the BMW is poorly designed for its having such a strong market share.

Instead of one central location to do all the work there are a bunch of small spots that require a crane to get to. And cranes have stand down wind ratings, and they are always built where it’s windy. I couldn’t imagine the massive pain it would be to maintain them off shore.  \n\nLifecycle cost is an important metric to measure and consider.

This was \"destructive\" scanning because the book is destroyed in the process. The pages are intact, but the customer never wanted them back, that's the whole reason they wanted their books scanned - to save space.\n\nSo I hope that's what they're talking about, the simple fact that it's hard to scan a bound book without destroying it.

          "text": "So I wrote a book.  It’s sold over 70,000 copies between print and e-book over the past 10 years.  The publisher holds the copyright and I get royalty for every book sold.  Retail is 18.99 USD.  I receive $1.20 per book sold.  \n\nRecently I was invited to join the class-action suit against Anthropic.  It had nothing to do with buying my book and destroying the binding.  \n\nAs I understand the suit, it’s that my writing, language and story (under copyright) will be used without my consent (or even knowledge till lately, as I was unaware of this) and uncompensated, to create a product/service that will make a shit ton of money for someone else who is utilizing my — again— copy written work.\n\nCan someone explain to me how a book I wrote - let’s be more specific: the sentence structure, cadence, word choices, metaphors, narrative tone, voice, story, plot, sub-plots etc etc which I created as a human and have contractually agreed to sell to other humans and their institutions can now have no claim to compensation when a company takes all that, feeds it into AI and then makes money off my work via the AI product?  \n\n I’m reading this thread and wondering if there are authors here who’d like to weigh in who’ve had their work used by for profit entities without consent and compensation.  \n\nNot without fault myself as my music back when came from the high seas.  I still bought music directly, and I never saw pirates as making money off torrents.  I also have seen sites where my book can be downloaded in what appears to be a free platform, and that does’t bother me.  If someone can’t afford to buy, I’d rather have them read it as I believe my book has value to others (it’s a memoir and many tell me it’s helped them).\n\nI did join the lawsuit.  I’m opposed to a company co-opting my work for their profit.  These companies have no care for humans. Their CEOs are sociopathic monsters who actually convince people that unfettered AI development will be a benefit to the working class when it’s already clear jobs, and whole industries, will become irrelevant.  \n\nFor the final rant about AI, I’m sickened by the fact that my writing could be contributing to programs that degrade our capacity to write, reason and think creatively and critically.  How’s that working for us so far even without AI?  The Epstein class would love nothing better than to have us mindless and impoverished, or better yet, only good for serving and benefiting them-even more than we already ceaselessly do.  If for that reason alone, there should be some blow back on the actions of Anthropic.",

Microsoft invests in OpenAI, OpenAI buys Azure compute from Microsoft, Microsoft reports that as revenue growth--it's basically Microsoft selling to itself with extra steps. Nvidia benefits because both sides buy GPUs, but the fundamental economics don't work unless someone downstream actually pays for AI at its true cost.\n\n  \nThe forcing function strategy (bundling Copilot, making it default) is risky because it creates resentment rather than adoption. When users feel like AI is being shoved down their throat, they actively look for ways to disable it rather than integrate it into workflows. Compare that to how people adopted Google Search--no one forced it, it was just clearly better than the alternatives.\n\n  \nThe real tell is enterprise hesitation. CIOs aren't stupid--they see the same cost structure problem. They'll pilot Copilot, but committing budget at scale means believing the productivity gains justify the expense. So far, the data isn't there.",

Find the index of the first entry that matched the key using string comparisons. Go the keys spreadsheet, find the index of the same thing. Then return the index of the key in the key spreadsheet. It would then throw away that index because it was useless. It would then go to the key-values spreadsheet, find the first index of the key again, then try to parse out the value from the next column. Using that value, it would then go find the first index that matched the value from the value spreadsheet and return that value. Which was the same value it already had.\n\nI sat there trying to figure out what the heck the code was doing for so very long. My conclusion is there was no logic, rhyme or reason for why it was doing the things it was doing. The original author just stumbled through it until it gave the expected behavior.\n\n——\n\nI also had an Excel based GUI that would use VBA to call a LabView executable that would then load a presumably legacy C executable that used a third party library to execute memory tests on an embedded part. These embedded memory tests were taken from an example website teaching people the basics of memory testing.\n\nThat was a wild ride. The original author had notes on the lessons they had learned and it was basically “don’t use Excel, VBA, or LabView to do anything complicated”\n\nAnd yeah, almost always you can expect variable names like \n\n“x1, x2, x3, xx, xx1”",

And the big investors can do whatever they want anyway because they have so much money they can swing the whole market.\n\nIt is mostly vibes nowadays. In the past you had more \"investor\" types like Buffet, who generally tried to look for a company that seemed to be selling for less than they thought it was worth. They'd buy up stocks in that, then usually make a good profit when people realized the company was undervalued, and these were relatively safe bets, since even if the company under-performed a few quarters, you generally had a piece of something with real value.\n\nEven back then though, the majority of the stock market was \"speculators\" people who aren't interested in what a company's real worth is, and more interested in \"what will the stock be in X months/years\" - they don't really care or feel the need to know what a company actually does, just if vibes suggest line goes up. If a company goes up by 50% one year, and you sell it then, then it crashes to 10% of what you bought it for the next year, you still make bank. Of course, generally the price fluctuates wildly, but the occasional \"success\" is worth so much that speculators can't resist. \n\nAdd in big private equities and VCs who can literally pour billions in a company, helping it grow despite it hemorrhaging money - these companies then \"look\" healthy, they're growing, out-competing everyone and when they're \"ripe\" the private equity sells this famous \"up and coming\" company at a price that makes more than they spent on it. Of course, reality tends to start affecting the company once that sweet \"investment\" money dries up, and it starts having to \"shittify\" just to break even.",

When a market is first opened there is a lot of money to be had. Sometimes this is simply mathematical. The rate of InstaPot sales slows to the rate of population growth, and then farther as a secondhand market develops, because you only need one InstaPot. But even in non-durable goods, the initial boom arises to meet the need, but slows down because of competition driving down the rate of profit. Capital must constantly be opening new markets to create new sites for profit accumulation or lose the necessary momentum of constant growth and collapse.\n\nIn previous epochs this has been addressed by cracking open previously inaccessible markets (colonialism), technological advancement, and destruction, typically war. It has also produced periods of largely scam based economies. This is because the mature, low profit economy will accumulate vast sums of money in a few hands. They have nowhere to put this money that makes a profit that would salvage their other collapsing businesses. They are both desperate and have a lot of money to spend, allowing all manners of grift to flourish.",

That's nice, but could you imagine your minecraft world completely resetting after playing in it for 10 hours? Or the character you've learned for a competitive game having their abilities change completely?\n\nIf they could get the permanence up to 1000 hours, this tech still wouldn't be valuable to gamers because decoherence doesn't always happen suddenly, it happens gradually. You could lose a few numbers on the stats you were trying to min-max 20 hours in, you could have your blue armor downgraded to green 5 hours in, etc. Maybe the game forgets you got a \"rare\" drop and you lose it in an inventory somewhere. Maybe you meet an NPC early on named Melanie and a few hours later her name spontaneously changes to Meganlanie.\n\nThe value of games as they are is they can save your progress and the world effectively perfectly and indefinitely. On top of that, the permanence is what allows you to share your experience with your friends more effectively because you... Shared the experience. A secret cave that's in your game is something cool you can show your friend in theirs, but in a fully AI generated game that may not be the case. And unlike procedurally generated games like Minecraft, there's no rules by which you can find a similar structure in your friends world. \n\nLongwinded but I genuinely don't think a fully AI generated game even with really good capabilities, like what Genie is trying to do, will be valuable to the average gamer.",

          "text": "It's a cool demo but there are fundamental issues that I don't see as easily overcome.\n\nCost. You are saving on some up front time, maybe. Instead of having to make a city block or a fantasy landscape it's immediately ready. Cool. But if you want to play the witcher3 or baldues gate 3 or doom 3 or fallout 3 or half life... Alex... It's sitting there done. With this method you now need to pay for every frame generated. Forever. \n\nYou are no longer selling games individually. You are selling a service to play the Any Game You Feel Like game. That leads to the second problem.\n\nWhat's the game? You can imagine it could generate better interactivity. But without someone to test that gameplay how do you know it's fun?\n\nThere's a version of this where AI has a bunch of known fun stuff and remixes it. But won't that end up feeling aimless or inconsistent?\n\nGames are tested and refined for years to be fun and interesting to play. Randomly generating shooting or fighting or whatever is going to be a mess. So who does that? Maybe you still do that bit. You have a team develop a game by vibe coding the engine until the shooting feels good, or swordplay is okay. \n\nSame goes with story. Have you tried to get ai to generate a story? They're not great. That's not to say every game requires a deep story. But baldurs gate 3 was loved in part for great characters. \n\n Okay, so we keep some writers to direct the story, characters and so on.\n\nAt a certain point you still need a big team to make comparable games. There are things you are saving on - asset creation etc - and these are potentially big savings, but you still need to pay up front costs. Plus you also need to pay ongoing frame generation costs.\n\nOr you just let AI so everything and let users wander a Dreamworld where there is no set story or gameplay.\n\nThe more money you save on cutting out humans the less directed it becomes.\n\nThere's also the general backlash against ai generated content in games. Expedition 33 losing awards for a few assets in the files is a sign of what people think of ai being used to cut costs.\n\nIf I was going to guess where this is actually going:\n\nA Roblox type platform. Users generate the games. Small teams make projects. It's not the witcher 3 or GTA 6. Its something new. Kind of.\n\nDo you play Roblox? Probably not. But lots of kids do. There's probably a lot of people who would play on whatever platform this AI thing ends up being. \n\nIf I were Roblox I might be worried perhaps. \n\nBut then again Minecraft exists and is still popular. A new platform growing doesn't necessarily mean others die.\n\nEqually I don't think Nintendo needs to worry. If they wanted to have a Roblox type platform they would. But their model is not to sell user generated content. Its to make good games.",

So VAs get paid, and we get variety with NPCs.  That’s as far as my desires for “AI” in games goes.",
