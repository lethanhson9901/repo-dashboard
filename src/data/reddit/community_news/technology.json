You’ll owe at least 2.5% import duty, state use tax when you register it, and fees. The real problem is compliance and tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese cars that will be sold in Canada are not certified to U.S. DOT (FMVSS) and EPA standards, which means you’d need a Registered Importer to modify and certify it, often $10k+ or outright impossible. On top of that, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to Section 301 tariffs, which for EVs can effectively double the vehicle’s cost (100%+ duty).\n\nUnless the car is 25+ years old (exempt) or already U.S.-certified, you can easily end up paying more in tariffs and compliance than the car is worth. As mentioned in the begininng, it’s usually not worth it.\n\nEdit: for everyone asking why the EPA is involved here is the link. \n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fuel-economy-and-ev-range-testing",

Our national neighbors to the north have already caved, setting off alarm bells in some U.S. operations, and now NADA is hoping to amplify that warning.\n\nGo absolutely fuck yourselves drive.com. Canada didn’t cave on shit. \n\nThe Biden administration wanted to put tariffs on Chinese EVs, but thought it would be even better to have North America united as a bloc on those tariffs. So Canada imposed the exact same tariffs, despite the fact that NA EVs are almost exclusively in the American market. \n\nChina imposed disproportionately heavy tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports. Because they recognized that Canada wasn’t benefiting from the EV tariffs the same way America was. So Canada took the biggest hit, and got the smallest benefit. But we stood by our decision. \n\nThen Trump tariffed us, told us he didn’t need us, threatened to invade us, and members of his government started having meetings with Alberta separatists to break up our country. \n\nSo Canada said “why are we taking this hit for Americans if this is how they treat us?” Carney made a deal to lessen the Chinese EV tariffs and remove the hurt on our agricultural exports. THAT ONLY EXISTED BECAUSE WE WERE BEING GOOD ALLIES TO AMERICANS!!!!\n\nFuck all you people.",

Tesla killed itself via terrible management, a massive failure in the Cybertruck, and failing to update it's models in a timely manner. Why the fuck would Canada want to limit it's exposure to the best consumer products here? The US companies that they work for are abandoning EVs too. This opens up the opportunity for Chinese cars to get manufactured in Canada as well.",

Products are produced to the price point that is asked for, but in a lot of instances that no longer means they cannot produce to a high standard.\n\nNo one bats an eye about their Chinese made Apple or Android phones, but somehow thinks that we are solely capable of producing anything else better than everyone else. China decided to not play catch up with gas powered vehicles and saw an emerging next generation car opportunity and capitalized. Their battery technology is superior and their manufacturing capacity is huge. \n\nCouple this with the same folks desire to destroy public education, kill R&D funding and the overall anti-intellectualism and you are dooming the country you were lucky enough to be born in.",

I noticed that the time displayed in the corner on live US news broadcasts was about ten minutes off (eg, if the current real world time was 7:32am in DC, and 7:32pm in the city I was in, the US national news timestamp would be 7:22am, meaning we were seeing news with a ten minute delay).\n\nThen I noticed that the screen would go black periodically. It finally clicked that the US live news was being screened and censored. The lag was the time they gave themselves to block out ideas they didn’t want broadcast there. Entire news segments (1-4 minutes) were being blocked.\n\nI like the regular people and culture of the country, so I don’t want to name it in case I want to go back (I’d never get into any sort of political action there, but we can see how things are going with travel and ai surveillance of socials already). \n\nI think about that when things like this happen. It’s the kind of thing the US is supposed to be against. The very first amendment provides this right (free speech, free press, free from national/forced religion, free to choose any religion, free to assemble/protest, etc).\n\nThese rights are usually chipped away gradually, and only just enough to avoid causing a big uproar, and when people accept that change, it’s chipped away a little more later. Then a year or decade later the accumulated change is so drastic that if it had happened all at once there’d be mass uprisings, but instead, because of the slow creep, everyone is just lulled into complacency thinking, “wow, how’d we get here?” And carrying on as if things were normal because, “what can I do?”\n\nPoint being, there needs to be pushback over these little chips being removed from rights, even if they seem inconsequential at the time, because they are likely part of a larger pattern that will ultimately fundamentally change the freedoms we enjoy.",

Google can do what they want with their platform just like you can't affix a billboard to the roof of my house.\n\nWhat MeidasTouch could and should do is host their own video.

I think you could only show 30 total seconds of daily content per broadcast or something. \n\nThink of it like the NFL broadcast disclaimer.

The pretense of \"F-f-for the children!\" is paper thin at best. \n\nThis is just one of many steps into digital surveillance and gross overreach that are going to be taken in the near future as the Technocrats and Governments around the world realize how much they can get from us. \n\nPrivacy is vanishing before our very eyes.\n\nGod, I hate to sound like a tinfoil-hatter but it's becoming impossible to ignore just how much we're being surveilled in our daily lives. \n\nThere is no space that they will not try to take.\n\nEven if I were to pretend they were sincere about PROTECT THE KIDS it still isn't the job of the Government or any Corporation to do so. That's what their parents are for. \n\nIt isn't anyone else's fault that Deborah threw an iPad at her 9 year old to shut them up. That's her failure and her responsibility.\n\nEDIT: This blew up and my notifications are a circus of bad faith morons making some Olympic leaps so here's a few little clarifiers for you.\n\n-Sit your asses down and have a thorough conversation (or several) with your kids/teens about online safety. My parents did this with my brother and I and they didn't even grow up in the internet age. You can do it. You know more than your parents did, and have access to more tools than they had, too. Teach your kids about boundaries and how to set them. When and how to walk away. How to identify and report inappropriate content, and how to Block people. Teach them about identifying information and stress the importance of never ever sharing it. Stranger danger. Let them ask questions and make sure they know that they can and should come to you if something feels off.\n\n-Just don't put them onto the unrestricted internet. Little Jacob doesn't need an iPad. If you must put a screen in front of him, make it something safe like a goddamn Nintendo. \n\n-I am not American but I see what's happening there and understand that the rise of Fascism and this increasing demand for surveillance are not coincidental. The role of Discord in Nepal's recent revolution should be something to consider in the conversation about Discord wanting your ID.\n\n-For the love of God, no, I am not a Pedo Defender. Just a gal who doesn't feel the need to fork over every last piece of identifying information she has to faceless corporations and whoever they want to forward it to. Or, you know, occurrences like the data breach Discord Dearest suffered in October. I can remember that far back and so can you! \n\n-If I refuse to submit my ID, my account gets labeled as a Teen Account. I'm 30something. That doesn't protect kids.\n\n-The Government and Corporations don't give a damn about you or your kids. \"Protect the Children!!\" And \"THIS IS TO FIGHT TERRORISM!!\" are smokescreens used to sneak other, more sinister agendas under your nose. God fucking dammit I sound like a Hatter again.\n\n-The Trojan Horse looked like a Pretty Pretty Horsie. It was more than that. Go read about it and then do some thinking, ok?",

Requiring users to submit even more sensitive personal data under these circumstances is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates a serious lack of awareness of the trust you have already damaged.\n\nBefore demanding additional identification from users, your organization should first explain—clearly and transparently—how such a breach was allowed to occur, what accountability measures were taken, and why users should believe their data will be handled safely this time. At present, there is no credible justification for asking users to assume even greater risk.\n\nTrust is not restored by collecting more data. It is restored by demonstrating competence, accountability, and respect for user security. Until those standards are met, this policy change feels less like a security measure and more like a liability transfer from your organization onto your users.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this requirement or, at minimum, provide a secure alternative that does not involve submitting highly sensitive identification documents.\n\nThis policy, as it stands, is unacceptable.\"",

We do not use any age restricted features at all and will be fine with 'teen mode.' \n\nhonestly it is kind of pathetic from the global software industry.

          "text": "Let me tell you all a little Discord story. Back in 2017 I was attending Blizzcon as I had for many years. One thing about Blizzcon people don't realize is how many epic after parties there are in the area. Heat Ultra Lounge is one of the closest nightclubs and usually has a party hosted by one group or another. Usually a private party where the host is a Blizzcon regular or a PC vendor running promotions (for example in 2015 the party was sponsored by Predator). It's known for being one of the best after parties of the con.\n\nSo in 2017 when I was attending Blizzcon with a friend who had never been before, I wanted to make sure she got the chance to go to this party. But this particular year in typical corporate fashion, Discord rented out the entire venue so they could control who got in. Fortunately I have a friend who's married to a pro gamer and the pro gamers were all given VIP passes. Since they had the VIP passes they didn't need their regular tickets and offered to give them to me and my friend which we gladly accepted.\n\nBut when we got to the door, Discord (not Heat's own bouncers) turned us away. The reason? Our names weren't on the tickets. I asked why that mattered, I could have the ticket owners come vouch and the club would still check our IDs anyway. Still they argued and refused. So I reached out to Mallory Loar, the head of Discords events who I had previously been in contact with. But now when we had a problem, suddenly crickets. We never got in.\n\nNow at the end of the day, it's just a party, not a big deal. But it's more the principal of the thing - that a big company can come and just reserve a venue that usually hosts fan-run or sponsored parties, then decide themselves who has access to a Blizzcon tradition. And adding bureaucratic rules that make no sense with an unresponsive support team.\n\nIt showed me just how corporate Discord had become. I've long since been done with them.",

I wouldn't trust them with anything more than my email. If, for whatever reason, their A.I. determines I'm a teen. I will simply endure whatever restrictions there are, and possibly leave the platform.\n\nIn the event apple / google come up with on device authentication of age, that has an API that transfers NO data, aside from: Yes this person is 18+, I will do that. Sorry discord, unfortunately, even though you're *saying* all the right things, I simply don't believe you have what it takes to keep my info safe.",

We need forums and online spaces run by individuals and small groups for zero profit and paying for their own server hosting or just hosting their own servers. Honestly, home Internet and home computers have become so fast and cheap, we shouldn't need to beg corporations for free hosting anymore, we can do it without them at home.",

At that point you just have your account with \"the\" big central authority, except with way lesser functionality vs competitors.

That's not magically going to get rid of the people who voted for him or contain the racist and divisive forces channeled by the Republican party.\n\nHell, if the Republican party is totally dismantled in a US-style de-nazification program in 3 years, and the Dems rule unopposed for 20 years straight sort of like after a mirror of the Civil War, this could STILL HAPPEN AGAIN as long as the Wealth elite exist and continue to cause problems to happen in society and then go and fund fascist solutions because they REFUSE TO SACRIFICE any bit of their wealth for any reason at all.\n\nNo, actually, it's worse than that. Not only do they refuse to sacrifice wealth, they refuse to sacrifice their ability to MAKE EVEN MORE WEALTH. It's not like they're short on wealth or profit right now. There isn't even credible socialist political power in this country. They're funding fascism because they THINK it might emerge, and morons like Peter Thiel are scared shitless its like 2 days away or something. So rich AND delusional; great combo.\n\nPeople don't want to hear it for a variety of reasons, but the problem is, and always will be, Capitalism. Who created the millions of downtrodden people who want to lash out, and thus vote for Trump ? Capitalism. Who created Trump himself ? He's one of the worst examples of a human being made by it. Capitalism. Who poured billions of dollars into souring Sander's campaign even though he isn't even that much of a socialist ? Capitalism. What creates a socially divisive society of competition for the benefit of the elite ? Capitalism.\n\nCapitalists wrote the US Constitution and stuck it full of veto-points because they didn't trust the poors to make choices. You might think that's cause they thought the poors were stupid. And perhaps they did. Lots of people do today still. Except that's not really it. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't, but they were really afraid of the poors voting to take all their wealth. Which is a NON-STUPID response to inequality. That's why there's a house AND Senate. That's why there's an Electoral College. That's why the stupid fillibuster rule exists (it's not in the constitution, either).\n\nThe system makes the unrest and discontent through the process of creating insane wealth for a few, and then those few fund the fascist response to protect that insane wealth. It'll do this over and over and over again as long as Capitalists have any political power (and thus wealth) at all.",

CTV is owned by Bell, which means the big banks all have stakes in it. The Toronto Star was bought by Jordan Bitove a few years ago.

VPN's allow you to view content that might be blocked in your country by allowing you to view media as if you are located in a different physical country, bypassing regional blocks. As an additional benefit, the advertisers that help sponsor that state media coverage of the event receive less exposure and the event receives lower viewership ratings as more people choose to view the event through a non-filtered perspective from a different nation's coverage.

As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions.

Holy hell man so offbase.\n\n\n\"Waymo vehicles are not directly remote-controlled or \"joysticked\" by human operators in real-time. Instead, they use a \"fleet response\" system where remote specialists provide high-level guidance or navigation, such as clearing obstacles or directing the car to take alternative routes, while the vehicle handles all driving, steering, and braking itself. \"\n\nKey details regarding Waymo's remote assistance include:\n\n - No Active Driving: Remote agents cannot directly take over, steer, or brake the car.\n\n - Contextual Assistance: When a vehicle encounters a confusing situation (e.g., road construction), it may stop and request help, and a remote human agent helps the system understand the scene to continue safely.\n\n - Safety Rationale: Waymo believes remote driving is unsafe due to potential wireless connection latency (lag).\n\n - Human Intervention: If the vehicle cannot resolve a situation, human roadside assistance is sent to the physical location\n\nWaymo Driver and Remote Assistance has been [third party verified by TÜV SÜD](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/independent-audits) as recently as Nov 2025 and [Automated Vehicle System Consortium](https://avsc.sae-itc.com/publication/avsc-04-2023)\n\nThey don't \"take over\". The car gets into a trouble spot where the safest choice is to stop. That can be remotely monitored and observe what is making them stop and only suggest things to do. This is a security measure and again if Tesla is doing remote driving they are even further behind than thought.\n\nYou can tell people that upvote this have never been in a Waymo. Lots of Tesla boy turfers that hide their history.\n\nWaymo remote assistance is clearly defined. There is CLEARLY a concerted turfing effort to pump remote controlling probably to try to cover for when people find out Tesla does that probably from the control car.\n\nThere is no other reason this type of info would be pumped. Just five minutes of research would tell you why remote control is a horrible idea.\n\nIf Tesla boys are pumping and turfing this \"claim\" on Waymo, Tesla has to be stuck in that mode.

It knows to turn around and go a different route if the way is blocked or hazardous.\n\nBut in those edge cases where it can’t tell what to do*, these people “provide guidance”. They aren’t driving the cars, they look at the video and LiDAR feeds and explain to the AI model what it is seeing, and sometimes to suggest a route to pick. Then the existing decision system uses that additional info to make a decision and keep driving. The AI is still driving the cars.\n\nhttps://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\n\n*As an example, this week they published about handling extreme edge cases, like what the car should do if it encounters a tornado.

          "text": "This is actually pretty common in the \"AI\" industry and highlights something important: the gap between what companies market as autonomous AI and what's actually happening under the hood. Remote human operators handling edge cases or difficult scenarios isn't necessarily bad engineering—it's often the pragmatic solution when full autonomy isn't reliable enough yet. The issue is the lack of transparency about it.\n\nWhat's interesting is this mirrors the early days of a lot of automation. Even Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" has always had the disclaimer that it requires active supervision. The difference is Waymo marketed itself as truly driverless, so finding out there are remote operators (whether in the Philippines or anywhere else) feels like a bait-and-switch. That said, remote assistance for stuck vehicles is different from remote *driving*—if they're just helping with routing decisions or confirming it's safe to proceed in ambiguous situations, that's still way more autonomous than a human driving the whole time.\n\nThe Philippines angle also opens up the labor economics question. If we're outsourcing the \"human in the loop\" part of AI to lower-wage countries, we're essentially just offshoring the jobs rather than eliminating them. It's the mechanical turk problem all over again, except now it's dressed up in Silicon Valley marketing speak about revolutionary AI.",

Now tell me how classifying everyone as underage helps with that lol? They should be doing the exact opposite - require you to prove you're actually a child - which would have even worse implications in case of a data breach.\n\n\nSo how about we stop trying to solve this problem on the service side and just ask parents to fucking parent their kids?",

It isnt producing anything of value, is destroying entire classifications of jobs without offering alternatives for those employees, and is using a lot of expensive resources. It hasn't cured cancer, it hasn't made society better in any way, and the scandals involving it being used as a disinformation tool keep piling up.

              "text": "I find it suspect that the article (and their father) decided to focus so heavily on the game they were playing and their interest in Korean culture. They wrote an 8-page suicide note...surely that wasn't the only thing in there.\n\nI went looking for some other articles about this and found some other interesting tidbits:\n\n* The girls dropped out of school in 2020, 5-6 years ago. They weren't doing well in school when they were attending. [This source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) claims the girls dropped out because their father was deeply in debt and could no longer afford to send them.\n* The family lived in a gated community and none of their neighbors knew them. One said “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents.\"\n* According to one source, the girls never had their own phone - they were using their parents' phone to get online. And the parents didn't just take the phone away - they also threatened to marry off the girls.\n* The father, Chetan Kumar, actually has two wives who are sisters. The source linked above says \"two of his partners walked out\" and disappeared for a few days; he filed a missing persons report and they came back within a few days. (Unclear if those two are the same as the two wives...)\n* [This source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece) says there wasn't even any evidence of a game found on the device(s) they were using, and said that they mostly cited TV shows. But [this source ](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2026/02/04/three-sisters-jump-to-their-death-after-parents-cut-off-their-video-gaming-time/)says evidence was found on their devices of long gaming sessions (and also contradicts the other article, which said they didn't have their own phones). However, literally no one has been able to name the game itself, and the description of the game changes from source to source - some say it's a \"love game\" (I assume a dating sim), others a task-based game, and one even claimed that the last task in the game was suicide.\n* Although the suicide note does mention their love of gaming and Korean culture, it also talks about the girls' loneliness. Interesting how that hasn't become part of any of the headlines.\n* Their diary/suicide note also [referenced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) beatings (\"Did we live in this world to get beaten by you… death would be better for us than beatings.\")",

The way this is being reported (as of now) is setting off my alarms that those girls were likely dealing with a much more concerning reality than a mere loss of access to a game. Especially the fact that the eldest daughter was part of it all. Generally speaking, whether pressured to or not, eldest daughters tend to take on a secondary mothering role to younger siblings. If death seemed to be preferable to whatever life she and her siblings were facing as a result of losing contact with the outside world, I think that's a pretty big sign that the conditions of their daily life need to be looked into.",

The three sisters last attended Green Valley School, where their academic performance was sub-par,” said the officer.\n\nInside the gated society, several neighbours told The Hindu that they only knew the family from a distance. “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents,” said Gaurav Kohli, a neighbour.\n\nRahul Jha, the secretary of the apartment who accompanied the police during the investigation, told The Hindu that he learnt the family faced financial troubles. “The family lived on rent, and they did not speak to anyone much or participate in any activities. A day before this happened, Mr. Kumar handed me ₹700 for maintenance, but he never delayed any payment,” M.R. Jha said.\n\nAt present, the police have recovered Ms. Sujata’s cell phone and sent it for forensic analysis. The police have also seized the handwritten note left by the girls. ***The DCP said that a case has not been registered yet as the parents have not filed a complaint.***\n\n😒\n https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece",

How the fuck would you know that the game was 'task-based' but you don't know what the *name* of the game is? According to news reports the police have the device(s) the girls were using to play the game. How could you not just pull the name of the game from whatever app they were using? Their suicide note was 8 pages and contained specific references to other Korean and East Asian TV shows, anime, manga, singers and groups - which they called out by name - but not the actual game they were playing?\n\nI call bullshit.",

Web interface to manage WiFi etc. like a traditional router but it has security first settings in mind. When a new device joins a network it joins a default vlan with no egress and no access to the home network. The user must use the app to click the drop-down and assign the device to a group. Groups have very simple config: egress enabled, ingress enabled, and lan access. All your IP cameras can live in one group, with egress, ingress and lan disabled. All your smart devices in another gorup. Think guest wifi network but dynamic for any group that you want. That was several years ago and I still wonder why the heck consumer routers don't offer this. I know certain routers offer vlan capability, but I'm talking about dead simple for the everyday consumer.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More here:\n\nAt Sunday’s Super Bowl, Ring advertised “Search Party,” a cute, horrifyingly dystopian feature nominally designed to turn all of the Ring cameras in a neighborhood into a dragnet that uses AI to look for a lost dog: “One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in the Super Bowl commercial. “Search Party from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs.” Onscreen, an AI-powered box forms around a missing dog: “Milo Match,” it says. “Since launch, more than a dog a day has been reunited with their family. Be a hero in your neighborhood with Search Party. Available to everyone for free right now.”\n\nIt does not take an imagination of any sort to envision this being tweaked to work against suspected criminals, undocumented immigrants, or others deemed ‘suspicious’ by people in the neighborhood. Many of these use cases are how Ring has been used by people on its [dystopian “Neighbors” app for years](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs/?ref=404media.co). Ring rose to prominence as a piece of package theft prevention tech owned by Amazon and by forming partnerships with local police around the country, [asking them to shill their doorbell cameras](https://www.vice.com/en/article/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement/?ref=404media.co) to people in their neighborhoods in return for a system that allowed police to request footage from individual users without a warrant. \n\nChris Gilliard, [a privacy expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBgnjn5cC0&ref=404media.co) and author of the upcoming book [*Luxury Surveillance*](https://www.techpolicy.press/through-to-thriving-protecting-our-privacy-with-chris-gilliard/?ref=404media.co), told 404 Media these features and its Super Bowl ad are “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\nRing’s poorly defined partnership with Flock in particular has been the subject of various viral posts and public backlash. Many people have suggested that this partnership is evidence that Ring camera footage will be shared with ICE. At the moment there’s not enough evidence to explicitly say that that’s the case. \n\nThe supposed vector goes something like this: Ring says it will partner with Flock, which is used by thousands of local police departments. As we have reported, some of those police [departments have performed Flock license plate lookups for ICE](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/). It’s too early to say whether Ring footage will eventually end up with ICE, but the fact that people immediately drew that conclusion and understood the possible method of information sharing shows that surveillance companies can no longer hide behind viral videos of delivery drivers dancing. It’s a mask off moment, and people know it: “In Amazon’s alliance with this administration, it’s become more clear than ever that Ring is an extension of the carceral state,” Gilliard said. “An emotionally charged Super Bowl ad won’t change that.”\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)",

I've had half a dozen friends already come to me with some variation on \"isn't that neat, they can crowdsource finding your dog\" and I keep wanting to scream \"it's not for finding your damn dog!\"",

You have a setting in the OS for the device where you put a birth date (or any date close enough to your age) and that information stays local to your device. Then when a piece of software or a website asks \"are you over x age?\" The device says yes/no without communicating personal information.  \n\nIt puts the responsibility on parents to set up their kids devices properly and not grant them any admin privileges, and if you're an adult you can just put in any information that registers as over 18. It also helps protect kids because it can age gate people over a certain age from spaces, and if you try to put yourself in a lower age bracket in this system then that becomes pretty suspicious. And it doesn't create any undue burdens on software developers or people who host web content. In theory it can be used to curate individual users experiences on news, entertainment, and social media sites because individual page elements can be age gated. It creates a frame work where the served up software can say \"this is mature content\" and the operating system can say \"I'm not allowed to view mature content\" and the served up software can say \"okied dokie, not displayed\" and the user doesn't have to do anything.",

It's an open source software and you can self-host it, the main developers are from the United Kingdom and Canada. Meanwhile Discord is a closed source app confirmed owned by the US *and* the Chinese.

It worked really well and there just wasn't anything like it, and it was much more tightly focused on providing cross platform text and voice chat and that was about it.\n\nNow it's gotten extremely bloated and I don't think it knows what it's supposed to be, and using it has turned into a very strange experience - I would venture it was never really designed to be a forum hosting platform and people have kind of shoehorned it into that role. Also there SO much porn, I'm not really that surprised they're doing age verification because giving pornography to kids is a crime in a lot of places",

Do you know how many teams touched this commercial and approved this completely tone deaf advertisement? \n\nDiversity isn’t about skin color, it’s about culture. My most blazing observation was that Amazon didn’t have anyone from a culture that sees this as a problem. And those people are making other decisions that have ramifications for services people have grown dependent on. \n\n“Oh look, we can find your dog if it walks up and to a stranger’s doorbell camera!” \n\n“So it can do that with faces too?”\n\nThe entire industry is in this culture where they can just blurt something out and receive no educated follow up questions. And some companies are surrounded by dangerously homogeneous weirdos.\n\nI mean, I know people that threw out their ring camera. What kind of advertisement does that?\n\nAll they needed to do was say “Now you personally can scan neighbor feeds for your pet without disturbing anyone’s privacy” but it’s not granting that privacy by design choice. Leaving it open to the preface for a Black Mirror episode. \n\nWhat if I’m a stalker and one day I say my target victim is missing and now all the neighborhood cameras can tell me where to find them? What if I’m a lazy cop who would rather watch people’s doorbell feeds than patrol the neighborhood and communicate with the community. \n\nI found myself, as did millions of Americans, recreating the Leo meme pointing at the TV because this is some dystopian level nonsense.

Now I wouldn't be surprised if most do not even remember they exist.\n\nAnd for most part those who would make either just end up making a mobile app now, which is kind of extreme overkill for simpler stuff and often killed by monetization of what once would have been free.\n___\n\nIt feels like game modding has somewhat died too, so few newer games support it and they are to complex and/or locked down for people to mod without that support.\n\nAnd considering how many devs, and even entire successful studios and some of the most profitable games to exist, got their start with game modding that is a bad thing for the industry. You would think they would want to support such a great headhunting tool and one that GUARANTEES long term sales producing infinite content for free but nope.\n\nHopefully Slay The Spire 2 has half the modding community of 1 when it comes out next month, IIRC the devs plan to make it easier to mod than the first.",

It was awesome as an early adopter because it gave me an advantage over laggards — in terms of quality of work, time savings, and in praise from my bosses (“Oh, wow. Look at what you were able to do with AI. Great job leading the team.”)\n\n But as everyone catches up and expectations rise, the grind just amplifies. AI is less an advantage and more a crutch because unless you’re using it constantly you drown completely under the weight of all these AI-generated emails, docs, and artifacts.\n\nI’m not saying it’s all bad. I actually appreciate a lot of what AI can do for low value and time consuming work (like meeting notes, task automation, etc). But it has some real limits too.",

Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”\n\nIn a team meeting yesterday manager said that even though we did feature planning with AI in mind, meeting our targets won't be good enough for upper management. They can see that it _is_ making things faster, but that's making expectations rise even faster.\n\nAnd contention on resources for properly testing things is becoming a major bottleneck to the point we're going to start having corners cut.\n\nLots more chatter about early retirement and lower intensity careers around the office lately.",

They really push any sort of AI tooling that Devs think are useful, most had cursor as their IDE but these tickets were bug heavy,  light on AC so it was difficult for me to tell (and get answers) if features were working as intended.\n\n\n11pm finishes/7am starts were commonplace and apparently had been for a while. Sales were basically telling prospective customers \"we don't have the ability to do this now, but we will in a week!\" which led to so much short notice shit my brain was pickled trying to get myself up to speed properly as well as deliver all this crap 'at pace' I just threw in the towel and I'm going back to my old job next week. They then gained those customers so of course why wouldn't they continue making those kinds of statements and have those kinds of expectations? \n\n\nQA there were ignored for the most part, I had a hell of a time getting anything out of product owners/developers, not because they didn't like me (I don't think) but because they were so damn busy all the time. I'd be midway through testing something to be told it was getting merged and released to prod and any issues could be picked up post release.\n\n\nIt was my first experience of a company that leveraged AI tooling across all aspects of the business, it was horrendous. \n\n\nWith the increases in productivity coming I'm a bit worried the old 1:4 QA to dev ratio is just going to get blown out the water ",

The study this article is based on only looked at 200 people at a single tech firm, hardly a representative sample of the global workforce.\n\nIf you read between the lines, the “burnout” isn't coming from the AI itself it’s coming from people voluntarily overworking because the barrier to entry for tasks has dropped. Just because an AI makes it possible for a PM to start doing engineering work during their lunch break doesn't mean they should. We're seeing the typical early adopter frenzy where everyone thinks they need to be doing 10x the work just because it's technically possible.\n\n\nBurnout happens when management expects 10x output for the same pay, or when workers don't have the discipline to log off. Blaming the software for “intensifying” work is like blaming a faster car for a driver’s speeding ticket. We need better boundaries not fewer tools but people will only read the headline and think this is yet another “AI bad” situation.",

Faster output → higher expectations → less recovery time. Rinse, repeat.\n\nA few patterns I keep seeing with early adopters:\n\n* **Cognitive overload**: juggling prompts, tools, workflows, and constant context-switching\n* **Identity pressure**: “If I’m not using this well, I’m falling behind”\n* **Invisible labor**: experimenting, refining, validating AI output—work that doesn’t always count on paper\n* **Acceleration guilt**: when you *can* do more, resting starts to feel unjustified\n\nIronically, the people most resistant to burnout are often the ones using AI *selectively*—as a boundary, not a badge. They automate the boring stuff, then stop. No constant optimization spiral.\n\nThere’s a weird lesson hiding here:  \nBurnout isn’t about tools. It’s about **who feels obligated to extract maximum value from them**.\n\nIf you want, we can unpack what “healthy AI usage” actually looks like in practice—because it’s way less impressive than Twitter makes it sound, and way more sustainable.",

It should only be used for large dataset analysis and maybe meeting minutes. Otherwise whatever content it makes is pure slop, no matter what platform it is. For example trying to get google notebook LM to configure anything useful takes more time than it is do to the work yourself, especially when it comes to PowerPoint summaries of hundreds of documents. I don’t need a fucking podcast made for my job.\n\nI’m a high performer but the pressure of using AI is taking away from my normal speed and quality of work (we get literally rewarded with better bonuses when we showcase our skills using it), and the upper management and leadership think shits super easy so timelines get smaller. Yesterday I was asked to summarize 500 documents into a 50-100 slide deck in less than a week from scratch because “you can just use AI to do it for you”. I’ve never, as a high performer, had to push back on timelines. I’m finding myself doing it fucking constantly now. It makes me want to quit and it’s only going to get worse.",

Now instead of figuring out how to iterate through a data set efficiently, you have to proofread the AI to make sure its code is doing that, or debug it when the “simple” function you had it write starts causing problems when the input size is too large, or a million other things. Anyone who expects AI to speed everything up needs to read The Mythical Man-Month. It’s not that different from having an army of tireless junior devs at your beck and call.",

          "text": "As a long time software dev, I've been tasked by management to use AI, Claude and CoPilot specifically. I can see the problem. There's a natural rhythm of intensity and relaxation in the professional coding cycle. One gets \"in the zone\", and codes like a maniac, and then into a phase of consolidation and thougthful review.\n\nCoding with AI is like working with the worlds most knowledgeable and fast working amateur, junior dev. My job is to know what we're trying to do, to express it in a way the AI can successfully operate with, Understanding how the current results differ from the desired ones (which includes testing and code review), and the time to iterate. And as we all know, LLMs are \"sticky\", and particularly by asking leading questions at the end of any task: \"Do you want me to <various suggestions about what it could do next>\". \n\nThis tends to keep one in active mode. There is no downtime to think, unless you are disciplined enough. The constant prompting tends to erode that.\n\nAnd FWIW, despite being specifically for coding, Claude falls into the same problematic ruts that every AI I've tried using for real work  does - once it gets something wrong, it then will \"loop\", when you point it out. It'll undo the change, resulting in the return of the prior problem, which it will \"solve\" in exactly the same failed way. I've let it go through three complete iterations of this to verify it won't break out on its own. I have to point out it already tried something, which is very strange, since it's own output becomes a part of the context it keeps so there *can* be a \"conversation\". You'd think looping would be something the AI would notice, but none do, and that's across 5 major LLM offerings.\n\nAll this adds up to non-stop work. This type of work has been extensively studied and written about, and anybody who thinks they are a resource manager should know about things like \"critical chain\", in which slack time refers to the amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the project's overall timeline, which is managed through buffers to ensure timely project completion. Slack time is consideered absolutely necessary, as they've shown throughput (the actual amount produced) *decreases* without slack time, sometimes catastrophically.\n\nUnfortunately, some managers will think \"non-stop work\" sounds like a dream for their stats. They're going to be very confused, disappointed, even angry when the opposite occurs.",

When it snows, the trunk door will drop a significant amount of snow into the trunk when opening. \n\nIn general, the BMW is poorly designed for its having such a strong market share.

It does things like disables biometrics, turns the camera on (it can also upload the footage), send a message to a designated contact… it’s great, highly recommended.\n\nI think this subreddit doesn’t allow cross linking, so I’m not going to put a link in… but if you go to the Shortcuts sub and search for the name the thread will come right up.\n\n(If I’m incorrect about the rules let me know and I’ll edit the link in.)\n\nI’m not sure if that Shortcut puts the phone in Lockdown (kind of thinking it doesn’t) but it shouldn’t be difficult to add that step in.

                  "text": "OK then post it \n\n\nYummy pig\n\n\nThe FBI has been unable to access a Washington Post reporter’s seized iPhone because it was in Lockdown Mode, a sometimes overlooked feature that makes iPhones broadly more secure, according to recently filed court records.\nThe court record shows what devices and data the FBI was able to ultimately access, and which devices it could not, after raiding the home of the reporter, Hannah Natanson, in January as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know anything else about phone unlocking technology? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.\n“Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the court record reads, referring to the FBI’s Computer Analysis Response Team, a unit focused on performing forensic analyses of seized devices. The document is written by the government, and is opposing the return of Natanson’s devices. \nThe FBI raided Natanson’s home as part of its investigation into government contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who is charged with, among other things, retention of national defense information. The government believes Perez-Lugones was a source of Natanson’s, and provided her with various pieces of classified information. While executing a search warrant for his mobile phone, investigators reviewed Signal messages between Pere-Lugones and the reporter, the Department of Justice previously said.\nThen, the government obtained search warrants for Natanson’s residence, vehicle, and person to seize her electronic devices. Those warrants included language that would have legally allowed them to press Natanson’s fingers onto the devices, or hold them up to her face, to unlock them if biometrics were enabled.\nUpstairs in Natanson’s residence, the FBI found a powered-off silver Macbook Pro, an Apple iPhone 13, a Handy branded audio recording device, and a Seagate portable hard drive, according to the court record.\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the court record says.\n\n\nA screenshot from the court record.\nThe court record mentioning Lockdown Mode was filed on January 30th, around two weeks after the FBI raided Natanson’s residence, indicating the FBI has not been able to access the iPhone during that time.\nApple primarily markets Lockdown Mode as a feature to mitigate remote access spyware, such as that sold by companies like NSO Group to government agencies. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all,” Apple’s website reads. Essentially, Lockdown Mode makes some changes to how iOS works to make it harder for third parties to hack into an iPhone. It blocks most message attachment types; loads webpages differently; and stops FaceTime calls unless you’ve previously called that person in the last 30 days.\nA small section of the Lockdown Mode page also mentions mitigations around connecting an iPhone to an external accessory. “Device connections: To connect your iPhone or iPad to an accessory or another computer, the device needs to be unlocked,” the Lockdown Mode page says. “To connect your Mac laptop with Apple silicon to an accessory, your Mac needs to be unlocked and you need to provide explicit approval.” Mobile forensics tools such as Graykey and Cellebrite, which law enforcement use to break into phones, work by physically connecting to a phone to then unlock them.\n\n\n“Many advanced forensic techniques and law enforcement tools rely on vulnerabilities that Lockdown Mode explicitly blocks or limits,” Andrew Garrett, CEO of digital forensics firm Garrett Discovery, told 404 Media.\nNeither the Washington Post nor Apple responded to a request to comment. The FBI declined to comment.\nThere is a constant cat and mouse dynamic between the companies that make mobile phones and their operating systems, namely Apple and Google, and the firms making tools to break into those devices. In 2024, 404 Media revealed Apple quietly introduced code that was rebooting iPhones after they had not been interacted with for a period of time, making them harder for police to unlock. Broadly, it is harder for authorities to crack devices that have been powered off or not unlocked since switched on, a state known as Before First Unlock (BFU).\nThe FBI was still able to access another of Natanson’s devices, namely a second silver Macbook Pro. “Once opened, the laptop asked for a Touch Id or a Password,” the court record says. Natanson said she does not use biometrics for her devices, but after investigators told her to try, “when she applied her index finger to the fingerprint reader, the laptop unlocked.” The court record says the FBI has not yet obtained a full physical image of the device, which provides an essentially complete picture of what was stored on it. But the agents did take photos and audio recordings of conversations stored in the laptop’s Signal application, the court record says\n\n\nHungry hippo",

Is that all it is?\n\nI thought police/feds had 3rd party tech to hack your phones passcode, unless you use an actual password/code instead of a 4-6 digit number code. A random password of X length would (I imagine) be hard to crack. But a 4 number code only has 10,000 (0000-9999) possibilities that I feel like a computer could crack fairly easily.",

That’s a recipe for disaster. If they want a better public image they need to keep their side of the street clean, as the saying goes.\n\nThe history of border patrol has an era where they brought on way to many people way to fast, did little to no background checks or training, and sent them out into the world with a new gun and badge to round people up. Countless rights violations and crimes ended up being committed (eg, murders, rapes, using detainees for sex (aka rape), drug dealing, etc).

Even moderate people that support detaining or even deporting felons that are here illegally look at these lapses in background checks and training as an issue, and anyone that knows how this turned out in the past can see it increases the chances of problems in the future.",

[Communities with increases in immigration tend to see decreases in crime.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/debunking-myth-immigrants-and-crime/) [Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they receive in benefits.](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/immigrants-pay-taxes-benefits-study/3973064/?amp=1) And there have been studies showing that [immigrants boost the economy overall.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy).\n\nSo, even if there was a magic button you could press to make all the immigrants, or all the illegal immigrants, go home, without hurting anyone in the process, it would actually make our country poorer and more dangerous to live in, rather than safer and richer.\n\nBut there isn’t a magic button to do that, and ICE’s enforcement actions are hurting and sometimes even killing, not just immigrants, but US citizens as well.  Renee Good and Alex Pretti were both US citizens who ICE murdered on the street during “enforcement operations”, Keith Porter was a US citizen killed by an off-duty ICE officer, and 6 people have died in ICE facilities in 2026 alone: Heber Sanchaz Domínguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, and Geraldo Lunas Campos all died, or in some cases, were murdered, while in ICE custody.\n\nSo if you are a DHS agent or ICE agent reading this, whether you’re spying on me because I criticized the king, or whether you just happen to be on reddit, please resign.  Start looking for work elsewhere.  They are going to ask you to do horrible things, to follow orders that are blatantly illegal, and it is going to be a lot harder for you to defy them than you think it will be.  Start looking for a way out now.",

Any service that wants to operate in the UK will need to put together age verification infrastructure in order to comply with the law there, and once the infra is in place it's not that hard to expand it to users in other jurisdictions, or just apply it globally to avoid the risk of still having regulators going after you because a user decided to use a VPN to bypass it. \n\nThe issue is much bigger than Discord and I feel like I'm screaming into the void trying to make people aware of that fact.",

You acknowledge that it's **your** responsibility to take care of **your** kids. They aren't mine--they aren't anyone else's. It's not my responsibility, or the responsibility of anyone else, to police what **your** kids see. Don't want them seeing something? **You** take measures to prevent in **your** kingdom. Don't put a screen with internet access in front of them until the reach a certain age. Even after reaching an age, you lock down that device. You monitor what they do with that device. That's not our job. The internet doesn't need to be fixed. The parents do. If we want to get laws involved, those laws and punishments need to be targeting bad parenting--not what they are doing now.\n\nAll of this, of course, is a moot agurment since as many have already said here, this has nothing to do with child safety. This is data harvesting and surveillance. Child safety is just the face they are putting on it so they can say \"if you are against this, you are against the children!.\" The same bullshit they have pulling for decades now.",

You can obviously restrict them but the government cannot legally require gates for that content even for minors. Rated R movies are still within a minor's first amendment rights, I believe that was also mentioned in Paxton. Sexually explicit doesn't automatically mean obscene even for minors.\n\nIf you're concerned about predators then find and arrest them. Just making it marginally more difficult doesn't actually solve the problem of some person roving for children to abuse and massively harms social networks.

You've not going to get past a few decades, let alone retirement.\n\nThat's nothing to do with AI, that's just automation and technology.\n\nThe scaremongering, really, is subtly different, though.  What they're saying is that once you're out of this job... NO OTHER JOB WILL EXIST.  Not just \"you would struggle to get another job with your qualifications/skills/expertise\" but \"there won't be a job for you\".  Because AI is so magically wonderful that all jobs are obsolete, even those using AI.\n\nThat's the bit that's bollocks.  And if it isn't?  Then the world have a problem of catastrophic proportions on its hands.  Because there would be nobody left to work, which means no products to sell to them, which means no companies still surviving to sell them.\n\nThat's the part that simply isn't going to happen any time soon but, if it did... governments are going to realise one of the most dangerous things that could ever happen is about to happen.  A lot of people.  Jobless.  Homeless.  Penniless.  Starving.  With nothing else better to do.  No incentive to do anything.\n\nThat's just a revolt and anarchy waiting to happen.  Better hope, if the assertion that AI is going to just take everyone's job is true, that you've planned for universal basic income or some way to quell a billion unemployed knocking on the door of your mansion demanding food.  Including those people sworn to protect you who... are also suffering the same fate themselves.  Nobody's going to bodyguard a billionaire when their money means nothing any more.  (Same as the \"billionaires will all hide in bunkers\" nonsense... really?  That weedy computer nerd is going to survive the nuclear winter and live out life in the lap of luxury, being waited on hand and foot and someone's going to defend them with their life?  You think so?  Or you think that the armed guards sworn to protect them won't get some big ideas of their own, away from all other authorities, and decide that maybe THEY'D like to be living that life rather than putting their own on the line?)\n\nThe fact that government AREN'T prepping for that situation, anywhere in the world, tells you one thing.  They know it's not going to happen.  Hell, they'd be inventing fake jobs if that was the case.  \"Here, if you pick up litter, we'll pay you a wage, just to keep you busy and out of our hair and not ask too many questions about what we're going to do about it.\"\n\nPeople will lose their jobs.  Guaranteed.\n\nBut jobs aren't going anywhere.\n\nAnd bored people sitting around doing nothing but thinking who to blame... that's one of the most dangerous situations you can ever imagine for a government.",

It is pretty well documented that as the share of women in a field increases, the field is devalued by society. College is getting more and more female, so now it isn't seen as prestigious. Fewer and fewer men are attending. They are functionally blocking themselves from so many career options because they've convinced themselves their TRUMPcoin bet is going to pay off any day now and that'll show those college snobs. \n\n  \nAnd while you'd think more women in college would be an incentive for men, the truth is that the kind of men who are opting out do not want to be with women who can intellectually compete with them, much less have economic autonomy.

Companies have invested too much into forcing AI into everything, even though (in its current form) it's rarely the best solution to the problem at hand... and they can't pull back now even if they wanted to. \n\nWhereas an iPhone is an iPhone and it's just hardware.

I guess if you didn’t organize your photos, it does find them well. \n\nIt’s a niche feature in my opinion though, there’s not too many times when I want to pull up information from my email and my Google Drive and my photos at the same time to answer a question. I guess I could ask what trips have I done in the past based off my photo library or something. Photo generation is also pretty pointless in my opinion too, I’ve never seen a use for it and I’ve never used it. \n\nThe only time I used it was for a recent college technical writing class, we had to make a infographic to convert a project, we did in the past into 2 infographics for two different audiences. It’s an exercise in how to present information to different audiences. I made up a logo for a fictional company, that’s the only time I’ve actually used the photo generation feature for something useful. I could’ve just easily picked a real company logo anyway, I was just curious if it could do that.\n\n\nThere’s a use case in education for sure though, I think AI can tutor people through K-12 homework pretty well so if an AI can be set up to not give away the answer which is a huge problem right now if you do use it. It could be useful for closing the gap when kids need more explanation on things like homework. \n\nIt definitely feels like it’s overall a solution looking for a problem though, I don’t see any burning problem AI is solving for most people. I guess it’s answering questions so people spend less time on Google with an answer that may or may not be accurate due to AI hallucinations",
