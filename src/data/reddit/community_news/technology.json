So if you ask the AI something it will draw from all the training on Wikipedia, but there's no more traffic to the website. That means people don't know the knowledge is from Wikipedia, they think it's from ChatGPT (or whatever chatbot they're using) and they will not go to Wikipedia, because the chatbots don't source their claims. And if they don't go to Wikipedia to check the sources there, they may be misinformed, but they also don't donate or understand the labor that has gone into assembling that accurate information.\n\nWikimedia has released a few numbers and it shows that while the internet has grown in traffic overall, traffic to Wikipedia has actually decreased in recent years. This means people get their information from elsewhere and without attribution to Wikipedia, why wouldn't it have the destiny of StackOverflow soon?",

The public only became aware of the problems with Scots wikipedia after a Reddit post went viral and was picked up by national newspapers. \n\nI have over 1500 edits on wikipedia - mostly actually writing original content, and none of them automated edits (which is common when people use tools to fix grammar or capitalisation) and I pretty much quit completely a few years ago because it's so frustrating when someone decides they want to revert your edits or when you butt up against bureaucracy.

I actually started to learn how to use wikipedia. Eventually I started to learn things i never thought I would ever think about in a million years, I even learned things about myself reading articles.\n\n I firmly belive things like Wikipedia and PBS are humanity's single greatest achievements, they should be protected at all costs. If any one reading this feels like they want to help the world and humanity, this is a start in my opinion. Everyone should have access to all the worlds information and Wikipedia is providing us just that FOR FUCKING FREE WITH NO ADS OR ANY OTHER BULLSHIT!!! OF COURSE IM GONNA GIVE THEM MY MONEY IF THEY NEED IT!!!!\n\nTruth be told wikipedia is sort of like my beacon of hope for humanity.",

NASA’s Artemis program has their manned lunar landing program set in 2027. China has their manned lunar landing set in 2030, and they have been nailing every single one of their intermediate missions in the meantime.\n\nAsk yourself why China doesn’t try to cut corners and beat the US back before 2027. Because they know we won’t make it, thanks to MAGA and the growing anti-science movement in the US. That’s why. You may think “oh, but we were there first, so who cares?”. Strategy. We won the initial 100 yard dash in the first space race, but China will win the marathon. And when they do it, in high definition for the world to see, they will use it to stoke the fires of nationalism and Chinese superiority. And when they control the Helium-3 market in the latter half of this century and hold the world by the balls economically due to us having to kiss their ass for access to quantum computing, nuclear fusion and even the ability to continue using magnetic resonance imaging, we probably *still* won’t have learned our lesson.",

But that's not necessarily easy when you also need that oil.  And it doesn't help when countries still buy his oil, regardless.\n\nWhen energy transitions fully (or mostly) to solar and wind (which will require good batteries), energy will no longer be something that can really influence geopolitical events.\n\nThere are going to be a LOT of people who will lose money and power or just don't know how to react in that sort of reality.\n\nGoing to renewable energy with good storage (which, right now means batteries) is the right thing to do for the world.  But there are a lot of people who will lose out when it happens.\n\nOh, and China doesn't have any oil to speak of.  Right now it depends on Russian oil (which is why Putin still has money) but it's got great incentive to develop alternative energy that it has access to (wind, solar, hydro) vs stuff it needs to buy from Russia (or wherever).  They need to keep all that oil to fuel their military planes as that's not going to transition to battery power anytime soon.\n\nI don't think China likes Russia or is really even an ali; they are partners of convenience and if Putin continues to weaken Russia and it's already clearly known that the Russian military is not strong, there is a possibility China will start incursions into Siberia.",

We are very far behind those promises. \n\nIn addition, most of this needs to be subsidized at a higher rate than gasoline. So we are paying more to give china business? This has never made sense for the west. \n\nMaybe in the future but currently, you grow GDP with cheap energy. This is costing taxpayers more and not delivering to expectations.",

The only conclusion to draw is that they saw a revenue drop along with the layoffs which combined with the AI service costs wiped out any return. It’s going to be a bit muddy because attribution is hard, but you’d expect to see a lift if it lived up to its promise. \n\nFWIW this is much more in line with what I’d expect — LLMs can be great productivity tools in some circumstances, but they’re productivity tools. The distribution of that productivity bump is invariably going to be lumpy, so without targeted application Id expect pretty low signal to noise when looking at  returns. They’re not replacing FTEs broadly across your org, which seems to have been some (most?) executives expectations. \n\nIf you look at organizations more broadly many haven’t even bothered rolling out old fashioned automation solutions for many tasks internally. Those organizations are likely the least well positioned to leverage LLMs, even though they have the most potential for a return. Their problems are mostly due to having weak technology orgs, and trying to roll out LLMs internally isn’t going to help them because they’ll have just as much issue with that as with rolling out the automation they could already have been leveraging for returns. \n\nLooking at the benefits of LLMs more specifically they’re just not suitable to be used unsupervised. Their output needs to be scrutinized by a real person, and if that validation takes as much or almost as much time as the person just doing the work in the first place then there’s no lift to be had either. It’s neat that an ML model can mostly do that work, but the benefits to the business are inherently limited by that need for supervision. \n\nSo while I think it’s obvious that LLMs will deliver increased productivity in the long term, I think the current market and investment are grossly disproportionate to those gains. We just aren’t going to see the wholesale displacement of workers by LLMs, absent some additional breakthroughs in model design and training. It’s going to be a loooooong time to get a return on investment at the current levels of spending in the industry. \n\nAll of that is a really long winded way to say that I’m just not surprised by this. There’s been far too much ‘irrational exuberance’ around LLMs and a correction is coming. We don’t know when, who will be impacted the most, or the full magnitude of the correction, but it is coming nonetheless.",

My grammar sucks and trying to untangle my inner thoughts into a nice straight pattern on paper actually makes me feel like I’m banging my head against the wall. Which is ironic given my major in TV Prod and minor in screenwriting.\n\nI got through high school and college by writing all my essays and then pasting them into grammarly, having it fix all my spelling, grammar, and word-vomit, and then submitting it. Simple, no AI involvement, no change in the points and arguments I made in my writing, just a simple clean up and mistake polishing.\n\nNow I try to use grammarly to do that same thing to help me write emails and cover letters for job apps and it’s practically all AI now. Just yesterday I tried using it to help me fix any mistakes in an email draft and the AI is trying to change everything I said and is actually making what I wrote worse than if I had just wrote it myself and sent it without trying to proofread it. It got to the point where I had to fix mistakes that the AI proofreader had made while also trying to fix my own grammatical errors. Defeating the purpose of me using it in the first place!\n\nWhat drives me up the wall even more though is the insistence of other people around me telling me “just ChatGPT it bro”. If I’m trying to write a tough professional email or message to someone I’d have my dad who works in sales help me out and give me ideas. Now I try to get his help and he’s like, “just ask ChatGPT to draft some up for you”. I don’t ***want*** to ask Chat to do it for me. I ***want*** to learn and figure it out for myself so I know how to better do it in the future.\n\nPlus, all the very few times I actually tried to have AI draft some written thing up for me it’s made so many mistakes and when I tell the people giving that advice to me they tell me, “well you just always have to proofread it and fix any mistakes it made. It’s a tool not a psychic”. That’s not how tools work though? A tool is a second hand that aids in you performing correctly on a task. It’s not supposed to make your task performance worse. That’s like saying you should use a shitty hammer to bang in a nail, and then use you’re bare fists to finish the job and fix the shitty hammer’s mistakes.",

It absolutely can do things for *individuals* in workplaces, but the trouble is applying AI at large, \"introduce AI into our entire workflow\" type stuff. That's what a lot of CEOs expect, but without putting in any effort or investment to enable that.\n\nAnd even for the individual, using AI to help automate or speed-up one part of your job isn't some game-changing, insanely beneficial, high-return move that AI is expected to be. It just means you can do something marginally faster than you did before. You still have to do all the OTHER stuff that AI can't do, so it's super odd how many C-suite folks seem to be seduced by this as some massive productivity enhancer.\n\nThey want to implement AI, but they don't tell people how they want it to be used, and they won't(or can't) implement it at scale into full workflows across their business. So what do they expect? Nobody handed people Outlook and said \"There you go! Email! Now go be ultra productive!\". You had to change your business to operate around it over time, with significant investment into on-premises servers and staff and networking to support it. This is rarely done with AI as CEOs just want an \"out of the box\" solution, but have no idea *how* AI is supposed to fit into their business. Very few businesses are going to hire AI devs and technical experts to create in-house LLMs that are tailored for their workspace and sensitivity of company data.",

Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Brooks. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or buy less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to nonprofits fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard.

Why are we using “may” in the headline?\n\nThere were tons of reports from government workers about forced entry and demands for access to very sensitive information, but the Trump admin basically said “just let it happen” and green-lighted everything. No doubt this was quid pro quo for Musk after he put up nearly 300 million dollars to help Trump win the election. In Trump’s mind, this was probably a small favor since he knew plans were already laid out for establishing a dictatorship. I feel kind of silly for saying things that seem a bit too obvious. Musk stole our nation’s sensitive info and secrets and he is connected with people like Putin. So.. that’s basically where we’re at right now. Please correct me if I’m wrong about something.",

Mueller did all the legwork for him, and Biden could've gone after Kushner, Jr., and Trump in one fell swoop. But he refused. Think about that: A presidential candidate conspired with Russian officials at Trump Tower to interfere in the 2016 election in exchange for lifting sanctions. Obama knew about it, but did nothing. We wait for Mueller/Comey to present all their findings, in the expectation that a future Democratic DOJ would indict the Trump family for the crimes -- and zilch. Biden let them go scot-free. \n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that Biden Chamberlain allowed an insurrectionist to illegally run for and steal the presidency in the 2024 election, in direct violation of 14th Amendment, Section 3. We're currently under an illegitimate Presidency, because Democrats refused to enforce the Constitution, despite controlling the Senate for 4 years.",

The \"material conditions\" of the president are often embodied by that president. You can look at the political opposition and the primary challenges and things to see other parts of the conversation and the moment, but rarely is a president a poor reflection of the zeitgeist of the American elite. Since you want to limit it to the end of the roaring 20s at the far end, you push out guys like Mickinely.\n\nTypically someone as stupid as he is doesn't get that far. You get minor and major leagues. You get a junior varsity. Obviously he showed us that because *technically* you don't need to be elected to office at least once before, it is probably a good idea. Corrupt? sure. Plenty I'd say 1 in 4 are so criminally corrupt as to warrant legal action. However the revolving door to becoming a lobbyist isn't criminal corruption. Just the weird America version of political patronage and spoils systems.\n\nNarcissistic? Sure. It wasn't just Nixon and LBJ who had to center themselves in everything.\n\nCruel? Most politicians are just agnostic to cruelty. They are negligent to it, not terribly overtly cruel. It doesn't serve their other aims. Blowing political capital in hurting others for no reason is quite rare. Sure Nixon comes back up here with his petty vendettas and shit. However Nixon was very bright.\n\nAll of these men reflect the moment. They all reflect tens of millions of men just like them who are nobodies. Reflect their political desires and viewpoints. That is certainly the case with Trump.\n\n1/3 of America is all of those things. However we're learning the hardway that having someone be elected to a local office and use the executive power is probably a good first step. Trump is bald faced democracy run amok. A reflection of the worst of us and what the worst of us will do when no one will stop us.",

He might have bought the same amount (~$250k) of every S&P500 company and it would only be $125MM, which is not unusual for a billionaire's portfolio.\n\nGuy's, I hate Trump, but this thread is just a demonstration of redditors' financial illiteracy.",

At the very least it's a licensing issue.\n\nIf I draw something and put it online under a [Creative Commons NonCommercial license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_NonCommercial_license), they shouldn't use it.  I should be able to sue them for having used it in their training data.\n\nEvery person who posted their early stories to LiveJournal as a teenager would never have allowed a larger corporation to come along as use that data for training without some sort of compensation.  Not to mention LiveJournal probably had a bunch of terms and conditions for reading the site, and all content posted to LiveJournal was owned by LiveJournal and could not be used by any other entity.\n\nEvery musician who posted their music to MySpace and Bandcamp (who again have their own terms and conditions about use) would never have said \"oh yeah sure use that to train an AI band which sounds just like me.....I'll make all my money off live performances.\"  \n\nThey are scraping literally _everything_ they can from the internet to get as much data as possible.  Do you think they look for what license the data was published under?  Of course not.\n\n\"Stolen\" or \"Broke the terms and conditions\" whatever you want to call it.  When I **personally** do it to businesses, they take me to court for repirations (see any RIAA or MPAA case in the past two and half decades regarding torrents and illegal downloads).\n\nAnthropic at least purchased copies of books (which hopefully ended up paying royalties to the authors, but really how many of those books were purchased used or wholesale from libraries discontinuing editions, etc?), https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/, but even then the argument was \"they were having the AI read them just like a human would\".  I bet if you read the copyright at the beginning of most of those books and they don't explicitly license for training AI, and probably say \"for personal use only\" (which if you've ever noticed, all movies / TV programs say for personal use only, not for showing to groups, which again I would get sued for if I do that).\n\nAI should have been it's own, new, completely different license from regular human use.  But then \"oh no Country <X> doesn't follow US Intellectual Property Law\" so they will get ahead of us in AI design / training / modelling if we have to follow some new US law to obtain training data.\n\nFuck that.  Every piece of data used to train AIs was stolen if it wasn't in the public domain, which Disney and other companies keep pushing that further and further back.",

But if the industry norm is that your performance can be used to train an AI, which will replace you, that lifetime career turns into one single job, and then you're permanently out of the industry. And then we'll get less talent entering the industry because they know they'll just get a one and done job, and the entire entertainment industry stagnates and becomes what ai slop is already - more ai slop",

The dog farts, the cat looks directly ah the camera and hisses, then starts beating the dogs ass with its paws. Not in the least bit funny.\n\nAnd here's why: anyone here old enough to remember the absolute cultural phenomenon that was Americas Funniest Home Videos? Millions of Americans sending in moments captured on video.\n\nBut there's the key word. CAPTURED. They were filming, something unplanned occurred, bedlam ensued, and a perfectly imperfect moment of pure human chaos was captured. And now we had a way that we could all share in it.\n\nI remember watching a documentary of the making of the show, and they had a segment where they aired a few of the reject videos. Why were they turned down? They had obviously staged some grand catastrophe and filmed it with the hope of gaining fleeting mainstream fame. And it was painfully obvious which ones were faked. There was no spontaneity. It just felt forced. They weren't captured moments, they were constructs, and the end result reeked of it. More recently I've seen people try to fake internet videos of things like \"jewellery store heist gone wrong\". They're infuriatingly unfunny, and they're pretty obvious to spot.\n\nNow, everyone is trying to create \"funny\" with AI, and it is failing miserably. AI can only force moments to happen. It doesn't capture that moment when our humanity blows up in our faces. It crafts it. And what it crafts will never be anywhere near as good.\n\nI'm watching these companies that have pumped trillions of dollars into AI circle the drain, and I'm not mad at it.",

To give you a few examples of ways I think it can enhance human creativity:\n\n* Small uses of the erase tool and the select tool in Photoshop and similar programs to help isolate foreground subjects. Many Photos hope users aren't even aware they are using AI.\n* A fun video I watched a while back was where two programmers had AI's and had them play Geogesser. One had a general-purpose AI they had spent a lot of time training. The other took responses from his chat in real time and tried to determine the correct answer based on hundreds of human inputs. The result was a mixture of silly mistakes and groups of humans in the chat fighting over giving silly results or trying to win. [Here](https://youtu.be/JmoFvtBBDJw?si=5ToPMhSb94yBPvT_) is the video in question.\n\nI don't think this generally works for comedy. I think whole AI art projects are lazy and lose a lot of what makes art interesting, but I think the line on what is good and can be funny is much fuzzier than many believe.",

Once the era of technical slop recedes, we'll get a generation of new vision, in which the barriers to making art will fall back.

It's going to be decades before we even have a glimpse at actual AI, and that's being generous. AI won't actually make an appearance until many of us are long gone. \n\nWhat we have now are nothing more than glorified data scrapers, and that's exactly what these companies pushing AI so hard are using it for. To scrape data from every possible metric related to every man, woman, and child alive today and those to come in the future. It's why we're seeing \"AI\" elements being forcefully shoved into products that simply don't need it. Why more and more products are being bundled together with apps. None of it is for our benefit. None of it improves the user's experience. It's all about swindling as much data as possible about each and every individual on the planet so it can be sold for a profit and then shoved back into our faces as ads.\n\nThe government should be sued. I'm so freaked out and paranoid to type anything online, go outside, run errands, or enjoy anything these days for fear of constantly being under surveillance, and it's absolutely affected my health negatively in multiple ways. So not only are they stealing my info to make a profit, but they're also destroying my mental and physical well-being. And I know I'm not the only one. Far from it. And yet, we're trained to believe that such things are perfectly acceptable and that we have zero power or say over any of it. \n\nIf a company wants to track my info, then they're going to give me 80% of the profit they make when they sell that info to data centers. And all companies should be forced to make dumb versions of every smart product they sell. Versions that have no internal elements that connect to any networks or any apps. Products that have zero tracking or use statistics. \"MAYBE\" some on-board basic diagnostics that \"WE,\" the people who own the product, can easily access to do our own troubleshooting. \n\nI used to think we were well on our way to the greatest timeline in history.

Your voluntary neighborhood watch footage becomes part of something much bigger.\n\n>The partnership works through Ring’s existing [“Community Requests”](https://ring.com/support/articles/uds27/Community-request?srsltid=AfmBOopukxUzsJ6_KUL22s3P1pPPJ0BlMEzOxENQuwhFou6G-kpV6K9-) feature, where police ask users to voluntarily share footage. But once you click “yes” to help solve that package theft, your footage enters Flock’s ecosystem where federal access is built into the system’s structure.\n\nThis is an important distinction for current users: as described, this only affects video clips you choose to share on the Community Requests, your regular footage is not defacto shared with Community or put up for viewing by your local law enforcement agency or by extension, the flock expansion. Users who don't opt to share anything to Community shouldn't (at least, by current appearances) be concerned that everything that your camera sees is being shared to Flock/ICE. \n\nThat said, this is Amazon we're talking about, so stay vigilant with your privacy and watch the space for any further changes beyond this. If you're going to use a doorbell camera etc. be cognizant of how it may affect your privacy in your future - you know, don't do lines of coke or pimp hookers in front of the cloud enabled thing.",

If there is a non-American alternative to the same thing, they'll probably take it.\n\nWhat should worry America the most right now is the loss of public opinion and consensus around them. The speed at which the USA went from being glazed by everyone in the world and considered a trustworthy entity, to starting to be compared to Russia and China in perceived trustworthiness - sometimes even unfavourably - needs to be studied. And I mean, I don't think I can be surprised either: the entire world is on Ukraine's side, and now the White House is evidently allied to the Kremlin. On top of all that's happening, there is now a perceived association between the USA and not one, but two, countries which have been committing war crimes in attempts to conquer a territory. You start to lose the cool factor. And here's the thing: people don't like wars. People are afraid of wars, people like stability and prosperity. If you wanted to be liked, war mongering is not it.\n\nAs it turns out, if you keep reading on the news that Trump wants to impose sanctions on you and is now even threatening some member countries of the Union you are part of, you will not really feel safe with that entity having such an important role, and you will not want to be personally responsible in fuelling their economy.",

You'll see a lot of propaganda crying out that it's pointless and it won't work.\n\nYou see it for strikes and unions. Then, you always see they get results. You see it for boycotts - it's so ingrained that even some of your friends will tell you it's pointless. Time and time again, companies cave and start listening to the complaint after a good boycott campaign.\n\nAt a minimum, boycotting damages the image of a company, and that in itself has a snowball effect.\n\nMost purchase decisions are done with an irrational component. When two products are comparable, people mostly tend to like with the company that they like the better: track record, brand identity, any cool ads they've seen that have stuck, etc. A brand that is under boycott will start to have this unpleasant aura around them. You won't order a Coca Cola when you're out with friends and some of them feel very strongly about Palestine. You will be more reluctant to order Coca Cola alone, too.\n\nBoycotting works, both because it tarnishes brand reputation, and because we are social animals who go with the herd and tend to want to get approval from the pack, involuntarily. Boycotting works great because it plays exactly on that aspect of humans.\n\nThis is why they want so desperately to make you give up. They don't want us to wake up and realize that we actually hold a huge amount of power. See all those banks, insurance companies, enterprise B2B companies? At the very end of the pipeline, there's us. There is B2C. The end goal is always controlling where we decide to put out money. If we stop putting in our money, the entire thing goes belly up. We are quite literally the weak link of the entire supply chain, and they don't want us to realize that we are the table on top of which the castle of cards was built.",

If you keep putting it off, you can find yourself in a situation where the latest Windows update does something that crosses the line for you and you'll be stuck scrambling for a solution.\n\nEven if you don't plan on using Linux *today*, having it installed on a separate drive even if you don't use it right now means you have a plan B.  I recommend Bazzite as a very straightforward \"just works\" option, you don't really need to know much about Linux to get things working and it *really* will not let you muck it up in a way that can't be fixed with a reboot.  Install it on a second drive, and if Windows gets to be too much one day or you have time to kill you can play around with it and see what all you can accomplish.",

Mind you my setup is outside the ‘norm’ and I run most of my games at 7,680 x 2,160. Under Windows I get great frame rates for pretty much all the games I care about on my 5080 but on Linux I get sometimes less than half the frame rates making it unplayable. Once that gets fixed I’m done with Windows. Just tried CachyOS this week with Octopath Traveler 0 and I would tank for no reasons while it’s super smooth on Windows.\n\nI want to switch so bad I’ve even considered putting the AMD rx590 from my NAS in my computer and passing the 5080 to a VM to run games that way, but I feel like that would push my power supply too much and heat up my case too",

No idea, but I don't think it's likely.\n\nBoth of my other deciding factors have been tackled though. I stopped playing competitive multiplayer games, and I've now shifted career path from going to school for mechanical engineering to learning the electrician trade.

Most consumer distros will offer to install encrypted. But for some distros you need to manually provision LUKS, set up Secure Boot signing, and figure out backup strategies that won't make the entire ordeal moot.\n\nAnd practically all laptops have firmware binaries that need to be signed, usually by Microsoft. Untrusting their signing key in UEFI can put the system into a state where you need to bitbang the pre-boot environment just to get the screen on to see what else you need to fix. (Ask me how I know this)\n\nAll Microsoft has to do is sign a provided binary, then an alphabet soup agency can insert it into the boot chain before at least the microcode.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into Intel's rat-fuckery with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel\\_Management\\_Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine)\n\nThey have access to all network datagrams before they get encrypted and their MINIX system operates at a lower ring level than the kernel.\n\nEdit: Just to be explicit, encrypt everything.

Depending on the edition (home or pro), it may be the user directory only or the entire drive thats encrypted (if pro, go to control panel instead of settings). Regardless, settings should indicate where the recovery key is (if pro, click \"backup recovery key\" and if the \"save to my MS account\" option is greyed out then its in the account).\n\nTo remove keys from the MS account, go online (theres a URL to the specific page but I'm on my phone rn) to the page to manage recovery keys. Find the one which matches your computers name, and from there you should be able to view and delete it. **Make a backup of the key locally** (like a physical usb stick) before deleting it. And remember where the backup is! Keep it with you like on a keychain, and dont tell anyone you have the keys on that usb stick. In thw event youre being forced to unlock your device, destroy the usb stick.\n\nEven better, store the backup encrypted online- the easiest way to do this without command line or specific services (like a password manager), is to use a file compression program like 7zip, store any recovery keys into files, and package the files with 7zip into a format that supports encryption (I believe the .7z format can be encrypted; .zip could apply a password but I dont think its fully encrypted, could be wrong). Always use strong passwords, ideally a password manager with transparent encryption protections, even self hosted if inclined, and wherever possible, enable 2fa (the PIN/password able to be set in bitlocker is technically a form of 2fa but for complex reasons its not as effective as the 6 digit codes)",

Market share? What the fuck do you think you're talking about?\n\n_Windows_ is a paid product, that supports a giant company with thousands of highly paid staff and shareholders. Microsoft certainly cares about user count.\n\n_Linux Mint_ is a community project, developed primarily by volunteers, given away for free. Which of the [three](https://www.linuxmint.com/teams.php) (3) staff members listed on their website do you think is head of marketing that will spearhead this new campaign? How much extra revenue do you think will be generated by pushing a $0 product to fund this endeavor? Are you currently seeing a lot of ads for Linux Mint? Do you expect to? I'm guessing not. The developers of a community Linux distribution are less like the executives at Microsoft and more like the moderators of a community subreddit.\n\nI see this kind of language all over the internet and I think it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what community developed Linux distributions even are. The truth is, almost universally among community distros, nobody actually involved in the project gives a shit about user numbers. If anything, a large userbase is a problem to be solved; since it still costs money to host repos, and forums, and all manner of infrastructure, each new user is a net negative monetary value to a distribution sustained by donations. If you've ever been to the community forums you should know that useless bitching about problems is readily met with snarky comments that you're entitled to a full refund of $0 and can just leave if you don't like it.\n\nThere won't be a Linux Mint \"marketing blitz\". There will be no campaign. Because they _can't_ make one, and even if they could, they _wouldn't_ because there's just no reason to care about user count. People evangelize Linux distros to their friends for the same reason they evangelize their favorite movies and books — it's why [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/6hur7u/do_you_recommend_windows_10_xpost_rtumblr/) has been a meme for years. People contribute to community distributions because they want the operating system _they_ use to improve, and to reflect their opinions and values about how it should function. A growing userbase is a side effect, not a goal.",

In its defense I think a lot of it did work from its end, it found the printer and the right driver automatically but the printer just wouldnt accept the print jobs, its like a 15 year old printer that hardly works any more. I had to use an hp proprietary utility to add it which was pre-installed to fedora and was like, the only thing I had to use the terminal for and all I had to really do was run \"hplip-setup\"\n\nI've wrestled with printer on windows way more so I'll call it a win.",

The US military for example still primarily uses Microsoft, and they’re not using the base Windows Premium installation with a hope and a prayer that Microsoft never gets hacked. They don’t even get their updates from Microsoft, they have a security team that downloads the update, checks it out, and then pushes it out to their networks once it’s been deemed safe. They also get custom 0day patches, but those are largely handled by a unit in a special branch like USCYBERCOM so they don’t have to tell Microsoft about the bugs they want to hack other countries with. ",

If anyone but you has access to your keys then your encrypted data is not secure.\n\nIF you have a TPM chip AND you do not give MS your encryption keys AND you set a bitlocker pin (prevents the TPM to sending the key without the pin) AND Microsoft has not put any kind of backdoors into bitlocker, either \"just because\" or at the command of the NSA under threat of treason charges if they reveal it (if you're too young to know who Edward Snowden is Google him, this absolutely happens and all the time), if ***all*** of that then ***maybe*** bitlocker can actually be considered truly secure, even from a corrupt government?\n\nAlso let's not forget \n\nBut honestly this is just another reason to ditch Windows for Linux. There's never been a better time, with a handful of exceptions it's hard to even find modern games that don't run well on Linux either natively or via Proton.\n\nMy personal top 4 distro recommendations:\n\n* **Arch:** For giga-nerds who wanna get pretty good at Linux in the way Mozart was \"pretty good\" at playing a piano. Can be (*will* be) a PITA if you run into an issue that's beyond what you've learned how to do at that point but if you want the absolute most out of your hardware and want the highest level of assurance your computer isn't doing a damned thing you didn't explicitly tell it to short of designing your own PCB this is the distro for you. It's very well documented and there's a lot of community support, so you'll likely never be flying blind, but you'll always be flying with the assists turned off.\n* **Manjaro:** For middling nerds who want something that largely \"just works\" but still offers many of the benefits of Arch. It's Arch under the hood but with the creature comforts baked in instead of installed by you by hand one by one.\n* **Debian:** If you're somewhat techie and want to be able to customize and fiddle around with stuff, but mostly want your computer \"just works.\" Some will recommend other flavors of Debian, like Mint for example, but what I like about vanilla Debian is that it is unbelievably well documented and largely in a way that's a little more layman consumable than Arch's documentation. Chances are if you have a problem there is documentation on how to fix it or another user who's had the same problem and posted their fix.\n* **Ubuntu:** If you just wanna be off Windows and don't want to have to learn anything but a new GUI. You still can get under the hood and tinker if you want to, but you'll probably never need to. This is the Linux distro you put on your mom's computer if it is too old to still function well on Windows but she refuses to buy a new one.\n\n---\n\nEdit: just as an addendum to Arch; don't be intimidated. If you wanna try it out and esp. if you have a bit of Linux knowledge try it out. I'm in manglement (*executive* manglement, so even worse!), barely touch computers beyond sending emails anymore at work, but I daily drove Ubuntu for a few years a long while back, and have used it here and there on raspberry pi's for little projects. That was more than enough for me to figure out installing Arch to my tastes and having it reliably do what I want it to do. It is the PITA choice in many ways but if you think you wanna try it out try it out. Worst case you say \"Fuck this\" and pick another distro. I truly cannot recommend it if you don't want to learn at least the basic ins and outs of Linux. If you want something that just works with no need to fuck around with it it is *not* for you. But if you like learning stuff and tinkering with stuff and want that experience? You'll be fine.",

          "text": "The headline “Microsoft will give the FBI your encryption key” sounds scary at first, but the actual situation is nuanced. Microsoft has confirmed that when users’ BitLocker recovery keys are stored in the cloud and a **valid legal order** is served, the company will provide those keys to law enforcement. That’s exactly what happened in a recent Guam fraud investigation where the FBI got recovery keys via court order and was able to decrypt seized laptops.  \n\nIt’s worth separating three things here:\n\n1. **Encryption strength:** BitLocker’s cryptography itself isn’t broken. The algorithm still protects data effectively if you keep keys offline.\n2. **Key escrow defaults:** The controversial part isn’t the encryption, it’s that Windows **backs up recovery keys to your Microsoft account by default** on many systems. Those cloud-stored keys become something Microsoft *can* hand over under legal process. That’s a design choice with tradeoffs.  \n3. **Legal compliance:** Microsoft isn’t doing this “voluntarily” in some privacy-invasive way — like all U.S. companies it will comply with a lawful warrant or subpoena. That’s the same basic model under which providers of email or cloud storage respond to legal requests.  \n\nSo the real question isn’t whether the FBI *can* get keys — they can if the provider holds them and a warrant is issued — but whether people **should be comfortable with default key-backup behavior that makes those keys recoverable in the first place**. From a privacy perspective, that design decision is worth debating, especially when competitors (e.g., Apple with Advanced Data Protection) architect things so the provider *cannot* access certain keys at all unless the user opts in. But saying Microsoft is just handing over keys “because they feel like it” is oversimplifying both the law and how encryption systems are designed.",

(Spoilers for a ~30 year old film I guess)\n\nBasically, people wake up in a big cube full of death traps and they have to escape. That's the whole film. It's pretty neat.\n\nIn the end, they ask why that whole cube is even a thing in the first place. Why does it exist? Why are people senselessly tortured and killed in it for no apparent purpose?\n\nWell. Because someone paid for it. It cost a *lot* of money to build that thing. And to justify its existence, they put people in it and let it kill people.\n\nAI is kind of the same: Trillions of dollars were put into it by now. So you *have* to have a justification to use it. So they use it, even when it's completely pointless. Everyone knows it's pointless. The people who advertise it, the people who sell it, the people who develop it. But everyone has to pretend it's useful to justify all the money that was being spent on it.\n\nWhy are we forced to use AI? Because someone paid for it.",

          "text": "Every technology investment follows the same basic principles. First you have a small group explore the technology and do some demonstrators. Then you measure how well it functioned and stack it up against comparable technology/products/processes. You look at things like learning curve, support in the community, commercial support, cost to train, cost to migrate, and all your normal ROI estimates. Then maybe you have some pilot users try out the tools in the real world and closely monitor the outcomes. Plan for an 18 month to 3 year transition (or longer because of holdouts, entrenched legacy tech stacks, prioritization, and leadership turnover). \n\nInstead everyone went with \"feels like 20%\" and assumed they'd be quickly into some gains because AI is so interactive and conversational. They're not treating it as infrastructure intensive, training intensive, or realizing there's still a learning curve and a time to proficiency to deal with. Meanwhile they're also laying off seasoned developers who are pointing out the flaws in the strategy and foregoing hiring on junior devs because the savings is just one more quarter away. \n\nThen there are the costs. Companies always have this bait and switch on costs. First you go free tier, get individuals using the product on their own. Maybe you have a low cost license, low enough that some hobbyists and professionals might buy in just to \"get a leg up\". Once they spread the gospel to their friends and companies you start demoing it and giving out some free licenses for evaluation purposes. Maybe you renew those licenses a few times to get teams hooked and further into the sunk cost side of things. They invest their time and when it comes down to the end of the evaluation they don't want to give up the last 6 months of work they've done and the production code they shipped (even though they weren't supposed to). Nor do they want to tell the other teams that were adopting on the side that they'll have to stop. \n\nSo now the product has a foothold and the contract negotiations start. Maybe the sales people go easy and it's a cheap license $20 bucks a month per dev, or 100-250k for the whole enterprise. Company leadership thinks it's a steal and worth the investment. Then after the contracts are signed the product gets slated for use in all the major parts of the company's product line. Once entrenched it will be hard and expensive to get rid of.\n\nIn the meantime the company who sold the product is BLEEDING cash because they're taking a loss in trade for higher adoption and a growing client list. The client list, even if those clients are only demoing the product, is what draws in investors and new clients. At some point though they have to start balancing the books. That means 1. Selling to a competitor 2. Increasing licensing costs. Regardless this often means big bumps to companies who are using the product after the initial contract ends and has to be renegotiated. Sometimes those bumps are massive, doubling or tripling the cost of use. Imagine if you had a floating license for 25 users spread across the company and the vendor does away with that option and starts charging by CPU/GPU use, number of requests, or volume of data, how many end-users your product interacts with, or any number of other metrics that turns a $100k license into a $1m+. Drop in the bucket for a large company maybe, but devastating to smaller companies. Plus it comes at a huge cost now if you want to switch to a comparable cheaper product because either you didn't abstract yourself enough from the service and/or you'll have to maintain contracts on two product lines for the duration of the migration process (not a simple, oh just flip this on and that off). \n\nThis is why some companies spend 5-10 years trying to get out from under old technology and some keep old technology around for decades because it's too big, too old, and too critical to swap. Plus telling the story to investors is hard without numbers to say how it will benefit the company to do such a swap. If you tell an investor \"we need to spend $2m to unwind from this stack that will now cost us $1m in licensing\" they say pay the licensing and save $1m now, they don't care about next year or even next quarter necessarily. They want their return now. If you tell them you won't make their targets this quarter with the new tech like they wanted then they'll trigger a sell off and you'll lose millions or billions in equity. \n\nThe result is you end up in shitty and expensive contracts you can't get out of or you do some calculus to do the hard thing to get onto something else. This often means cutting labor to hit quarterly targets. And you justify the labor cuts by talking up the benefits of the technology shifts you are taking on and how it will (eventually) improve productivity. \n\nWhen that doesn't happen you reorg.",

How exactly is that a sign that AI is useless to implement? If im a business man, im just going to compare what those 12% did to what i did and adjust accordingly. I mean AI is only just recently good enough to do actual work with so of course early adoption is going to lead to a large portion of businesses not using the tech to its full effect. Everyone in the comments seems very short sighted and pessimistic because of their inherent anti-AI bias. But unless you fell for the obvious marketing hype, these numbers are really not bad. AI is a tool like every other technology. Some things are instantly helpful like the internet but other tech needs time to settle in. Actually, even the internet needed time to settle in but no one remembers that i guess",

          "text": "Mini executives are not seeing any ROI on AI usage and integration because it’s also coupled with firing in getting rid of a lot of of employees and practices used to conduct business. They can’t even do a sensitivity analysis looking AI it’s efficiencies because there are so many more inefficiencies being brought to light and exemplified because of their trash hiring and firing systems that they employ. The way our economy works now is new hires make more than 10 year employees and then they get surprised when those 10 year employees finally leave and they’re just left with in adequate staff that cost a lot and it takes 4 to 5 people to do the job of that one person who just left. The American economy does not reward good workers skilled workers efficient workers. It just makes some random number the bar and punishes those who can’t meet that expectation. Everyone can’t be the most efficient worker. The bar should not be the most efficient worker that is unrealistic. Instead of doing any critical, thinking into how their labor forces are adapting to AI executive leadership are doing the same things being looking at some numbers that can give them indications on certain trends using that as an excuse to fire people or re-organize and then going from company to company doing the exact same thing while siphoning off a portion of the companies revenue as resources for them only. When companies do great employees don’t get rewarded. They get pizza parties, cupcake parties, and maybe the occasional day off but for executive employees they directly benefit monetarily when people who are not them work hard harder, more efficient meat numbers and do better every quarter. These people can’t even indicate where they would even see efficiencies from AI and yet statements like this or just thrown out there. Everything doesn’t need AI in AI won’t fix every problem, especially in the state now. Most programs are integrated with AI at most mini coding platforms are integrated with AI. It can help turn out solutions but most jobs mean work by most employees in America are not Microsoft or internet search based.  \nMost programs that employees used to do their work are either standalone applications or Internet applications that are not integrated with AI. This is another example of how leadership doesn’t even know what they’re talking about is some are going to make decisions to get rid of AI when in reality that’s not even the issue.",

You call up the company. They drop off a shipping container full of miners. You connect the shipping container to the grid. Turn it on. It lines Crypto. You, as the power plant get a portion of the mining revenue, and the owner of the container gets a portion. The surrounding residents get to deal with all of that extra noise and pollution.\n\n\nThose projects died when Etherium switched to Proof of Stake rather than Proof of Work.  ",

Do you not realize than data centers power everything from online gaming, to streaming, to online shopping, to the social media you’re typing these comments on? I swear the way the comments come off when it comes to data centers you would genuinely think people think that data centers only came into existence once AI came into the picture, and they are only affiliated with powering AI. \n\nYes there are arguments to be made about how AI is now accelerating the amount of data centers, but to ignore that a ton have been around for so long and have been running all day, every day, 24/7, for years and years is just weird. Nobody ever mentions cutting down their Netflix or online gaming for the environment, you know, because of data centers and them being the bane of existence. Nope, only AI is mentioned.",

The power company since spent a lot of money to beef up the grid, and our power has been pretty reliable. There have been a lot of solar projects locally to help beef up the micro-grid situation too.\n\n\nBack then we also used to lose power a lot whenever a strong enough blizzard would blow through. That doesn't happen anymore. \n\n\nMy area was one of those areas which survived the 2002 Great Blackout, because an engineer at the local Hydroelectric plant managed to isolate the region of the grid I was on before a cascading failure could spread. Hopefully with all of this electric grid demand, the power companies will focus on forcing the data centers onto their own power sources rather than whacking homes and businesses without their own power generation. ",

Some use battery and sell the juice back when it's needed - which is a new service the grid batteries provide.\n\nIf you have one of those grid backup batteries you could maliciously soak all the power at peak demand time, but that would be self destructive because then the grid won't trust you any more. You could maliciously dump power too, which might destroy some generation turbines if someone else didn't soak it up. A malicious hacker could theoretically take control of a grid backup battery I imagine. That sounds like a script prompt.",

          "text": "Some key issues:\n\n>Efforts to gut the federal workforce by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency significantly derailed operations at a Pentagon tech team with a key U.S. military role, according to materials reviewed by The Intercept.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Defenders of DOGE, including Musk, have claimed the project solely ferreted out fraud, waste, and abuse. But according to a December 2025 contracting memo from the Defense Information Systems Agency, DOGE’s tactics caused major problems at the Pentagon’s IT office — which is core to the operation of the U.S. military.\n>\n>The memo describes how DISA’s Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Enterprise Directorate, known as J6, was hobbled by DOGE cuts to such an extent that it was unable to obtain necessary software. This unit is responsible for maintaining secure channels that keep the Pentagon connected to military assets around the world, including nuclear capabilities.\n>\n>“During calendar year 2025, the DISA/J6 program office has been unexpectedly and significantly impacted by Government programs that incentivized personnel separation or extended periods of leave,” the memo reads, “e.g., Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments, Paid Parental Leave.”\n>\n>A second DISA memo notes that the Deferred Resignation Program resulted in the departure of an officer responsible for an important Pentagon cloud-computing contract, resulting in that contract expiring entirely. The DOGE-induced staffing shortage resulted in a situation, according to the memo, where DISA’s systems faced “extreme risk for loss of service” across the Department of Defense.\n>\n>While DISA operates behind the scenes, its globe-spanning networks are critical to the armed forces, explained DISA J6’s then-director Sharon Woods in a Pentagon-produced June 2025 interview: “Command, Control, Communications, and Computers — it is what underlies everything and the department’s ability to communicate with itself.” Asked what would happen on a day where DISA J6 couldn’t operate, Woods replied, “In my mind, it cripples the Department [of Defense]… This is really a mission where failure is not an option.”\n\nGiven how central information technology is to modern conflicts, slashing and burning the departments and people who are tasked with providing these critical connections and infrastructure is foolhardy to say the least. \n\nIt looks like this approach is almost the same approach as Elon took with Twitter when he took over. The difference here of course is that Twitter was a useful but ultimately optional social media platform for information where outages and bugs are annoying but rarely life threatening whereas with DISA there is far more at stake.",

Today I see what that endless forgiveness and looking away does. We need a backbone to stop this hate from indoctrinating the world while the rich and powerful laugh at our despreration and deaths because to them we were never anything more than potential numbers in their bankaccount.\n\nThis is considered woke today. Woke has always been about equality, awareness and standing up for rights. If you use woke as an insult you're a biggot. We want to live together in peace as equals. How is that ever considered wrong? Why is your life worth so much more than anyone elses? \n\nIt isn't. Never will be, never has been. Money and power aren't a true indicator of how much you are worth. How much good or harm you bring does. And unless you are willing to change your path, to do good and to be better, you are worth no more than the poo underneath our shoes that made us fall ill. \n\nThis shouldn't be forgiven or forgotten. We need to learn from this. That peace is sadly something you have to fight for because if you don't it will be the wrong people taking advantidge of our want for peace just like so many are doing now. We need to stop forgiving. Stop looking away. And start giving people the punishments they deserve and never ever let them get away with this every again.",

The \"Lunarinskaya\" uranium mine collapse that occurred just outside Novosibirsk in southern Siberia has concluded with a happy ending. As you recall, thirty-five miners became trapped deep underground following a high-magnitude earthquake. But thanks to their Suslik-2 hibernation implants, the miners were able to survive without access to food and fresh water for two weeks. Fortunately, after their rescue and following a brief rest for technical evaluation, the miners were able to immediately return to work. \n\nMoving from below the earth to above it, Militech has announced plans to establish a new colony on the Red Planet. The proposed base will be subdivided into three areas - industrial, scientific, and residential. Ten residential modules are already available for purchase at a starting rate of one hundred million eurodollars. A hefty price, yes, but can you truly put a price on your security? \n\nIn New Mexico and Oklahoma, a new bout of unrest has erupted in the wake of suicide blasts at New United States bases. President Myers has openly blamed the Republic of Texas for the attacks. In a swift reprisal, NUS forces carried out a series of bombings on Texan airports in Wellington and El Paso. Although both sides have expressed a desire to avoid further escalation of the conflict, bookies have put the odds of a full-blown border war at 3 to 1. That concludes today's world news segment. Please, join us again next time.\"",

But by that time, those years of only payed users still being able to create the same stuff would continue to proliferate. \n\nThe most obvious thing to do is to turn off the feature and have the logs be made public, so the criminals can be stopped.

There's a whole bunch of case law involving the limits of freedom of expression, what counts as obscenity without artistic value, etc. Personally I'm not a big fan of broadening the definitions of obscenity given it often feels like a loophole to allow the government to suppress speech it doesn't like, but if AI is at the point where the images it generates are indistinguishable from reality I'm not even sure if there is a good solution in the first place. If it's not Grok it'll be some other AI model, possibly even run locally. So unless you want to completely destroy everyone's privacy there's no real way to actually crack down on the production of such material at this point. Hell, this is specifically about production of obscene content, but that almost feels like it overshadows the bigger issues at play with realistic generative AI and all it can do. And even with restrictions, researchers have shown all sorts of ways of jailbreaking AIs via prompt engineering. Kind of feels like the genie can't be put back into the bottle at this point.",

                  "text": "This is part of the natural Silicon Valley cycle rotation. Silicon Valley investors have the expectation that most ideas fail but that 1 out of 20 is worth 100x the value so by stacking the occasional good bet on a bunch of bad bets they will eventually end up ahead. Also the major players in Silicon Valley are worried that their existing business would be worthless if the promise of AI is realized so they are in an arm’s race to outspend their competitors with the hopes that they can win the arms race. Therefore there is a self fulfilling problem that tech companies need to outspend each other to justify their share prices, but investors keep pouring money into the shares of these companies which causes them to spend more building the next model and next AI center so that investors will choose their company. The companies then need to justify their share price by promising even greater future revenue that will come eventually. Microsoft is no longer selling an operating system and software suite but they are selling the ability for entire industries to become dependent on computers and programming that they own and then can make people dependent on their technology.\n\nThe Silicon Valley model for the companies that are building AI since the advent of the Internet has been to give their product away for free until they create a user base they can exploit and either charge a monthly fee or selling ads through harvesting personal data. However systems like AI require so much more computing power to run. Which means that they require factory sized buildings that allow them to operate at optimal temperatures. Running the equipment and keeping them at the optimum temperatures is incredibly energy intensive and new facilities are being build faster than new he energy capacity to run these facilities. This is why energy costs rise. The companies are operating at a loss because they need to train new models (basically letting an entire warehouse of computers become better at recognizing parameters) and because each prompt takes an incredible amount of processing power. AI is going to try to make money however they can, but the costs that have gone into building each model and data center makes the costs astronomically too high to become profitable through a monthly subscription or ad based model. So they need to promise to solve problems that would justify enough revenue to cover their investment costs. \n\nIMO the main issue we are seeing with AI today is that the majority of gains in the stock market are coming from companies attached to AI and the US economy is largely being propped up by spending to build AI infrastructure. This creates incentives for everyone to want the technology to succeed at any costs because a failure of the technology means that the entire stock market craters and the economy suddenly looks stagnant. Therefore government doesn’t want to regulate AI, large corporations don’t want to say they can’t justify the cost, and the companies building the technology can’t say that they’re essentially burning more money while getting less returns. AI will solve some problems, but I don’t see how the current trajectory of industry will be able to justify enough investment or become profitable in the near term.",

          "text": "> Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warns that we must \"do something useful\" with AI...\n\nWell, yes, that's what we've been saying from the start.  Show us something useful.  AI-generated pictures are cute and all...  But I'm not sure that warrants all the money being poured into this endeavor.  Show me something impressive.  Something amazing.  Something Earth-shaking.\n\n> Workers should learn AI skills and companies should use it because it's a \"cognitive amplifier,\" claims Satya Nadella.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with that \"cognitive amplifier\" bit...  I mean, yeah, in theory it can correlate a lot of data...  But we've got two major problems with that in a useful, productive sense.\n\n1)  AI still hallucinates.  It's still just basically pattern-matching.  It doesn't actually *understand* anything.  This routinely results in garbage output - so everything has to be checked for accuracy.\n\n2)  People often misunderstand what AI is/does.  They *think* it understands things.  They trust its output, don't check it for accuracy, and wind up using bad data to make bad decisions.\n\nThis combination makes me incredibly skeptical of how much cognitive amplification is happening.  I suspect people are putting just as much time/effort into the work with AI as without...  It's just maybe shifting the workflow from correlating data to verifying results.  Or maybe to remediating damage.\n\n---\n\nI don't **hate** AI.  I use agentic tools like OpenCode almost daily...  But it's not really saving me a lot of cognitive work.  I'm still having to carefully understand what I'm trying to accomplish, how the codebase works, what the issue is and where it's coming from, what the resulting code does...  It's basically saving me the actual typing and generally avoiding stupid syntactic errors.  But my output hasn't suddenly doubled thanks to AI.\n\nAnd this is in a very specific, very AI-friendly context.  Writing code is very pattern-based.  We've got strict rules about what does/doesn't work.  We've got a carefully-curated repository of code to reference.  We've got error logs and test suites to verify the output.\n\nI can't imagine trying to do anything useful with AI in a less-structured context.",

Maybe they could've built tools that supplemented the artist or musician's workflow if they'd bothered to ask them, but they tried to leapfrog over them entirely. Because of all this, AI does not allow anyone to stand tall on the shoulders of giants.

That toothpaste isn't going back in the tube. We have to hope they don't come up with use-cases that ruin the world. Maybe if the economic crash that follows the AI bubble is dire enough it'll force a wave of legislation that curbs large data center proliferation.

Google and Nvidia can pivot. But LLM’s were a magic trick that should never have happened.\n\nI made an unsupervised learning tool with data sets in my 2014 AI class as part of my bscs. We thought it was magic and the only limitation was the data you can feed it. Enter OpenAI and Microsoft scraping copyrighted material to create GPT-3. \n\nLogarithmic returns means this technology will always result in average results with unpreventable hallucinations. It’s been in scientific papers throughout all the fanboys. It’s not proper to replace automation that is 99.99% accurate with something that specializes in everything and is good at nothing.\n\nIntelisense has been running code completion at a higher acceptance rate than LLM’s when they started; showing that the technology existed without LLM’s scraping broken and abandoned projects. LLM’s found design patterns, but if you were doing multi-line cursor inserts and using Intellisense, adding an LLM like copilot slows you down.\n\nThe industry has to reduce standards to let AI LLM’s be helpful. Microsoft knew this first as it offshored thousands of jobs to India including their AI engineers. And they were positioned to be the main proprietor of OpenAI, but tossed AI in their products and lost market share.\n\nNow you have OpenAI, xAI, and Meta putting up data centers and it feels like the rockets club of yesteryear. Rich, nonintellectual, men trying to rush nuclear reactors to run their graphics card rigs to build a better LLM. I don’t know a single engineer who bets on this or heavily invests in AI companies. \n\nThey might be wrong. \n\nBecause as another poster has pointed out- we’ve funded their development through subscriptions, but the product never turned helpful besides rewriting emails for people who have the time to write, proofread, and analyze prompts before sending that email. There’s no business case. \n\nChina, alternatively, poked a hole in AI with Deepseek. Showed you could do it for a couple $million. Their society has continued to push for automation over AI and ours is sitting patiently waiting for Mark Zuckerburg to figure it out while his main business is drowning in AI generated news, pics, and videos.",

The big Cons are run by one or two companies. We're not money makers like actors. So a LOT of conventions are starting to price artists out. Those artist alley tables are typically $300-$500 dollars (vendor booths? 1k+). A lot of the cons have shrunk their alley space to try to force artists up into vendor booths. \n\nThe scuttlebutt I hear about how these cons work is atrocious. For 2 years now, every con has had to be screamed at to remove AI.\n\nIf you want more of your money going to artists, especially locals, look for smaller conventions near you. Pretty much every state has smaller conventions, or more niche conventions, and those ones are usually easier to work with, and often MUCH cheaper than the big conventions.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More context here:\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con changed an AI art friendly policy following an artist-led backlash last week. It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money. \n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world’s premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. According to [archived rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20240724010823/https://www.comic-con.org/cc/things-to-do/art-show/) for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn’t for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used.\n\n“Material produced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be placed in the show, but only as Not-for-Sale (NFS). It must be clearly marked as AI-produced, not simply listed as a print. If one of the parameters in its creation was something similar to ‘Done in the style of,’ that information must be added to the description. If there are questions, the Art Show Coordinator will be the sole judge of acceptability,” Comic-Con’s art show rules said until recently.\n\nThese rules have been in place since at least 2024, but anti-AI sentiment is growing in the artistic community and an artist-led backlash against Comic-Con’s AI-friendly language led to the convention quietly changing the rules. Twenty-four hours after artists called foul the AI-friendly policy, Comic-Con updated the language on its site. “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/comic-con-bans-ai-art-after-artist-pushback/](https://www.404media.co/comic-con-bans-ai-art-after-artist-pushback/)",

I do color quantization at different steps, specific dithering in some of my works, vision systems for masking and redraws, and then there's hand touches at the end.\n\nFiguring out all the different processes and sub processes I need to make a drawing mine, is hard. Then you've got figuring out the right loras and checkpoints, sometimes even having to train your own if you can't find one you need.\n\nThere are people who just put 1-2 sentences into a prompt. Most serious AI artists do way more than that.\n\nThere's also things you can do with AI that are just VERY difficult to do by hand, such as creating artistic QR codes. Like these: https://huggingface.co/monster-labs/control_v1p_sd15_qrcode_monster\n\nGenerating an image that a machine reads as a QR code is just, hard. AI makes it actually doable.\n\nIf you want to get seriously into it, look up comfyui and try it. It's basically a simplified engine for working with the various python tools and engines. It's a lot fun.\n\nEDIT: This stuff is cool and it's way more complicated than a few prompts. Your downvotes and disagreements don't change that. I've said nothing disrespectful or wrong. You all want to stick your head in the ground go a head. \n\nEveryone that actually cares about technology and what this subreddit is about, go look up what you can actually do with it on your own hardware and the open models out there. It's pretty cool how far this has all in just a few years. It's only going further in the next few.\n\nLast edit: The amount of disinformation is kind of disturbing. Learning off web accessible data is legal, as the world's various courts repeatedly say. Getty has lost almost every court case regarding web scrapping, but even prior to AI like \"HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn\", and even older cases like \"Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service\" show the same thing, collecting publicly available data and transforming it is legal. \n\nCopyright only exists because our laws make it exist, and those laws have exceptions. Teaching AIs falls under that based off all current court and legal theory. Again, you don't have to like AI, but trying to argue training off publicly available data is some how wrong is naive. It flows in the face of decades of president regarding information access and fair use. If most of your arguments would put cross hairs on things like libraries and even search engines. \n\nNothing is stolen. The court and law agrees.",

This is low effort, bottom of the barrel content that annihilates any reasonable signal to noise ratio and make it almost impossible to find \"the good stuff.\"\n\n\nThe problem with generated content isn't that it can't be beautiful or artistic - it can - but that it's too easy to generate an overwhelming amount of intellectual garbage. *That's the real problem* in my opinion.",
