This is technically different, because the US government is only \"asking\" providers to block domains. So those companies are technically responsible for the censorship.

The slogan is asymmetrical by design -- police will not livestream investigations, the government will not publish internatl deliberations, judges will not disclose private communications.\n\nThose will never happen because **power requires privacy to function**. By taking away peoples' privacy, they take away peoples' power.\n\n- The _foundational_ principle of justice is **innocent until proven guilty**.\n\nA society that believes in \"nothing to hide = nothing to fear\" reverses that burden. Everyone is presumed guilty until they prove their innocence.\n\nA stranger with something in their pocket is suddenly a potential threat that they need to explain.\n\n- Even if you truly _did_ have nothing to hide -- the very act of surveillance changes behaviour. Chills speech. Suppresses dissent. Narrows experimentation and creativity.\n\nThe harm is not punishment; it is self-censorship. A society selecting for \"nothing to hide nothing to fear\" is selecting for conformity above all else -- not truth or happiness or ...\n\n----------\n\n#If someone says this to you:\n\n> When you use a public washroom you leave the door open, right? Because you have nothing to hide?\n\n> When you mail a letter you don't seal the envelope, do you?

Surely you have nothing to hide and that's fine?\n\n----------\n\nIf laws were just...\n\nIf enforcement was error-free...\n\nIf government officials were incorruptible...\n\nIf data was never misused...\n\nThen _maybe_ we can talk -- but history consistently disproves every single one of those assumptions.",

This app will need location permissions in order to show you the map, therefore it *could* be harvesting your data. It says it doesn't, but it's on the honor system. It could be lying.\n\nPlease, for the love of fucking everything, be discerning what you download to your phones right now! There are honeypots on all the app stores, I guarantee it. They would masquerade as something that looks exactly like this. I don't know how to tell the difference between an app that's legit and an app that's dangerous. I don't think it's possible at this point, unless you personally know people who can vouch for people who can vouch for the devs. And you're not going to find that level of connection in a reddit post.\n\nBy all means, look up maps of where the flock cameras are. This is a good idea. But think twice before installing an app that can double as spyware. Manually navigating to a website is *far* more secure, as you have more control over what information is being shared(you can, and should, navigate away from pages that won't load until you give them permissions to access your location).",

          "text": "Supreme Court Hacked, Proving Its Cybersecurity Is As Robust As Its Ethical Code\n\nMan pleading guilty to accessing Supreme Court database over and over again.\n\nBy Joe Patrice on January 14, 2026 1:01 pm\n\nRemember when the Supreme Court was absolutely consumed with figuring out who leaked the Dobbs draft opinion? They assigned the Marshal to investigate, brought in outside help, and made scores of employees sign affidavits. The response was immediate, muscular, and deeply unserious. The investigation did basically everything except interview the justices, because why interview anyone with both opportunity AND motive? Say, a justice credibly accused of leaking the results of other decisions who might have feared that colleagues would water down the maximalist draft before the case came down? No need to check in on anyone like that!\n\nA witchhunt ironically launched to defend an opinion based on witchhunters. And after several months, it inevitably fizzled. It was we’re all trying to find the guy who did this meme if the cops just accepted the man in the hot dog costume at his word.\n\nWell, it turns out they might’ve spent less time worrying about threats from inside the building and more time assessing how easily someone could waltz in through the digital front door.\n\nA 24-year-old from Springfield, Tennessee, named Nicholas Moore is set to plead guilty to hacking the Supreme Court’s electronic filing system. Not once or twice, but 25 times over a two-month span. If the Supreme Court didn’t know he was hanging out in the system for two months, is it still trespassing? When does adverse possession kick in?\n\nCourt Watch’s Seamus Hughes, who first spotted the filing, posted his reaction on X:\n\n￼\n\nIndeed.\n\n\nThe filing is notably spare on details. Maybe Jeanine Pirro learned that less is more if she needed to pursue an indictment without D.C. grand jurors responding with a resounding, “Are you kidding, lady?” The former Fox News personality who now serves as U.S. Attorney has had a rough go of it in D.C., between the juries refusing to convict and judges openly questioning whether her office understands basic Fourth Amendment principles — but now she’s found a case where the defendant is just going to plead guilty and save her the risk of another embarrassing fail.\n\nThe charge itself rests on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a statute prosecutors love the way DIYers love duct tape. The CFAA is intended to put sophisticated hackers in prison, but in practice, prosecutors deploy it whenever a computer makes someone feel bad. Its vague “unauthorized access” language has become a hammer used against people for logging into computers when company policy should have blocked access. It’s a computer crime law written for an era where our grasp of the technology came from movies like The Net, with that girl from the bus.\n\nDid Moore maliciously hack into the system, or did he just walk blithely through an open door? Unfortunately, it wouldn’t matter much under the CFAA. Prosecutors told TechCrunch they “cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.” But based on the bare-bones of the Information, the defendant only gained access to the electronic filing system as opposed to the Court’s emails or document management system. Moore presumably wasn’t getting access to internal deliberations or Clarence Thomas’s next billionaire-funded luxury vacation through the filing system.\n\nNot to downplay the seriousness of the breach — insider access to the filing system would afford access to any sealed documents — but this doesn’t sound like the start of a future Dobbs leak.\n\nThis marks the latest humiliating incident for the federal judiciary’s cybersecurity prowess. Last August, we learned that Russian government hackers had breached the broader federal court filing system. After years of claiming that PACER was a multibillion-dollar endeavor — before we learned that it was basically a federal judiciary slush fund — the federal judiciary belatedly committed to beefing up cybersecurity. This case serves as a reminder of how behind the times the judiciary was in 2023.\n\nAre they any better in 2026? If they approached cybersecurity with the same vim and vigor they brought to revamping the Court’s ethical code, let’s say no.\n\n\n￼Joe Patrice is a senior editor at Above the Law and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer.

I’d suggest that the simplest option is to have the loophole require that exceptions must grant the same nonstandard license used to the general public, and that that license may not include any provisions that *de facto* restrict the benefits of that license to the host.",

And right now the AI bubble/hardware shortage seems like a pretty good hook to pressure companies/people into cloud compute.\n\nJust look at Adobe, once you could buy a fixed version of their programs/suite and use it forever, until you absolutely need a new killer feature. And now it's a subscription and you own nothing. Didn't make Adobe less of an industry standard, they had a monopoly and unilaterally forced the conversion and people sucked it up.\n\nSame with Office365, if Microsoft wants to kill the standalone office suite, businesses will suck it up, because if they wanted to switch to libre office, then they already would've.\n\nEven hardware isn't safe. They don't *have* to make the next version of HDCP available on Linux. If you don't have access to the DRM necessary to decrypt, there's nothing you can do. Same with web browsers, Google controls basically ALL web browsers except Firefox through chromium. If they make changes to the next manifest, add DRM or other proprietary shit, that Firefox legally can't implement and gets all big web players to utilize that standard, it's game.\n\nSame with any other service/protocol, if you convince enough big players to make a move and business/customers can't wait or go through the pain of switching to an alternative it's game. Same reason why all new social media platforms fail, unless everyone agrees to switch over at the same time, then the people that do, don't have any peers to use it.\n\nI'm not saying all this doom and gloom is going to happen, but the big players have plenty of screws they could turn to make moves in a way that Linux and open source won't be the savior. Are there open source alternatives to Adobe? Yes. Will you get a job if you can't prove proficiency with the industry standard tools? Probably not. What if Rockstar decides to release GTA6 only in the cloud? Do you really think people can ignore their FOMO and boycott it? Like they did with HL2 when Valve forced steam and always on DRM onto people? Oh wait..",

But im still satisfied with its performance in gaming and anything else I do with it.\n\nSo... I just cloned my PC.

I can still run even somewhat newer games at 1440p and 60-120 fps and that will be good enough for me for a long time...\n\nOh, and i feel like most new games these days suck so hard that im really not missing much when i cant meet system reqs anymore.",

          "text": "Some details of this software and what it enables:\n\n>“Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) is a targeting tool designed to improve capabilities for identifying and prioritizing high-value targets through advanced analytics,” a user guide for ELITE obtained by 404 Media says. The tool aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend.\n>\n>One feature of ELITE is the “Geospatial Lead Sourcing Tab,” according to the user guide. This lets ICE see people it may potentially want to detain on a map interface, based on various criteria such as “Bios & IDs,” “Location,” “Operations,” and “Criminality.” An ICE officer can then select people one by one, or draw a shape on the map to see people in that selected area.\n>\n>ELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, immigration officers waited in three unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex in Woodburn. They went on to bust a driver’s window and pull a 45-year-old woman from a van, used ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her, and agents had the goal of making eight arrests per team per day, Oregon Live reported. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people in a “dragnet.” \n>\n>“One of our apps, it’s called ELITE. And so it tells you how many people are living in this area and what’s the likelihood of them actually being there,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit, identified in court records as JB, testified about the raid in early December. 404 Media purchased a transcript of JB’s testimony from the court. “It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address. ELITE notes the source of the address (such as the government agency that supplied it), and gives an “address confidence score.” One address confidence score example in the guide is 98.95 out of 100; another is 77.25 out of 100. This score is based on both the source of the address and how recent the data is, the user guide says. (ICE is paying skip tracers, private investigators, and bounty hunters to help verify peoples’ addresses.)\n>\n>...\n>\n>“These records give us behind-the-scenes insight into the kind of mass surveillance machine ICE is building with help from powerful tech companies like Palantir,” Laura Rivera, senior staff attorney at Just Futures Law, told 404 Media. “When combined with what we know from ICE testimony and other public information, it gives us a blueprint into how ICE is going into communities and identifying people for arrest in real-time.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Palantir has worked with ICE for years and was focused on criminal investigations, supporting Homeland Security Investigations’ (HSI) Investigative Case Management (ICM) system. That changed in the second Trump administration, with Palantir now working on ICE’s deportation efforts. \n>\n>After participating in a three-week coding sprint, ICE updated an ongoing Palantir contract related to “Enforcement Prioritization and Targeting,” to “support the development of an accurate picture of actionable leads based on existing law enforcement datasets to allow law enforcement to prioritize enforcement actions,” according to an internal Palantir wiki previously obtained by 404 Media. The goal was to find the physical location of people marked for deportation, and Palantir said it believes its work with ICE is “intended to promote government efficiency, transparency, and accountability.”\n>\n>The leaked material described Palantir’s deportation-focused work as “concentrated on delivering prototype capabilities” and lasting around six months. It left open the room for more work with ICE, and said “Palantir has developed into a more mature partner for ICE.” Documents ICE published described Palantir’s work as building a tool called ImmigrationOS.\n\nThis situation, from a privacy standpoint, is looking worse and worse. It seems that we are well into the era of mass surveillance, and not just by the state but by private for-profit entities who are happy to sell to the state and anyone else who would want these data. It's pretty much guaranteed that all these systems are collecting data on all of us, and not just \"those people over there\".",

The Soviet Union routinely committed atrocities against their internal opposition by detaching their brutal reactions through a complex mechanism of sham trials and false legal processes, so they could pretend their gulag victims were 'appropriately' deserving.\n\nIt's actually kind of hard to convince even a militant to round up a hundred people and then, personally, walk past them and shoot a bullet in the back of a person's head a hundred times. After a while they start having nightmares and weird human feelings, even if they are otherwise true believers.

At some Central repository, because your mother tags your face with the Ring app, now you are recognizable anywhere a ring camera is installed. \n\nThe UK, Canada, Australia, etc. all need desperately to keep palantir and these systems out - once they are integrated or operational in your country long enough, they will exfiltrate your information back to the US data centers.  In Alberta, Edmonton I believe, a US company is trialing body cams that utilize AI and facial recognition automatically check faces against criminal databases. Do you think all that processing is happening entirely within Canada? I don't. Meanwhile, they've got a police force walking around indexing the positions every citizen in public that can be recognized. License plate recognition systems like Flock or those used by police forces are building databases of movement and association which could be queried after the fact. Remember those cell movement visualizations during the pandemic?

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our scoop. Here's more: \n\n404 Media has learned that Palantir is working on a tool for ICE that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier of each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address. \n\nAnd ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based. \n\nThis is the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground.\n\nAccording to the user guide 404 Media obtained, the tool, called ELITE, aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend. \n\nELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, agents waited in unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex before busting a driver’s window and pulling a 45-year-old woman from a van, using ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people [in a “dragnet.”](https://www.chronline.com/stories/oregon-lawyers-seek-court-order-to-halt-ice-warrantless-arrests,394264) \n\n“It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit identified in court records as JB, said about ELITE during testimony of the raid.\n\nMore details: [https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)",

If ICE produces a warrant, the Guard will stand by and intervene if ICE initiates violence. If ICE does *not* produce a warrant, they will be ordered to leave the property. \n  \nIf ICE becomes belligerent and/or attempts to incite violence with a Guardsman, the Guard is authorized to respond with deadly force. \n \nImportant: The Guard is there to police ICE, *not* citizens. That is the job of local police. The Guard is constitutionally barred from policing the citizenry. They *are* constitutionally sworn to defend American citizens from \"enemies, foreign and *domestic*\".  \n\nThis will accomplish a number of things at once. \n \n1) This positions America's military on the side of American citizens - not ICE and DHS.     \n2) The public perception and popularity of the National Guard will skyrocket.  \n3) Citizens will immediately become safter, as this will have a cooling effect on ICEs predilection for inciting violence.    \n4) ICE officers will be safter. Because citizens will feel less threatened and less likely to assert their 2nd Amendment options - diminishing the pretext Trump is trying to foment for declaring martial law.    \n5) Armed Guardsmen in uniform cannot be confused for 'domestic terrorists' - used  as a pretext for ICE attacking/killing them.     \n6) If ICE dares attack, injure, or kill National Guardsmen (God help them if they do), this will instantly position them as an enemy to our armed forces - and Hegseth, Noem, and Trump won't last long after that.      \n  \nEvery so-called 'Blue State' Governor needs to deploy the Guard in this manner, which will make the position of the Trump Administration much more precarious, rather than the other way around.\n  \nThis would instantly flip the script on Trump, and make his regime worry about HIS people getting violent with the Guard, creating pretext for the Armed Forces to step in and do something about them. I promise you, Generals and Commanders are just looking for a reason. \n\nIt needs to be done NOW.",

Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.",

The goal was to exacerbate existing societal divisions rather than favor one party exclusively.\n* **Shift to Favoring Republicans:** Investigations into the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections concluded that Vladimir Putin ordered campaigns specifically designed to assist Donald Trump and the Republican Party while harming Democratic candidates.\n* **Targeted Disinformation:** In 2020 and 2024, Russia focused on spreading misleading allegations against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, often through \"proxies\" and \"troll farms\" to undermine Democratic support.",

Mueller did all the legwork for him, and Biden could've gone after Kushner, Jr., and Trump in one fell swoop. But he refused. Think about that: A presidential candidate conspired with Russian officials at Trump Tower to interfere in the 2016 election in exchange for lifting sanctions. Obama knew about it, but did nothing. We wait for Mueller/Comey to present all their findings, in the expectation that a future Democratic DOJ would indict the Trump family for the crimes -- and zilch. Biden let them go scot-free. \n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that Biden Chamberlain allowed an insurrectionist to illegally run for and steal the presidency in the 2024 election, in direct violation of 14th Amendment, Section 3. We're currently under an illegitimate Presidency, because Democrats refused to enforce the Constitution, despite controlling the Senate for 4 years.",

The \"material conditions\" of the president are often embodied by that president. You can look at the political opposition and the primary challenges and things to see other parts of the conversation and the moment, but rarely is a president a poor reflection of the zeitgeist of the American elite. Since you want to limit it to the end of the roaring 20s at the far end, you push out guys like Mickinely.\n\nTypically someone as stupid as he is doesn't get that far. You get minor and major leagues. You get a junior varsity. Obviously he showed us that because *technically* you don't need to be elected to office at least once before, it is probably a good idea. Corrupt? sure. Plenty I'd say 1 in 4 are so criminally corrupt as to warrant legal action. However the revolving door to becoming a lobbyist isn't criminal corruption. Just the weird America version of political patronage and spoils systems.\n\nNarcissistic? Sure. It wasn't just Nixon and LBJ who had to center themselves in everything.\n\nCruel? Most politicians are just agnostic to cruelty. They are negligent to it, not terribly overtly cruel. It doesn't serve their other aims. Blowing political capital in hurting others for no reason is quite rare. Sure Nixon comes back up here with his petty vendettas and shit. However Nixon was very bright.\n\nAll of these men reflect the moment. They all reflect tens of millions of men just like them who are nobodies. Reflect their political desires and viewpoints. That is certainly the case with Trump.\n\n1/3 of America is all of those things. However we're learning the hardway that having someone be elected to a local office and use the executive power is probably a good first step. Trump is bald faced democracy run amok.

As we have seen in the past they will go to great lengths to remove \"offensive\" advertisements. \n\nThis is not out of the goodness of their heart, but because no company wants their ad shown next to an AI porn ad. Once enough people report them, if that particular company goes away. They can create a new company, create new Google ads but that cost them money and eventually if every single questionable ad is reported, it just won't be worth it to buy real identities on the darknet in order to register for a Google AdSense account. \n\ntl:dr: if you had a newspaper that ran questionable ads that ran counter to your beliefs, and they had a phone number to call to report these ads to them.. but instead you told your kids just ignore the ads that are completely amoral; then the problem is you for not trying at all. Google works on metrics, if enough people reported them, a human being will look at it. If everybody had your point of view, absolutely nobody would report it and these ads would be completely free to create for anybody who knows how to bypass the system. Clicking the three dots menu and selecting that this ad violates a particular policy is never going to be more detrimental than doing nothing.\n\nEdit: I think my tldr was longer than my actual post. Hell, I never claimed to be perfect. If we just engage our brains a little bit.. ok, we know what kind of a society we live in (speaking to Western people in particular) so just remember—google, facebook, twitter... they will use numbers and algorithms to make their decisions. If you opt out of the algorithms and numbers that they give you, and you opt out of the service, then I'm legitimately impressed. If you opt out of the reporting options, the ability to say \"this ad is fucked up\" but still choose to complain about it and consume content on the platform, then that's on you. Enjoy the endless list of AI ads that break the rules because nobody reports them.",

But I swear that shit is climbing, at least from casual conversations.\n\nNow I get it, \"maximum wage\" is kind of a misnomer, most of these rich people don't get money from wages, they get them through investments, so it'd be more like \"maximum wealth\".\n\nBut it's just the fact that I think some people are realizing, once you have enough money to buy ENTIRE INDUSTRIES, and shut them down just because the head of one of the companies in that industry called you a \"doodoo head\". That's probably too much money and power for one person to have.\n\nWe all know what a monopoly is, but an oligopoly is similar, instead of a single person owning everything, it's just a small number of people who own everything. And how do we test if it's an oligopoly, if one of the players suddenly disappeared, would the rest of the industry be affected? If yes, there are likely too few players. And oligopolies are considered bad, because 1) with reduced competition, consumers lose 2) they're significantly less stable than if there are many players.\n\nBut we allow PEOPLE to have so much wealth that they make the classifications for shit like oligopolies look like a joke, and most people (until late) have been more than fine with it.\n\nThe maximum wealth should be set at a decently high number, so people who work hard can still like lascivious lifestyles, but not so high people can buy whole fucking industries because they feel like it.",

I thought Microsoft was doing rough in the mid-2000s, but what we're witnessing with copilot takes the cake.\n\n* Driving the cost of consumer hardware through the roof because supply is being reshifted to satisfy AI development, leading to extremely high-demand since consumers get the crumbs of what's available.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on.

There have been a lot of solar projects locally to help beef up the micro-grid situation too.\n\n\nBack then we also used to lose power a lot whenever a strong enough blizzard would blow through. That doesn't happen anymore. \n\n\nMy area was one of those areas which survived the 2002 Great Blackout, because an engineer at the local Hydroelectric plant managed to isolate the region of the grid I was on before a cascading failure could spread. Hopefully with all of this electric grid demand, the power companies will focus on forcing the data centers onto their own power sources rather than whacking homes and businesses without their own power generation. ",

Some use battery and sell the juice back when it's needed - which is a new service the grid batteries provide.\n\nIf you have one of those grid backup batteries you could maliciously soak all the power at peak demand time, but that would be self destructive because then the grid won't trust you any more. You could maliciously dump power too, which might destroy some generation turbines if someone else didn't soak it up. A malicious hacker could theoretically take control of a grid backup battery I imagine. That sounds like a script prompt.",

I’m technically a customer service agent. Except I don’t work with the rest of customer service. My manager is the CEO and I’m paid like 4x as much as regular customer service to just fix critical customer tickets and repair damaged relationships with key accounts. \n\nSo what kind of issues am I mostly fixing? Simple things that’s become major things because nobody is answer or solving shit until the customer has a god damn book of grudges and it blows up.

They'll most likely pick the 100% ownership. \n\nOpenAI and Google could probably be argued to be the two most direct competitors, given recent focus on agentic ecommerce through UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol)",

Let’s call a spade a spade and some number of far right winger people are going to exist in the minority.  In my opinion that is still true, but how does this turd have so much support?  Cognitive dissonance is very painful for the human mind.  Wildly populist asshole runs for office and is elected. Let’s say I was once an uninformed Trump voter. Once it becomes clear that many of his actions, beliefs, qualifications, racism, sexism, hates everybody actually exists I have a thought.  I don’t believe that stuff, what the fuck.  Now I have cognitive dissonance - my personal beliefs do not align with my actions of being a Trump supporter and that is EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE to the brain. While anybody can just say “you need to just revaluate” it is actually pretty difficult, ESPECIALLY if you don’t mentally step back and realize it is going on.  The brain really likes shortcuts and the quickest most efficient way to stop feeling uncomfortable is to rationalize the actions you take to the beliefs you hold.  When Trump says things like “What you see and hear is not really what’s happening” and trying to just discredit everything negative said about him it is a form of confirmation bias.  This leads to me, the uninformed Trump voter experiencing cognitive dissonance an easy way out.  I don’t even have to SEEK OUT reasons to justify my action of supporter human poop.  It’s literally delivered to me via twitter, truth, fox, etc. multiple times per day thanks to our information delivery systems.  Add in AI, strategic disinformation, flooding the zone, and on and on and it is weaponized psychology.  So yes, while I still emotionally feel like people are idiots I think we all need to collectively understand this type of stuff literally has treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy.  So at surface level people are idiots but realistically they don’t understand they are being conned because unless you are actually able to be aware of what you are experiencing, which most people won’t.  Usually takes a therapist to help you identify this type of shit.  It’s not new and has been around in some form for a very long time.  Great for authoritarian rule.",

Film may be an even better example, some are fine with the formulaic commercial blockbuster spam of the MCU, but others wanna get weird with it like Everything Everywhere All At Once, AI definitely feels like it'll always lean into the former.\n\nEdit: Random thot but a lil surprised by how much this got downvoted.

And, with the artist furor over AI growing every day, it’s no surprise that the company has decided to take a stand against it. In a Reddit post, Bandcamp announced that AI-generated content would not be permitted on the platform and would be subject to removal.\n\n>The guidelines leave little room for interpretation. In the post, the company says that “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp.” It also prohibits using AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles, similar to a rule implemented by Spotify in September. The support team also encourages people to use the site’s reporting tool to flag any music that “appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI.”\n\n>In the thread, Bandcamp support also pointed people to the company’s Acceptable Use and Moderation policy page, which includes an explicit ban on scraping content or using audio uploaded to Bandcamp for training AI. It says that users agree, “Not to train any machine learning or AI model using content on our site or otherwise ingest any data or content from Bandcamp’s platform into a machine learning or AI model.”\n\n>Other platforms, such as Spotify and Deezer, have taken a much more conservative approach to combating AI-generated content, focusing primarily on imitation or relying on labels rather than bans. iHeartRadio pledged never to play AI-generated music or use AI DJs in late November. But Bandcamp is the first major music platform to outright ban AI-generated content.\n\nDirect link to Bandcamp's Blog Announcement: [https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/)",

Most modern music production, including major artists, relies heavily on virtual instruments, mainly for economic and productivity reasons.\n\nMusicians can’t suddenly be put in the position of creating music as if it were the 60s again. Everyone uses quantization, drum replacement, samples, time-shaping algorithms, MIDI arrangements for most percussive and string instruments, vocal harmonization tools, pitch correction, wave-shaping, etc. These are all algorithmic processes.\n\nSo where do we draw the line? Do we delete all music created in the last two decades? That feels like a pointless exercise to me. Avoiding AI detection is trivial anyway, Replacing stems with drums and bass from something like a Toontrack product and re-quantizing the MIDI would already make an AI-generated song extremely hard, or nearly impossible to detect. Just because someone clicked “generate” inside a DAW using a couple of tools, is that suddenly more valid?\n\nWith that said, I’m not a fan of fully prompted, end-to-end AI-generated songs. But I do think musicians are going in the wrong direction with this heated discussion. A more productive approach would be to clearly define when AI is being used as a production tool versus when it is generating a full song from scratch, and focus regulation and labeling there.\n\nBlanket bans like this feel disconnected and honestly a bit dishonest, compared to how music is actually made today. Unless people want to start making records on tape again.",

The point isn't making long-term profit from their number of schemes of over-pricing, artificial scarcity, planned obsolescence, reg capture, or addiction. They aren't truly (pretending to) provide US with a service in exchange for any form of data or payment (studies constantly prove no one cares about Ai). That is not where the money is coming from. They are instead crashing and burning everything they can gambling in the stock market to rush out before the last sucker and make bank. We are ruled by evil pedophile villains that literally no one elected. They sit on top of human organizations, fire everyone who's not a pedophile and steal infinite money from the organization. This system needs to end. They all \"caved\" to the current administration because their incentive structure BEGS them every day to be corrupt in all of the same ways. To see us as cattle where their job is to put every resource they have towards taking more and more from us than they give back. It's fundamentally incompatible with democracy. It's a ideology that sees democracy as a obstacle.\n\nSo they love being able to tell fellow investors the story that they will be able to replace us all with Ai, and pay no one, or at least have an excuse to begin a very profitable venture, firing sprees. But it's overwhelmingly just them finding an excuse to pass money between one another yet again. If we had made arrests after 2008 and refused to bail anyone out, this system would've lasted us a bit longer, buisnesses would be a bit more frugal like they are in Japan. And until they are held accountable to law like the rest of us, we will continue to see them increase and increase abuse and exploitation of us. And if we don't defang them entirely by having their position subject to regular elections, once we hold them accountable, (the most successful of them) will sit slowly chipping away at the laws like they've spent the last 80 years doing after the buisness plot failed, and they failed to kill Fdr. While every decent hearted person on earth will be grinded into the dirt. I fear for a human population that is subject to this system once brain implants are perfected, some private company gets leverage over our brains directly, we will never recover, they will languish in their unaccountable godhood where they can do no wrong and every imperfection is our fault while the world decays around ALL of us. We will continue watching it while feeling guilt without ANY of the economic power to address it. And these ppl use their power to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions, they continue with their pedophilia while destroying everything and feeling NO guilt whatsoever.",

I quickly got over that feeling windows gave me of being forced to use it and hey at least it works and went to a kind of playful way of using it just using it daily for whatever i do and whenever i want something changed just looking up how to do it and doing it. It kind of feels like a little puzzle game in between i recently even felt happy something didnt work because its fun looking it up. Gnome also is really quick and snappy which enhances that playful feeling as well. Overall it has been a great experience and was way easier than expected. It also helps to get over being too scared to touch anything in fear of breaking something feeling to start having fun with it. Also design it to look how you want it to look, look into ricing quickly to customize it the more you like the look the better the whole experience will be.",

          "text": "TL;DR: You aren't the problem. They are. Stop letting them treat you like the problem. Continue to call it shit and asking them to be better. \n\n\nI am seeing quite a few comments asking why and while I am no professional or expert in why this is happening. \n\n\nMy working theory is exposure. My best guess is Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI are seeing loss in profits because it is expensive and the cost can't be out weight by the use or the demand. \n\n\nIE servers and connections are expensive. Negative response has reduced the amount of users they want to see adopting but the end goal problem is more users means more cost. So the cost of use or subscriptions would have to go up but can't because current use would plummet and cost would outweigh demand. \n\n\nThey are seeing this in the RAM shortage and GPU shortage because Dell now feels A.I. isn't the future and is backing away proving to Microsoft, \"hey guys your OS is getting worse, people are now looking for alternatives, and A.I. as the solution just isn't one. \n\n\nThis impacts NVIDIA'S market share as well. If you aren't buying a machine or interested in A.I. then the RAM shortage and GPU cost aren't being justified by A.I. we are starting to see numbers show a big problem and these CEOs and big tech companies aren't sharing everything going on but investors are now seeing an issues with adoptions.\n\n\nThe systems aren't getting enough adoption. Money isn't flowing, and adoption rates and usage are slowing down. So how do you spin this? You blame the public. Easy as that, \"well mr consumer if you would stop being so negative others would use it and it would get better.\" \n\n\nBut it isn't and the systems are faltering and I think companies are seeing a problem and trying to blame use but are now starting to sweat.\n\n\nI think our A.I. market pop is coming a lot sooner than later and these companies are seeing the writing on the wall now and are realizing they have to now establish the narrative it isnt us...it is the consumer mr investor and mr bank. If people were just more positive it would have worked.\n\n\nSo when people stop using your product less you start to go, \"how can we say adoption is up and they are using it more. How can we expose the average user to use this.\" Obviously, you implement it in everything everywhere. For Google this is somewhat working. Gemini just makes sense on your phone it isn't overly intrusive but it is there as a side toggle and option. Is it still annoying it is in every Google product? Hell yes but is it optional and not hitting me in every app to interact and engage with it with no toggle to turn it off? No.\n\n\nI work for an organization and right now we genuinely have people complaining they can't turn Copilot off in Excel. We don't have the licenses for them to use it but yet Excel pushes it. So these employees get a prompt to engage but really can't fully do so. So it is just an annoying on product advert and all it does is annoy said employees to the point they don't even want it.\n\n\nSure enough Microsoft has no toggle to turn this engagement pop up off. It is literally Microsoft trying to get people to go, \"oh well maybe I want Copilot\" but instead the opposite reaction is happening, \"I just want to open Excel and move on.\" \n\n\nCoPilot isnt selling and they see it and are now freaking out but if they put it in everything you can't ignore it there for you may embrace it or try to use it or maybe it sucks in something else but if it sticks in File Explorer then mission accomplished.\n\n\nPoint being, now they need to point fingers because they don't understand why no one is interested. These companies have lost all touch with consumer realty. They thought A.I. would be the up and coming next big tech trend and it is or was for awhile but now we are seeing negative press and we are seeing the problems it causes and going, \"maybe my job is on the line next in this market.\" Or \" I just want to play a game. Why do I need an A.I. in my game or my spreadsheet?\"\n\n\nI think Gemini has been received better because Google has been transparent about its use and it feels like this passive assistant that is just there when something crosses my mind. It isnt perfect and I am not defending Gemini because it isn't great being in every little thing either.\n\n\nI think it is, however, to compare their use cases and compare why one is being received in a different lighting than another because that emphasizes what a consumer does want or prefer. \n\n\nThe problem is it is aggressively being shoved into things while the main product you are consuming is getting worse. Windows 11 performance is worse than ever. GPU costs and tech cost in general are insane and these companies only have to blame themselves. You can't tell me my PC can't move to Win 11 or my RAM and GPU can't use your product so I must upgrade my tech to use it but then he shocked when the use of said product has made the tech difficult to buy for someone that can't afford it then continued to be shocked when I am sticking to Windows 10 and not using CoPilot because you genuinely fucked the system to be that way.\n\n\nThese companies have no one to blame but themselves don't let them point fingers at you for being angry. Point the fingers back and say, \"it is shit and I am continuing to say it is shit until you back track on where you went wrong and do something differently.\" \n\n\nMake a product, stop being aggressive and slow include it if you want a more well rounded and received view of a product rather than letting the main component of your product fall behind. It is like NVIDIA and Microsoft want Linux and AMD to just take the market.",

If you unlocked it early at 60 days before it's fully \"paid off via credits\" and sold it or lost it, those credits would stop and you would have to pay the entire remaining balance.\n\nWhat Verizon is really mad about is selling cheap prepaid phones for like $20 and those people unlocking the phone after 60 days and taking their money away from Verizon. That's not the consumers' fault, that's Verizon trying to incentivize people to use their service without actually providing it at a reasonable price that retains users.\n\nedit: my guess was so right that a near perfect example is noted in FCC's waiver on this\n\n>Verizon details one recent prepaid iPhone scheme in the New York City area where 18,000\ndiscounted iPhone 12, 13, and SE3 handsets were activated on $30 plans with one monthly service\npayment, were not used, and were later found advertised for sale by handset resellers.\n\nNone of this is fraud as I noted above, they're just mad they are incentivizing folks with cheap phones but not actually cheap service to keep them around. It's not like these 18k phones were stolen at gun point or bought with fake money or whatnot, Verizon OFFERED to sell them for cheap, people took them at their offer then bounced because Verizon was just not providing cheap enough service when you can get unlimited premium data for $30-40/month",

I immediately swapped sims and have no intention of going back. Sites like Slickdeals have tons of people buying super cheap subsidized devices with no plans of ever activating them and just use them as a glorified mp3 player or smart remote. \n\nI love subsidized devices. They lower the barrier of entry in an era where a smartphone is a basic necessity for most people. However I also understand where Verizon is coming from. They sell those devices cheap intending to make up the cost in overpriced monthly service. If you want an unlocked phone you can still buy an unlocked phone, just not through a carrier without the hassle of having to pay it off in full and request an unlock. ATT and T-Mobile do the exact same thing on their pre and postpaid brands except they're not beholden to the same 60 day rule.\n\nI want the 60 day rule back but I think it should apply to everyone. Otherwise Verizon just continues to subsidize devices intended to be used on other carrier's networks while they don't face the same pressure. \n\nMeanwhile you have some carriers like Cricket who have gone to such extremes as to put an app on your phone that blocks you from enabling developer options or ADB and also locks the device out from connecting to WiFi unless active on their network with a paid plan.",

If I leave the provider within 36 months, I owe them only the remaining months. If I stay with them for 36 months, the phone is free. The deal comes with a 36-month lock on my plan's price, so no price increase for 3 years.\n\nUntil this rule change, the phone was automatically unlocked at 60 days, so I was free to leave if I found a better plan elsewhere and I'd still have the benefit of my provider having paid $33 per month toward my phone's cost for the time I was with them.\n\nNow, with the rule change, I have to wait 360 days and I have to call and ask for it to be unlocked. So I just need to ask myself if I plan on sticking with them for one year, knowing the rate plan is locked in. That is a fair bet (I've been with them 7 years already), knowing I'll get a $396 credit from them toward my phone during that time. \n\nAnd if I do leave, I just owe the remaining months - it is like a 0% loan.\n\nNo competitor's phone plan comes close to mine if I were to subtract the US$33, so it is not like they are overcharging me for the phone plan. The reality is that they are facing stiff competition and want to get people as entangled as possible - they can't force a 3-year contract because competitors don't do that, but these types of deals make it emotionally harder for people to think about switching. I'll use their competitive pressures to my benefit.\n\nCall me stupid if you want, but I'm paying US$0 for a US$1,099 phone. \n\nWhat IS stupid is that those in Europe have phone plans for US$15-20/month with tons of competition, while Americans are stuck with plans that are roughly US$40 for a de-featured plan and easily US$75-85 for a full-featured plan.",

You can walk into a prepaid mobile store with less than $100 in your pocket and walk out with a competent midrange phone. Personally I prefer the mix of providers and services we have as it gives better access to those who may not have a lot of money at one time but also allows people with unlocked devices to seek out better rates with different carriers or MVNOs. You can still buy a (whitelisted) unlocked device and activate it on whatever network you want. Foreign phones can typically only be activated on T-Mobile networks though.",

In fact, unless I misunderstood things it seems like all other carrier providers are only complying with the **voluntary** wireless provider [CTIA commitment](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2015/02/11/wireless-providers-fulfill-commitment-let-consumers-unlock-mobile-phones) and that this 60 day unlocking policy only exists because the part of the spectrum Verizon licenses.\n\n>One way that carriers deter and prevent this type of fraudulent activity is to lock their\nphones—meaning, they prevent the phones from being switched right away from one network to another.\nDue in part to a 2007 Commission rule, **Verizon has been required to unlock its phones much faster than\nother carriers.** Today, criminal networks are specifically targeting Verizon handsets due to the company’s\nunique unlocking policies. The Commission’s rules currently require Verizon to unlock its handsets 60\ndays after activation.\n>\n>...\n>\n>In 2007, the Commission adopted the section 27.16(e) unlocking rule as part of a set of\n“open platform” requirements imposed upon Upper 700 MHz C Block licensees.4 This rule prohibits\nlicensees from locking handsets that operate on the Upper 700 MHz C Block frequency bands (i.e., the\n746-757 and 776-787 MHz bands).5 Under this rule, no C Block licensee “may disable features on\nhandsets it provides to customers, to the extent such features are compliant with the licensee’s\nstandards . . . , nor configure handsets it provides to prohibit use of such handsets on other providers’\nnetworks.”6 The Commission stated that Upper 700 MHz C Block licensees “may not ‘lock’ handsets to prevent their transfer from one system to another.”7 As one of the Upper 700 MHz C Block licensees,\nVerizon must comply with the section 27.16(e) handset unlocking rule.8\n\n[Source](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-43A1.pdf).\n\n27.16(e): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/27.16\n\n>(e) Handset locking prohibited. No licensee may disable features on handsets it provides to customers, to the extent such features are compliant with the licensee's standards pursuant to paragraph (b)of this section, nor configure handsets it provides to prohibit use of such handsets on other providers' networks. \n\nSo in 2007 the rule regarding **spectrum licensees for the 700MHz C block** was adopted. Verizon's petition states that they are forced to unlock devices sooner than other mobile providers which is directly related to this rule. Verizon acquired a part of the 700 MHz spectrum in a 2008 auction. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_wireless_spectrum_auction#:~:text=Some%20of,55%20%28block).\n\nThe waiver they got in 2019 \"allows Verizon to lock handsets\nthat operate on the Upper 700 MHz C Block frequencies for 60 days from the date the handsets become active on its network.\"\n\n[Source, page 3](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-43A1.pdf).\n\nIt is important to note, however, this bit:\n\n>In 2024, the Commission released the Handset Unlocking NPRM, exploring the use of\nhandset unlocking policies as a means to improve consumer choice and flexibility and to enhance\ncompetition in the mobile wireless marketplace.20 The Commission tentatively concluded that adopting a\nbroadly applicable set of handset unlocking requirements for all mobile wireless service providers would\nserve the public interest, and it sought comment on which specific requirements would best facilitate\ncompetition and consumer choice.21 This rulemaking is presently pending before the Commission.\n\n[Source, Page 4](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-43A1.pdf)",

If you finance your phone through the carrier they always force you onto higher-priced plans with ridiculous amounts of data that you'd never ever use up. And if you're like me and only buy last year's model at a discount after the newest model debuts, the carriers are always very slow to pass on that discount to their financing terms.\n\nI bought a Pixel 8 in 2024 after the Pixel 9 debuted and paid $700 and got a free smartwatch and $150 gift card thrown in, while using a $25 monthly plan with 5 GB data (I don't use even 1 GB a month). If I were to finance it through a carrier I would've paid $0 upfront and at least $100/month over two years with a plan that gives 100 GB of data. The total cost after 2 years would've been $1,100 higher and I would've missed out on the freebies. \n\nI'm guessing the US would be similar?",

One of the reasons Verizon didn't like having this condition imposed on them was that they were selling prepaid phones at a pretty big discount, and you only needed two months of service on those higher priced plans to unlock before you could downgrade to a cheap plan or leave altogether. It got to the point where even if you factored in those two months it was cheaper than buying retail. For example, this Black Friday they were offering the iPhone 16e prepaid for free if you pre-purchased a 3-month $60 plan. That's less than US$200 spent for an iPhone that would normally retail for triple that. After two of those three months (for Black Friday shoppers this will be in a couple of weeks) bam, the phone unlocks, then you can take it wherever.",

Now, they have essentially eliminated it after spending over a decade attacking it.\n\nWhy? Because it protects consumers from predatory businesses.\n\nRepublicans also oppose free e-filing for your taxes because their paymasters at Intuit (TurboTax) tell them what to do, and they obey like a bunch of trained mutts.\n\nRepublicans talk a lot about supporting regular folks, but regular folks think paying to file taxes electronically is a dumb idea, and regular folks think being able to easily switch phone carriers is a good idea, and regular folks think predatory lenders (which the CFPB was tasked with eliminating) shouldn’t be allowed to exist.\n\nThe Republicans message to regular folks is, “Go fuck yourselves, peasants.”",

That issue exacerbates the underlying issue. Without looking at the data, my hypothesis would be that remote communities in Alabama are even more under served then their counter parts in states with sensible legislation. This user is confounding two different things. They also cherry picked one set of data from one state on one subset of patients. I could do the same to show that US healthcare is better than Canadian healthcare.\n\n\nTeleoperated robots that could serve remote communities (the thing Bernie is complaining about in the OP), could help aliviate both of these issues. If Bernie's point is that the profit driven American model of medical service sucks, then yah, he is right, but that has nothing to do with teleoperated robots. This government was never going to provide universal health care and even if it did it wouldn't solve the under served issue in rural communities. Teleoperated robots at least have a chance of providing medical care to some people that wouldn't have had it otherwise.",

Yeah, from what I understand, even paying all they can afford, getting people to move there is not exactly an alluring proposition.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to move away from the city but are worried about medical access, go somewhere pretty where the temperatures don't get crazy high or crazy low.

You still need a dedicated in-home assistant for some hours, or they end up needing to go to a group home just for the single-digit percentage of  help they need, or worse, they end up at one of those predatory companies specifically designed to drain ever dollar of an old person's retirement fund.  \n     \nWe have serious problems in how healthcare is being run, we need a serious overhaul of the healthcare industry, but it's very much a corporate-interests problem and a problem of perverse incentives. Increasing technology in healthcare is *not* the problem, and it should not be framed as a tech vs humans issue. It is absolutely a corporations and negligent government vs the public problem.",

There is no economic version where a robot that needs routine maintenance, software updates, ability to respond to patient command and use their own judgement while also understanding deep nuances about specific human anatomy while performing the task will be cheaper than a person who trains at a tech school and takes on the debt themselves to work for you. Really think about how delicate and variable the components would need to be and what happens if a machine breaks down midday and you will quickly realize it's just more practical to use humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will note that while robots are used for surgery, there is a very obvious reason it is physician guided and not like an assembly line. We have the tech to automate those robots already. We dont do it bc unlike an assembly line no 2 ppl are the same. Considering AI still has trouble understanding how many fingers are in a human hand do you really think it is ready for surgery? Even if it was there would still need to be a surgeon on standby at all times in case the machine breaks down, in which case you are paying both for the tech AND for the surgeon watching every step of the procedure.

Well educated, rich doctors on average want to live in the city with city amenities, culture, and access, not live in a mansion in the country.\n\nWe already heavily subsidize rural doctors, and it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't even an American problem.

          "text": "I would be actively cheering on replacing human jobs with automation and robots if we would FIRST tackle the issue of \"How do we ensure someone who can't work can still afford to live.\"\n\nCause part of the reason they're trying to replace these human OBGYN jobs in rural areas is that people who do those jobs would generally rather do them in higher paying areas, which rural areas aren't.  And once they start replacing the rural openings that people won't fill with robots, they start replacing the suburban and urban openings with them, too.  Now it's harder to find a full time job anywhere.  Think about it like replacing four cashiers with one cashier and four self checkout registers - that's three cashier jobs gone.\n\nIf the goal is to move toward a future where only like 1/4 or 1/5 of us have to work, and/or that those who have to work are basically just babysitting robots and sanity checking them or correcting issues, and working 20-30 hour weeks - that's amazing.  That's great.  If, and only if, we solve the problem of \"okay, but can you afford to pay your bills on ONE job\" and \"okay, but where are the people who don't have jobs because there aren't enough jobs going to live?\"\n\nSolve THOSE problems, and then let's replace everything with Rosie the Robot.",

There's almost nothing to do. The school systems are abysmal. Decent shopping - whether it's for necessities or luxeries - is really hard to find. My guess is you could offer healthcare providers willing to work out there 20-30% more than they'd make in a major city (Huntsville, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, or even Auburn & Tuscaloosa) and they'd still turn it down because the quality of life sucks. Pretty much the only people who live there are people whose families have *always* been there. \n\nSo the \"real solution\" is more than just increasing enrollment in nursing & medical schools or offering better pay/incentives for the healthcare providers. The would need to completely overhaul the community to make people want to bring their families there.\n\nUntil that happens (which it won't) I believe, unfortunately, robots and telehealth type appointments may be the best these people can get without driving long distances.\n\nSo I totally agree with the point Sanders is making...I just don't think there's a better solution.

This provides clear benefits to doctors to move to these areas. \n\nThere is also the issue of population density and the distance between hospitals. Addressing that will obviously vary more from location to location, but it's worth noting that trump is the one who just cut a TON of federal funds that existed specifically to keep those hospitals open.

This is similar to how the robots work that are commonly used for surgeries (in most cases the surgeon is nearby, but the concept is roughly the same). \n\nThe technology itself isn't completely unproven; I don't know the technical specifics of these particular systems, but the surgical robots usually have a force-feedback mechanism so that the operator has real-time feedback similar to the physical feedback they would get if they were standing in the room. \n\nAnd of course, all medical technology has to undergo fairly rigorous certifications in terms of fail-safes etc. before you're allowed to use it at all. \n\nObviously it's your (or any other patient's) right to reject a procedure if you/they are uncomfortable with it, that's not dispute. But I don't think it's entirely fair to call the technology unproven as if it's like a brand-new and dangerous technology; it's a new derivative of a technology that has existed for a long time and is already well-proven in even more technically challenging applications (laparoscopic surgery). \n\nWhat Sanders was actually criticizing, which is much more important than the specifics of the technology itself, is that the robots are a band-aid on the bullet wound of not having enough rural OBGYNs. Like the ultrasound robots are probably a good thing in and of themselves (compared to the status quo where patients would need to travel to get an ultrasound), but just being able to remotely do ultrasounds isn't a replacement for the full suite of care that an OBGYN provides. And it would be nice if Dr. Oz (don't we all wish that was a joke?) would be focused on fixing that instead of patting himself on the back over this, which is at best a half-baked nonsolution to the bigger problem.\n\nedit: I looked up how the system actually works, and there is still a nurse or assistant who actually sets up the robot and is in the room the whole time. The system basically just allows the doctor sitting somewhere else to move the probe around to image whatever they want to image. https://www.adechotech.com/en/melody-ultrasound-robot/",
