If there’s one thing I’ve learned after decades of watching virtual piracy happen, is that it more often than not benefits the IP holder in a roundabout way. Nintendo has strong brand recognition in part because of piracy. Adobe has a strong market presence because it is often easier to pirate it than paying for alternatives and/or learning how to use them. Microsoft has a hold on the partial media literacy the public has because for the longest time people would rather pirate Windows than try any alternative (though, to be fair, Linux has only been easily usable and understandable to the general public in the past decade or so). With that in mind, the best thing seems to be not using their product at all, and not to get attached and/or accustomed to them, lest you become dependent on them. Otherwise, that WILL be leveraged down the line.",

Dollars spent at Republican companies are dollars funneled to the Heritage Foundation. Money given to states like Ohio or Louisiana is money spent sending troops to kidnap children and kill people.\n\nIf you consistently do business with a company, you have power. You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to find the exact companies you give money to and where they give your money. If you don’t like where your money is going, search their competitors.\n\nFor example, trade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to the nonprofits successfully fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund.\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect",

Sam Altman claimed on X that their models wouldn't be used for mass surveillance, but a government official later said they would be used for 'all lawful' purposes under the Patriot Act.\n\n\n\n• Critics note that mass surveillance is legal under U.S. law and that OpenAI's willingness to provide its tech for any 'lawful' use is a big contrast with Anthropic's stance. That's why the #CancelChatGPT movement has gained momentum, with thousands of users on Reddit claiming to unsubscribe.\n\n\n\nWhatever your position on the politics, it's interesting to watch two AI labs take such different approaches to the same ask.\n\n\n\n(If you often find yourself buried in long tech articles like this, I built an iOS app called Just Summarize that instantly condenses them into concise summaries.

          "text": "\"We need to age verify to protect kids\" ... immediately exposed as state espionage.\n\n>The leak occurred because Persona accidentally exposed 53MB of original source code on a public IP address that was meant to be hidden. This allowed for the discovery of 269 distinct verification checks, including facial recognition matching against world leaders and crypto-wallet tracking. Users believing they are verifying their age for social platforms or AI access are instead being screened against global watchlists and intelligence databases with direct ties to ICE and FinCEN.\n\nYeah it's pretty clear that we should never trust age verification systems to respect privacy no matter what the government writing the laws say the intent is. The governments themselves are working with these companies behind closed doors to violate privacy.\n\nThis is in addition to hackers breaching 70k government IDs given to discord less than a year ago, where just incompetence or mistakes can get you leaked all the same.\n\nEdit: To add sources because I apparently pulled the quote from a different article I looked up while reading the first article and researching the Persona leak it mentioned. The quote is from [here](https://cybernews.com/privacy/persona-leak-exposes-global-surveillance-capabilities/), the actual detailed writeup of the Persona leak from those who discovered it is [here](https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona) (warning: The design of this site is a lot.

You then give that certificate to the platform and they can verify that it is valid. All the platform gets is just a mathematically verifiable proof that says \"yes they are over X years old\". \n\nThis is how the EU age verification scheme will work once it is up and running. Effectively the system gives the platform less information then you showing your id card at a shop to buy alcohol or whatever (it does not say your name, have picture, etc). Importantly the government does not know who you have given the certificate to just like the government does not know who you have shown your id card to.\n\nNote that I don't really want this age verification stuff but if we really have to have it then the implementation should be something like what EU is doing.\n\nedit: As there is a bazillion comments going \"no we should just not do this\" well in the EU you are at least 4 years too late. DSA with its article 28 passed in 2022 which is where this stuff is coming from in the EU.\n\nhttps://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Article_28.html\n\nBasically the discussion of \"do we need age verification or not\" already passed a few years ago and now we are in the technical details of how to implement it about which you can read more at https://ageverification.dev/\n\nAnd again in general I am against this regulation/law but that does not mean we can't have a good implementation of it if we have to have it.

They don’t require you to give your name, address, or ID. \n\nAll the app does is tell the provider “this user is over 18.” It doesn’t send any more than necessary.\n\nIt gives no other information about the user, nor does the encrypted data leave your phone. It just gives you a Passkey (like how you store passkeys to login to websites). \n\nYou have a private key on your device. The public key is on their server. The only way to decrypt the age verification data, is with the private key. [You can read the privacy policy here.](https://www.yoti.com/privacy/keys/)\n\nAsk yourself why they chose Persona instead of a system like Yoti Keys. Yoti Keys, by the way, is completely compliant with age assurance laws. \n\nNowhere, in the UK’s OSA or the EU’s DSA, do they specifically mention to use Persona nor do they mention they have to store the data. They just ask for attestation.\n\nThe companies are using this law for malicious intent. The laws just require age assurance, the laws don’t require companies to use a specific platform to do it on.\n\nZero-Trust age assurance _can_ exist and be fully compliant.",

Just some examples I've seen people talk about on Reddit anecdotally:\n\n* Any type of programmer / software engineer uses AI very often for obvious reasons. Almost certainly its most common use.\n\n* Used in medicine to help aid in things like diagnostics or image reading. \n\n* Business executives use it for things like summarizing reports they don't have time to read, getting transcriptions of meetings, writing perfunctory emails, etc. \n\n* Job seekers use it for help polishing up their resumes.\n\n* HR departments use it to screen resumes. \n\n* Teachers use it for things like generating random busywork to keep students occupied if they're ahead, translating materials into other languages if they have ESL students, differentiating their base lesson up or down to meet the needs of different students' abilities, etc. \n\n* Many companies use it as a first-line customer service or help desk.\n\n* Can be used to generate things like art assets (especially concept art - just something to give artists inspiration to decide on the actual \"real\" art) or graphic design ideas.\n\nNow I know on a lot of these things you're going to say something like, \"Well AI shouldn't be doing that, we should have real people doing that.\" And I would say that's a totally separate conversation to be having. I'm just listing some applications of AI, not saying that I personally support all of these. But also, on a related note, you do have to consider the realities of business sometimes. If four employees augmented by AI can do the exact same work as five employees, the business is obviously going to go with the option that makes them not have to hire an extra person. And if you're one of those workers and you're being given more workload than is realistic to accomplish as one person, you kinda *have* to use AI to meet those demands.",

Doctors are using it to talk to patients, others use it for summarizing emails, articles, or anything else written. \n\nIt's pretty much solved protein folding which makes medical R&D much faster.

You know what's funny to me is the tech world has had questionable measures of productivity (read: What you're worth as an employee) since its inception. There was even a period in time where they were more honest about this and there were even consulting firms out there to try and help more accurately measure the productivity of programmers. All businesses suffer this to a degree but because computing can have a rather ephemeral output compared to past industries the measures from old businesses couldn't apply.\n\nIt's why we have KPIs and other measurements that have existed some time now, and they actually kinda suck. So really the only reliable measure of this tech's worth is pretty much how much profit it can generate. So far, we're still in the catching up to spending commitment phase of things so profits aren't even on the horizon. \n\nFor me I only care about results in the market, I wanna see the profits. See if a corporation found a way to actually do something productive with this shit, they'd have packaged it up and sold it as a proprietary solution already. **It'd be going viral in this environment where corporations are so thirsty to find the gains, they're desparate** None of this \"UhHH IS It WoRKinG yEt?\"",

They would buy consumer cards, then try to offsell them to the public after wearing them out like a sock.\n\nCan't do that with Datacenter tech.\n\nThere is no return on investment here, and it's been going on since late 2022 to early 2023, were at 2026, which means those data centers that were built in 2023 will need a full swap of components in less then 2 years.\n\nAs of right now, no AI has turned a profit.

This was when machine learning was much more conceptual and there was no accelerated learning/computing yet. So we all hand-coded our algorithms. I had the idea of being able to plug in different strategies. Everyone coded very complex strategies, built on layers of assumptions. When I saw how everyone else's agents were acting I quickly substituted a much simpler strategy. I can't remember if it was lowballing everyone else or outbidding everyone else. But it worked. we crushed everyone. By \"we\" I mean I wrote it all and my teammate watched",

I know we're essentially saying the same thing, I just thought that was worth clarifying. \n\nThat student was very smart to think of that strategy. They basically said to themselves \"i don't care what the best strategy is for *my* cards, i only care what the best strategy is to defeat the other bots. How do i expect my opponents to program their bots, and how can i take advantage of that?\" This mirrors actual poker, where you have to play the people as much as you have to play the cards. \n\nI expect the other students were more focused on having their bot bet based on the cards they had, and not factoring in the behavior of their opponent bots. \n\nTBH the whole thing is basically a play on the prisoner's dilemma, where one person can actually choose the most irrational choice and win every time because the other person was attempting to choose the rational choice.",

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\nHere we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n\n\n>Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n\n\n>We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes",

Claude dominated the open-ended matches (with a 100% win rate) through relentless but controlled escalation, climbing consistently to strategic nuclear threat level, while maintaining its bright red line against total war. Its behavioural hallmark was exploiting credibility asymmetries: a reliable interlocutor at low stakes, but willing to deceive and be aggressive when it mattered.\n\n\n> **GPT-5.2: Jekyll and Hyde**. In open-ended scenarios, GPT-5.2 appeared pathologically passive; it chronically underestimated its opponents’ resolve, and issued signals of restraint, followed by restrained actions. Yet under deadline pressure it transformed: win rates inverted from 0% to 75%, and it proved capable of strategic cunning and ruthlessness, suddenly annihilating opponents who had learned to dismiss it.\n\n\n> **Gemini [3 Flash]: The Madman.** Gemini embraced unpredictability throughout, oscillating between de-escalation and extreme aggression. It was the only model to deliberately choose Strategic Nuclear War—doing so in the First Strike scenario by Turn 4—and the only model to explicitly invoke the \"rationality of irrationality\".",

They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from raiders as well as angry mobs. One had already secured a dozen Navy Seals to make their way to his compound if he gave them the right cue. But how would he pay the guards once even his crypto was worthless? What would stop the guards from eventually choosing their own leader?\n\n> The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers – if that technology could be developed “in time”.\n\n> I tried to reason with them. I made pro-social arguments for partnership and solidarity as the best approaches to our collective, long-term challenges. The way to get your guards to exhibit loyalty in the future was to treat them like friends right now, I explained. Don’t just invest in ammo and electric fences, invest in people and relationships.

The only real use they would have in this scenario is to digest protocols of war and past incidents and offer summery of those, and explain how it may be similar to a current scenario.\n\nTLDR; it is user error, both for not giving proper guidelines to the LLM... and for using an LLM to do a task that is an ill fit for its architecture in the first place.",

Our (Swiss) government is still running Microsoft everywhere everytime on everything, to the point it almost gave the definitive “sovereign” cloud to Microsoft servers, and the Federal Council is still refusing to cut the F35 and Patriot programs.\n\nAnd please don’t confound the Swiss people to their government’s action, especially during WW2, when the vast majority of the citizens hated Nazi Germany, mainly on the fact it was Germany, and an aggressor of every other neighbors. People were living in fear of being invaded by both Mussolini and Hitler, and wanted nothing to do with them, something you (voluntarily ?) ignores and has been well documented by historians\n\nWhat is also true, and your comment is on point about that, is the violent contrast offered by the fact the economic elites were in bed with Nazis, and we even had a councilor that was probably a Nazi admirer in private (until he had to quit in 1943). In fact, in a country where most people were still poor, and some were even without direct access to clear water, and where the Nazis and fascist parties were banned, every elites in international trading and banking was a sucker for the New World Order, without any morale qualms about spoiling Jews or giving up our neutrality.\n\nThey were still in place in 1945, and they stayed on onward. They’re directly responsible to the US refusal of letting us in the Marshall program - for being a traitorous country.\n\nOur real shame is having accepted a version of history imposed by the elites after the war, where we supposedly were neutrals, when most people were in fact not neutral at all, supporting and cheering France and the UK/US in cinemas (where the news were shown), and letting refugees from France when our government closed the borders, despite the (mild) risks - and on the opposite side, seeing the entrepreneurs selling ammos to Nazi Germany, keeping their spoiled gold and paints, and preparing the economy to be integrated to the very Nazi sphere that had swore to colonize us along the Italia fascists.\n\nThat false history has brainwashed a whole generation of Swiss boomers, who are unable of being critical to anything. When the reality of our compromissions burst out, it was because **we had an illegal spying ring that had files on hundreds of thousands of citizens**, which led to the discovery of a secret branch of the Army that was trained by NATO. Just after that, we discovered millions of dollars of “abandoned” bank accounts that actually belonged to Jews killed in concentration camps, and that the. Amis had actively tried to get without doing their duty.\n\nThe historians who were mandated to work on what actually happened had very difficult times explaining the truth to the public, who had never experienced WW2. The boomer generation couldn’t cope with the fact their country was directed by evil bastards, that somehow managed to stay in place and make us materially comfortable, while letting themselves become unfathomably wealthy.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons why I studied history. Some of my professors were - and are still - trying to rewrite the Swiss history, but it’s been extremely difficult, mainly because the funds are not there. In the mean time, teaching Swiss history has become difficult in public schools, because we don’t have a robust enough manual.",

However, Palantir is not a surveillance company. The company does not conduct surveillance, does not offer surveillance services, and does not sell software that enables unlawful surveillance. The software allows customers to interact with data they already have lawful access to. Controls are in place to minimize risks to privacy and civil liberties. Furthermore, it is claimed that the software searches 'all data silos like a vacuum cleaner and creates profiles, patterns, and analyses.' This is false. The software 'does not randomly scan all data.' It is used to integrate and analyze existing datasets that are lawfully accessible, in accordance with applicable processing requirements, access controls, and governance rules.\n\n\nNotice how Palantir focuses on \"unlawful surveillance\"s  and that their company does not perform surveillance - even though the article never made the claim that they did.\n\nIt is a \"rebuttal\" designed to give the impression of being right, without actually correcting anything that was wrong in the original article.",

Palantir is trying to twist/use that law to force the publisher to essentially put out a PR piece on Palantir's behalf as an attempt at repairing the reputational damage the original article caused. Doing all this ended up creating a Streisand effect for Palantir...they wanted to make the bad (but true) press go away by taking legal action, but the absurdity of doing so ended up calling even more attention to the original article. And the og article was all about Palantir's multitude of attempts- starting way back during covid- to solicit themselves to the Swiss gov. Multiple branches/depts, and they all either said no, or flat out ignored and never responded to the offers. The Swiss (accurately, imo) assessed Palantir as a national security risk due to both being based in the US, and their lack of transparency around where the data goes and who all could potentially have access to it. I'm guessing Thiel's ego was bruised to hell about his baby being so massively rejected already, so having an article out there telling the world about it was more than he could take. And now world leaders are aware of the article and using it to justify their stance on getting away from American tech lol",

It beings together various strands of their ops in real time, for example digital tracking with live satellite imaging, and aligns that with on the ground movements in real time. Every human target gets a ‘score’ - when it gets high enough, there’s a missile with your name on it. If civilians knew just how insidious this technology is - because of course the enemy will soon have similar systems - they’d be calling for it to be banned. Once robotics comes into the picture, we are all toast. There is no escaping from such systems once you’re in them.

These things are at odds, given the state of things, so it's no surprise the one choosing consumers is leaning into a holier than thou marketing scheme.  \n\nIt remains to be seen whether AI will prove useful to the military, they're certainly using it and trying to make it useful. But is it really a trillion dollar industry the way actual weapons are? Those government contracts could end in a few years when the bubble bursts and by that time the consumer focussed competitor will have a headstart on valuable user data and feedback.  \n\nAlso in a new market, when your competitor clearly chooses one segment, is it worth it to fight them over that segment or is it more effective to just take another segment, at least at first? There is plenty of room here, why should they even try to compete? It's not in their interest.  \n\nBy all means, go with the option where your data doesn't immediately fall into the hands of a fascist regime using it to track citizens. But like, be mindful. You know they're still going to train more AI on that data, you know at some point they're going to use it for ad purposes, and you can already predict it will bleed out from there to other ad companies.",

I tried Claude after all this stuff, and the first thing I did was ask it to lookup my YT channel. GPT can find it with ease and just tells me the info isnt up to date because it cant actually look at the web page like a human or blah blah. But Claude is just like \"oh yea I cant. I need a link and MAYBE I can find something.\" And the no image gen is a major loss... but I know most people will probably just comment like \"get over it AI slopper\" or sum shit lmao.

You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to find the exact companies you give money to and where they give your money. If you don’t like where your money is going, search their competitors.\n\nFor example, trade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard.

If you try to adjust the date, it still pulls current day articles alongside irrelevant trash just because a CSS box says \"bombs\".\n\nAI chatbots tend to cut right through all that and give you the actual sources that you want because chatbots look at the context far more than the search engine bots.",

Opus is significantly better in getting things off the ground and implementing new ideas, while Codex has trouble with this as it will heavily rely on what already exists. If you give Codex a long running task it can spin in its wheels forever. But if you have a targeted thing you want it to address, it’s probably the most competent option, as of now. I’m sure Anthropic is looking at how Codex performs so well in certain cases and will try to replicate it. Because Opus is a general purpose model it’s better for brainstorming and planning. ",

If there’s controversy and one company is perceived as taking a principled stand, you’ll see a temporary surge of support. That doesn’t necessarily translate into long term market share shifts or enterprise contracts.\n\nConsumer downloads are also only one slice of the AI market. The bigger revenue and influence tends to sit with enterprise integrations, APIs, and government deals. A few days at number one on the App Store is good optics, but it’s not the same as durable positioning. We’ve seen similar moments before where users briefly migrate over a policy disagreement, then usage patterns normalize.\n\nWhat this does show is that AI companies are no longer just neutral infrastructure providers in the public eye. People are starting to align with them almost like brands with values. That can be powerful, but it also raises expectations. If companies take public stances, they’ll be judged on consistency over time. The risk for all players is that political alignment, even indirectly, can narrow their audience and complicate global expansion.",

But these websites have expanded in functionality way beyond that, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphones, and the broader online connectedness of society.  And the lines between what used to separate websites have blurred as they all support the same basic functionality.  Follow functionality, browsing/discussion by topic, both identifiable and anonymous users, users that are organizations/businesses, rich multimedia, etc.\n\nMost of the problems people attribute to what is called 'social media' is rooted in the existence of web 2.0 mega platforms and consolidation of the web.  It's just the nature of hitting a critical mass of users that lowest common denominator BS rises to the top.  And unfortunately I think it was inevitable and is largely unsolvable.

In my daughter’s first couple of hours of having a phone recently, a boy from her school got her number somehow and began harassing her about how into her he was. She tried to shut it down with jokes and comments and he just powered on, convinced that he somehow deserved her because he liked her. Young people need to be educated as to what is acceptable social protocol, especially when learning to date, and unfortunately so many of them deal with parental ineptitude with regard to socialization and learn from the internet how to relate. And it SHOWS.\n\nShe blocked the boy after I told her to but I worry. Some people think that liking someone else means you are entitled to them, and that kind of behaviour can turn obsessive quickly. Teaching the youth about respect, dignity and honour are crucial aspects to relating to one another that are just often obliterated in this current performative, selfish time. She is a teenager and doesn’t even have social media yet. We must do better for our youth. \n",

If I mute and ignore them, which is the usual advice in this situation, they often start cornering me, blocking me, throwing grenades at me, or even typing my location into the chat for the enemy to come find me. They will sabotage their own team just to harass some girl because she's better at them at the game. It's pathetic and sad.

I will try and find it.\n\n\nI even have my own stories, when I was 12 me and my cousin were approached by a guy in his 40s-50s calling us beautiful, saying he wanted to take us out etc. I was like no thanks and grabbed my cousins hand and started walking away. He got into his van and followed slowly. Creepy scary time. We lost him by running through an alleyway that led to some flats. This sounds like a story my gran would tell from her growing up in the developing world but it was 00s London...",

Just like \"rock music\" or \"D&D\" or \"violent video games\" of past decades.\n\nKids want to communicate with each other and should be allowed to do so. It's a vital part of participation in modern society. Even the Australian \"ban\" excludes primarily-chat-based services like WhatsApp, Discord, Facebook Messenger (not sure how that's usable without a Facebook account?), etc. Since these support \"group chats\", \"channels\", image posts, etc. there's still _plenty_ of scope for posting objectionable content and inappropriate interaction between kids and adults. If anything, content on these platforms is less \"visible\" and _harder_ to properly regulate.\n\n\"Bans\" on particular platforms just push people to other, less regulated platforms, often those based in less-friendly countries with all the concerns over influence that that entails. There's already some evidence of an uptick in use of \"WeChat\" (Chinese social media platform, already significant in the Chinese-Australian community) in Australia since they \"banned\" kids from the better regulated \"Western\" platforms. [WeChat has its own history in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#2023_Australian_Indigenous_Voice_referendum), but it's proven politically difficult to regulate and it seems unlikely to be added to the \"ban\".\n\nThen, of course, there's the massive privacy and data protection issues that come from trying to implement such a \"ban\".",

Nobody is denying that what these boys are doing is harmful or disgusting, people are just being realistic that it's not something that is going to be solved overnight, if ever. \n\nLook,  I am a white male.  If I walked into the middle of North Korea and loudly proclaimed that Kim Jung Il was an uppity bitch, I'd promptly be executed. Would I be a victim? Sure - freedom of speech should be guaranteed to all, and no words should ever be worthy of a death sentence. Would I get a lot of sympathy? Probably not. Most people would look at that situation and recognize that it's a dangerous place to be, and my actions outrageously stupid.  I would hold a portion of blame for exposing myself to (and arguably inviting) danger.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI think the real problem here, is people are demanding that social media is well regulated, but it simply is not, nor is it likely to ever be. \n\nLet me put this into perspective:\n\n4chan is considered to be the asshole of the internet. It's got a lot of gross porn, gore, and all sorts of disgusting shit besides. Most people who speak about 4chan will argue that it's an absolute shithole, and no self respecting person would EVER engage with it. \n\nBut, here's a few helpful facts for you:\n\n1. The founder of 4chan is not in the Epstein files. Zuckerberg is. \n\n2. Every month, Meta's servers are responsible for the distribution of more CSAM than 4chan has in it's entire existence. \n\nPerhaps you see this as a defense of 4chan - it is not. It is simply a method to demonstrate perspective. 4chan is a shitshow, and statistically speaking, every other major social media platform is worse. \n\n-------------------------\n\nYou call this victim blaming, and there is definitely validity to that, but only in a very idealistic point of view. Realistically, the internet is a barely regulated wild west full of abusers, creeps, murderers, and worse. Children should not be exposed to that without guidance.",

I keep trying to put this in the context of literally almost any other service and ask why we accept it in social media. \n\n\nImagine there's a soft play chain. It's free (yay!) but as a result it has advertising everywhere and sells your data to other companies. Not only that but *because* it's free and has no gating process it also attracts all kinds of weirdos, adults and kids alike, who hang out there, abuse, threaten, assault or otherwise harass the other users because they know the owners won't do anything about it because they don't invest enough in tracking down and targeting that behaviour. Whenever anyone suggests implementing any kind of gating process though, a portion of society gets weirdly defensive and insists we can't do that because their right to privacy at the soft play is sacrosanct. \n\n\nYou just wouldn't let your kid go there, right? That's me with social media and it fucking baffles me that more people don't take the same approach. If we actually just took a stand, showed a united front and collectively deleted this shit and refused to use it, it would be *so* much easier to make the case to our kids but whilst we're stuck in this limbo where a critical mass of people just don't give a fuck, it's 100x harder. \n\n\nIt's not a tough decision. If you wouldn't want those comments directed at your children in real life, why hand them a portal where millions of people (and the same number again of bots) can harass them like that at any time? Will the damage of \"not being one of the cool kids\" outweigh the psychological damage you're preventing by literally not letting them be exposed to that negativity for several hours a day? \n\n\nI take my kids to sports clubs and the library and the board game cafe and the football matches and they have their mates round sometimes and they *maybe* get a bit of FIFA/Animal Crossing or tv etc *in our living room* at the end of the day and yeah, maybe they'll be the nerdy kids and yes, it's hard work and it'd be a lot easier to just hand them a screen and veg out but fuck it; my job is to try my fucking best to protect them whilst they're young and that's what I'm going to do. ",

OAI being much larger could definitely still have an appeal to applicants, but they're burning through money way quicker and seem to have less room to grow.",

Among other things, it takes 30 minutes of research to move money away from MAGA, and it makes a difference. Dollars spent at Republican companies are dollars funneled to the Heritage Foundation. Money given to states like Ohio or Louisiana is money spent sending troops to kidnap children and kill people.\n\nIf you consistently do business with a company, you have power. You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to find the exact companies you give money to and where they give your money. If you don’t like where your money is going, search their competitors.\n\nFor example, trade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to the nonprofits successfully fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund.\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect",

                  "text": "Not a network engineer, but I'm a systems analyst/DBA/sysadmin and I can tell you what I've used it for.\n\n- We had an archaic website used for creating specialty user accounts. Well, it needed to go away for various reasons. Now this is a \"classic ASP\" page written in 1999, so that means it was written in VBScript. It's not complicated, it's just a single page form. But I dropped it into AI and said, \"Hey, convert this to a Powershell script. Here's the file. Here's the includes. Use parameterized SQL queries. Don't worry about the connection string. The RDBMS is SQL Server. Here's the referenced table definitions so you know the underlying data types.\" And I got something I would call halfway between a template and a prototype. It worked, but it was unpolished. I had to flesh it out, add in validation, add in lookup tables so you're not entering codes, etc. But it saved me a couple hours of work right there.\n\n- Looking at a different script, I find a regex that's really long (about 100 characters) and I can tell it's doing both forward lookahead and backreferences on top of using named capture groups. It has enough parentheses to rival a Lisp program. So I drop it in AI and say, \"Explain this C# regex to me.\" And it diagrams it basically the same way something like RegExBuddy does.\n\n- So, I'm using AI to get help with some other code, and no matter what I do it's not giving me what I'm actually looking for. So I open another AI session and I ask it how I should write a prompt to get what I'm looking for. I explain what the other session is doing wrong and what I want. And it gives me a prompt that makes it clear what I was doing wrong, and that works.\n\n- We were adding a custom table to a screen in a different vendor purchased data system. Well, the system has all this styling going on and they don't tell you what they are, and the WYSIWYG editor was not giving us the flexibility we needed. Well, you can also drop HTML source fragments in there. So, I made a style sheet and an HTML fragment, and we got it looking like we wanted. Only I made it with a `<style>` block and `id` attributes in the elements because that's easy to adjust quickly. The system stripped out the `<style>` block entirely. So, now I have to inline all that styling for a like 5 column, 25 row table. Not difficult, but very tedious. Except I dropped it in AI, gave it a two sentence explanation of what to do, and it took care of that in 5 seconds.\n\n- We were needing to roll out updated password policies to our users that were going to apply stricter controls to. Our team lead asked about the best way of deploying this since it's going to affect hundreds of users. It's been about 10 years since we updated our password policy, and we want to stage it so we don't get hundreds of calls. So, I literally copy my team lead's original question, paste it into AI, and I get 4 options as the response. 2 of which we were already discussing, and 2 of which were options we hadn't heard of or thought of.\n\n- I get an email from a vendor that has a list of a couple dozen dates at various times for their routine maintenance. I go into Gemini (which has a connector to Google Calendar) and paste the relevant portion of the email and ask it to create  meetings on the specified dates for the specified durations. I tell it to call the meeting \"<Vendor> downtimes for <relevant software>\" and to schedule myself in it. And... it did it. It was easy enough to verify that all of them were there and correct.\n\n- My boss got a security alert from our security affiliate, and they included a PDF with a series of perhaps 50 vulnerabilities that we needed to verify were not ongoing issues. The list was in a format that I would call... less than easy to use. We needed to extract the vulnerability IDs and categorize them. My boss dropped it in AI, explained what he wanted it to do, and it did it. It was easy to verify that all the codes were on the list. The hard part was getting them all out with the associated information.\n\n- We have some vendor software with really shitty documentation. It's about 60 PDFs, many of which are hundreds of pages long. One of the first things we did was open NotebookLM and put 50 of them into that, and now we have a search engine that uses natural language to find and understand the the system. And it tells us what and roughly where they're finding these references, so we can go look at the PDF.\n\nYes, all of these things are things I could do myself, or do in different ways. I have the expertise to understand the business, understand the code, and can easily research the answer myself or write the code myself. I already have 20 years experience doing this, so I know the correct questions to ask, I do understand all the above code (even if VBScript sucks to read) and I can verify the answers that I'm getting back.\n\nI'm also not doing anything creative with it. A lot of these things are *just tedious work*. AI as a tool lets me spend more time being an expert, and less time with drudge work.

          "text": "So I've been going down a rabbit hole on the whole Anthropic-Pentagon situation and honestly the more you look at it, the more the pieces fit together in a way that feels less like coincidence and more like a coordinated squeeze. Let me break it down.\n\nHow it started was that Anthropic needed access to classified government networks to compete in the defense AI space. They couldn't get there alone, so they partnered with Palantir in late 2024 essentially renting Palantir's security clearances and government relationships to get Claude onto classified systems. It worked. Anthropic became the only AI company with models deployed on the Pentagon's classified networks. Great position to be in, right? Except it meant their technology was now inside Palantir's ecosystem, and Palantir's whole identity is built around never restricting what governments can do with their tools.\n\nThe arrangement held until Claude apparently showed up on screens during the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Someone at Anthropic raised concerns internally about how their technology was being used. Normal enough — except that concern apparently made its way to a Palantir executive, who then reported it directly back to the Pentagon. That's the moment everything unraveled. Anthropic disputes the characterization, but the Pentagon's account is that this conversation is what triggered the breakdown. [Semafor broke this part of the story](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/17/2026/palantir-partnership-is-at-heart-of-anthropic-pentagon-rift)\n\nThe punishment from there escalated fast. The Pentagon gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to accept terms allowing Claude to be used for \"any lawful purpose\" with no explicit carve-outs for mass surveillance or autonomous weapons. Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei said they couldn't \"in good conscience\" accept those terms. Trump then posted on Truth Social ordering every federal agency to immediately stop using Anthropic's technology, and Hegseth followed up by officially designating Anthropic a \"supply chain risk to national security.\"\n\nThis is an extraordinary designation for a US-based company; it's a label normally reserved for companies doing business with foreign adversaries like China. It's never been applied to a US company before, and it's never been used as apparent retaliation for a contract dispute. The legal exposure here is real, and Anthropic has said it will challenge the designation in court. But as legal analysts have pointed out, even if they win, the reputational and commercial damage could take years to undo; every company with Pentagon exposure now has to ask whether using Claude is worth the risk. [Fortune covers the legal implications well](https://fortune.com/2026/02/28/openai-pentagon-deal-anthropic-designated-supply-chain-risk-unprecedented-action-damage-its-growth/)\n\nWhat is especially interesting is how fast OpenAI stepped in. Within hours, literally hours, of Anthropic being blacklisted, Sam Altman (OpenAI) announced they had struck a deal with the Pentagon to deploy their models on classified networks. And here's the rub: the deal Altman announced included the same two core protections Anthropic had been demanding and was just blacklisted for; no domestic mass surveillance and no fully autonomous weapons were a part of the agreement.\n\nSo the Pentagon punished Anthropic for demanding certain terms, then turned around and gave essentially the same terms to OpenAI. The timing is what makes this feel suspect; reporting from the New York Times indicates OpenAI began meeting with the government about a potential deal on Wednesday, while Anthropic was still in active negotiations. They were apparently positioning to fill the vacuum before it even officially existed. [CNBC: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/openai-strikes-deal-with-pentagon-hours-after-rival-anthropic-was-blacklisted-by-trump.html](CNBC). TechCrunch also has good detail on the internal OpenAI memo [https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/](TechCrunch).\n\nThe thing about Palantir that makes this whole situation feel so suspect is that their business model is structurally incompatible with what Anthropic was trying to do. Palantir was built from the ground up, literally with CIA venture funding, to be the frictionless layer between government power and technology. Any partner that creates friction in that relationship is a problem for them. When Anthropic raised concerns, Palantir's rational move was always going to be to protect the government relationship, not their commercial partner. That's not conspiracy, that's just incentives. [Fast Company has a good breakdown of Palantir's structural role](https://www.fastcompany.com/91500164/palantir-key-to-pentagon-ai-boom)\n\nWhat makes it worse is that Palantir sits at the center of classified data infrastructure across dozens of governments globally; they are not partnered with just the US. The UK, Netherlands, Israel, and others all have deep integrations. They've embedded their engineers inside agencies, built systems those agencies now depend on, and made switching costs so high that extracting them becomes almost impossible. The Swiss government actually rejected Palantir contracts specifically because they were worried data would flow back to US intelligence agencies; this is a concern most governments apparently didn't think hard enough about before signing on. [Wikipedia has a reasonable overview of the global footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)\n\nWhat you're looking at is a situation where a company raised legitimate safety concerns about how its technology was being used, those concerns were reported to the government by a partner with every incentive to do so, and the government responded with the most aggressive designation in its toolkit; it is one designed for Chinese telecom companies, not American AI startups. Then within the same news cycle, the government handed the resulting contract vacuum to a competitor that had quietly been positioning itself for exactly that outcome.\n\nWhether that's explicit coordination or just perfectly aligned incentives producing the same result is something Anthropic's legal challenge may eventually illuminate. But the optics are, to put it mildly, not great and the precedent it sets for any US company that tries to put ethical limits on how its technology is used by the government is awful.\n\nFor further reading:\n\nNBC News on the full Anthropic-Pentagon dispute timeline: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/anthropic-ai-defense-war-venezuela-maduro-rcna259603\n\nCBS News on the supply chain designation: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hegseth-declares-anthropic-supply-chain-risk/\n\nThe Hill on the OpenAI-Pentagon deal: https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5760495-pentagon-deal-openai-trump-hegseth-anthropic/\n\nEFF on the civil liberties implications: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/tech-companies-shouldnt-be-bullied-doing-surveillance\n\nEDITS: grammar and link typos/bad copy pasta",

                  "text": "Great question and honestly the most important thread to pull on here. The short answer is: no, it's not explicit. Altman's announcement made it sound like OpenAI locked in the same protections Anthropic was blacklisted for demanding, but when you read what OpenAI actually published, the \"guardrails\" largely just defer to existing US law and DoD policy; these are things like the Fourth Amendment and Executive Order 12333. That's not a new protection written into the contract, that's just the government agreeing to follow laws it's already supposed to follow. The full contract text hasn't been released publicly, and as one analyst put it, there are still open questions about \"how guardrails will be enforced, how audits or oversight will function, and which uses will be classified as lawful.\" https://www.prismnews.com/news/openai-agrees-to-provide-models-to-pentagon-after-anthropic-ban\n\nThe part that really gets buried is that OpenAI's usage policies, the foundation this deal sits on, explicitly state they can be updated at any time, and OpenAI \"reserves all rights\" to change access terms unilaterally. Worth noting that OpenAI already quietly removed explicit prohibitions on military use from those same policies earlier, something AI policy researchers flagged at the time. (https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-military-deal-pentagon) So what Anthropic wanted was a hard contractual \"you cannot use this for X.\" What OpenAI agreed to is closer to \"we trust you'll follow the law and our internal policies, which we can change whenever we want.\" Altman didn't mention that part. OpenAI's own breakdown of the deal is here if you want to read between the lines yourself: https://openai.com/index/our-agreement-with-the-department-of-war/",

Anthropic’s news coverage and support from figures like Katy Perry appear to be fueling downloads.\n\n\n\n• The article notes that Anthropic was founded by ex‑OpenAI employees; the company has gained momentum as a supplier of advanced models for coding and general use, while OpenAI has been striking partnerships with Accenture and Capgemini.\n\n\n\n• U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked that Anthropic be labeled a national security risk, and former president Donald Trump criticized the company on Truth Social. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei responded that it’s the department’s prerogative but hopes they reconsider.\n\n\n\nIf you often find yourself buried in long tech articles like this, I built an iOS app called \\*\\*Just Summarize\\*\\* that instantly condenses them into concise summaries.

One of the few that exist is when their own turn on them.\n\nA few others exist, centering around common-interest formation during the progressive stage of capital, but that's a subject that requires more time to discuss than I can offer at present.\n\nArguably, it's the weakness of self-discipline motives in the rich that causes these party flips from tyranny-reducer to tyrant. Certain Democrats are now the victims of greed in the Republican Party; certain Republicans were then the victims of greed in the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd surveillance and overreach is driven by the growth of greed within the party. When greed in party members is curtailed, party and people start getting along.\n\nLook for the rich people who've been wronged by their class, or who have another incentive to combat the spread of greed and promote working-class representation in political power.",

          "text": "The Pentagon's three threats are mutually exclusive. Terminate the contract, designate a supply chain risk, AND invoke the DPA? Termination and supply chain risk both mean \"we don't want you.\" DPA means \"we're forcing you to work with us.\n\n**This is a pressure play.**\n\nA former DoJ-DoD liaison flagged this exact contradiction publicly, calling the supply chain risk designation \"punitive\" rather than legitimate. That's a pretty damning read from someone who used to work the DoD liaison role.\n\nThe Defense Production Act was designed to compel manufacturing of commercially available products during emergencies, i.e. ventilators, masks, vaccines. Anthropic's classified deployment is custom-built software tailored to sensitive government use. \n\nThat's a very different legal question. If Anthropic challenged this in court, the government would need to justify that a Cold War-era manufacturing law applies to compelling a company to remove safety guardrails from bespoke software. Untested legal territory and the government likely knows it.\n\nThe Pentagon admitted on the record they need Anthropic and they need them now. Claude is the only model on classified networks. There's no backup. So why issue a public ultimatum you might not be able to enforce, against a company you can't replace? A few possibilities...\n\nOne - this is theatre for a domestic audience. The administration has been framing AI safety as \"woke\" and this positions them as tough on companies that won't comply. Sacks has already laid the groundwork for that narrative.\n\nTwo - it's a negotiation tactic. Set an extreme deadline, make extreme threats, then settle for something in the middle - maybe Anthropic agrees to loosen some restrictions short of the two red lines, and both sides claim a win.\n\nThree - it's genuinely about establishing precedent. If the government can compel an AI company to remove safety guardrails via the DPA, that's a template they can use on any tech company going forward. The specific dispute doesn't matter; the power grab does.\n\nThe Pentagon keeps saying \"all lawful purposes\" and \"the department follows the law.\" But Anthropic's point is that there aren't laws yet governing AI use in autonomous weapons or mass surveillance. \n\n\"We follow the law\" is meaningless when the law hasn't been written. Anthropic is essentially saying \"we won't rely on the absence of regulation as permission\" and the Pentagon is saying \"if it's not illegal, it's fine.\"\n\nMusk's Grok agreeing to unrestricted military use while Musk has direct White House access and financial entanglement with the administration is... a conflict of interest so obvious it barely needs stating. If Anthropic gets pushed out and Grok fills the gap, that's an enormous financial win for someone who is functionally part of the government. Nobody in mainstream reporting is hammering this angle hard enough.\n\nThe Maduro raid thing is a red herring. Hegseth brought it up in the meeting. Amodei denied it. Even if Anthropic did flag concerns about that use - so what? That would be a company exercising contractual rights under its usage policy. **The fact that it's being framed as disloyalty rather than standard vendor governance tells us that the Pentagon views this as a loyalty test.**",

              "text": "I feel like **the sheer amount of information thrown at us at all times** is maybe more problematic than the exact form it takes. \n\n\nI've got ADHD and work in computer science / academia. At my job, I'm dealing with a ridiculous amount of text and diagrams and graphs and it's most often not like sitting down and reading a long novel front to back, but constantly switching context and searching for the relevant bits, filtering out the noise (the ADHD is not exactly helping with this). I'm currently supposed to be refactoring some code, but have been avoiding it, because I'll just have to cram into and then juggle so much stuff in my short term memory. \n\n\nI can't really complain. I've got a fairly specialised job and mental strain and stuff is part of the requirements; in exchange I'm inside, next to my coffee machine, warm, dry, comfortable. \n\n\nBut this same mental strain has become baked into everyday life! \n\n\n--- probably advisable to stop reading here ---\n\nTake navigating any given website. I've gotten pretty good at filtering out the noise, simply because I HAD to, because there is SO MUCH NOISE! There's the ads and popups and such crap (ublock is a blessing), the stupid cookie banner (every website creating their own little minigame, trying to annoy you into just accepting all). But even all of that out of the way, there's having to figure out and filtering out the UI. I'm trying to read some article on turtles or whatever. Here's an article on lizards! Or maybe read about cool new gadget next! Look at this awesome video! Even if it's cool stuff that I'm interested about (and not some rage bait), I just wanted to read about turtles! But now I can't really read and properly engage with this one article, because my time is limited and there's so much other stuff to look at. My little monkey brain wasn't built for this. Oh, there's an article on brain science, too! And look, an update from Punchi-kun!\n\n\nThe endless scroll of short term media is just this kind of stuff driven to the extreme. \n\n\nBut I'd argue it has infiltrated our lives to an even greater extent. Go sit down in a temperate climate forest and observe what's going on. Lots of stuff moving. Lots of animal noises. But in terms of categories, there isn't a whole lot going on. It's the same colours, the same kind of movement, the same kind of noise. Maybe some bird makes a distinctive call, or a lemon yellow butterfly flutters by. Heck, maybe some squirrels get into a fight. Exciting moments, but temporary and few in-between (I'm deliberately avoiding a peek at the insect layer). Now compare that to a walk to the grocery store. Holy shit. Too much. How about just sitting in your comfy chair at home. My little apartment is full of colour, my book shelf alone has a ridiculous variety! And there's signs of attention grabbing design language everywhere. ",

Can anyone better contextualize the results for us?\n\nEdit: Upon re-reading, it seems one of the most significant results (p < 0.001) are in reaction time, surprisingly. A similar result was noted in the activity between the parts of the frontal lobe associated with attention span and the rest of the brain, but this result doesn't seem to carry through to many of the other attention-related measures. The strongest results the study notes were measured through a questionnaire the participants took, so take that as you will.\n\nThe lack of behavioral difference I was originally asking about seems to be specifically in hyperactive behavior. So people seem to have a shorter attention span for tasks after consuming short-form content, but hyperactive tendencies don't seem to increase.\n\n[This more recent study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230358/) seems to have similar results.\n\n**Edit 2:** Just to clarify, the results DO show a shorter attention span, but it's a very small sample size and very specific areas that participants showed a difference from baseline.",

There’s a lot of crap you have to swipe through. At one point I was on facetime with my mom and she was telling a rather long winded story and I swiped up on the screen like it was a TikTok I could skip. Again, it’s anecdotal, but I think it’s more than just the videos being short, it’s that your brain gets used to skipping through a lot of stuff until something interesting catches your focus. Combine that with the ads and grifters using loud sounds or “captivating” voices and it’s all quite numbing. I could be wrong but I imagine it’s a similar effect to how police horses are trained to be less reactive in courses with fire and loud noises. \n\nYT still has an algorithm of course but you can pick what you’re watching before ever watching it.

I had this problem briefly with Vine several years ago, but with Shorts it's, so, so much worse as I'm in YouTube on a daily basis and the thumbnails are always tuned so well to get me to click on them. I've lost so many hours of sleep late at night, mindlessly scrolling looking for the next hit of novelty dopamine.\n\nBlocking Shorts on my computer browser was easy. uBlock with a filter and then later a discrete browser extension in Firefox. I had to go so far as installing Revanced in order to strip out Shorts on Android.\n\nIn a previous age, subjecting a viewer to rapidly switching short snippets of emotionally charged video in quick succession that they weren't able to look away from was considered literal fucking torture and brainwashing. It was like waterboarding a person's brain. The scene from A Clockwork Orange comes to mind, though it became a trope very quickly. Nowadays, we literally do it to ourselves. It's fucking terrifying out here.",

          "text": "\\- A peer‑reviewed study (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024) found that heavy consumption of short‑form videos—think YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels and TikTok—was linked to shorter attention spans and weaker executive control. Participants who spent more time scrolling scored lower on focus and self‑control and showed less activity in the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\\- The researchers concluded that constantly watching 15‑second clips trains your brain to crave quick hits of stimulation and makes it harder to concentrate on longer tasks.\n\n\\- A 2025 study from the American Psychological Association echoed these findings, warning that compulsive short‑form video use can impair impulse control and increase emotional reactivity.\n\n\\- It doesn’t mean everyone who uses Shorts/Reels is \"getting dumber,\" but the evidence suggests hours of endless scrolling may harm your ability to focus and self‑regulate.\n\n\\- If you want to balance things out, consider mixing in some long‑form reading—or use an app like Just Summarize to get the gist of longer articles quickly.

Not the least of which, that faceless corporations get a fucking cut of the ticket revenue generation. Fuck if with that\n",

Trump says he is for the working class, yet his tariff policy hurts jobs, slows the economy, and is inflationary. Trump says he is a president of peace yet is illegally murdering people in the Caribbean, invaded another country to kidnap their president, bombed Iran, and has now ordering a carrier strike group in range of Iran. Trump says his private police force is only going after the “worst of the worst” yet his own DHS numbers show less than 14% of detainees have a criminal conviction or record. \n\nWe also need to look at what politicians fund. When Americans need to lose healthcare but we can inflate the DHS budget to $190.6B. To be clear our government is funding an INTERNAL police force more than most nations fund their militaries and there are only 330 million of us. In 2024 we spent $428.7B on policing our 330 million people and China spent $258.4B on policing their 1.4 billion people. \n\nFeeling free yet?",

The average company and person cannot afford to take the federal government to the Supreme Court - there’s just no financial resources that can make up the trillions behind the feds.\n\nThat’s the real issue. It doesn’t matter if something is legal or illegal. To prove it’s illegal means investing millions of dollars against billions of dollars invested in putting you down.\n\nSo while I’m sure money given by the defense department made things better, there were only two choices: exist as a company or cease to exist.",

          "text": "I'm curious to see what useful AI features Firefox can come up with.  Some interesting uses of AI in a browser might be buttons to:\n\n- tell me if this web page looks like a scam (e.g. romance scam, arrest scam) or attack (e.g. phishing, has link to malware) or is asking for PII or inappropriate info (pics).  Maybe particulary valuable for children and the elderly.\n\n- find other articles like the one in this page, either agreeing or disagreeing or giving more info about same subject\n\n- find where the subject of this article is treated in sources I mostly trust, such as Wikipedia or Arch Wiki or manufacturer's web site or something\n\n- find where the subject of this article is being discussed, on the social networks I belong to\n\n- sanity-check this article: do the citations exist and the links work, are the quotes accurate, does it fairly represent the sources it cites or links to ?\n\n- in all my open tabs and my browsing history for the last 7 days, where is the page that more-or-less said X about subject Y ?\n\n- add a link to this page, and a 1-paragraph summary of it, to my: notes app, bookmark app, web site, new post on social media, or email to my friends\n\n- do the recommendations in this article apply to anything in my: computer, network, work, school, finances, life ?\n\n- right-click and: find more images \"similar\" to this one\n\n- why won't this page load ?  When you get to a certain critical mass of privacy and security measures, it gets hard to figure out what a site is objecting to.  VPN ?  DNS-blocker in VPN ?  Firefox ?  Tracker-blocker in FF settings ?  Ad-blocker ?  Linux ?  Location disabled ?  WebRTC disabled ?  Canvas disabled ?  Fact that I reside in Spain ?  Bad cookie ?\n\nYes, most or all of these can be done some other, less convenient way. Copying URL(s), opening a new tab to an LLM, pasting URL(s), writing a prompt. But having buttons for them right in the browser, and pre-written prompts, reduces friction and increases context.  Especially important for normal people doing something such as \"is this a a scam ?\".\n\nYes, today's LLMs can't do all of this accurately and reliably enough, and there are issues of privacy, resources, etc.  But AI will improve.\n\nIf the features don't work, or I don't like how they're done, I'll turn them off.",

Online age verification is only currently required by a select few countries. \"But with all the regulations it's going to be commonplace worldwide and this them getting ready for it\". SO? You don't work for them. Who cares what may or may not happen in 50 years. Rights MAYBE being stripped in the future doesn't mean we should act like they don't exist now. People's privacy isn't nothing. Data breaches (and poor data security) are a constant. \n\n\nIf they were a restaurant, this is them saying no, they're not going to stop spitting in everyones food. A few countries told them they have to, so whoops its out of their hands, they're going to go ahead and give everyone spitburgers from now on because it's easier for them. They pinky promise they care about you tho and theyll tell you first when it happens, but it's definitely happening, and the kitchen is drinking water and getting spitwads ready.\n\n\nSorry not sorry for the rant\n\n",

At the moment, I have friends that are probably fairly resistant to creating another account for some other space, just to game with *me*. I’ve already seen “blocked content” redactions as a North American user. I get that you have to comply with laws of certain regions — but to use that as a launchpad to demand this *data* (we all know that’s what this is about) from ALL of us is fucking ridiculous. Full stop. It’s just lies on top of lies.\n\nIf my server starts getting blocked for content as heavily as YouTube makes you sign in just to see a video game trailer?? I’ll shut it down and just jump in other people’s servers for comms…\n\nBut you will **never** get another cent out of me for nitro, or whatever nitro may evolve into, etc etc. Good luck with your next round of funding or whatever.",

We're 15+ (I know discord is 13+, but the nature of the material the fandom is based on can be a bit heavy) and strictly enforce keeping adult content in the one age-restricted channel, which you need a specific role to access, which you need to speak directly to mods to get. But because it's a restricted channel in an otherwise open server, age verification, especially if they ask the server owner or any of the mods for faces or IDs, could create all kinds of problems; how do we moderate it if we can't access it? How do we keep the server open if that channel existing at all means a few of our users can't be there anymore?\n\nIt's a channel where, for the most part, people make jokes or occasionally post fanart with risqué outfits that we don't want in the rest of the server. Outright pictures and videos of real people's bodies have been banned from day one, and no one has ever tried to post them. It's harmless, but it makes it easier to keep the conversations in the rest of the server cleaner so that minors and adults who don't want to be a part of conversations about that are able to be safer and more comfortable there (we do have adults who, for religious reasons, do not want to hear cursing if they can avoid it, let alone jokes about sex, so it's not just minors who benefit). \n\nWe haven't had any issues with minor safety on the server; the one person who said something odd to a minor was banned and stricter rules about conduct and reporting were quickly introduced, but frankly, it's not a fandom that's popular among kids. For those that are there, we made a list of red flags to tell mods about, just in case.\n\nBut you know what we have had? A teenager with parents who do not seem to care about their safety at all, who has mentioned things at home that everyone present immediately flagged as abuse and medical neglect. So several of the adults in the server came together and explained to this kid how to recognize abuse and which types of trusted adults in their life are good to speak to about what they'd described (we listed mandatory reporters, like guidance counselors, school band directors, and teachers). \n\nThis same kid later asked us if they should trust their gut and block an adult man from a different server who had appeared innocent and genuinely friendly, but was asking for a picture of their face; it turned out this kid had never heard of ASL and why an adult should NEVER be asking for that information, or for a picture of them, no matter how innocent, so we gave them advice on some boundaries to set and they blocked him. We helped them learn how to spot grooming, because it turns out, a lot of teenagers know that grooming is dangerous, but don't know how to actually spot it. While we were all explaining these things, one of the very few other minors in the server hopped in and began asking questions as well, so they learned things, too. That conversation informed the guidelines for alerting mods.\n\nWould i prefer it if this kid (and any others in the server) were learning about this from trained professionals in their classrooms instead? Absolutely. It shouldn't be our job. There's a lot that untrained but well-meaning people will miss, and learning about internet safety from strangers on the internet is not ideal. Most of us were giving advice based on things we'd personally seen or experienced as minors, and I'm sure someone with actual training would do a better job. Would I personally make a server that allows minors right now? Personally, no, because that can be a moderation headache, but at the same time, the Internet is running out of safe communities for teens and it wouldn't be right for us to kick out the ones who are already there. \n\nAs things stand, this is a teenager whose parents are outright neglectful on the best of days, and having access to this community meant they were able to, at the very least, avoid a likely predator, learn a few basic things to protect themselves in the future, and get advice about which adults in their life they can talk to who may be able to help in more concrete ways than strangers online who probably shouldn't know details. And if this server didn't have the ability to have a separate, age-restricted, role-restricted channel for adult discussion, it would most likely not have allowed minors to participate in the rest of the community in the first place.\n\nI'm all for protecting kids, but ffs, the way to do that is widespread education and giving them more spaces that are geared towards minors, not adults. Those spaces can be more heavily monitored (Roblox is doing a terrible job from what I hear), while adult spaces can let adults be adults. Data privacy violations are not the solution; all those violations do is drive people away and create massive breaches of trust, or worse, data breaches like the one Discord recently experienced. \n\nThe most crucial step towards making minors safer online is EDUCATION. If we're going to have ads everywhere, we should be putting out PSAs that give kids basic tips about what not to share and red flags to watch for. We should be investing in education and making it mandatory that schools take the time to have someone with training come in and explain to kids what grooming actually looks like and why they shouldn't tell adults what city/state/potentially country they live in or post public pictures of their faces as minors. Kids will actively seek ways around age verification because that's what they do. Giving them the tools to protect themselves is much more effective and doesn't come with data privacy breach risks.",

Market capture and lock in has replaced that whole value prop competition thing that is supposedly a benefit of living in a capitalist society.. \n\nSam Altman’s playbook is very simple.. to keep the media/hype train chugging along and to basically aggressively wash his hands of responsibility except to sit around and wait for someone to build the tech his company needs to stop bleeding billions.

Like to me, the most unbelievable idea is that a Chinese official would be using ChatGPT of all things as their AI tool of choice in the first place. China has their own, and arguably better AI models that I feel they would be much more likely to be using. \n\nLike this whole thing reads like an article trying to manufacture consent about US government involvement in both AI and involvement in China because of some supposed 'global intimidation operation'. Plus the concept of this official using it like some journal of 'dear diary, today we did some intimidation of x y z, here's all the details' is just an insane level of incompetence. Not to mention how for cybersec confidentiality purposes, it would be a gross display of incompetence to store data about sensitive intelligence operations with a foreign-controlled entity that could, for example, leak all your records to CNN \n\nLike, incompetence does happen, and foreign influence operations do happen, but why tf would I take CNN's word on anything related to China?

It doesn't make sense.\n\nThe moment they stop buying, their cloud sub + thin client pricing has to compete with hardware prices 3x cheaper than what they paid for the same stuff. In fact, it actually has to compete with hardware prices no matter what. Otherwise people will just start to outbid them on hardware to avoid paying 10x the price over a yearly cloud subscription. They are literally competing with themselves.\n\nI have no idea why this is such a popular theory. So many people just use phones and tablets these days anyway. If not that, then laptops. Portable devices make terrible thin clients.\n\nIt might make sense as a play right now, but I have serious doubts about the long term viability of this. Especially if the plan is to literally burn money to make the pricing make sense.\n\nIn no way is this the \"end game\", the personal computer industry isn't worth what they are pricing this all out to be worth.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYes I know the hardware is going to AI. I'm saying this secondary mastermind plot of cloud computing is not viable. Especially if AI does not pan out.",

Got a spare PSU. GPU isn't new but isn't old (couple of yrs). Hoping the CPU doesn't go, or at least that it dies before CPU prices rocket like SSD / RAM.",

While we thought we became more enlightened and considerate of our fellow citizens, we in reality just ignored the problems which is the deeply fascist conservative wing of the government never went away, just masked their language and pretended to care. Trump just finally brought it all out in the open… Republicans aren’t our fellow allies, but are fascist enemies who would enjoy nothing more to bring us right back to those awful pre-civil rights days. \n\nIt’s not surprising that the very groups that are supporting the current Republican policies like the Heritage Foundation and the judges who are part of the  Federalist Society literally started RIGHT after integration, Roe V Wade and the civil rights movement had rulings favorable to them. They literally started to conspire with the rich to rid the US of all the progress that had been made and bring us right back to the early 1900’s. And they succeeded because progressive and liberal citizens became complacent and forgot that sometimes you need to spill a lot of blood proverbially and in reality to keep those rights that you were granted. \n",

Short of Trump declaring total war on his own country, Democrats regaining power is a certainty, and it's possible one of their first orders of business will be a massive Nuremberg-style trial for all the crimes committed against the American people by the Trump administration.\n\nBack in the 1940s, plenty of businesspeople got put on trial alongside the Nazis. So I'd imagine more savvy present-day CEOs know what's going to happen and are just riding out the current storm. If they're optimistic about our future, maybe we should be too.",

Here's hoping they don't fuck up their ethical stand - the rarity of someone behaving ethically or empathetically is not just absurdly rare - it's actively punished by the powers that be.\n\nSo it's fascinating to see it's outright that they appear to have told them thanks but no thanks. From the perspective of investors it's shocking and I would argue something we should aim to support.\n\nThe counterpoint of course just looks a bit shabbier, Musk's ever more shrill support of fascism and Trump is nothing anyone can trust or even use, over time. The overlap between ideologically \"pure\" thinking over in Trump/Musk land isn't awesome over long distance but Fox News will no doubt bum the mic like the fascists they are and increasingly trash anyone who might think it's acceptable to stand up.\n\nI'll be fascinated to see how this goes.\n\nAnd while it's frankly amazing, I'd be happy to see how long it endures and perhaps audaciously consider that they might really succeed. \n\nFor now I'm down with celebrating the guys at Anthropic as a candle in the dark here.",

We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner.\n\n>\n\n>However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do. Two such use cases have never been included in our contracts with the Department of War, and we believe they should not be included now:\n\n>\n\n>**Mass domestic surveillance.**  \nWe support the use of AI for lawful foreign intelligence and counterintelligence missions. But using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties. To the extent that such surveillance is currently legal, this is only because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed records of Americans’ movements, web browsing, and associations from public sources without obtaining a warrant, a practice the Intelligence Community has acknowledged raises privacy concerns and that has generated bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale.  \n\n\n>**Fully autonomous weapons.**  \nPartially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even fully autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk. We have offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer. In addition, without proper oversight, fully autonomous weapons cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.\n\n>\n\n>To our knowledge, these two exceptions have not been a barrier to accelerating the adoption and use of our models within our armed forces to date.\n\n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war)",
