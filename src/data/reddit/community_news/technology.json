                  "text": "Yep. Freezing your credit is free BY LAW. And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

Like people of color, migrants from poorer countries or more progressive ones, their political opposition in terms of voters or politicians, LGBTQ+ folks, the differently abled and folks with reported/documented mental illness, the chronically unhoused population (rent only keeps going up with everything else)d anyone who dares to speak out or fight back against what is ahead. They programmed the masses to accept terrorists meaning someone who can be lawfully killed, tortured/abused, and/or detained indefinitely even without due process despite that concept going back to medieval times with the magna csrta. Now they expanded the definition of terrorism to include whomever they want with the new official loose definitions they changed with an executive order, now anyone especially from the previously mentioned groups are targets for being labeled as domestic terrorists and they have already started testing the water on that with no serious push back from the masses or even politically.\n\n*They are building more camps in every state than they are \"illegal immigrants\" (remember when it was just supposed to be the 'dangerous ones' but now they openly just embrace all migrants regardless of paperwork/status)*\n\n***the Nazis didn't campaign on the final solution or concentration camps, they ran on deportations and de-naturalization of \"non-germans\" following the same rhetoric as the admin currently is rehashing***\n\nRegular folks didn't learn from history, the system intentionally aided from that and folks are and have been to pacified by their work and treats to concern themselves with this progressively more obvious blatent descent descent into what will eventually involve a final solution like it did with the Weimar Republic, there are building massive crematoriums for a reason, the global West in terms of regular folks might not have learned their lessons but the fascists did and this time there won't be all the bodies left over as evidence when they try to erase history.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it frequently rhymes.",

There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI.

Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware.

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

Even if the AI can respond to someone it’s not the same as a person acting with intent and considering decisions. \n\nWe tried to use auto scheduling, literally the easiest task you’d think. But that light touch from a human stopped major issues from happening that could ruin the schedule for the day. It would have gotten rid of one or two people for my region but delayed our work easily losing that employees pay in lost prod. It was inflexible, slow and could not react in realtime to changing demands. So it was shelved. This is the AI failure in a nutshell.",

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term.

During Reagan's presidential runs in 1980 and 1984 they basically shut down broadcasting of his movies, but they were also strict on liberal presenting media around this time. However, over time several exceptions were made, one being that talk shows can be exempted on a case by case basis. In practice, over the years talk show interviews became pretty much exempted by default. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George Bush, Guiliani, Bernie, Harris, Desantis, Ramaswamy, Haley etc etc have all been on talk shows during campaigns. However, the 'case by case basis' nature of the exemption is a huge flaw and now being weaponized by this administration.",

But there is another formation very similar to monopolies called oligopolies. An oligopoly is a \"small number of players in a market\" instead of a **mono**poly, which is just one player.\n\nHow we know if a market is an oligopoly or a healthy competitive market is based on how much power each individual player has. If a single player can completely warp a market, then the market is not a healthy competition, and it requires more players.\n\nBillionaires have so much power, enough to buy entire industries, just to shut them down if they feel like it. Their power is so disproportionate compared to the average Joe. We would never accept this in a healthy business market. But it's totally normal (for a lot of people) on a citizen level.\n\nAlmost all of our modern problems is due to the fact billionaires are treating countries like their playgrounds. Tax them until they're no longer billionaires would fix a fuckload of our problems, while also allowing our government to y'know, do things again. I'd much rather a government handle these things than billionaires for the simple fact, if a billionaire is evil, you can't do shit. If a government is evil, you can vote them out.\n\nIf a politician isn't talking about taxing billionaires, they're trying to \"go along to get along.\" When ANYONE can see how fucked up they are making the world.",

He stole the presidency. Exactly like he tried to do in 2020, just this time with the already compromised tabulator machines tuned more aggressively to guarantee it.\n\nDo not take my word for it, here's the actual data (and even though this video is now several months old and there is much more they've found, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as you might expect with criminals). Please see for yourself and if you trust the data (not simply conspiracy theory talk) share with anyone who still thinks \"America got it wrong\" or we need to get out and vote more.  We did, and Kamala would have won, decisively, had our votes actually been counted correctly. It's the compromised, privately owned tabulators (vote counting machines) that turned votes for Kamala into votes for Trump in all the swing states, after a certain threshold of votes were counted on each machine. These folks and other independent teams of analysts like them, are doing us a great service:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ru8SHK7idxs?feature=shared\nelectiontruthalliance.org\n\nAnd we've been on that road for a very long time which, unfortunately, is not surprising. This journalist research article, written just before Obama's 2nd term, dives into the long history of election fraud in the US and how, especially in the digital tabulation age, it has been setup to get us to the point where whomever has control of them can literally steal an election:\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/\n\nSo, whenever Maga or Republicans say they want to investigate Election Fraud (\"by the Dems\"), it's to accuse and look in the right, yet as we know, and as the data evidence demonstrates, their accusation is yet again projection.",

Sorry, not sorry, but if you're still relying heavily on ABC, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, etc. you are playing into their hands. Every single one of those is owned by someone who has the exact same class interests as Donald Trump, and as such, will not meaningfully challenge him at the cost of their own position in society. When push comes to shove, they *will* align themselves with him. There is no reason for a billionaire to own a news empire or a social media network that isn't to sanitize their own reputations, and to curry favor for themselves among the centers of power in the world. \n\nIf we REALLY want to deal them a blow, then we need to take our views to non-profit and ideally (because non-profits rely on donos which can be and almost always are from powerful, wealthy individuals who expect a return on that investment) journalist-owned media. The Associated Press is arguably the best \"major\" network, as it is not \"owned\" by any one group - but the controlling members are the major networks who ARE owned and controlled by billionaires. Better sources of news would be, like, 404 Media (tech), Aftermath (gaming), Drop Site News (politics), Hell Gate (New York news), ProPublica, etc. Where we can, we should be giving these sites your membership fees, views, clicks, web hits, etc. These are good journalists, usually a diaspora from some old mainstay website's \"restructuring\". They're not just randos who threw together a website, but real, dogged journalists with real work behind them and they can do BETTER work when they've got food in their bellies, a healthcare plan, a safe and secure place to live, etc. For we who have SOME means, that means it's up to us to not just use these sites, but kick over a little monthly dono as well.\n\nAs long as we depend and expect these news sources owned by people who are actively working against us, to work FOR us, we can continue to expect disappointment. They own these outlets and these platforms for a reason, and that reason is *specifically* to undermine our power and to divide us. Also, like, I know I mentioned the traditionally \"liberal\" news outlets and declined to mention Fox, Newsmax, OANN, but that's because... like, I expect conservatives a.) not to care and b.) generally to be willingly obsequious serfs on the modern digital feifs. They don't care that billionaires own these, because they're deliberate simps to power. I expect liberals, in theory, aren't.",

If I want to use AliExpress, I'll use AliExpress. If Amazon slaughtered 95% of the listings on the site it would be far more usable. I'm willing to spend ever so slightly more money on legitimate and durable products. If they just curated their own storefront then I'd buy way more stuff.",

The tonal shift in the company from Bezos (still a dickhead) to Jassy was so noticeable: fear of layoffs, anti-employee RTO and comp policies, tracking badge swipes and time in office. The guy has no creativity other than to 'drive efficiency' after he made specific decisions that made the company inefficient to begin with (bureaucracy, over hiring, etc.).\n\nThe guy has got to go. I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years. People compare him to Ballmer, and I'm starting to really believe this is the current era this company is in.",

Discord has a huge number of customers having more or less cornered the VOIP market for gaming related activities, notice how discord already links to various game accounts, and to twitch, and it has always had overlays showing what game you're currently playing, which means it is collecting all that Data, and that Data is valuable.\n\nDiscord wants to look as valuable as possible so they can make a lot of money selling the company piece by tiny piece, and they've already been forced to implement ID verification in several countries, so they have the perfect excuse, they say they won't sell your data, but that's not a contract just a promise with no garauntee other than their word, and if someone else like microsoft for instance decided to quietly purchase a controlling share, well they never even promised not to sell your data.\n\nThis is just a combination of greed and stupidity, Discord picked a singularly bad moment to try this shit given what's going on in the world given wider political and consumer confidence issues which make the public much less trusting, but in a calmer moment in history this wouldn't have blown up nearly as much.",

People boo the heel as he suplexes the good out of the product or platform. Once he's made all the changes the board wants, they can come in and fire the heel, and people cheer!\n\nBut the changes never do quite seem to fully revert, do they?

And there's no reason at all to use any of those as forum replacements.  Hell, even reddit would make a better curated forum platform than discord.  The only thing even slightly unique about Discord is the way it broke things out into searchable channels and topics.  \n  \nDiscord only really exists because it got momentum and maybe even a bit of brand loyalty from a group of people who have never really had to migrate between internet services before, so the whole thing just comes off as a bit amusing to people from the ICQ/AIM/mIRC era.",

Discord has settled on Nitro features, but the problem is that the base product is so good that a lot of folks will not have much need for those extended features, which means Discord will have to enshittify or find some killer use case to get people to pay, which I haven't really seen yet.\n\nIt's not the issue in this case, though-- this is a decision that results from the idiotic British age verification rules, that Discord has inexplicably decided needs to roll out across the globe. For most of the world, privacy-abusing and pointless face verification isn't required by law, and a lot of people will not put up with it-- the question is how many people won't put up with it and whether it's justly fatal to the company.

The fact is that you see lots of these \"People are outraged about Discord's age verification process!\" posts on multiple different subreddits. I ask you though, how many threads do you see on those posts about people discussing alternatives to Discord that they should switch to? My experience is that very few people are actually talking about where they are going to migrate to, which signals to me that most people are here to be outraged and not do anything about it. If people actually cared, these posts would have tons of people discussing where to migrate their social circles to.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dinosaur that remembers the days of having TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and Skype all installed to play with different friend groups. Discord has been awfully convenient for consolidating the different gamer groups, but for me, the time has come to move on and return to the days of having multiple platforms installed to keep in touch. Be the change you want to see in the world and stop waiting for everyone else to move first right?",

The very next short is a video explaining how to disable the LED without the glasses blocking your ability to record...\n\n\nEdit: scrolling through YouTube meta glasses videos about half are about disabling the LED. In the comments is a mix of people trying to talk shit about people not wanting to be secretly record, truly ignorant people who dont get why its a bad thing but are worried to damage the expensive glasses and very obvious perverts who are excited about the info. \n\n\nEdit2: after searching YouTube just for \"meta glasses\" the algorithm is now even serving up \"how to disable the LED\" videos on my YouTube front page.

People driving predictably so traffic flows, people moving over to let you walk past, someone holds the door for you politely. \n\nYet you generally don't remember that, you will remember the *one* driver that didn't move over to let you merge, the one walker that stopped and blocked your path, or the one person that didn't hold the door. \n\nThe news media gets more interaction out of negative and, doom and gloom, and ragebaiting than they do out of happiness and rainbows reporting. They do need to report **some** good things, otherwise if it's all negative thing their viewers will get burned out and not bother to view anymore, but the negative reporting is still the biggest main draw.",

Kuhl took a moment to issue a stark warning to anyone wearing AI glasses in the courtroom: stop recording with them and delete the footage, or face contempt.\n\nMany courts generally forbid recording during trials, though there are exceptions. However, while the judge did seem to be worried about recording in general, she also had another concern: the privacy of the jury.\n\n“If your glasses are recording, you must take them off,” the judge said, per the *Los Angeles Times*. “It is the order of this court that there must be no facial recognition of the jury. If you have done that, you must delete it. This is very serious.”\n\nCurrently, Meta’s AI glasses do not include the ability to identify the names of the people a wearer views through them, but that’s not likely what the judge meant in her concerns about “facial recognition.”\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91495248/meta-ai-glasses-court-judge-threatens-wearers-contempt-mark-zuckerberg-testimony)",

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

It was explained in a way that basically suggested that the auto pilot computer is in “seeing” anything… It’s literally just using the cameras to compare the image to its training data.\n\nI have no idea if this is true, but if it is, it’s very concerning.",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

And they can afford these failures because they'll still have money left over even if some of them fail.\n\nTo add to that, they have networks of rich friends and family who do the same thing, so if they start a new business, they've got some investors available to instantly give them capital to get it started. So an idea tried on a whim — such as an online book store that could potentially expand to other products — can have instant success over the competition just because a bunch of rich buddies poured money into it and kept it running even when it wasn't turning a profit.\n\nSo there's no genius involved in wealth, nor anything clever at all.

The algorithm he created is horrible, he can be bought for political means, he has turned the app into literal trash compared to what it was. I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved. It has no originality no design and no practicality anymore, it's a mess.",

There is always pressure from management to cut corners on security for one reason or another. They tell us that they want to focus on security and have an absolutely secure product. And then some crazy requirement comes in that I say, \"absolutely not,\" and suddenly management is looking for any loophole to get out of what they told me about having iron-clad security.\n\nAt the old company I worked for, management told us about a requirement where we should be able to show the user their password if they asked. I basically had to throw a tantrum to get them to change their minds on it, and even then they didn't understand what was wrong with it. \n\nOh, no the best one at that company was they wanted to have show a QR code on the screen that contained the user's credentials, so if they scanned it on their phone, they would automatically be logged in.",

                  "text": "Nearly every service in existence that has persistent chat history stores your messages you send in plain text. There are very few that instead store encrypted messages. Those that do are typically using E2EE. And the reason most services don't use E2EE is because it's incredibly inconvenient.\n\nUsers typically want to be able to do useful things like search through their past messages, which is something you cannot do if the messages are stored encrypted unless you load all of the messages onto your device to decrypt them before performing the search, which becomes a massive drain on both client and server resources as chat histories grow larger. Additionally, if the keys are lost, then depending on the implementation, you could end up losing access to the entirety of your message history. These are generally considered problematic by the majority of end users.\n\nE2EE sacrifices convenience for enhanced privacy and security. If you need that enhanced privacy and security, then you'll usually be happy with the trade-off of losing convenience, but most users don't need the enhanced privacy and security and would much rather have convenient functionality. Thus messages tend to be stored in plain text so as to facilitate that functionality (developer laziness notwithstanding).\n\nPasswords are a different matter entirely. Any service not run by an imbecile will neither store them encrypted nor store them in plain text, they're stored hashed. And this is fine because you don't need to know what the password is, you just need to know if the password someone gives you is the correct one, so scrambling the password in the exact same way and comparing the scrambled results is sufficient. Anyone storing passwords in plain text in 2026 needs to be executed.",

You’re just moving the same problems to a new service.\n\nStaut looks strong but it’s missing screen sharing and that’s a feature too many people utilize and undoubtedly, people are just going to go back to Discord when they want to screen share and can’t anymore. Because all the righteousness only works for the moment but if people experience inconvenience or feel they could do things on Discord they can’t do on Staut, then they are just going to go back to Discord when the fire fizzles out.\n\nFluxer is the closest thing to a feature complete transition from Discord and I think that’s the route we should go. It has stability issues for the moment and the dev is working to refactor their code but it’s open source in all the right ways, the dev is very responsive to requests from users and he recently just changed their Contributor License Agreement to be more open source friendly. It’s also based out of Sweden and adheres to GDPR and allows you to self host. It’s the culmination of all the best aspects of Discord without any of the bullshit. It’s only problem right now is it’s not quite ready for the big stage and needs more time in the oven but it’s blatantly the closest thing you’re going to get to an open source Discord and that’s really what you need if you want people to leave Discord and stay off Discord. \n\nIt’s not dissimilar to Signals success. It was enough likes What’sApp and had most of the features people actually used from WhatsApp so the transition was easy. If we are going to pick alternatives to Discord then Fluxer is probably the most analogous.\n\nFor the mainstream, you only really get one shot at migrating users to a new platform. If the alternative sucks or doesn’t have the features people use daily, then undoubtedly people are going to roll back over to Discord over time. Further, if it takes too long and you let this moment pass where people are up in arms and they slowly come to accept the reality, then the moment will be lost and most people you know will stay on Discord and that’s how Discord will get away with all of this. It’s like the Reddit API stuff all over again. People just got used to the new rules and moved on to being angry about something else. If the transition to a new platform is inconvenient, not feature complete and gives people a reason to stay on the old platform, then humans being creatures of comfort and convenience will learn to deal and stay on Discord. That’s just reality.",

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

Some people can't hear distortion or artifacts, but most professional mixing engineers are not full of shit and can absolutely tell when a master has been over compressed or destroyed by multiple different things. \n\nCables, amps, and playback hardware is MUCH less important than whatever happened to audio up to that point. Recording equipment, audio file formats etc are much more important than your phone's DA converter. As long as you don't have random RC circuits or *very* poor impedance matching along your signal chain, it's hard to tell small changes.\n\nThe difference between the lossy compression formats at highest quality settings and lossless formats is negligible perceptually, though very significant for other reasons (actual loss of information, changes to some transients etc).\n\nMost audiophiles have a very superficial understanding of audio technologies, AD/DA technology and why some things matter and others don't. They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable.

It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

The power cable affects nothing, yet audiophiles will spend 150x more for a power cable claiming to prevent audio interruptions that don’t exist. In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it. Yet audiophiles are claiming that the conductor used between the two changes the sound, and this study shows that to be a lie.",

All the effort went into ensuring good connections, wire was sufficient gauge, and amps had enough continuous and peak power.   Most of the money was spent on the microphones used (a phased array) for testing.\n\n\nAll that said, audio \"quality\" is a subjective measure, just like food flavor, IMHO.  Our perception is modified by so much. \n\n\nMy favorite \"personal\" experiment was blind testing CD vs 320kbps mp3s where I had my son randomly choose one version and then the other version of songs while I listened.  I went 9 for 10 in identifying them.\n\n\nNext, I did the same but didn't A/B the same songs and instead did it fully random.   I guessed right on 11 of 20.\n\n\nNone of that is scientifically valid, but it highlights advice I give when people ask me, which is that if it sounds good to you,  it is good!",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

Someone on business tv said, that a known community bank gets 1000+ applications for some back office jobs that net 60k. The demand for (lower) middle class life outstrips the real job market 1:10 already. Organisations like [lisep.org](http://lisep.org) track this for ages, they call it \"underemployment\", that means you have the smart people but they are \"not needed\", so people give up, live in the basement or deliver food with their run of the mill MBA degree.

Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily.

When students retain the basic information conveyed during lectures, they are able to moved more quickly onto the application, analysis, evaluation of the content and later creation of media and concepts using that content. \n\nThis is evident in elementary students up to post graduates. I even saw the difference in my education myself. During undergrad, I used a laptop and took notes on that in the classes that allowed but moved on to regular notebook paper by junior and senior year, choosing to transfer the notes from my handwritten notebooks to typed files simply to maintain the information in a better to read format later. The handwriting made it much easier to gather the information and the subsequent transferring to digital documents further cemented the knowledge so that I barely had to study before tests. \n\nHowever, during grad school, about 8 years later, I didn’t want to get a laptop so my partner had bought me an iPad Pro second hand. I had iPads in the past and never used them, but the iPad Pros had just introduced the Apple Pencils which completely revolutionized the iPad for me. I took all my notes on the notability app (I believe). I was quickly able to switch between pen and marker colors and really define how I was organizing my notes as I took them. I didn’t feel the need to rewrite them in a digital document because it had the ability to convert what I wrote. I should also note that most of my courses in grad school were music theory and high level analysis, so it wouldn’t have been a help to retype these things. \n\nBut I retained that information and was able to review it so much better than I ever had been able to with typed notes. I’m not saying this is an absolute fact of learning, but studies support my claim. \n\nAnd when I was teaching, students would complain about their struggles to learn concepts. I would ask to see their notes. I was so surprised to learn that they did absolutely everything on their Chromebooks - and the kicker was that most of the teachers simply gave them their lecture outlines instead of making them notate the content down. By doing that, you aren’t making the students do ANYTHING to obtain the information. It’s like handing them a textbook and asking them to put it under their pillow at night to learn by osmosis. Not to mention the textbooks were all now on the chromebooks.",

While the teachers are busy spending time working with other kids, mine spend 2 hours a day reading. 2 hours of screen time reading. Not reading content the teacher prescribes but reading whatever they want like “graphic novels”, also known as comic books. The school developed AR goals for the kids to justify all the reading but its all bullshit. Its a pacifier thats being justified.\n\nKids spend 6 hours in school. 1 hour lunch/recess. 1 hour special. 2 hours reading. Teachers only teach maybe 2 hours. Bullshit\n\nOn top of that, they go edu tech software that one of my kids read to so that AI can determine how well they read. Seriously!?\n\nTwo years ago. The school district moved the goal posts by changing the grading rubric from 5 levels to 3. Guess what, now the kids on the borderline “meet standards”. \n\n\n\nBut hey, every school board meeting i go to im told look how great the school is doing. Well yes, that will happen when you change how you measure success. \n\nBest part was a few weeks ago when my 11 year old tells me the teacher taught them how to start writing by using chatgpt to help them. \n\nSo I completely agree with the many many articles that are highlighting a very bad situation in elementary education right now. I like the parents mentioned in the article plan to meet with the supe and hand him these fucking ipads and tell him to start doing his job. ",

It requires giving your brain a challenge to overcome. f you remove the challenge, you reduce the opportunity for real learning. But because the computer makes it easier to produce \"work,\" you end up with students creating products and completing assessments in a way that indicates \"knowledge,\" but that mostly shortcuts around the process of actual learning.\n\nGreat for grade books, terrible for humanity.\n\nEdit: By \"one to one\" I mean one computer per child, which was a big movement that took off while I was teaching. It happened super fast, and within a decade or so we're starting see massive pushback because educators, employers, etc. are finally starting to see the results and the results are catastrophic.

In general I've become a tech-luddite who rails against AI, mandatory chromebooks, and constant screen time, but this opt-out approach bugs me too. \n\nChromebooks do have some advantages over pencil & paper - they support differentiated education (via adaptive math programs, for example), offer multimedia opportunities like slideshow creation, and can support remote learning during inclement weather (in the southeast we just had two straight weeks of school closure thanks to the arctic vortex). Of course, none of these examples supports always being on chromebooks for every class all the time, but they have a time and place that blanket opt-outs can't address. \n\nI think we're at a critical point where community pushback can moderate technology use in schools, but I also think opting out at an individual level is on balance a bad approach that can disadvantage/ostracize students working in an existing curriculum and puts a huge burden on already overworked teachers to create completely distinct education models for individual kids. \n\n",

Both tech and curriculum for schools is entirely designed to make money and very, very little to do with actually educating children. \n\nThe research put into most curriculum is minimal and same with the piloting. They don't even properly edit their manuals. If we're paying $2k per grade level, I expect perfection from the company producing the phonics curriculum. \n\nUnqualified people (curriculum directors) purchase curriculum and tech for entire districts. These are bought from companies that have unqualified people, just a customer sales agent, pushing cookie cutter products. These products are often not well researched and developed. They are blatant money grabs and these companies will slap on the latest labels to attract the unqualified curriculum directors. Ex: Science of Reading being put on everything now. If you're an educator and know just a smidge of SOR, you can easily see through the bs. \n\nYSK: if your district has a curriculum director or curriculum coaches (DON'T even get me started on these leeches), you should petition to remove those positions. They are high paying positions and they do not improve student experience or outcomes. They do put additional pressure on teachers by increasing demands and reducing hands-on support. Your tax money is being pissed away and your kids education is getting worse. Your average principal has zero control over this. Go straight to your boards and superintendent.",

Everything is mainly multiple choice (even in high school!) and they let things be auto graded.   Most of the time students can’t even see what they missed since kids in other classes haven’t taken the test.   \n\nThey don’t get the hand written comments in red ink showing why their answer is wrong.\n\nNo more signed progress reports and parent involvement.  They can look if they’re interested but aren’t required to do so.\n\nHell, the online platforms can’t even average grades properly.  Not sure if they do batch processing or what, but  4 100s and 1 80/100 don’t average to 100/100 under any type of sane weighting, even with rounding.\n\n\nIf all of this was to support larger class sizes, it’d be one thing.  But not even that.   My elementary school classes were double the size of what’s allowed today and the teachers did everything by hand — even the gradebook.  But we had actual books,  they actually taught, and we wrote paragraph answers on test questions.   (No, we didn’t use washboards then!)\n\nSchool districts today are more interested in raising the lowest quartile slightly than teaching the upper quartile.

          "text": "***TL;DR:*** *High school daughter has flourished when switching to books and handwritten notes (at a private school) from the typical 1:1 learning when she was in 4th-8th grade.*\n\nDad here of a current 10th grader. My wife and I ended up putting our daughter into private school a few years ago. It wasn't because of the teachers, or the curriculum. It was because classwork, reading, homework, projects, everything was entirely swallowed by tech. Our daughter did not do well with a 1:1 device.\n\nFrom the 4th grade through 8th grade, almost everything was electronically completed. She had teachers that did teach, but it was often taught from some electronic platform, which maybe additional white-board writing for further explanations.\n\nIn general though, things were PDFs or online textbooks or other online platforms where she had to complete her work or readings. She retained so little. Her math? More often than not, it was done on a touch-sensitive Chromebook with a stylus. So if you wanted to try and remember how you did a homework probably from a couple weeks ago? It either didn't exist, or you had to wade through innumerable image files.\n\nAnyway, I could go so much further into it, but everyone here knows how typical 1:1 device and teaching is like.\n\nHere's what we've noticed over the last 1.5 years after enrolling her in a private school that teaches like schools taught 20 years ago. Even when she could focus in her classes, she retained a *lot* less when reading from an online document/book/scanned-image than she does from physical papers and books in her private school now. She also retains sooo much more when she is essentially \"forced\" (out of necessity for capturing the important material and getting a decent grade, not \"physically forced\") to take notes in her own hand, on actual paper, during class versus creating a Google doc or slide deck to \"take notes\" in. She retains a lot more when the important info is coming from a teacher versus when coming from a video. She retains a lot more when math work is expected to be done on physical paper versus on a screen.\n\nBasically, her switching to the non-tech method of learning has done wonders for her retention, interest and ability to connect things. And again, nothing against the teachers. My wife and I really thought they were great overall.\n\nAnyway, at least to people like my daughter (moderate ADHD and typical teen), *every single measurable aspect* of learning and retention improved when she switched to a school that teaches kids using teachers and physical books and papers, and expecting the kids to take notes in their own hand using pen/pencil. It is night and day.\n\nAnd last thing I'll add is that, she was always a very average student. The school she is in now is a very high expectation type of school, which worried my wife and I a lot, wondering if our daughter could handle it. It turns out, she can, and she said a few months ago that she always thought she was bad at math, and never knew she could *actually* be good at it. It nearly brought me to tears.\n\nAt least for a typical kid like my daughter, I honestly believe that the recent way of teaching/learning is **making millions of kids into intellectually** ***less*** **than what they otherwise could have been**. I could say a lot more about all of this, but it's already too long of a post, so I'll stop here.",

          "text": "I know no one will see this comment but something that is a huge problem in schools is getting the paper copies made… someone who I am very close with is a teacher at an elementary school and the children in my opinion shouldn’t be using chrome books so much. But the teachers (at this particular school and district) literally don’t have time to make copies and get all the papers graded. They have 45 minutes of prep before and after school. At least two of those days a week the prep time is taken up by meetings. The school only has one big printer they lease and some of the teachers who were lucky enough to have grants have a printer in their classroom. If u think about it, 30 children. Half hour to 45 minute long lessons. 8 or so lessons a day that’s about 300 pages a day, that’s if they only have one sheet of work to do per lesson. That doesn’t count actually finding the right worksheet for the lessons or in a worse case making the sheet from scratch. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to do everything on paper all day long anymore. With everyone again in this particular school and I know many others being on such different levels of knowledge they can’t realistically be doing the exact same work every day. So that’s even more variation. With the chromebooks they have the work there. And the kids who need help can get it as they need it and the kids who don’t, don’t need to be waiting on everyone else. If there’s some issue with the worksheet for some students the teacher can go and make corrections or change it and tailor it to some students differently then others. Which again wouldn’t really be possible if it was all done on paper.",

          "text": "It comes down to the effort required, both physically and mentally, to write information as compared to typing the same information. It also depends on the purpose of that particular composition; since writing information that you already know in order to communicate it to another person is more focused on the reader's ingestion of that information. This is most communication, and that's why typing it out on a keyboard is ideal - it's faster to make (type) AND easier to read.\n\nTaking notes is a great example of communicating information you DON'T know to yourself. And this self-communication is instant—You're not writing information to a future version of you, either. That would fall into the first category. You are taking notes just to go through the act of writing the information, and the purpose is not to review the notes later (though, that is a bonus).\n\nTLDR: To your brain and muscles, the 'A' key and the 'S' key are almost exactly the same thing (you push a key). However, actually writing the two letters 'A' and 'S' is a very different task, and this added effort solidifies the actual information behind the words into your head. Much more than typing them or reading them.",

If the author of this article were actually paying attention, it's been clear for several days now (so before the February 13th publication of this article) that Canada was going to be purchasing the F-35. Canada has been quietly purchasing spare parts and lower profile items for the F-35 which wouldn't make sense if they were going to cut the contract at 16. \n\n2. Given that Canada has already committed to 16 F-35s, it would cost more for less capability to backfill the rest of the Canadian Air Force equipment with Swedish Gripens. The Gripen and the F-35 are reasonably comparable in purchase price, and while the Gripen maintenance costs are lower, having to maintain two full separate maintenance supply chains and training systems would negate any of that cost advantage. \n\n3. The F-35 is just better. And while it is true that the Gripen is a mature platform, that's also another way of saying that there's not a lot of room for improvement. And the current Gripen is several steps down from the current F-35, while the F-35 has a lot more ceiling to it. \n\nAny technology subreddit, regardless of the politics, would have to understand that the current technology, the future technological ceiling, not to mention the economics regarding ongoing costs and maintenance makes the F-35 the obviously better choice. \n\nSo, of course, Reddit being Reddit, this sub is going to completely ignore that. \n\nAll Canada is doing right now is Kabuki theater to tell everyone that they're angry with the US, while they rack up contractual delay costs just end up buying the planes that they would have bought in the first place. They're just going to spend more money at it, to pay Lockheed Martin some extra delay fees. \n\nYay. Nice to see the Canadian politicians are competent at handling this kind of thing. 🙄",

The cloud either already sells or will soon sell solutions for everything like gaming, office work, corporate projects, data storage, software development, image and video editing, etc.\n\nModern computers are grossly overpowered.  All of our computers sit closer to being turned off than on when they're actively being used.  I have 50 chrome tabs open, a web video stream playing, a game running I'm tabbed out of running in the background, and a video editor open and my cpu usage *sometimes* hits 25%.  You might value a computer build at 2000$, but only spend 30 minutes a day using more than 10% of what it's capable of.  A cloud service provider can use almost all of that processing power, 24 hours a day.  They can sell that same machine as a subscription to 20 or even 50 people each for 20$/month.  At the price you're willing to pay a cloud service provider can have their investments get paid back in months.  Cloud SAAS companies are willing to accept much higher hardware prices because even with those higher costs, they still get paid off practically instantly.",

Security is often addressed reactively, minimized to compliance requirements, or handled after a security incident.\n\nEven when software security engineers are on a team/org, their impact depends heavily on the org's structure. If they are in an advisory role, they are limited in their enforcement, and any improvements may be filtered through their ability or lack of ability to influence. They don't always have direct ownership, and if they aren't good at influencing people, their contributions are diminished or only compliance/policy driven.\n\nThere are good orgs out there; it's just not most orgs. Not even the big ones that make a lot of money.\n\nSo, none of this surprises me. AI Coding LLMs are just a path of least resistance, and if an engineer didn't apply security principles before, they sure as hell won't now. The difference is that now they can mindlessly do it.",

I messed with programming years ago, but if I want to build something for personal use, that's off network, it's useful. \n\nFor professionals it seems like a bad idea. Rolling out messy, inefficient and insecure code to thousands, or millions, of users is just a recipe for disaster. Looking at comparisons, keep in mind I am an electronics/radar technician, by actual programmers between AI code and human written stuff. It seems like the AI code is always massively fat in comparison. It runs worse, and seems to be far less stable.\n\nBut it's fast. Especially if you do no actual QC or bug testing. That seems to be what is happening. AI slop code is just being pushed live because it didn't immediately crash.\n\nYou can't fix, or improve something if you have no idea how it works. I can see the utility in having AI puke out a working base, but are you saving any time by fixing that mess rather than writing it yourself? I'd imagine not. Same issues I run into with my job. We have systems with aggressively poor documentation. If it fails it's a guessing game once you get through the basics. It takes a lot longer to get a system running again when you are making educated guesses on how a black box works.",

Basically, when I write a paper, I have peer reviewers and editors who make suggestions, and I incorporate them into my paper. Now, many people, myself included, use AI to do the same. I think most academics don't have a problem with this. \n\nBut the question is, why can't AI be a co-author? Because it has no autonomy. It can not be held responsible for the contents of the paper. The AUTHOR is the AUTHOR because they can be held accountable; they hold judgment of the contents of the paper. Which again, you can make the argument that using AI as much as you want to write a paper should be fine as long as the author accepts, understands, verifies, and accepts responsibility for the contents. \n\nso to finally get my points, you see all the vibe coders that are unable to understand, verify, and accept responsibility for their coding.",

Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component—accidentally or intentionally—that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.\nhttps://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/260",
