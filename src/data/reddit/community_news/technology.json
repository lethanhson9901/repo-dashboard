This happens because their perceived image of \"loving and caring parent\" crashes headfirst into the reality of \"I sent my child away to a place where s/he was abused in every way conceivable\". The two are irreconcilable so to protect their ego they just deflect at every step.       \n\nI'm 100% expecting the same reaction out of MAGA chuds: they'll be unable to cope with the reality of \"I helped elect a fascist government\" because it'd destroy their perceived image of \"proud American defender of democracy and the constitution\" and so they'll go full on Deflectionville mode.              \n\nHell, we've already seen that with the murder of Renee Good: they can't accept that they helped elect a government that can and will freely murder citizens and so cue all the \"she tried to run him over/she was obstructing the way/she should've obeyed\" deflections. With the latest killing they'll go into deflection mode even harder.       \n\nIf it's of any comfort, for both the parents of kids who survived the TTI and MAGA chuds, deep deep deep deep down, under literal mountains of copium, ***they know what they did.***",

I ran it through and asked if it noted anything striking.\n\n# What’s striking (patterns)\n\n* A large share of tips show limited follow-up outcomes in the “Response” field (e.g., “no contact made,” “voicemail left, no response,” “no probative information”), even when the allegations described serious conduct.​\n* At least one complainant was “spoken to and deemed not credible,” showing explicit credibility triage inside the list.​\n* Several tips converge on recurring themes: modeling recruitment/industry pathways, parties at wealthy/private residences, and alleged involvement of high-profile figures (Trump, Clinton, Maxwell are repeatedly named in different tips).​\n* One tip describes a caller who attended multiple parties at Epstein’s NY residence at age 16 and alleges sexual assault by Epstein; it also names “Allen,” “Oren,” and “Tal” and notes they may be identifiable as the Alexander brothers.​\n* Some allegations are extremely severe (e.g., claims of missing/murdered girls, threats, purported video evidence), which stands out because these are extraordinary claims presented in tip-summary form rather than as fully developed investigative memos.​\n\n# Why the modeling angle stands out\n\n* Multiple tips reference recruiting/“modeling” as a lure or access channel (including a “Trump Modeling Agency” timeframe and mention of older Victoria’s Secret models at parties).​\n* Independently of these tips, Epstein has been publicly reported as having connections in the Victoria’s Secret/Wexner orbit, which is why readers flag modeling as a recurring motif in Epstein-related reporting.\n* Separately, Trump’s modeling agency has had public scrutiny in the past over labor/immigration issues involving models, which may be why tipsters anchor stories to that pathway (even though the tips themselves are not proof).",

The murder of Pretti was too indefensible for people to support them if they kept pushing things.  They want to turn up the temperature and get people to retaliate *without* fully losing their base.\n\nThat’s why they backed down after January 6th too, they knew they couldn’t win back then.

You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to search the exact companies you give money to, and where they give your money.\n\nTrade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to the nonprofits successfully fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/).

Does this 150% account for any bumps in new *install* rates or anything like that? I hate tiktok, but this seems like fluff since nobody seems to be reporting something like \"10% of us tiktok users have deleted their accounts\". Plus, with all the errors the app has had lately, I'm wondering how many people thought it was their phone causing it and did a fresh install to try to fix it",

Even mysql (that oracle tried to infantalise to make it's paid for dB seem better) would be a generally better choice for an enterprise app IMO.\n\n\nWithout their banking and government projects I'd expect oracle to just fade away into overpriced obscurity.\n\n\nOf course I thought the same about We sphere ($27k a license when I worked with it) and weblogoc (a bargain $17k a license). Neither of them work as well or as quickly as jboss, which isn't even my favourite free open source alternative.\n\n\nRegulations in that sector tend to help the incumbent with very little benefit for the people it's supposed to help.

In the US, TikTok is still the most downloaded app (5 million times last month according to SensorTower in the US) and #1 entertainment app still according to App Store ranking (not overall rank). If 2.5x increases, not that much of US users uninstalled.\n\nThe scale of their user base is the key factor here. Think about it from a simple user math perspective: it's all about whether new users can replace the ones who leave. TikTok has over 130 million users in the US alone. Let's say a normal week sees 1 million uninstalls. A 2.5x spike pushes that to 2.5 million. That sounds huge, but it's still less than 2% of their total US user base. It just means for that one week, their new signups likely didn't keep up with the spike in people leaving. The platform is big enough to take that hit. (In a theoretical sense) \n\nIt's a noticeable dip, for sure. But their user acquisition engine is always running to help offset those losses. It would hurt their growth ratio for that, but a platform that large is built to absorb temporary shocks like that. It really just confirms the slow bleed idea instead of a sudden collapse.\n\nAlso, not that a lot of user would prompt to branch out. In January 21, 2026, apptopia reported that those audience would move to TV, Streaming, and/or gambling apps.\n\nhttps://apptopia.com/en/blog/tiktok-dau-growth-has-fallen-churned-users-are-not-going-to-competitors/\n\nhttps://app.sensortower.com/overview/835599320?country=US",

I do have a bluetooth speaker but when the battery dies (it won't last 8hr) it makes a very loud BLEEPBLOOP to announce shutdown. I guess 'not having phone next to me when I wake up' is a great start if I can figure out how to have brown noise playing from my phone, without my phone.

And why would he then delete his tweet and never talk about it again?\n\nElon being a pedophile creep, just like Trump, is the least surprising news ever. I just hope we get a real investigation and people finally go to jail, but it'll have to be after the Trump admin is out of office.

It’s never gonna get any better. Don’t look for it. Be happy with what you got.\n\n Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.\n They’ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. \n\nWell, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain’t in it. You and I are not in the big club\"",

Toyota makes multiple models that fit the Model Y class so their sales numbers are spread out for a lot more car models. Tesla just makes the 3, S, X, Y (and Cybertruck which has abismal sales). Imagine if Toyota only sold 4 different models, they would absolutely beat the Model Y sales if that were the case. \n\nThe other huge factor is EV tax incentives, which just ended in the US. A lot of Tesla Model 3 and Y sales were solely because the government gave great price incentives that made them more affordable to buy. With the US incentives ending and more EV models coming to the rest of the world, I feel Tesla is only going to have lower and lower sales in the coming years. BYD or others make better EVs at a cheaper price and I really wish we got that competition in the US.",

They've got some of the best efficiency ratings outside of something weird looking like Aptera.  From all accounts, they were designed and redesigned continuously by some great engineers within the company.  Then Musk wanted his own project with the Cybertruck, and it has flopped hard.  I think people would get over its looks if it wasn't so expensive and the range and reliability were what they had promised.  But from what I've heard, Musk mostly took control of the design and took a ton of shortcuts on things, like the suspension, in favor of eye catching stuff.  Then he got sucked into the alt-right pipeline and went more insane and bought twitter and mostly has abandoned Tesla to the chaos he leaves behind.\n\nBut no, he had to go full Nazi and do a bunch of stuff that has/will statistically lead to the deaths of something like 300,000 people worldwide.  All because he wouldn't go to therapy, and let his insecurities get hijacked by alt-right influencers... not that he was an angel before that...",

They relaxed a lot of their rules to make it more welcoming to others. They didn't actually change anything country wide, they just tried to be a bit nicer during the event so people could come in, see how amazing they are and then leave.\n\nThe US is going the opposite route.

There's way too much money invested already. Much the same as the 1936 Olympics, we will see a few standing up and making a point to say the US didn't deserve the sport being hosted there and that's worth more, historically then any boycott. There was a \"boycott\" for the 36 games, even a whole different games set that year in Spain (didn't happen), but we don't talk about that...we sure as fuck know the image of Jesse Owens standing next to Nazi's geting his gold medal. Sometimes the best protest is run with the enemy and make your voice heard when the stage is yours.",

They're confident you've got a few decades of a reduction in standing before they have to consider American soft power something they need to take into account.\n\nThere's plenty of other indicators of American loss of soft power in the past few years, but the Catholic Church didnt survive a thousand years by taking risky bets. They see American influence going down, and a potential for religious movement within the US to increase, with a potential of their own expansion as a result.

It just bypasses the fights by way of threats.\n\nFor instance, USAID was very much an organization designed to bully. That money was not unconditional. It was given first, then used to say \"hey, if you don't deregulate your own country's oil and gas exports and allow US corporate interests to further pilfer your nation's national resources, then this money we're giving you will go away and we'll destabilize your whole-ass regime in the process.\"\n\nPrivate entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do the same things. \n\nWhen Bill Gates says \"I want to eradicate polio!\" and the country says \"yeah, uhh, we don't really have that many problems with polio, but we could really use some malaria meds,\" Bill Gates will put terms and conditions on his \"aid\" such that it CANNOT be used for malaria meds.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, Bill Gates wants a headline saying \"King Dickhead Eradicates Polio,\" not to actually help people in need. The Clinton Foundation has operated in precisely this way in Haiti as well.",

I still remember when I went in 2020, how awful the vibe was.\n\nThe convention itself was dead. There was way more interesting activity in the lobby of the St. Regis than there was at the center. When we got to the center, it was saturated with a bunch of “dead”, shit-tier web3 games and NFT marketplace platforms that we’re supposed to *”disrupt the market”* that were absolutely scams. No gamer who was there was satisfied with the offerings, and majority of the booths and kiosks were empty. I remember saying right then and there that *”This convention is dead.”* There was no reason to spend money on hotels, passes, and the bloated cost of the Bay Area to waltz around the Tenderloin and risk being approached by homeless people.\n\nNow? As if the prohibitive costs and low-participation from developers wasn’t bad enough, you could actually get arrested. Every developer has their own showcase now per platform, so there is no reason for the major players to go, either. The meetup is now almost exclusively for people pitching their games and trying to secure new rounds of funding; even then, if you are in that phase, there are cheaper and easier ways to secure deals than to attend the event. It is definitely going to go the way of E3 and die out, 100%\n\nThe other unrelated but relevant detail I remember; virtually everyone I knew who went that year caught COVID. It was a super spreader event, and the convention did virtually nothing to help prevent it from being that way. It is a weird value proposition to any developer: *”Hey, spend $3000 to come here for a few days, talk to some financiers and BD guys, leave with a chronic illness that can and will spread to your teams when you return and decommission for them for another 7-12 days!”* You combine it with the area being housed with a massive amount of homeless people who can and do steal as much as possible from convention-goers, and it just isn’t worth it.",

Paralytics can stop breathing, cause cardiac complications, and leave people with permanent damage. Anyone with clinical training knows this. Advocating harm is the exact opposite of the oath and responsibility that comes with working in healthcare.\n\nI am not even political, which makes it more disturbing to watch people defend this. The moral gymnastics are wild. The justification sounds eerily similar to the logic J6 supporters used. They convinced themselves democracy was being stolen (it wasn’t not), so they felt their actions were justified. Now others are convincing themselves they are fighting literal Nazis (they are not), so they feel justified advocating medical harm.\n\nWe are living in unhinged times. I genuinely hope someone studies this era from a psychological standpoint, because the level of self righteousness required to publicly call for medically harmful acts is unreal. I cannot imagine being so emboldened that I would advocate hurting people and assume the rest of the world agrees.",

I would send screenshots, but I photos cant be uploaded. This is the AI overview response I got,\n\n“Based on newly released, hacked, and leaked documents from 2013–2016, Jeffrey Epstein acted as a behind-the-scenes broker in foreign policy, specifically attempting to facilitate a secret backchannel between Israel and Russia regarding the Syrian civil war.\n\nKey details regarding Epstein's involvement in Syria include:\n\nBackchannel Diplomacy: Between 2013 and 2016, Epstein acted as an intermediary between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Russian authorities to discuss the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussian Connection: Emails show Epstein advising Barak to meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss a Russian-led peace plan for Syria, with Epstein helping to craft messages for the Kremlin.\n\nTargeting Assad: The goal of these, and other, interactions was to shape US and Russian policy to align with Israeli security goals, which included removing Assad from power and opposing the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBrokering Deals: Reports from Drop Site News suggest Epstein used his network to act as a \"fixer\" at an elite level, connecting Israeli intelligence with international actors, including in discussions about Syria.\n\nContext of Leaks: These revelations emerged from emails hacked by \"Handala\" and published in late 2025, which also indicated Epstein's involvement in other geopolitical matters.\n\nSeparately, in 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed in an interview that Epstein did not commit suicide but was killed because he held \"vital secrets\".\n\nSeems pretty suspicious to me",

Schumer has said it himself, their main objective is to keep their voter base pro-isreal.

Isreal is a top priority of our foreign policy and rights be damned. So they voted to ban the app. Using this bullshit Chinese data harvesting conspiracy theory. China doesn’t need to harvest American data, they can buy better more intimate data harvested by basically every American company.\n\nThe ban is and always was about narrative control and democrats banned it to stem the tide of public opinion shifting on isreal",

[Here's another](https://x.com/jfederations/status/1767989253735133673) calling for TikTok to be banned/censored precisely due to it being a vehicle for criticism of Israel.\n* [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtk_5c9D_Ko) Mitt Romney admitting the reason for the ban on camera, very explicitly.\n\nNot surprising that, having received a loud, clear message that the government will punish social media platforms that don't sufficiently censor content inconvenient for the government of the day, the current owners of Tiktok are now more than happy to comply with the propaganda interests of this new government-of-the-day.",

                  "text": "that's the typical cycle. we are on track to have China surpass the US in economic terms. So what does that mean? well...\n\nChina needed drastic repression when shit was really bad, quality of life was poor, and they wanted to invest massively. Now it's population is generally much better off, strong middle class, expanding and getting wealthy, so they are much more complacent (sound familiar?). China is about to reap the profits of massive investments in industry and infrastructure. they went from being the worlds factory for cheap things with slave labor and using industrial espionage and ignoring copyright laws to learn and advance as much as possible, to now being the worlds factory for nearly everything including the absolute state of the art and top tier products, having incredible universities, they now have the best cars, the best smartphones, the best robots, (they just lack the best chips, which is taiwan, which is why they want it). They have the fastest bullet trains in the world, and they have more railway of it than the circumference of the earth. they have transitioned to a service economy while also maintaining the best industries in the world, a service economy that is now benefiting from the massive infrastructure spending allowing for people to be connected and trade and move around very fast\n\nmeanwhile the US is the opposite. quality of life is deteriorating, infrastructure is crumbling, there's been zero investment just the opposite, they have been dismantling and selling everything for parts and cutting spending everywhere. the US elites now need control over the population. There are no fast trains. Everyone must go into debt to have a car to go to work, to earn to pay for the car. The roads that america kept building and building, more lanes, more highways, more parking lots, now all need repair (25-30y lifecycle of tarmac), and it costs more to replace than to build new. The debt has come asking for interest. And while the interstate highway investment back in 1950's did reap a lot of benefit, more and more roads and more cars doesn't keep scaling up. not like trains do. A train line can take 100 people or 1 million people, you can make trains longer, higher, double deck, more frequent. You can have trains so frequent that you don't even need to look at your watch, you just show up and board. miss it? there's another in 4 minutes. you can show up at the station 2 minutes before and still board. and you board and arrive downtown to downtown. meanwhile cars, good luck with the parking and the traffic. you'll spend more time going from the suburbs to downtown and finding parking than the actual trip. cars don't scale, they clog. roads don't scale - the more lanes you make, the more parking you make, the further away your destination gets. just look at a commercial area having 2 shops separated by parking lots that take 10 minutes to walk from one to the other, and then imagine if there was no parking lot, just a train rail and a platform - the shops would be next to each other and take 20 seconds to walk from one to the other. now multiply that by every shop and house. A walkable distance becomes a 30 minute drive once you add parking lots and massive roads between every house and shop. meaning, economic waste. you spent money on infrastructure that forced people to spend money on cars and oil, only to make people not move faster than simply walking. in a service economy, you need people working and spending - not wasting time inside cars, that is sure to make auto industry and oil industry rich - and no one else.\n\nthis isn't to excuse china or the usa, in past, present or future. China is still China, and the US is still the US, for better and for worse. China now has a complacent population, so they can avoid doing more Tiananmen massacres, but they will still be corrupt autocrats. The USA already had no proper individual freedoms (see 2000's laws, if i accuse you of being a terrorist i can hold you indefinitely without lawyer, court, or accountability, and put you in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and torture you, see border control 2000's laws saying that within 200 miles of an airport or land border or port, anyone can be arrested without charge, lawyer or court, on accusation of being an illegal immigrant). the right violations were already there, they just were almost never used because the USA was rich and the elite were happy keeping the status quo and extracting wealth. now these lack of rights are being used to oppress the population, because the elite wants more wealth to be extracted but people are already living paycheck to paycheck and drowning in student and medical debt, so they ransack the government (doge) and they sell out democracy (laws and executive power is traded for cash, gifts and bribes like a plane from qatar, or $1 billion a year per country for board of peace), and if this continues much more, I can totally see massacres like Tiananmen happing here (Kent state, japanese concentration camps).",

Think of the most conservative state you can, then go to their subreddit and see if it reflects reality.

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.”\n\nGeorge Orwell, 1984",

Won't this be fun when convincing AI video is the only thing on the platform. Wonder why ICE is taking photographs the protestors?  it's not like the Whitehouse posts AI manipulated photos on the official Whitehouse website... https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ce9yydgmzdvt They wouldn't do that with video... Would they? The one thing that stops trust from eroding and keeps them in check. I am sure that this is just a crazy conspiracy that is totally fine and that no one is focusing on for some reason. I can't wait for the surprise and shock that this could happen. Seriously please wake up. The battle you think you are fighting is the distraction they are about to flank you with AI.",

This is a massive violation of established laws and guidelines.*\n\nI’ve been seeing a lot of reports/videos/questions about ICE (or other agencies) taking photos of people recording them and claiming they are being added to a \"terrorist\" or \"criminal\" database solely for filming.\n\nIf this is happening in a multijurisdictional intelligence system, it is a textbook violation of federal law - specifically 28 CFR Part 23.\n\nUnder this federal regulation, law enforcement agencies are strictly prohibited from adding you to an intelligence database unless they meet these criteria:\n\nNO \"Reasonable Suspicion\": Under § 23.20(a), they cannot put you in a system unless there is reasonable suspicion of definable criminal activity. Recording a federal agent in public is a constitutionally protected act, not a crime.\n\nFirst Amendment Violations: § 23.20(b) explicitly forbids agencies from collecting or maintaining info on people based on their social or political activities unless it’s directly related to criminal conduct. Recording the government is a First Amendment right.\n\nHarassment & \"Chilling Effects\": § 23.20(l) states that intelligence projects cannot be used to harass or interfere with lawful political activities. Labeling a legal observer or a bystander a \"terrorist\" for holding a phone is a clear attempt to intimidate. (I believe this applies *even if they are lying*)\n\nFalse Information: § 23.20(g) requires that all data be accurate and relevant. Entering a \"Terrorist\" label for someone who has committed no crime is a violation of data integrity.\n\nIf this happens to you, what you can do: Document everything: Get the officer's name, badge number, and the exact time/location. (Clearly this is a problem with these ICE goons, however, record license plates as though will be tied to the agents operating them).\n\nFile a Privacy Act Request: You can file a FOIA/Privacy Act request with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to see if records exist on you.\n\nContact Advocacy Groups: If you think you've been \"watchlisted\" for filming, reach out to the ACLU or the National Lawyers Guild (NLG).\n\nDon't let them intimidate you into putting the camera down. The law is literally written to prevent this exact type of overreach.\n\nTL;DR: 28 CFR Part 23 says they need \"Reasonable Suspicion\" of a crime to put you in an intelligence database. Filming them isn't a crime; it's a right.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I am a former criminal intelligence analyst, my job involved maintaining one of these databases and the law is extremely strict on what can go in it, despite public perception.\n\nThe video of the ICE agent stating that woman going into a database as a terrorist is a blatant violation of this law and should trigger a congressional investigation.\n\nRead the full text of the regulation on the eCFR website. [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23)\n\nEdit: I believe 28 CFR Part 23 only applies if data is entered into a DOJ-funded criminal intelligence system. We don't know at this point if this is the case. But either way, it merits a congressional investigation.",

They ought to be wearing bodycams and filming their own actions so others don't have to do it for them.\n\nActions taken by *public servants* shouldn't have to hide their faces. They shouldn't be afraid of being judged by their peers. The fact the government puts ICE Agents in a position where they feel terrified by the general public seeing what they are doing is a travesty, to say nothing of the implications of the actions themselves.\n\nIf they are breaking the law, then filming their illegal actions is in the interest of everybody but the lawbreakers themselves. If they aren't breaking the law and are doing everything as they should be, then they have nothing to fear.\n\nThis is not \"If you have nothing to hide, then you don't need privacy\" argument - actions taken by public servants are *supposed* to be scrutable. This is why many countries have Freedom of Information laws. We empower these officers of the law to enforce the law, and trust them to do right by us all, and in exchange, we get the ability to hold them account when they break those laws themselves - because giving somebody power without accountability is and always has been a recipe for disaster.\n\nIf the general public cannot hold them account, the government isn't holding up their end of the deal, and the fact the rest of the US government seems complicit in this is a travesty.\n\n---\n\nFor folks interested in the origins of modern Policing, the \"Peelian Principles\" and \"Policing by Consent\" from the UK and how it's morphed into Policing by Law with accountability - public trust is at the heart of democratic law enforcement. Empowering an organisation that people don't trust and then taking actions to undermine any trust they could build is a great way to increase the friction between the people and the state and will likely make things escalate further.",

This was my cost but his was more I owe it to him to do the right thing and use my talents to bring good and knowledge and truth to this horrible time.  But my family will disavow me.",

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the forced removal and incarceration of over 110,000 to 120,000 people of Japanese descent—two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens—from the West Coast into inland, guarded detention camps during World War II, driven by wartime panic and false claims of military necessity. \nKey Details of Executive Order 9066:\nPurpose: The order empowered the Secretary of War and military commanders to designate \"military areas\" and exclude any person from them.\nTarget: Although it did not name specific groups, it was used specifically to target Japanese aliens and American citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast.\nImpact: Over 120,000 people were forced to leave their homes, businesses, and lives, spending up to three years in relocation centers.\nDuration & Rescission: The order remained in effect for the duration of the war and was formally rescinded by President Gerald Ford on February 19, 1976.\nLegal & Historical Context: While challenged in court (e.g., Korematsu v. United States), the Supreme Court originally upheld the detention as a \"military necessity\". In the 1980s, these convictions were overturned, and the government apologized, admitting the actions were based on racial prejudice rather than evidence of treason. \n\nSame same but different meme***",

Some of those would be discovered. That would be disinformation: something that would call into question whether *any* specific part of the information is valid or not.

I only know this because I've been doing a piece of work recently that researches into this.\n\nMisinformation generally isn't just considers to be \"getting it wrong\" because you can deliberately choose to spread misinformation. The difference is that you don't really have an agenda to influence you  with misinformation. Disinformation has an agenda though.\n\nFor example, I generate an AI video of a group deer running through an American town and share it online with the caption \"Woah, nature meets our little town!\". I'm only really doing this to try and go viral. This is misinformation.\n\nDisinformation would be if I generate the same video and claim the deer are in town because President Trump has authorised ten times more logging than any other President and it's driving animals into towns. That's disinformation.\n\nSo the OP is right this example is likely disinformation because it's being spread with an agenda to influence. However, I can see why you'd label it misinformation to prevent an argument \"I'm not saying you're lying on purpose, it's clearly a confusing and stressful moment, I'm saying you just got it wrong\" etc",

Disinformation implies that you already had all the correct information, and what you knew for a fact was the truth, which gives you more leeway to craft a lie using small parts of what we know to be true in order to give it legitimacy. \n\nI’m not sure if this is shared amongst the general public, but that’s what it evokes for me.

Any data harvested from Palantir operations in US allies will go right into US misinformation campaigns to support antidemocratic far-right movements. Which the US has explicitly announced it will do in its National Security Strategy and is run by an administration that is actively supported by Palantir.\n\n**EDIT:** Editing this post, in order to reply to the edit in the post below, because apparently that is a normal way of having a discussion. Just as an aside, a bot would likely be significantly more literate. For both the Gaza and Ukraine conflict, I used data from the OHCHR to have a comparable analysis with roughly equal methodology, from the same source:\n\nGaza: [https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026) (70,000 cumulative reported casualties)\n\nUkraine: [https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29\\_ENG\\_0.pdf](https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29_ENG_0.pdf) (50,000 cumulative civilian reported casualties)\n\nI'm willing to admit that the Ukraine figure is likely significantly higher, although then again so is the figure in Gaza. The war in Gaza remains a shorter conflict fought over a smaller territory with lower overall populations, with orders of magnitude smaller proportions of armed forces involved. The total figures of military casualties in the case of Ukraine is also significantly higher (2-3 million), even assuming the total number of civilian casualities is around 300.000. Even taking that lower estimate of military casualties (2m) and higher estimate of civilian casualties (300k) it would be about 15%, whereas the [estimated proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza can be as high as 83%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war), according to international scholars.\n\nPart of this is just the core mechanics of this war: Gaza is largely in an urban area, the War in Ukraine has been primarily fought in rural areas, with a meatgrinder doctrine employed by the Russian aggressor. But no international academics in conflict studies are actually claiming that the proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza are on the lower end for modern urban warfare. [Quite the contrary in fact.](https://www.972mag.com/israeli-intelligence-database-83-percent-civilians-militants/)\n\nUnder international law, deliberately withholding food and medical supplies from civilians in a war zone, and blocking foreign or NGO food deliveries as well, is a war crime. Specifically article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Rome Statutes of 1998. There are a range of other international humanitarian laws that can be applied to this as well (including additional protocols to the Geneva Convention), and it has formed [part of the mandate for the arrest warrants for Israeli government members](https://www.csis.org/analysis/starvation-crimes-and-international-law-new-era). Part of the inspiration for much of this international humanitarian law is Soviet Russia's Holodomor in Ukraine (I would recommend Anne Applebaum's Red Famine on this to anyone, also to get a broader idea for some of the historical origins of Ukrainian nationalism).\n\nLet's also be absolutely clear: in no way am I supporting Russia or sympathetic to Russia. One look in my post history will say enough. Unlike certain other people I'm also happy to be transparent about my post history, and don't hide past comments on my newly created profile. I'll give enough to grief to anyone who engages in apologetics for Russia, or tries to justify the Russian war as being provoked by NATO expansion. As a person of the left, I have had friendships broken over my support for (and personal involvement with) Ukraine, by people often upset that Ukraine receives military support and humanitarian aid, while Gaza is left to rot.\n\nBut **truth** matters. And pointing to Ukraine is not a justification for Israel's war of genocide on Palestine. The way you can tell it's a genocide (regardless of what u/AVolantScheme says) is because Israeli ministers such as Smotrich, Ben Gvir, and government coalition members in the Knesset have openly bragged about how it's a genocide and a war for extermination.",

                  "text": "It's literally being used in this article lmao\n\nTrying to call Israel defending itself against genocide as \"Violent US hegemony\" meanwhile Russia killed more Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol than Israel has killed total and Iran killed more civilians in the past 3 weeks due to the protests than Israel has in Gaza\n\nBe how the world is going\n\nEditing because the guy below me simply lies and because of how Reddit works the actual response disproving his blatant Pro-Russian lies gets no views:\n\nRussia killed \\~80k civilians in Mariupol, as reported by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. Kind of insane to argue that Israel is trying to eradicate Gaza yet to completely handwave away Russia's attempted eradication of Ukraine. 15k civilian deaths in Ukraine lmfaoooo. Civilian death toll is in the hundred thousands in Ukraine.\n\nIsrael has killed \\~70k, of which between 50%-66% have been civilians, the lowest ratio in urban conflict's history\n\nIsrael has has no been starving or indiscriminately bombing, as proven by the fact said above lowest civilian casualty ratio in urban conflict's history and the fact that yknow, multiple >SINGULAR< actual indiscriminate bombings the USA did killed more civilians during WW2 than Israel has killed total\n\nOn starvation, that a complete lie. According to the World Food Programme: [https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023) 951 MT feeds 488k people for a week. 951 x 4.5 (a month) x 4.3 (getting 488k to 2.1m) is 18401 metric tons of food per month, convert metric tons to tons to get 20283 tons\n\n. According to the UN's own numbers: [https://app.un2720.org/tracking](https://app.un2720.org/tracking) In the nearly 2 month period (From May 19th to July 31st) Gaza has been given \\~37000 tons of food, nearly enough for two months worth of supply. Call it not perfect, sure. (Ignoring the fact that Israel has no legal obligation to do this). Just ridiculous how the blood libel is. \"Intentionally starving people\". It also directly conflicts with what COGAT has stated the past few days. The UN site states only 222 trucks were offloaded into Gaza from July 19th to July 26th, COGAT has stated that over 600 trucks were dropped off in that period. And I trust COGAT over the group that has actively blood libeled Israel since the Holocaust was finished.\n\nBut okay, you don't like that, let's get into the daily stuff then. Just a simple browse of Twitter account ImShin shows Palestinians posting their lives. Oh. So from the source they have food and tons of it. Ok. But that's not enough. Ok. So let's go over the Hamas statistics: According to the Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza) 68 total starvation deaths before July 2025 according to the \"Gazan Health Ministry\" (who gain nothing from lying about how low said numbers are)\n\nOk, let's establish a baseline: Illinois. Illinois had 625 deaths from starvation/malnourishment in 2023. Illinois' population is \\~12.7m, Gaza's is roughly \\~2.1m divide 625 by 6, 104 divide 68 by 1.66 (18 months) 41. Illinois's starvation death rate is 2.5 times Gaza's. Illinois.\n\nNo other nation in the world has EVER been expected to feed their opposition, rebuild their enemies. Israel continues to do so despite the blatant genocidal policies and attitudes. of the Palestinians.\n\nSo anecdotally, statistically, and analogically. There is no evidence that Israel is starving Gaza.\n\nBut hey, if you think Israel is doing all this and is trying to \"eradicate Palestine\" while the Palestinians >DIG UP THEIR OWN WATER PIPES AND FIRE THEM AS ROCKETS AT ISRAEL< you may not be using fact based evidence.\n\nAlso forgot to include the tens of thousands Ukrainians abducted by Russia too. But hey. Pro-Palestinians'll do bloody anything to glaze Russia lmao",

If not immigrants they'll just find slightly more expensive British citizens, who have a much greater 1 in 50 chance of rejecting the offer. \n\n\nWhat would really solve this is Palantir getting kicked off from the UK, and no less. ",

Local contractors would notoriously quote these ridiculous numbers for simple jobs around the warehouse because they knew Amazon would just pay for it.\n\nThen, instead of allowing one particular team to work remotely for a site that was still being built, which that team could have worked remote with their job role, they paid to fly them all to a hotel multiple states away and booked a months worth of nights. \n\nIt is perhaps one of the most wasteful companies I've ever heard of.

A few of them literally left tech entirely after that. \n\nI also heard that some teams have a requirement of one person getting cut every quarter / year or so (depending on PiPs), so they would intentionally hire someone they knew was sub-par to be able to keep their main team itself.\n\nI worked at one of the big tech companies for almost 6 years before quitting with my soul barely in tact and didn't have too much corporate evil to deal with personally because I worked in part of the company that went from normal hours to COVID hours (product was necessary for our customers to actually function and customers were schools, so moral obligation easy to push)... So working 6am to 1am 7 days a week. Even after the COVID crunch was over, that just became the new normal all the time. And it was still COVID, so what the fuck else was there to do but work? I lost so much weight during that time and never noticed just from barely eating anything.\n\nI loved one of my coworkers (my manager) and had my little flock of people I protected (I had risen to be senior on my team), but honestly now I just have watched from the outside as those people I liked got laid off or now work even more insane hours just to keep a necessary product functioning in order to keep the other crap that made money functioning on top of it. I'm happy to have left when I did. \n\nWhen I joined that company in 2017, the stock was around $42/share. It's now ten times that. I also had an offer from another faang (had interned there) that I turned down after seeing the fact that the free meals just really were meant to keep employees there from early morning through late dinner, to the point where employees really didnt know any humans that didnt work at said company. How do you make a product for people you have no context of?? It was scary how detached from reality they were and how many were just divorced and had no interest in maintaining custody if they had kids. \n\nHalf the thing with working at any of these companies is luck. There are four people just as qualified, two more qualified, that just didn't get a position because someone was having a bad day or a resume just got passed over. It's not a level of amazing prestige that it is seen elsewhere or seen as just a resume unlock tool for anywhere else you want to work, but it's a matter of luck. Any \"holier than thou\" attitude should be seen as purely bullshit.",

These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.\nThe lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified.\nThe broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October.\nThe firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.\nWhile affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Time to rethink'\nSince Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts.\nJassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.\nIn-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.\nAmazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement.\nIn an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\"\nJassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.\nAdditional reporting by Mitchell Labiak```",

I want you to remember it, because when the pendulum swings and the left inevitably regains power, I want you to remember as your red states, your rural towns, have law enforcement come through, I want you to remember the precedents you set.  I want you to remember the “justifications” and excuses you used.  I want you to remember that as your streets are filled with federal officers.  I want you to remember that as your neighborhoods are combed.  I want you to remember what happens when you resist.\n\nAnd I especially want you to remember that you justified it all, you set the precedent.  I want you to remember you laughed about it, you cheered it all on.  I want you to remember that and think about that when you experience it.

A cults effect on the mind is to change the very way you see and understand truth itself. When these people, including their leader, look at this situation they simply do not see the same thing you see.\n\nThey use confirmation bias to later reinforce their warped view. “Well he had a gun. Why does he need that gun? Surely he planned to use it. Ergo, he is a terrorist.” This is obvious confirmation bias being used to reinforce and double down on a warped view of truth.\n\nIt is so important to me. I am in fact begging all of you to understand: this has gone beyond reason, beyond peaceful protest, beyond diplomacy. It is already too late and we are going to lose if something more significant is not done. You’re trying to reason with, and send messages to, an impotent government led by warped minds that are not seeing reality. They are indoctrinated.\n\nI have A LOT of experience with cults. I am not just baselessly saying this. I am making an informed and educated observation and desperately want everyone to pass this along before we completely lose the country. What government we have left that has any sense clearly doesn’t understand what we are dealing with. No amount of reason or pleading or intelligent speech is going to change anything.\n\nFor the love of god please get this through your heads before it’s too late.",

A stoic person looks like theyre being harassed by a masked gremlin, a blubbering person makes the masked gremlin look like some tough everyman.

In the altered photo they actually removed her bold lip color, someone trying to downplay ethnic features wouldn't do that and someone ashamed lf their features wouldn't wear a fuscia lip.",
