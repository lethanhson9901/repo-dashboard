I noticed that the time displayed in the corner on live US news broadcasts was about ten minutes off (eg, if the current real world time was 7:32am in DC, and 7:32pm in the city I was in, the US national news timestamp would be 7:22am, meaning we were seeing news with a ten minute delay).\n\nThen I noticed that the screen would go black periodically. It finally clicked that the US live news was being screened and censored. The lag was the time they gave themselves to block out ideas they didn’t want broadcast there. Entire news segments (1-4 minutes) were being blocked.\n\nI like the regular people and culture of the country, so I don’t want to name it in case I want to go back (I’d never get into any sort of political action there, but we can see how things are going with travel and ai surveillance of socials already). \n\nI think about that when things like this happen. It’s the kind of thing the US is supposed to be against. The very first amendment provides this right (free speech, free press, free from national/forced religion, free to choose any religion, free to assemble/protest, etc).\n\nThese rights are usually chipped away gradually, and only just enough to avoid causing a big uproar, and when people accept that change, it’s chipped away a little more later. Then a year or decade later the accumulated change is so drastic that if it had happened all at once there’d be mass uprisings, but instead, because of the slow creep, everyone is just lulled into complacency thinking, “wow, how’d we get here?” And carrying on as if things were normal because, “what can I do?”\n\nPoint being, there needs to be pushback over these little chips being removed from rights, even if they seem inconsequential at the time, because they are likely part of a larger pattern that will ultimately fundamentally change the freedoms we enjoy.",

I think you could only show 30 total seconds of daily content per broadcast or something. \n\nThink of it like the NFL broadcast disclaimer. They ultimately own the content, even if games are broadcast on several different networks.",

The pretense of \"F-f-for the children!\" is paper thin at best. \n\nThis is just one of many steps into digital surveillance and gross overreach that are going to be taken in the near future as the Technocrats and Governments around the world realize how much they can get from us. \n\nPrivacy is vanishing before our very eyes.\n\nGod, I hate to sound like a tinfoil-hatter but it's becoming impossible to ignore just how much we're being surveilled in our daily lives. \n\nThere is no space that they will not try to take.\n\nEven if I were to pretend they were sincere about PROTECT THE KIDS it still isn't the job of the Government or any Corporation to do so. That's what their parents are for. \n\nIt isn't anyone else's fault that Deborah threw an iPad at her 9 year old to shut them up. That's her failure and her responsibility.\n\nEDIT: This blew up and my notifications are a circus of bad faith morons making some Olympic leaps so here's a few little clarifiers for you.\n\n-Sit your asses down and have a thorough conversation (or several) with your kids/teens about online safety. My parents did this with my brother and I and they didn't even grow up in the internet age. You can do it. You know more than your parents did, and have access to more tools than they had, too. Teach your kids about boundaries and how to set them. When and how to walk away. How to identify and report inappropriate content, and how to Block people. Teach them about identifying information and stress the importance of never ever sharing it. Stranger danger. Let them ask questions and make sure they know that they can and should come to you if something feels off.\n\n-Just don't put them onto the unrestricted internet. Little Jacob doesn't need an iPad. If you must put a screen in front of him, make it something safe like a goddamn Nintendo. \n\n-I am not American but I see what's happening there and understand that the rise of Fascism and this increasing demand for surveillance are not coincidental. The role of Discord in Nepal's recent revolution should be something to consider in the conversation about Discord wanting your ID.\n\n-For the love of God, no, I am not a Pedo Defender. Just a gal who doesn't feel the need to fork over every last piece of identifying information she has to faceless corporations and whoever they want to forward it to. Or, you know, occurrences like the data breach Discord Dearest suffered in October. I can remember that far back and so can you! \n\n-If I refuse to submit my ID, my account gets labeled as a Teen Account. I'm 30something. That doesn't protect kids.\n\n-The Government and Corporations don't give a damn about you or your kids. \"Protect the Children!!\" And \"THIS IS TO FIGHT TERRORISM!!\" are smokescreens used to sneak other, more sinister agendas under your nose. God fucking dammit I sound like a Hatter again.\n\n-The Trojan Horse looked like a Pretty Pretty Horsie. It was more than that. Go read about it and then do some thinking, ok?",

It’s a liability for Discord to not age verify, they don’t want to risk losing the money in a suit, so they are implementing this “safety feature” to cover their own asses despite the fact that it will make kids LESS safe.\n\nKids who don’t get around the age check are going to be shuttled off to sketchier parts of the Internet that DONT follow the rules: obscure chat rooms, omegle, places with more malware and less eyes. \n\nIt’s the same reason why I’m against age verification for porn sites because it just pushes people to sketchier, even less legit or less ethical sources.. people may be more susceptible to extortion or identity theft or scams in these places than the more regulated sites. \n\nWill this ID and face scan stuff be used in the future to identify and track all of us? Absolutely. But I don’t think that’s why Discord is doing it. I may be wrong, though.",

Requiring users to submit even more sensitive personal data under these circumstances is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates a serious lack of awareness of the trust you have already damaged.\n\nBefore demanding additional identification from users, your organization should first explain—clearly and transparently—how such a breach was allowed to occur, what accountability measures were taken, and why users should believe their data will be handled safely this time. At present, there is no credible justification for asking users to assume even greater risk.\n\nTrust is not restored by collecting more data. It is restored by demonstrating competence, accountability, and respect for user security. Until those standards are met, this policy change feels less like a security measure and more like a liability transfer from your organization onto your users.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this requirement or, at minimum, provide a secure alternative that does not involve submitting highly sensitive identification documents.\n\nThis policy, as it stands, is unacceptable.\"",

We do not use any age restricted features at all and will be fine with 'teen mode.' \n\nhonestly it is kind of pathetic from the global software industry.

And most parents already take care of this, so I don't see why they couldn't do the same with internet.\n\nBut it's not for the children, never was, and we shouldn't even blame parents. It's a movement launched by various far right groups to destroy anonymity and control people.\n\nIt's wrapped around the protection of children because \"let's track everything adults do on internet so we can blackmail the ones we don't like in the future\" would not be popular.

          "text": "Let me tell you all a little Discord story. Back in 2017 I was attending Blizzcon as I had for many years. One thing about Blizzcon people don't realize is how many epic after parties there are in the area. Heat Ultra Lounge is one of the closest nightclubs and usually has a party hosted by one group or another. Usually a private party where the host is a Blizzcon regular or a PC vendor running promotions (for example in 2015 the party was sponsored by Predator). It's known for being one of the best after parties of the con.\n\nSo in 2017 when I was attending Blizzcon with a friend who had never been before, I wanted to make sure she got the chance to go to this party. But this particular year in typical corporate fashion, Discord rented out the entire venue so they could control who got in. Fortunately I have a friend who's married to a pro gamer and the pro gamers were all given VIP passes. Since they had the VIP passes they didn't need their regular tickets and offered to give them to me and my friend which we gladly accepted.\n\nBut when we got to the door, Discord (not Heat's own bouncers) turned us away. The reason? Our names weren't on the tickets. I asked why that mattered, I could have the ticket owners come vouch and the club would still check our IDs anyway. Still they argued and refused. So I reached out to Mallory Loar, the head of Discords events who I had previously been in contact with. But now when we had a problem, suddenly crickets. We never got in.\n\nNow at the end of the day, it's just a party, not a big deal. But it's more the principal of the thing - that a big company can come and just reserve a venue that usually hosts fan-run or sponsored parties, then decide themselves who has access to a Blizzcon tradition. And adding bureaucratic rules that make no sense with an unresponsive support team.\n\nIt showed me just how corporate Discord had become. I've long since been done with them.",

Lots of random pitfalls like oh your client doesn't support all the features of the chat room version you're in so shit doesn't load right, or some apps support only the new way of calling while some only support the old way, and setting up a server yourself to handle all these cases is a royal PITA.\n\nYeah you can just register an account on matrix.org but then you negate a lot of the alleged benefit of the platform.  At that point you just have your account with \"the\" big central authority, except with way lesser functionality vs competitors.  You can do E2EE but I think more people care about functional screen sharing, which pretty much no Matrix client really has compared to Discord.\n\nJust to give you an idea, joining a room of 2k+ people can take well over a minute because of how the protocol works.  It just is not going to replace Discord any time soon / ever.",

              "text": "They 100% are, and have been being used to track and search for people, there is zero doubt about that. While the government can't surveil directly without justification (that gets slimmer every year), *private companies* have much more relaxed restrictions with their own products. Then all of the data they collect, including video, facial recognition, audio, etc, just just winds up sold to anyone who can afford to buy it. The US government is just another customer, bypassing regulation (including the Constitution) by purchasing access to the surveillance data from private companies or brokers. \n\nThis is not a new thing or a future concern, it is already happening even if a big chunk of the public was only recently made aware of it.\n\nOne of the more egregious offenses in this field is with Flock Safety. They have close to 1 million AI cameras already set up around the US to identify and track *all* passing vehicles. They identify the license plate, make/model, color bumper stickers, dents/damage, etc. creating a digital profile of your vehicle that will be referenced every time you pass any of their cameras and cataloging the location and time data. This data is then sold to law enforcement who are able to use it for dragnet surveillance without a warrant. They can essentially search for whoever they want, whenever they want, for whatever reason they want or no reason at all. It has been for things like [a jealous police chief repeatedly spying on his ex-girlfriend](https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article291059560.html) \n\nor for [tracking down people who get abortions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down)\n\n or for [identifying and cataloging peaceful protesters and activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists).\n\n The \"customers\" then have the right to distribute and use this data as they see fit, with little to no privacy regulation applying yet. [Here is a map of reported cameras so far](https://deflock.org/map), though since they are individually reported only by a fraction of the population that sees the need to catalog them, there are likely more, and new ones being added every day. Flock makes a big PR stink about \"not working directly with the federal government\", but the way their data rights are structured they are easily able to get access through those they do work with. For instance, it is known that ICE and DHS have access to them, so likely every agency does if they want to. Not to mention they are [trivially easy to hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY).\n\nHere are a few resources to learn more, and have it explained better than I did:\n\nhttps://www.stopflock.com/\n\nhttps://eyesonflock.com/\n\n[ACLU on ICE usage](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-pushback), and [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup)\n\n[EFF investigation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis turned into a bot of a specific digression, but you get the point. It is already happening. Also consider how Palantir is fascillitating similar privacy violations. Amazon/Bezos has already been working closely with the federal government this administration, who have shown themselves to be particularly interested in bot AI and surveillance. There is basically no chance that these aren't already being used for tracking, or at least searching people. That is likely one of the primary objectives of setting it up this way to begin with. Lots of data to sell for the company, and civil rights workarounds for the government, a win-win.",

That's not magically going to get rid of the people who voted for him or contain the racist and divisive forces channeled by the Republican party.\n\nHell, if the Republican party is totally dismantled in a US-style de-nazification program in 3 years, and the Dems rule unopposed for 20 years straight sort of like after a mirror of the Civil War, this could STILL HAPPEN AGAIN as long as the Wealth elite exist and continue to cause problems to happen in society and then go and fund fascist solutions because they REFUSE TO SACRIFICE any bit of their wealth for any reason at all.\n\nNo, actually, it's worse than that. Not only do they refuse to sacrifice wealth, they refuse to sacrifice their ability to MAKE EVEN MORE WEALTH. It's not like they're short on wealth or profit right now. There isn't even credible socialist political power in this country. They're funding fascism because they THINK it might emerge, and morons like Peter Thiel are scared shitless its like 2 days away or something. So rich AND delusional; great combo.\n\nPeople don't want to hear it for a variety of reasons, but the problem is, and always will be, Capitalism. Who created the millions of downtrodden people who want to lash out, and thus vote for Trump ? Capitalism. Who created Trump himself ? He's one of the worst examples of a human being made by it. Capitalism. Who poured billions of dollars into souring Sander's campaign even though he isn't even that much of a socialist ? Capitalism. What creates a socially divisive society of competition for the benefit of the elite ? Capitalism.\n\nCapitalists wrote the US Constitution and stuck it full of veto-points because they didn't trust the poors to make choices. You might think that's cause they thought the poors were stupid. And perhaps they did. Lots of people do today still. Except that's not really it. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't, but they were really afraid of the poors voting to take all their wealth. Which is a NON-STUPID response to inequality. That's why there's a house AND Senate. That's why there's an Electoral College. That's why the stupid fillibuster rule exists (it's not in the constitution, either).\n\nThe system makes the unrest and discontent through the process of creating insane wealth for a few, and then those few fund the fascist response to protect that insane wealth. It'll do this over and over and over again as long as Capitalists have any political power (and thus wealth) at all.",

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.",

The operator is not actually controlling the steering.\n\n\nThe concern from the Senate hearing and the Techspot article is about outsourcing. Waymo's plan is for this outsourced role to eventually be reduced to almost nothing. It would be better to use Americans, but then they'll be laying off Americans later.\n\n\n\nFor people concerned about foreign drivers, a Philippines tourist is allowed to visit the US and drive here with their Philippines driver's license plus an international driver's permit, which is just bureaucratic paperwork. A trained Philippines operator should be able to choose maneuvering options that the car provides and executes.",

Holy hell man so offbase.\n\n\n\"Waymo vehicles are not directly remote-controlled or \"joysticked\" by human operators in real-time. Instead, they use a \"fleet response\" system where remote specialists provide high-level guidance or navigation, such as clearing obstacles or directing the car to take alternative routes, while the vehicle handles all driving, steering, and braking itself. \"\n\nKey details regarding Waymo's remote assistance include:\n\n - No Active Driving: Remote agents cannot directly take over, steer, or brake the car.\n\n - Contextual Assistance: When a vehicle encounters a confusing situation (e.g., road construction), it may stop and request help, and a remote human agent helps the system understand the scene to continue safely.\n\n - Safety Rationale: Waymo believes remote driving is unsafe due to potential wireless connection latency (lag).\n\n - Human Intervention: If the vehicle cannot resolve a situation, human roadside assistance is sent to the physical location\n\nWaymo Driver and Remote Assistance has been [third party verified by TÜV SÜD](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/independent-audits) as recently as Nov 2025 and [Automated Vehicle System Consortium](https://avsc.sae-itc.com/publication/avsc-04-2023)\n\nThey don't \"take over\". The car gets into a trouble spot where the safest choice is to stop. That can be remotely monitored and observe what is making them stop and only suggest things to do. This is a security measure and again if Tesla is doing remote driving they are even further behind than thought.\n\nYou can tell people that upvote this have never been in a Waymo. Lots of Tesla boy turfers that hide their history.\n\nWaymo remote assistance is clearly defined. There is CLEARLY a concerted turfing effort to pump remote controlling probably to try to cover for when people find out Tesla does that probably from the control car.\n\nThere is no other reason this type of info would be pumped. Just five minutes of research would tell you why remote control is a horrible idea.\n\nIf Tesla boys are pumping and turfing this \"claim\" on Waymo, Tesla has to be stuck in that mode. Name another reason why this would even come up? It is misinformation and a bad product choice.",

It knows to turn around and go a different route if the way is blocked or hazardous.\n\nBut in those edge cases where it can’t tell what to do*, these people “provide guidance”. They aren’t driving the cars, they look at the video and LiDAR feeds and explain to the AI model what it is seeing, and sometimes to suggest a route to pick. Then the existing decision system uses that additional info to make a decision and keep driving. The AI is still driving the cars.\n\nhttps://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\n\n*As an example, this week they published about handling extreme edge cases, like what the car should do if it encounters a tornado. They are running simulations on what that looks like to LiDAR and cameras, so the cars know to avoid the area.",

Remote human operators handling edge cases or difficult scenarios isn't necessarily bad engineering—it's often the pragmatic solution when full autonomy isn't reliable enough yet. The issue is the lack of transparency about it.\n\nWhat's interesting is this mirrors the early days of a lot of automation. Even Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" has always had the disclaimer that it requires active supervision. The difference is Waymo marketed itself as truly driverless, so finding out there are remote operators (whether in the Philippines or anywhere else) feels like a bait-and-switch. That said, remote assistance for stuck vehicles is different from remote *driving*—if they're just helping with routing decisions or confirming it's safe to proceed in ambiguous situations, that's still way more autonomous than a human driving the whole time.\n\nThe Philippines angle also opens up the labor economics question. If we're outsourcing the \"human in the loop\" part of AI to lower-wage countries, we're essentially just offshoring the jobs rather than eliminating them. It's the mechanical turk problem all over again, except now it's dressed up in Silicon Valley marketing speak about revolutionary AI.",

Below are the steps that google provide when I searched how to set up voice channels in Steam. Hope this helps someone. \n\n\n1. Setting Up Voice Options\nBefore using voice chat, configure your microphone to ensure it works correctly: \nAccess Settings: Open the Steam client, click on Friends & Chat in the bottom right corner, and click the gear icon (Settings) at the top of your friends list.\nConfigure Microphone: Select the Voice tab.\nSelect Input/Output: Choose your microphone and headset/speakers from the dropdown menus.\nTest Microphone: Use the microphone test feature to ensure audio is detected.\nSet Transmission Type: Choose between Push-to-Talk (recommended to filter background noise) or Open Microphone.\nAdjust Threshold: Adjust the voice transmission threshold to filter out background noise. \n\n2. Starting a Voice Chat (Desktop)\nWith a Friend: Right-click a friend's name in your friends list and select Start Voice Chat. Alternatively, open a chat window and click the microphone icon in the top right corner.\nGroup Chat: Open a group chat window, then click the + icon or select the arrow next to the group name to create a voice channel.\nAnswering: When someone calls, a notification with a sound will appear, allowing you to answer or ignore the call. \n\n3. Using Voice Chat in Big Picture Mode\nGo to your friends list and select the friend you want to chat with.\nSelect the Start Voice Chat option. \n\n4. Troubleshooting\nIf the voice chat is not working:\nCheck Windows Settings: Ensure your microphone is enabled and set as the default device in Windows Sound settings.\nCheck Privacy Settings: Ensure Microphone access is allowed for apps like Steam in Windows Privacy settings.\nFirewall: Ensure your firewall is not blocking UDP traffic on ports 27014 through 27020.\nRestart Steam: Sometimes restarting the Steam client can resolve connection issues. \n\n5. Steam Deck\nUse the quick access menu (the \"...\" button).\nSelect the Friends icon (second from the top).\nSelect a friend and click the microphone/chat icon to start a call.",

It isnt producing anything of value, is destroying entire classifications of jobs without offering alternatives for those employees, and is using a lot of expensive resources. It hasn't cured cancer, it hasn't made society better in any way, and the scandals involving it being used as a disinformation tool keep piling up. There is a strong chance the people running it take their bags and just sort of disappear and the rest of us get left with global hyper inflation. So the world elite are getting governments to prop it up by essentially pointing all these things out which has the political class panicking I think.",

We're learning that there is a serious correlation between the evolution of the gut biome and the development of intelligence, as we've learned that the gut actually plays a core role in decision making and sends signals directly to the brain.\n\nIt's such a shame that a tool such as this, one of the dumbest kennedies, can come in and gaslight about nutrition which in turn leaves many people rolling their eyes about any sort of nutritional advice at all.",

But at the very least it was informational.\n\nBread/starches : 6-11\nVegetables: 3-5\nFruit: 2-4\nDairy: 2-3\nMeat: 2-3\n\nNow obviously, this is not a perfect system, because there are CRAZY variations in the macro and micronutrients in specific items which may fall under a category.\n\nSome white bread and rice are basically the same as sugar, where others could be high in fiber.\n\nGreek yogurt is dairy and has fantastic macros, American cheese is dairy as well, but much different nutrition.\n\nBroccoli has lots of micro nutrients, iceberg lettuce not so much. \n\nBUT, I can at least attempt to follow it. I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More here:\n\nAt Sunday’s Super Bowl, Ring advertised “Search Party,” a cute, horrifyingly dystopian feature nominally designed to turn all of the Ring cameras in a neighborhood into a dragnet that uses AI to look for a lost dog: “One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in the Super Bowl commercial. “Search Party from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs.” Onscreen, an AI-powered box forms around a missing dog: “Milo Match,” it says. “Since launch, more than a dog a day has been reunited with their family. Be a hero in your neighborhood with Search Party. Available to everyone for free right now.”\n\nIt does not take an imagination of any sort to envision this being tweaked to work against suspected criminals, undocumented immigrants, or others deemed ‘suspicious’ by people in the neighborhood. Many of these use cases are how Ring has been used by people on its [dystopian “Neighbors” app for years](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs/?ref=404media.co). Ring rose to prominence as a piece of package theft prevention tech owned by Amazon and by forming partnerships with local police around the country, [asking them to shill their doorbell cameras](https://www.vice.com/en/article/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement/?ref=404media.co) to people in their neighborhoods in return for a system that allowed police to request footage from individual users without a warrant. \n\nChris Gilliard, [a privacy expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBgnjn5cC0&ref=404media.co) and author of the upcoming book [*Luxury Surveillance*](https://www.techpolicy.press/through-to-thriving-protecting-our-privacy-with-chris-gilliard/?ref=404media.co), told 404 Media these features and its Super Bowl ad are “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\nRing’s poorly defined partnership with Flock in particular has been the subject of various viral posts and public backlash. Many people have suggested that this partnership is evidence that Ring camera footage will be shared with ICE. At the moment there’s not enough evidence to explicitly say that that’s the case. \n\nThe supposed vector goes something like this: Ring says it will partner with Flock, which is used by thousands of local police departments. As we have reported, some of those police [departments have performed Flock license plate lookups for ICE](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/). It’s too early to say whether Ring footage will eventually end up with ICE, but the fact that people immediately drew that conclusion and understood the possible method of information sharing shows that surveillance companies can no longer hide behind viral videos of delivery drivers dancing. It’s a mask off moment, and people know it: “In Amazon’s alliance with this administration, it’s become more clear than ever that Ring is an extension of the carceral state,” Gilliard said. “An emotionally charged Super Bowl ad won’t change that.”\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)",

I may be understanding the story wrong though; it's possible it was magically recorded during the 3 hours of 'free' footage you can have, but if the rumor about the footage being corrupted and the company having a backup is true, I'm still concerned about data storage.\n\nBest wishes to that family, btw.",

I've had half a dozen friends already come to me with some variation on \"isn't that neat, they can crowdsource finding your dog\" and I keep wanting to scream \"it's not for finding your damn dog!\"",

When a new device joins a network it joins a default vlan with no egress and no access to the home network. The user must use the app to click the drop-down and assign the device to a group. Groups have very simple config: egress enabled, ingress enabled, and lan access. All your IP cameras can live in one group, with egress, ingress and lan disabled. All your smart devices in another gorup. Think guest wifi network but dynamic for any group that you want. That was several years ago and I still wonder why the heck consumer routers don't offer this.

You have a setting in the OS for the device where you put a birth date (or any date close enough to your age) and that information stays local to your device. Then when a piece of software or a website asks \"are you over x age?\" The device says yes/no without communicating personal information.  \n\nIt puts the responsibility on parents to set up their kids devices properly and not grant them any admin privileges, and if you're an adult you can just put in any information that registers as over 18. It also helps protect kids because it can age gate people over a certain age from spaces, and if you try to put yourself in a lower age bracket in this system then that becomes pretty suspicious. And it doesn't create any undue burdens on software developers or people who host web content. In theory it can be used to curate individual users experiences on news, entertainment, and social media sites because individual page elements can be age gated. It creates a frame work where the served up software can say \"this is mature content\" and the operating system can say \"I'm not allowed to view mature content\" and the served up software can say \"okied dokie, not displayed\" and the user doesn't have to do anything.",

It's an open source software and you can self-host it, the main developers are from the United Kingdom and Canada. Meanwhile Discord is a closed source app confirmed owned by the US *and* the Chinese.

It worked really well and there just wasn't anything like it, and it was much more tightly focused on providing cross platform text and voice chat and that was about it.\n\nNow it's gotten extremely bloated and I don't think it knows what it's supposed to be, and using it has turned into a very strange experience - I would venture it was never really designed to be a forum hosting platform and people have kind of shoehorned it into that role. Also there SO much porn, I'm not really that surprised they're doing age verification because giving pornography to kids is a crime in a lot of places",

In short, I went with wall powered, but WiFi cams tied into a HomeHub Pro recording box (think like a NAS) doing 24/7 recording with specific notification triggers. More or less, open up the box, download the app, scan the QR code, plug into the HomeHub to connect, then go physically install it.\n\nLike any other camera system, it can take a little tweaking for certain difficult situations on the notification side (I have a busy street and sidewalk in front), but it's doable.\n\nTo view the footage, I have opened up the HomeHub to my home network so I can view it remotely via the app, or I can view it on my desktop/laptop at home.\n\nTake a look. I found that LifeHackster provides a decent overview of a lot of cameras: https://m.youtube.com/@LifeHackster\n\nThat said, I also considered Eufy at the time, but the deals and camera styles from ReoLink generally fit better for what I wanted. ",

Those can be digitally bypassed/opened and there’s usually some moderate-to-major physical security flaws somewhere too. Surveillance cameras? They don’t usually upload any footage if they can’t connect to anything, so if I have even a moderate grade multi-channel jammer with a 100 ft range? That’s pretty much bypassed if I then decide to disable it physically. \n\nIt’s as simple as **ONE** vulnerability or weak password in something as simple as a “smart” lightbulb, that then has the potential to reveal or compromise all other devices on a network.

My examples are what I use and have setup for friends and family for years. You can get remote access many ways that exclude anyone but you from accessing.\n\nI chose Reolink because I did not want to be forced to use an app to connect or have to use a products app to view. I used both Foscams and Amcrest cams until they made it nearly impossible to view or setup without using a proprietary app. Now most of the cams will \"phone home\" many times, hence the reason for a separate IoT vlan. If your router does not have that ability, look into setting up pi-hole, a fantastic full house ad/popup blocker, of course open source. I know it can be overwhelming if you're not into the tech, but to make it easier there are plenty of good sites that will walk you through setting this up and chatgpt or claude can be invaluable. Or head over to r/selfhosted or r/pihole subs.",

As time goes on it is the Database it builds that becomes increasingly a threat to personal rights. I feel bad for those people that don’t maturely make their own inquiries to see that this is very real. Abuses & violations of individual rights are happening almost daily. You just have to be brave and research it or continue living with your head in the sand. It wont be long til someone comes along and smacks you in your ass.\n\nI’ll give you a head start:\n\nhttps://www.wjfw.com/news/flock-safety-faces-privacy-concerns-cancelled-contracts-across-u-s/article_a9671d6e-014d-4c4c-b726-cd5be21a037e.html\n\nSummary Flock Safety, a company operating tens of thousands of surveillance cameras across the U.S., faces privacy concerns and contract cancellations. Critics argue the company’s AI-powered cameras infringe on privacy rights and lack public consent, while security flaws and unauthorized use have raised further concerns. Despite these issues, some law enforcement agencies continue to support their contracts with Flock Safety.\n\nhttps://www.blackrosefed.org/benn-jordan-interview/\n\nSummary Benn Jordan, a musician and audio engineer, discusses his interest in surveillance technologies, sparked by the prevalence of Flock Safety cameras in Atlanta. He highlights vulnerabilities in Flock’s systems, including unprotected Android devices and potential for misuse. Jordan advocates for privacy practices like lying online and resisting data collection, and emphasizes the importance of DIY projects to empower individuals and foster innovation.\n\nExcerpt: There are a lot of vulnerabilities. I believe over 70 at this point. In my opinion, the most concerning one is that the cameras and compute boxes are unprotected Android devices. I could push a button 3 times on a Falcon and it’ll give me a WiFi access point to connect to. From there, it takes a matter of seconds to infiltrate the device to access the video footage, data, and even some of the server credentials. What’s much worse is that I can “root” the device, which means that I can have control of it outside of the operating system.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/video/2026/01/06/staunton-resident-files-petition-ordinance-banning-license-plate-readers/\n\nSTAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - After the City of Staunton announced its’s canceling its contract with Flock Safety, the company behind the license-plate–reading software that popped up over the last year, some residents rejoiced, but others in the Queen City said more still needs to be done.\n\nLastly, Here’s an Ai internet scrape of examples:\n\nInvestigations by privacy advocacy groups and news organizations in 2025 and early 2026 have exposed multiple instances of law enforcement misusing the Flock Safety camera system, which operates a vast network of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) across the United States. Here are examples of articles and reports exposing these abuses, categorized by type of misuse:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Surveillance Related to Reproductive Rights and Abortion \"A Texas Cop Searched License Plate Cameras Nationwide for a...\" (Truthout/404 Media): This report detailed how a Johnson County, Texas, deputy used the Flock system to conduct a nationwide search, logging the reason as \"had an abortion, search for female\". The investigation highlighted how cross-state data sharing puts abortion seekers at risk. \"Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose...\" (University of Washington Human Rights Center): This analysis discussed how Texas law enforcement tracked a woman who had self-administered an abortion, with data generated by Flock networks in Washington state.\n2.\t⁠⁠Personal Stalking and Harassment by Officers \"Georgia police chief, arrested for using Flock cameras for stalking...\" (Lookout): This article reports on the arrest of a Braselton, Georgia, police chief for allegedly using the city's Flock cameras to stalk and harass private citizens.\n\n\"Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says\" (NBC News): This article highlights a lawsuit regarding a Virginia police department using the system to track a specific driver hundreds of times.\n\n\"Wisconsin Case Exposes Misuse of Flock Traffic Cameras by Police Officers\" (Yahoo News/Wisconsin Examiner): A Menasha police officer was charged with misconduct in office for using the department's Flock system to search for vehicles belonging to a private individual.\n\n\"Police Surveillance is Ripe for Abuse\" (ACLU of Wisconsin): Reports on a former Kansas police chief who used cameras to track his ex-girlfriend 228 times and a North Charleston officer who used them to track his estranged wife.\n\n3. Biased Policing and Profiling \"EFF's Investigations Expose Flock Safety's Surveillance Abuses: 2025 in Review\" (Electronic Frontier Foundation): An analysis found that over 80 law enforcement agencies used the Flock network to conduct searches using racial slurs and biased language, targeting the Romani community without evidence of specific crimes.\n\n\"Flock Enables Surveillance of Protesters\" (EFF): The same report documents how law enforcement used the system to track participants in various political demonstrations.\n\n4. Unauthorized Data Sharing and Immigration \"Flock's Aggressive Expansions Go Far Beyond Simple Driver Surveillance\" (ACLU): This article exposes how local law enforcement has used Flock data to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in immigration enforcement, violating sanctuary policies in some regions.\n\n\"Mountain View, California, pulled the plug on its entire license plate reader camera network\" (Malwarebytes): Following investigations, this report details how Flock cameras were sharing data with federal agencies without the city's permission.\n\n5. Inaccurate Investigations and Privacy Risks \"Public Interest Law Firm Responds to Flock Safety Pausing Federal...\" (Institute for Justice): This article discusses a federal lawsuit against Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the use of Flock cameras, noting that the system captured, \"photos of an innocent family's driveway and part of their front yard every time a vehicle drove by\".\n\nThese reports have led to nearly 30 jurisdictions cancelling or refusing to renew their Flock Safety contracts in 2025–2026, citing privacy violations, surveillance overreach, and illegal data sharing.",

Now I wouldn't be surprised if most do not even remember they exist.\n\nAnd for most part those who would make either just end up making a mobile app now, which is kind of extreme overkill for simpler stuff and often killed by monetization of what once would have been free.\n___\n\nIt feels like game modding has somewhat died too, so few newer games support it and they are to complex and/or locked down for people to mod without that support.\n\nAnd considering how many devs, and even entire successful studios and some of the most profitable games to exist, got their start with game modding that is a bad thing for the industry. You would think they would want to support such a great headhunting tool and one that GUARANTEES long term sales producing infinite content for free but nope.\n\nHopefully Slay The Spire 2 has half the modding community of 1 when it comes out next month, IIRC the devs plan to make it easier to mod than the first.",

They really push any sort of AI tooling that Devs think are useful, most had cursor as their IDE but these tickets were bug heavy,  light on AC so it was difficult for me to tell (and get answers) if features were working as intended.\n\n\n11pm finishes/7am starts were commonplace and apparently had been for a while. Sales were basically telling prospective customers \"we don't have the ability to do this now, but we will in a week!\" which led to so much short notice shit my brain was pickled trying to get myself up to speed properly as well as deliver all this crap 'at pace' I just threw in the towel and I'm going back to my old job next week. They then gained those customers so of course why wouldn't they continue making those kinds of statements and have those kinds of expectations? \n\n\nQA there were ignored for the most part, I had a hell of a time getting anything out of product owners/developers, not because they didn't like me (I don't think) but because they were so damn busy all the time. I'd be midway through testing something to be told it was getting merged and released to prod and any issues could be picked up post release.\n\n\nIt was my first experience of a company that leveraged AI tooling across all aspects of the business, it was horrendous. \n\n\nWith the increases in productivity coming I'm a bit worried the old 1:4 QA to dev ratio is just going to get blown out the water ",

That may sound like a win, but it’s not quite so simple. These changes can be unsustainable, leading to workload creep, cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making. The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\n\n...and then thought, \"Maybe burnout causes AI usage\"?",

The study this article is based on only looked at 200 people at a single tech firm, hardly a representative sample of the global workforce.\n\nIf you read between the lines, the “burnout” isn't coming from the AI itself it’s coming from people voluntarily overworking because the barrier to entry for tasks has dropped. Just because an AI makes it possible for a PM to start doing engineering work during their lunch break doesn't mean they should. We're seeing the typical early adopter frenzy where everyone thinks they need to be doing 10x the work just because it's technically possible.\n\n\nBurnout happens when management expects 10x output for the same pay, or when workers don't have the discipline to log off. Blaming the software for “intensifying” work is like blaming a faster car for a driver’s speeding ticket. We need better boundaries not fewer tools but people will only read the headline and think this is yet another “AI bad” situation.",

My job (the siren of coffee land) implemented a new “AI assisted” app that was going to save us soooooooo much time and increase our accuracy on our bi weekly inventory count by….. using the iPad camera. \nNow, in order to use it we had to change the way items are stored back of house and, consequently also the way we go about putting away daily orders.  \nEverything has to be unboxed, facing a specific direction, neatly aligned with an additional label clipped to the shelf in front of that product- if youve ever worked in a cafe or fast food environment, or hell any kind of stock room, you can probably already guess this is an extremely inefficient use of space. \n\nSo we do all that, tell the app the measurements yadayada everythings in place. \nOpen the app, point the camera and little floating AR numbers pop up overlaying the item its “counting” aaaand guess what!  it’s literally always wrong. So now I have to not only just take inventory by counting it myself (the old fashioned way, have to go thru and edit everywhere it’s inaccurate in a clunky ass interface that makes no sense. \nWanna guess how much time it saves me? \n\nSorry this turned into a much needed rant but I’m the inventory guy at my store so it’s always me. \nI hate it, just let me do my low/no tech job in peace please.",

There's a natural rhythm of intensity and relaxation in the professional coding cycle. One gets \"in the zone\", and codes like a maniac, and then into a phase of consolidation and thougthful review.\n\nCoding with AI is like working with the worlds most knowledgeable and fast working amateur, junior dev. My job is to know what we're trying to do, to express it in a way the AI can successfully operate with, Understanding how the current results differ from the desired ones (which includes testing and code review), and the time to iterate. And as we all know, LLMs are \"sticky\", and particularly by asking leading questions at the end of any task: \"Do you want me to <various suggestions about what it could do next>\". \n\nThis tends to keep one in active mode. There is no downtime to think, unless you are disciplined enough. The constant prompting tends to erode that.\n\nAnd FWIW, despite being specifically for coding, Claude falls into the same problematic ruts that every AI I've tried using for real work  does - once it gets something wrong, it then will \"loop\", when you point it out. It'll undo the change, resulting in the return of the prior problem, which it will \"solve\" in exactly the same failed way. I've let it go through three complete iterations of this to verify it won't break out on its own. I have to point out it already tried something, which is very strange, since it's own output becomes a part of the context it keeps so there *can* be a \"conversation\". You'd think looping would be something the AI would notice, but none do, and that's across 5 major LLM offerings.\n\nAll this adds up to non-stop work. This type of work has been extensively studied and written about, and anybody who thinks they are a resource manager should know about things like \"critical chain\", in which slack time refers to the amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the project's overall timeline, which is managed through buffers to ensure timely project completion. Slack time is consideered absolutely necessary, as they've shown throughput (the actual amount produced) *decreases* without slack time, sometimes catastrophically.\n\nUnfortunately, some managers will think \"non-stop work\" sounds like a dream for their stats. They're going to be very confused, disappointed, even angry when the opposite occurs.",

Faster output → higher expectations → less recovery time. Rinse, repeat.\n\nA few patterns I keep seeing with early adopters:\n\n* **Cognitive overload**: juggling prompts, tools, workflows, and constant context-switching\n* **Identity pressure**: “If I’m not using this well, I’m falling behind”\n* **Invisible labor**: experimenting, refining, validating AI output—work that doesn’t always count on paper\n* **Acceleration guilt**: when you *can* do more, resting starts to feel unjustified\n\nIronically, the people most resistant to burnout are often the ones using AI *selectively*—as a boundary, not a badge. They automate the boring stuff, then stop. No constant optimization spiral.\n\nThere’s a weird lesson hiding here:  \nBurnout isn’t about tools. It’s about **who feels obligated to extract maximum value from them**.\n\nIf you want, we can unpack what “healthy AI usage” actually looks like in practice—because it’s way less impressive than Twitter makes it sound, and way more sustainable.",

It’s fundamental: employees are *tools* “employed” for some task; the dehumanization is *built-in*. AI is appealing to capitalism simply because $30k of computation is necessarily cheaper than $50k or whatever of Bob.\n\nCapitalism is a fucking paperclip maximizer, and we’re hitting the point where it stops working well as an engine for economic growth because there *is* no more growth to wring out of the system much of the time. We’re spinning our wheels with a “once-in-a-lifetime” market busts every damn decade because the system is repeatedly crashing up against bounds that should be common sense.\n\nSociety needs a priority shift, and the priority should be to improve the plight of the least among us. We have the resources to give everyone the option of a free basic home, free nutritious, basic food, free basic clothing and such fit for the climate, and free healthcare (among other things). We just allocate these resources awfully because some people are very, very good at playing social games that give them power and money. We should be investing in society.

This then leads to me being overwhelmed with options, spending more time reading back through the answers.

Even when it doesn't make obvious mistakes, it can still do things in ways that will cause issues later, or hide problems.\n\nEspecially since if anything it's gotten much worse about being sycophantic. ChatGPT is especially bad - it _constantly_ says something is a \"known issue\" or that \"this is exactly why\" about things it's completely wrong about or that should be presented as unlikely shots in the dark.\n\nThey're also still quite bad at citing information if you actually click through to the links given - I'd say something like 75-80% of the time the link doesn't support what its attached to (or is just outright broken).",

But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called [QuitGPT](https://quitgpt.org/). \n\n>The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January. \n\n>For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.\n\n>QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions.",

Having Custom Instructions (and having them be much bigger than ChatGPTs) is really useful to me.\n\nCustom Gems are good, too. I know ChatGPT can do something similar, but being able to easily make a \"VentBot\", a \"WorkBot\", a \"OrganiserBot\" etc, and have them all on the screen, at the ready whenever I need, just generally makes my work much easier to accomplish.\n\nI've also found that the current free version of ChatGPT is incredibly poor... I did a comparison for the free versions of Gemini and ChatGPT and gave them both a PDF to read. GPT hallucinated like half of it. Was ridiculous. Gemini was MUCH better in this regard.\n\nLastly, the ChatGPT desktop app is horrendous... it crashes regularly, stops getting proper responses, and is terribly organised.\n\nSo yeah, Gemini isn't perfect, but it's suiting me better than ChatGPT, and I'm happier than I was paying for it than GPT. And with ads coming for ChatGPT, it feels like OpenAI is on their way out...",

That’s a recipe for disaster. If they want a better public image they need to keep their side of the street clean, as the saying goes.\n\nThe history of border patrol has an era where they brought on way to many people way to fast, did little to no background checks or training, and sent them out into the world with a new gun and badge to round people up. Countless rights violations and crimes ended up being committed (eg, murders, rapes, using detainees for sex (aka rape), drug dealing, etc). [This is a good episode about all of that](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-the-us-border-patrol-69755319/), there’s a part 2 as well.\n\nYou’d hope dhs would look at this dark history as a lesson, and do whatever they need to do so that they didn’t make the same mistakes again with ice. Even moderate people that support detaining or even deporting felons that are here illegally look at these lapses in background checks and training as an issue, and anyone that knows how this turned out in the past can see it increases the chances of problems in the future.",

[Communities with increases in immigration tend to see decreases in crime.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/debunking-myth-immigrants-and-crime/) [Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they receive in benefits.](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/immigrants-pay-taxes-benefits-study/3973064/?amp=1) And there have been studies showing that [immigrants boost the economy overall.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy).\n\nSo, even if there was a magic button you could press to make all the immigrants, or all the illegal immigrants, go home, without hurting anyone in the process, it would actually make our country poorer and more dangerous to live in, rather than safer and richer.\n\nBut there isn’t a magic button to do that, and ICE’s enforcement actions are hurting and sometimes even killing, not just immigrants, but US citizens as well.  Renee Good and Alex Pretti were both US citizens who ICE murdered on the street during “enforcement operations”, Keith Porter was a US citizen killed by an off-duty ICE officer, and 6 people have died in ICE facilities in 2026 alone: Heber Sanchaz Domínguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, and Geraldo Lunas Campos all died, or in some cases, were murdered, while in ICE custody.\n\nSo if you are a DHS agent or ICE agent reading this, whether you’re spying on me because I criticized the king, or whether you just happen to be on reddit, please resign.  Start looking for work elsewhere.  They are going to ask you to do horrible things, to follow orders that are blatantly illegal, and it is going to be a lot harder for you to defy them than you think it will be.

The problem exists only when you turn your attention to social media and that's a problem that you can easily fix.\n\nThe same shift happened when printed press became available to the masses and propaganda ended up being rampant.

No matter how much they'd try, tech bros cannot replace real life with AI slop. And let's face it, we're not getting manual labor robots that can do work cheaper than a poorly paid human. Human greed is the ultimate barrier against IRL AI slop because robots will forever be more expensive to create and maintain than humans.\n\nWe just have to touch more grass and scroll less social media in order to win the fight against AI slop. :)",

Obviously some people are overhyping current capabilities for money.\n\n\n\n\nBut for many of these people I'd imagine the reasons we are in danger are completely obvious and don't need to be explained. I say this because I am not an AI researcher but the risks are inherently obvious to me. \n\n\nSometimes I'll talk to people in my IRL social circle about the dangers of AI. What I generally do now is tell them my risk concerns, ask their perspective on that, usually it's \"I can't see that happening\". \n\n\nThen I'll ask them a series of questions, ask them to explain their answers in their words. Sometimes asking them to recap and synthesize multiple answers. Eventually we get to a point where I say, now do you understand what I'm saying better? \n\n\nUsually I get back, \"yeah I do get it more now\". But  mistakenly believing they are illequipped to do anything about it the next idea is usually, I hope some does something. ",

              "text": "This is more futurology, but one aspect of advanced AI is that it can assist researchers toward any ends. Optimistically they'll be used for positive ends, but it's obvious that they have dual-use capabilities.\n\nSoftware security is one of the first areas often mentioned. Given the compute one can use multiple AI tools to [search for vulnerabilities](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/google-says-its-ai-based-bug-hunter-found-20-security-vulnerabilities/). It's not clear to what extent this could cause actual harm (other than basic financial losses). Ideally it's used to find and report vulnerabilities and that's probably what we'll see.\n\nMedical/biological R&D is another, it's often framed as being mostly positive. Bioinformatics is still a relatively young field and lacks the data, so this danger is potentially closer to the 2060s. We're already seeing [fine-tuned medical AIs](https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/) and are aware of [dual-use software](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-drug-discovery-systems-might-be-repurposed-to-make-chemical-weapons-researchers-warn/). I'd generally put this high up the list of potential dangers as this will be more approachable for small labs (or countries) that had ill-intentions.\n\nLastly another area mentioned is just general bot misinformation/scams/etc. We've seen in many communities that people can become attached to LLMs and are somewhat easily influenced by them. It's still so early that the effect of this is not clear. (It could be transient in that newer generations build mental barriers that protect them. Even wide-scale public service announcements could thwart a lot of these dangers). When image/video/voice is flawless and real-time we can probably get a better idea to the extent of the harm and who it affects.\n\nI will point out that in my opinion it's largely impossible to change the pace of this or \"slow down\". Given the compute, multiple discovery tells us that researchers will largely advance the technologies. There are drastic steps one could take, but they aren't really feasible.",

According to a report published in May by Sharma’s team, the Safeguards Research Team had focused on researching and developing safeguards against actors using an AI chatbot to seek guidance on how to conduct malicious activities.”\n\n“According to a study Sharma published last week, in which he investigated how using AI chatbots could cause users to form a distorted perception of reality, he found “thousands” of these interactions that may produce these distortions “occur daily.” Severe instances of distorted perceptions of reality, which Sharma refers to as disempowerment patterns, are rare, but rates are higher regarding topics like relationships and wellness. Sharma said his findings “highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”",

Our adversaries already knew full well that the primary impact of social media in the long term was the destruction pf the global order and resurgence of authoritarianism. Ai would predictably cause an exponential level of disruption to society with the potential of toppling the United States.\n- Elon's sattelite launches via Spacex\n- Elon's Starlink\n- The Butler assassination attempt theatrics in 2024\n- The list goes on. The objective of Trump's allies remained the same.\n\nKeep in mind that if Trump has been under blackmail by America's adversaries since before 2016, he has been a traitor for that entire time. That would have made his loss in the 2020 election a devastating blow to the strides America's adversaries made to get him into office for his 2016 term. They would have been willing to do anything and everything to return him to office in 2024, and they certainly wouldn't have paused their efforts simply because Biden was President.

John Brown Gun Club and whatnot.  \n  \n/jk for indemnification",

They're quite inspiring, seeing how some actions worked and where things go wrong, and conjures up questions like \"If it or similar were to take place now, how would it be adapted, in addition to taking modern technology into account?\" \nI'd like to share them here. Why? No particular reason, but watch them if you can:\n- Army of Crime (2011)\n- Defiance (2008)\n- Edelweiss Pirates (2004)\n- Deacons for Defense (2003)\n- Free State of Jones (2016)\n- The 24th (2020)\n- Matewan (1987)\n- An American Story (1992)\n- Michael Collins (1996)",

More representatives from a single state would be a huge advantage because they'd be from certain areas of the state itself and know what's going on in their part of the state.

We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully we can all get to a better draft.\n    \n    We'll keep fighting for all Americans and for economic freedom. Crypto needs to be treated on a level playing field with the rest of financial services so we can build this industry in a safe and trusted way in America.\n\nAs others have stated, its actually banks who are exerting control over Congress to retain their monopoly over the U.S. financial system. Regardless of your opinion on crypto, BTC and Defi represent an existential threat to the bank's control over how money moves and the profits they siphon off the top.

If you buy Bitcoin at a legitimate exchange, they keep it in cold, air-gapped storage and don't lend it back out for more yield. The price of Bitcoin might plummet but you should always be able to withdraw your BTC. Of course, good regulations to ensure reserve audits and transparency to be able to function as a crypto exchange is necessary to work well, because inevitably exchanges like FTX will exist. ",

More USDC on their platform is better for their marketplace.\n\nSecond of all, offering a competing rate to deposits on USDC helps improve adoption, something CB needs. Think of it as a customer acquisition cost. They are paying the customer to steal their business away from the banks. \n\nStable coin adoption boosts the crypto market, which takes market share away from the banks. The stable coin reward is the price these exchanges, the alternatives to the traditional bank, pay to acquire these customers. \n\nIn the end, CB will be loaning out these deposits to customers wishing to take on debt. At that point, we will have a bona fide competitor to legacy financial systems. And that, is good for all of us. ",

If you knew the full details you would be on Coinbases side who are essentially on the average citizens side. Big banks are trying to reverse a part of the Genuis act legislation that allows stablecoin intermediares like Coinbase to pay rewards (akin to interest rates). These are much bigger than what banks pay who pay virtually zero interest to customers on deposits in current accounts. In the instances the bank gets 5.5% interest on your deposits, you get zero. Contrastingly Coinbase gets 2%, you get 3.5%. \n\nBanks are then coming up with a variety of BS reasons to fight and outlaw this in the Clarity act, which can all be disproved for various reasons, like deposits fleeing, like them having more rigorous regulation that neo and crypto banks don't need. E.g stablecoins are fully backed by 1-1 collateral to infinity. Bank deposits are imaginary money not backed by anything, other than a limited loss to say 100k, and are lent out and used by banks without customers agreement to do any activity they wish, thus why regulation is higher.",

Oh sure, people make money playing stock market with it, but its value in trading is contingent on its usefulness. The crypto market is already 90% bubble, and regulating it tightly makes it 100% pure unfiltered bubble, and an unstable one at that. \n\nThis is like bull fighting arenas banning bulls from fighting and then everyone is upset that they made a new rule that the capes have to be green instead of red.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between crypto industry interests and regulatory policy. If Bessent is claiming Coinbase is \"blocking\" legislation, we're likely talking about lobbying efforts against stricter crypto regulations or reporting requirements. Coinbase has been pretty vocal about wanting regulatory clarity, but on *their* terms - they've spent millions on lobbying and have been pushing back against things like expanded IRS reporting rules and stricter KYC requirements that traditional financial institutions have dealt with for decades.\n\nThe irony here is that Coinbase has simultaneously positioned itself as the \"compliant\" exchange that wants to work with regulators, while also fighting tooth and nail against regulations that would actually bring them in line with traditional finance. They want the legitimacy and institutional trust that comes with regulatory compliance, but not the actual compliance costs and operational constraints. Treasury's frustration probably stems from Coinbase's significant lobbying power - they've got the resources to influence lawmakers in ways that can genuinely stall legislation, especially on technical topics where most legislators don't have deep expertise.\n\nWhat's really at stake here is whether crypto exchanges should be treated more like banks (with all the consumer protections, reporting requirements, and oversight that entails) or remain in this quasi-regulated space they currently occupy. Coinbase's argument is probably that overregulation will stifle innovation and push crypto businesses offshore, while Treasury's perspective is likely that without proper oversight, we're creating systemic risks and enabling illicit finance. Both sides have valid points, but the \"blocking legislation\" framing suggests Treasury thinks Coinbase is being obstructionist rather than constructively engaged.",
