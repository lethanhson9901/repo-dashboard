The programming varies in tone and quality, but its breadth is vast: It’s viewed in more than 100 countries in 61 languages. The topics covered include human rights abuses in Iran, self-immolation in Tibet, human trafficking across Asia, and on-the-ground reporting in Egypt and Iraq.\n\n> The restriction of these broadcasts was due to the Smith-Mundt Act, a long-standing piece of legislation that has been amended numerous times over the years, perhaps most consequentially by Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. In the 1970s, Fulbright was no friend of VOA and Radio Free Europe, and moved to restrict them from domestic distribution, saying they \"should be given the opportunity to take their rightful place in the graveyard of Cold War relics.\" Fulbright’s amendment to Smith-Mundt was bolstered in 1985 by Nebraska Senator Edward Zorinsky, who argued that **such \"propaganda\" should be kept out of America as to distinguish the U.S. \"from the Soviet Union where domestic propaganda is a principal government activity.\"**\n\nThis is what then allowed [those guys](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) to also work domestically on US audiences;\n\n> Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media\n\n> Military's 'sock puppet' software creates fake online identities to spread pro-American propaganda\n\n> Centcom spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: \"The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable Centcom to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.\"\n\n> He said none of the interventions would be in English, **as it would be unlawful to \"address US audiences\" with such technology**, and any English-language use of social media by Centcom was always clearly attributed. The languages in which the interventions are conducted include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Pashto.\n\nIt stopped being unlawful only 2 years later, since then [Eglin has been known as the most Reddit addicted city](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/z6unyl/in_2013_reddit_admins_did_an_oopsywhoopsy_and/), oopsy..",

There is no evidence that they are actually able to track lost dogs but the fact that they have the data and technology to possibly implement it and are willing to market the product shows their hand a bit too much.

Then they changed the laws so no one needed to babysit the van.  \n\nGame on.\n\nIf Canadians know to do one thing right, it's arson. After the locals torched a dozen vans, the government decided it needed to 'read the room' and it got rid of photo radar .\n\n2 decades later they did bring back some photo radar at traffic lights, but it has signage, it is in a fixed location and it seems to be set around 19kph over the limit. Waze and Google maps reminds me before I drive through them. It's a non issue. If you are doing 20 over through an intersection you deserve what you get. \n\nThe moral of the story?

I wouldn’t be surprised if cities were using those to watch the bigger ones. They wouldn’t be that good for identification, but they would be able to see when the camera went offline and which direction the people came from and left in and if they used cars, bikes, skateboards, etc… Obviously checking for what phones were in that area would be the first step. But, assuming you took all precautions, just knowing how many people of approximate height and my details about them would be used by other cameras. In some cities, you can’t walk or drive through without being picked up on dozens of cameras, so you need to avoid being spotted by any others than the one you disabled, especially if you’re carrying something in a bag or knapsack. \n\nA better idea would be for everyone to dress in identical clothing and masks with same shoe slightly higher than the other and be all over the city at the same time and then ditch the outfits out of sight of any cameras. At some point, we’ll all be screwed and only drones could take them out if they didn’t take the drone out first.",

After doing a little research, I actually dug up the town meeting minutes where they were approved, and the whole process was shocking. I personally despise these automatic license plate readers and don't think they should ever be in the hands of private corporations.\n​In our local meeting, a resident literally stood up and asked if the federal government would have access to the surveillance which this ICE news proves was a completely justified fear. But the board basically brushed it off and voted to spend over $14k on the initial setup anyway, passing it 6-1. When an Alderman asked about the huge liability of a data breach, they shrugged and said Flock is solely responsible.\n​It's crazy because anyone could theoretically pay a fee to access this data for stalking or other real crimes. Towns and citizens really need to stand up for their rights and not just shrug off these massive privacy concerns. The EFF needs to get involved.",

While about two-thirds of executives reported using AI, that usage amounted to only about 1.5 hours per week, and 25% of respondents reported not using AI in the workplace at all. Nearly 90% of firms said AI has had no impact on employment or productivity over the last three years, the research noted.\n\n^ The most interesting paragraph, I thought.",

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation. \n\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w34836",

Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware. It forces software developers to stop assuming every increasing hardware capability can makeup for sloppy and inefficient code -- forces us to actually go back and optimize things.",

Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.\n\nLOL, I just LOVE that they make the connection to 1987 and folks wondering why the computer revolution hadn't happened yet.  We humans always expect change to be this dramatic thing, same as now with articles about AI replacing all jobs by the end of 2024.  LOL.  That's not how new technology rolls out.

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term. CBS thinks it can slip in and get some oarks (or avoid some penalties) by cozying up to the ghouls in power, because they assume none of us will care or remember in the long term. \n\nI hope we all make them eat that arrogantm unamerican assumption; but I fear that we won’t. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8x1oSGb/",

In practice, over the years talk show interviews became pretty much exempted by default.

If a station gives airtime to one candidate, then they must offer comparable time to other candidates competing in a given contest.\n\nEqual time also only applies to broadcast television and radio. So pieces on cable, streaming services or social media aren’t included.\n\nBut recently, the FCC changed the rules to also include talk shows that do political interviews. Which is why the lawyers advised him not to do this. But he did it anyway.\n\nIt's a great big political pissing contest, and he got away with it.",

Sometimes quite literally to the detriment of the outcomes they are meant to be pursuing. \n\nIn this case, it’s probably seen as much easier for the teachers to hand out work, grade work, track usage, etc. with very little thought to how it actually impacts a child’s ability to learn. \n\nI’ll give you a good example I just ran into. I had a home remodeling client that hired us to fix their inbound lead problem. After going through the whole process I identified that the system they were using for inbound leads was designed in such a way that it deterred customers from using it. We’d run ads, social media, you name it and find that people would hit this one particular page, but never actually complete the process. The problem stemmed from asking way too much of a potential lead, basically they wanted all the information needed to produce a quote. In theory this seemed fine, but in practice most people were overwhelmed or not knowledgeable enough to actually complete the lead form. \n\nSo I present these findings and their response was that it was a system designed by the person managing leads to be more convenient. She didn’t want to spend all the extra time interacting with potential customers to get the info needed to produce a quote. The real crazy part is that they never fixed the system and ended up needing to sell one of their commercial buildings to pay us and all the other people they hadn’t paid that year.",

PDFs are still expensive and through the same bullshit gatekeepers, the computers get damaged all the time because kids aren't being taught to be responsible with the stuff (or are too young to be expected to be), and upcoming generations are less computer literate so clearly it's not even helping there.\n\nSo once again something that imo had good potential behind it was ruined by scumbags who see education not as a social necessity but as yet another industry for pure profit with no concern for the actual quality of the education being provided.\n\nYou also of course then run into the issue of school funding in varying districts and the costs associated.",

The kids have ten times more books than I had when I was in peak graduate school. \n\nThey are rarely bored and when they are it doesn't last long. Kids need space to stretch their imagination and the engages all kinds of metacognitive skills. Outsourcing that to technology only makes sense if you're using this skills ELSEWHERE. But you don't want to raise children this way as they'll never develop them properly. \n\nI see more problems with motivation related to phone over usage than anything else in my practice. Across all ages. My main tips:\n\n\n1) use screen time, yes, you can circumvent it but it acts as a speed bump. Gives you time to reflect not just go into autopilot\n\n2) remove problematic apps (any social media that isn't connecting you to people IRL, Buh bye)\n\n3) delete short form video (TikTok and YouTube Shorts are the absolute worst)\n\n4) if you can't uninstall YouTube you can set shorts limits in the settings\n\n5) move apps around and hide them in folders if you don't want to uninstall. Again we're trying to slow you down to give you a chance to ask \"what do I really want/need right now?\"\n\n6) desaturate the color on your phone (go to accessibility options and turn on gray scale filter--don't go full B&W just dull the colors to the point where it feels bland but not garish)\n\n7) remove all mobile games from phone. These will never be more GENUINELY satisfying than a real video game. Just play on the switch/PC/PS etc. They're not designed for fun. You're not having actual fun. You're just experiencing boredom with delayed micro gratification. Once you see this is how mobile games work you can't unsee and they'll lose their luster very fast but only if you provide a higher quality alternative. It's like eating shitty strawberry candy for years and then eating a real strawberry for the first time in forever. \n\n8) if it's your kid you're worried about, walk them through it! Don't just lock things down and not explain it to them. They need to understand every human struggles with this including you and that there's a process for healthier behavior. \n",

I first heard that quote twenty years ago from a computer scientist at Stanford who was addressing a room full of colleagues—all highly educated, technically proficient, motivated experts who well understood the import of McLuhan’s warning and who probably thought about it often, as I have done, whenever they subsequently adopted some new labor-saving technology. Today, quite suddenly, billions of people have access to AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow conversations among professional educators who all report the same phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and in consequence learn nothing. We may end up with at least one generation of people who are like the Eloi in H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine, in that they are mental weaklings utterly dependent on technologies that they don’t understand and that they could never rebuild from scratch were they to break down. Earlier I spoke somewhat derisively of lapdogs. We might ask ourselves who is really the lapdog in a world full of powerful AIs.\n\n> To me this seems like a downside of AI that is easy to understand, easy to measure, with immediate effects, that could be counteracted tomorrow through simple interventions such as requiring students to take examinations in supervised classrooms, writing answers out by hand on blank paper. We know this is possible because it’s how all examinations used to be taken. No new technology is required, nothing stands in the way of implementation other than institutional inertia, and, I’m afraid, the unwillingness of parents to see their children seriously challenged. In the scenario I mentioned before, where humans become part of a stable but competitive ecosystem populated by intelligences of various kinds, one thing we humans must do is become fit competitors ourselves. And when the competition is in the realm of intelligence, that means preserving and advancing our own intelligence by holding at arms length seductive augmentations in order to avoid suffering the amputations that are their price.\n\n> Neal Stephenson – Remarks on AI from NZ\n\nWe must turn everything off from time to time and instead read, ponder, and memorize the ideas of those who came before us; especially those who came centuries, or even millennia, before us. \n\n> Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind.\n\n> Frank Herbert, The Orange Catholic Bible, *Dune*,",

Why are you filling your head with dune and Reddit when you should be memorizing the Iliad... Oh because remembering a whole book would give you zero benefit but learning lots of different books which you can reference back is much more useful? Huh. \n\nThe only advantage the illiterate have is they won't read the book 'this fantasy world is horrible for everyone' and start preaching the religion used to make that fantasy world horrible. \n\nThe only slightly less deranged colonialist guy that's part of a breeding program from powerful families who treat people as property kills billions upon billions of people then his incest descendent turns into a worm physically to kill even more people (via poverty not worn attacks) as a metaphor for how humanity hasn't evolved (the famous 'and much of you is still worm' from nietzsche, and yes Paul exists to criticize religion which is why jrr who was going the same' current time drama time displacement' thing but pushing a pro Christian ethos was so mad about it, hobbits are innocent people who win always because faith and magic while for Herbert those things are only used to destroy and control\n\nUsing the religion he very very explicitly created to cause social problems in his fantasy horror as a 'look at me I'm so clever to believe this also' is not a smart or sensible thing. \n\nAnd oh boy could we have a big chat about hg wells the time machine, I know you haven't read the story and certainly don't want to engage with hg wells actual beliefs about the topics involved (the racism, classism, etc he was sometimes against but also lived inside) but using it as 'this could happen' is like me warning the hungry hungry caterpillar could devour the planet if it keeps eating everything. The book is not a factual account of reality, had no concept of how evolution actually happens and is not intended to - like dune it's a social parable about the current situation in Europe (i.e. the inevitable colonial crawl to ww1,  and dune the post wars slide back towards colonialist ideology) \n\nPlease don't drag us back to being worms, or worse make us space worms - I don't want to be a laughing stock a thing of shame, I want to create something more then myself like all those people you mentioned actually did in their real lives, you know what plato was doing when matey was remembering every line of those books? He was devising the platonic forms, getting friendzoned and all the other stuff with his name on it today. \n\nYou seem to like human specialization carried to extremes and I'm not even going to tell you that it's evil child abuse, which it is, but if you want to live an aesthetic life then you can do that with AI, you can still dedicate your life to memorizing books, you can still sleep in the cold...\n\nThough your references all happen to be people who like eugenics / strict biological class division I'm going to assume that's just a coincidence but I will say that just like platon in Republic it's always the others who need to be treated like cattle and denied freedom because you don't want a simple life you want control - you see yourself as the quizat haderach rather then choosing to dwell in a cave, you want to control others and impose upon them horrors you avoid yourself.",

A scientist does not proclaim \"this is how the world *is*\" and expect their audience to trust unquestioningly; a scientist publishes their methodology, and ideally their data too, so that others can replicate their conclusions. The only place for absolutes is in the classroom, learning the foundational knowledge that's been well-tested-enough to be effectively true, and even there with the understanding that it's often a simplified/outdated model to help you build up to later lessons.\n\nBut the social media right's been taught to blanket-distrust science, while the social media left treats it as a religion that must not be questioned (not even in a quickly evolving area with conflicting statements and retractions everywhere. Once social media settles on a *particular* idea of truth, even scientists with different opinions are seen as secretly right-leaning and no-true-scotsmanned until they can be 'safely' ignored). Two suspiciously-opposite views, *almost* as if each group looks to the other and decides to be as different as possible. Neither properly scientific, as neither cares about the process by which things are found out, and both become utterly toxic when anyone doubts the group's deeply-held beliefs and wants to try replicating their methodology and data to see if that belief actually holds up. I'd reference examples that come to mind, but knowing this community, I already expect to get a negative score. Lets keep that low-single-digits negative rather than invite a brigade of zealots and drop into the negative hundreds.",

They do more reading at home and have more complex conversations in the home.  And they are better equipped to help children with their homework.  They also buy their kids more things, like books, making access easier.\n\nThey provide stability.  Like, moving house to house (apartment to apartment) less often.  Fewer school changes.  Steadier routines.  And often being in districts with more school funding.  And those school \"choices\" change who their peers are.  It sorta raises the bar to be around other kids whose parents fall in those same categories.\n\nAccess to healthcare and not being shorted on food really helps.  Making sure they have glasses, hearing checkups, ADHD evaluation and treatment, tutoring... that sort of stuff adds up.  I remember when we figured out that I needed glasses.  It changed my life.\n\nAnd even on the devices, there's stuff to say.  They have more money to control what the kids see and do.  Nanny software and the like.  They pay to have ad-free experiences.  Where lower income families get straight-up cheap dopamine internet experiences to a higher degree.\n\nI'm sure we could workshop this and come up with plenty more.

It used to be parents, if they needed a break for a few hours could shove their kid out the door and tell them to play outside. Then karens started calling to complain about those things. All it takes is one parent in your circle dealing with the hell of cps over letting their kids play unsupervised in their fenced in yard to aecond guess doing so yourself. \n\nYou need look no further than the multiple families who have gotten criminal charges  - not only the hell of cps but actual criminal charges- for letting their kid walk a mile to the store. One poor family is facing manslaughter charges because their kid got run over and killed in a crosswalk.  The driver that hit him, mind you, didnt even get a ticket.  \n\nThe further elimination of free third spaces, and free respite care in the form of family doesnt help. Parents dont have grandparents living nearby to go \"i need to clean the house, the kids want to 'help' but i really just need an hour of peace and quiet to get it done right\" like we used to - i remember a lot of hanging out with aunts and grandparents so my mom could get a break.  But at the same time, it was the 90s, and i was a laptop kid, because as a single mom who couldnt always find a sitter it was a way to keep me quiet when she had to go do something and had no choice but to bring me along ahe could park me in a corner with an old toshiba satellite her work had liquidated.  \n\nWhat free option do parents have now to get an hours peace and quiet from their kid so they can do grown up things like chores and scream into the void, and have a vent session about the ways parenting sucks out of earshot of the kids cause yeah, parenting sucks but you embrace the suck out of love for them and dont want them to get the wrong idea, you just need quiet.\n\n\nWe did this to ourselves",

They make teaching more lazy because rather than trying to explain a topic to help students understand better, the teacher can just say \"go watch this youtube video\" or \"go do this app lesson.\" Of course, either the student doesn't do it or just glares at the screen and not absorbing anything. Also, teaching software typically allows unlimited tries when doing problems, with no consequences for getting answers wrong, so kids would just blindly choose answers until they get the right one and end up learning nothing.",

          "text": "In 1950, 34.3% of Americans aged 25 and older were high school graduates, and 6.2% had a bachelor's.    \nBy 1970 it was ~55.2% high school and 11.0% bachelor's.   \n1980 it was ~68.6% high school and 17% bachelor's.   \n     \nIn 2020, 90.9% of Americans 25 or older had a high school diploma, and 37.5% had  bachelor's degree.\n   \nWithout any deeper analysis, we're the most educated we've ever been. \n   \nRealistically, we're in a weird place where the standards are simultaneously lower and higher than they've ever been.\n    \nIt used to be that a person could be barely literate, but still be able to provide for a family with one income.     \nNow, two college educated working adults can barely afford to make ends meet, let alone buy a house, raise 3 kids, or go on yearly vacations. \n   \nIn most of the 1900s, kids would just be held back if they couldn't do grade level coursework. Now we have \"no child left behind\", and kids get shuffled along despite not being able to read.  \n   \nBack in the 1920s, most physicists were unfamiliar with matrix math.  \nWhen Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics, his math was seen as strange (despite mathematicians already being familiar with matrices).\n   \nThese days, most high school students will have been exposed to more matrix math than the average theoretical physicist of 1920. \n   \nThe cutting edge stuff that earned PhDs and nobel prizes in 1900~1950 is now stuff that an undergraduate learns in upper division of a bachelor's degree.  \nEssentially every field of science is like that.  \n   \nA bachelor's of science covers a breadth of study that is almost unconscionable; it's truly problematic in that, because there's so much breadth that students no longer get depth into a subject, they never get the same grounding that older generations got when they could focus on a single theorem and develop intuition from first principles. Now, information is handed down from on high, and students are thrown into academic binge and purge cycles.   \nIn my entire time at University, we *never* really got through all the material in a course. Never. Not one single course did we ever hit a point where it was like \"that's all the material we had planned\", it was always \"that's as much as we could cram in, but we're 3 chapters behind; You'll just have to catch up in the next course.\"   \n   \nAnd the universities keep requiring so many units of general ed because of archaic pre 1900s ideals of what \"well rounded\" means, while simultaneously being too lazy to come up with meaningful courses that would cover culture and history in a way that would also supplement the understanding of mathematics, science, and technology.  \nSo every decade or two, the list of things a bachelor's of science degree needs to cover increases, but it still needs to be a \"4 year degree\".  \nFor my degree, Computer Engineering, the *average* graduation time was 5 years. The university standard was 180 units for a bachelor's, with a 216 unit \"cap\". I graduated with 278 units because they granted an \"exception\", but it was an exception that everyone with my degree gets, because it's literally not possible to do all the coursework in 216 units or less.  \n    \nThe whole education system is fucked, and seemingly no one with the power to change it, wants it changed.  \n   \nWhatever the problem is, tablets are just one small component of a bad system that's had problems for decades.  \nAcademia continues despite itself, through the sheer willpower of a handful of extremely dedicated people.",

Several factors go into why our students lack comprehension skills and critical thinking skills. \n\nLack of attention span thanks to social media and videos online. Factor in how so many kids go home and watch things or play games until late at night. They spend SO much time on a screen. \n\nThey CONSTANTLY want to simply \"look it up online\" via Google or AI to get an answer rather than sit there and think about it.\n\nReading isnt heavily emphasized both in school and at home. States emphasize teaching small paragraph excerpts to focus on testing skills rather than full novels/stories to focus on reading skills. Then, lets be honest, lots of parents dont have kids put down their tech and read. Even from early ages, kids simply arent reading enough at home. The average reading level in the US is around a 7th-8th grade level, including adults, and thats just embarrassing. \n\nState education systems push kids through due to funding issues.\n\nI teach high school (AP at that) and have so many kids who can barely read and write on grading level. I have gone almost fully to writing by hand with paper and no devices, and it shows tremendously. Kids that have tech are much more likely and able to cheat/look things up.\n\nIts exhausting.",

We took notes with pen and paper, copying whatever was written on the board. We had four computers in the school that connected to the internet, by the time I graduated I could count on my hands the number of times I'd ever been online.   \n  \nI went to college during the great recession when my career imploded. Everything was different. There were smart boards. Lectures were generally given with powerpoint (more often than not just the slides that came with the teacher's edition of the text book). Everybody used laptops to take notes, I used a tablet. Homework was often the online crap directly from the texbook publisher that required an extra $60 for a key.  \n  \nHaving been on both sides of the technology divide I found that all the extra tech in the classroom hasn't added much benefit. The smart boards were pretty cool as was my tablet I used for taking notes. The ppx lectures were terrible. It's too easy to overload the slides with information or to rely on visuals which made effective note taking difficult. Too many teachers don't even bother creating their own lectures and just use the slides that came with their book. I'm far from a Luddite, I love tech and have worked in IT. We just need to stop trying to fix problems that don't exist. More tech isn't always the answer. There are great uses that can improve the learning experience but a lot of what we do now is just distracting and unnecessary.",

          "text": "I don’t know if I would fully blame technology.\n\nSome of the textbooks at my high school were 20 years old. I had more than a few teachers who didn’t teach with the textbook at all. We weren’t able to afford to get the latest textbook(there’s a new one released every year) and the school updated their textbooks every 5 years. Even if we were able to get the latest textbooks released. It came with its own set of issues. I remember people were protesting one of the APUSH textbooks. It would only teach documents and removed a lot of important history because they didn’t want anything that painted the U.S. in a bad light in the textbook. There was a massive amount of backlash over it. \n\nI remember some of my most memorable classes were because my teachers embraced technology and more immersive forms of teaching. They were able to get some of the new tech to help with teaching. I remember all of the teachers wanted it. \n\nEducation is wildly underfunded imo. I remember growing up hearing about budget cuts. The school district setting up a contest for how much electricity people could save. \n\nIt doesn’t make sense to me why there are schools that allow complete unrestricted access to the internet. I thought it was standard by now for most schools to be blocking unapproved websites. \n\nI feel like they’re blaming technology because there was a lot of unexpected costs and logistics they didn’t expect that popped up during COVID-19. Like making sure all students have access to internet/WiFi to complete homework. Making sure parents understand the laptops are being loaned. They’re not keeping the laptops. There’s also the fact that kids went for a really long time without being in a classroom setting. Some people don’t have the discipline or parental support. \n\nIt makes a massive difference if parents are able to be proactive and hands on with their children’s education. Whether or not students are supplementing their own student learning. That also makes a massive astronomical difference. \n\nI would like to see more studies and more information about these schools that participated in this study. The students’ background and how these teachers teach. There’s just something odd about it.\n\nGen Alpha is quite literally the ipad baby generation. We’re still learning how that is currently effecting them. They were having unrestricted access to tablets early on in their development before they even entered schools.",

How long have you been waiting without putting any effort into reading anything?\n\nThe AI that we have right now has been massive for the productivity of coding. Test writing, onboarding new programmers, less easy mistakes. It's worth like tens of billions a year.\n\nIt's far better at communicating with people. Doctors are using it to talk to patients, others use it for summarizing emails, articles, or anything else written. \n\nIt's pretty much solved protein folding which makes medical R&D much faster. Because of this its opened up clear paths to curing the flu, for instance. It's turned drug discovery from trial and error into far more efficient processes. Same with materials engineering. AI can predict crystalline formations which enables us to improve semiconductors and batteries. \n\nThere's hundreds of examples of what we have now already greatly benefitting everything.

You know what's funny to me is the tech world has had questionable measures of productivity (read: What you're worth as an employee) since its inception. There was even a period in time where they were more honest about this and there were even consulting firms out there to try and help more accurately measure the productivity of programmers. All businesses suffer this to a degree but because computing can have a rather ephemeral output compared to past industries the measures from old businesses couldn't apply.\n\nIt's why we have KPIs and other measurements that have existed some time now, and they actually kinda suck. So really the only reliable measure of this tech's worth is pretty much how much profit it can generate. So far, we're still in the catching up to spending commitment phase of things so profits aren't even on the horizon. \n\nFor me I only care about results in the market, I wanna see the profits. See if a corporation found a way to actually do something productive with this shit, they'd have packaged it up and sold it as a proprietary solution already. **It'd be going viral in this environment where corporations are so thirsty to find the gains, they're desparate** None of this \"UhHH IS It WoRKinG yEt?\"",

But there is another formation very similar to monopolies called oligopolies. An oligopoly is a \"small number of players in a market\" instead of a **mono**poly, which is just one player.\n\nHow we know if a market is an oligopoly or a healthy competitive market is based on how much power each individual player has. If a single player can completely warp a market, then the market is not a healthy competition, and it requires more players.\n\nBillionaires have so much power, enough to buy entire industries, just to shut them down if they feel like it. Their power is so disproportionate compared to the average Joe. We would never accept this in a healthy business market. But it's totally normal (for a lot of people) on a citizen level.\n\nAlmost all of our modern problems is due to the fact billionaires are treating countries like their playgrounds. Tax them until they're no longer billionaires would fix a fuckload of our problems, while also allowing our government to y'know, do things again. I'd much rather a government handle these things than billionaires for the simple fact, if a billionaire is evil, you can't do shit. If a government is evil, you can vote them out.\n\nIf a politician isn't talking about taxing billionaires, they're trying to \"go along to get along.\" When ANYONE can see how fucked up they are making the world.",

It's worse.\n\nReminder and a surprise for some: the US, privately owned digital vote counting machines (tabulators) have been compromised for years and we didn't elect Trump. He stole the presidency. Exactly like he tried to do in 2020, just this time with the already compromised tabulator machines tuned more aggressively to guarantee it.\n\nDo not take my word for it, here's the actual data (and even though this video is now several months old and there is much more they've found, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as you might expect with criminals). Please see for yourself and if you trust the data (not simply conspiracy theory talk) share with anyone who still thinks \"America got it wrong\" or we need to get out and vote more.  We did, and Kamala would have won, decisively, had our votes actually been counted correctly. It's the compromised, privately owned tabulators (vote counting machines) that turned votes for Kamala into votes for Trump in all the swing states, after a certain threshold of votes were counted on each machine. These folks and other independent teams of analysts like them, are doing us a great service:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ru8SHK7idxs?feature=shared\nelectiontruthalliance.org\n\nAnd we've been on that road for a very long time which, unfortunately, is not surprising. This journalist research article, written just before Obama's 2nd term, dives into the long history of election fraud in the US and how, especially in the digital tabulation age, it has been setup to get us to the point where whomever has control of them can literally steal an election:\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/\n\nSo, whenever Maga or Republicans say they want to investigate Election Fraud (\"by the Dems\"), it's to accuse and look in the right, yet as we know, and as the data evidence demonstrates, their accusation is yet again projection.",

There is no reason for a billionaire to own a news empire or a social media network that isn't to sanitize their own reputations, and to curry favor for themselves among the centers of power in the world. \n\nIf we REALLY want to deal them a blow, then we need to take our views to non-profit and ideally (because non-profits rely on donos which can be and almost always are from powerful, wealthy individuals who expect a return on that investment) journalist-owned media. The Associated Press is arguably the best \"major\" network, as it is not \"owned\" by any one group - but the controlling members are the major networks who ARE owned and controlled by billionaires. Better sources of news would be, like, 404 Media (tech), Aftermath (gaming), Drop Site News (politics), Hell Gate (New York news), ProPublica, etc. Where we can, we should be giving these sites your membership fees, views, clicks, web hits, etc. These are good journalists, usually a diaspora from some old mainstay website's \"restructuring\". They're not just randos who threw together a website, but real, dogged journalists with real work behind them and they can do BETTER work when they've got food in their bellies, a healthcare plan, a safe and secure place to live, etc. For we who have SOME means, that means it's up to us to not just use these sites, but kick over a little monthly dono as well.\n\nAs long as we depend and expect these news sources owned by people who are actively working against us, to work FOR us, we can continue to expect disappointment. They own these outlets and these platforms for a reason, and that reason is *specifically* to undermine our power and to divide us. Also, like, I know I mentioned the traditionally \"liberal\" news outlets and declined to mention Fox, Newsmax, OANN, but that's because... like, I expect conservatives a.) not to care and b.) generally to be willingly obsequious serfs on the modern digital feifs. They don't care that billionaires own these, because they're deliberate simps to power. I expect liberals, in theory, aren't.",

Of the last six packages I've order, 3 arrived in good state, one was left literally in front of the my complex's leasing office at 10:00 pm, one was left randomly on top of mailboxes somewhere in the complex, and one was left by a trash bin.\n\nThe sad part is there is no easy way to say \"Hey, they effed this up\" and get resolution. Just reported the deliveries were wrong and that was it.  No feedback at all.  I went to Walmart+ (good prescription services) and have had no issues since.",

The tonal shift in the company from Bezos (still a dickhead) to Jassy was so noticeable: fear of layoffs, anti-employee RTO and comp policies, tracking badge swipes and time in office. The guy has no creativity other than to 'drive efficiency' after he made specific decisions that made the company inefficient to begin with (bureaucracy, over hiring, etc.).\n\nThe guy has got to go. I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years. People compare him to Ballmer, and I'm starting to really believe this is the current era this company is in.",

Unless it's something super egregariously positive, the news that gets reported/ things you remember are more often going to be negative things. \n\nThink about driving, walking, and human interactions throughout your day. You likely see hundreds, if not thousands of examples of positive interactions. People driving predictably so traffic flows, people moving over to let you walk past, someone holds the door for you politely. \n\nYet you generally don't remember that, you will remember the *one* driver that didn't move over to let you merge, the one walker that stopped and blocked your path, or the one person that didn't hold the door. \n\nThe news media gets more interaction out of negative and, doom and gloom, and ragebaiting than they do out of happiness and rainbows reporting. They do need to report **some** good things, otherwise if it's all negative thing their viewers will get burned out and not bother to view anymore, but the negative reporting is still the biggest main draw.",

Kuhl took a moment to issue a stark warning to anyone wearing AI glasses in the courtroom: stop recording with them and delete the footage, or face contempt.\n\nMany courts generally forbid recording during trials, though there are exceptions. However, while the judge did seem to be worried about recording in general, she also had another concern: the privacy of the jury.\n\n“If your glasses are recording, you must take them off,” the judge said, per the *Los Angeles Times*. “It is the order of this court that there must be no facial recognition of the jury. If you have done that, you must delete it. This is very serious.”\n\nCurrently, Meta’s AI glasses do not include the ability to identify the names of the people a wearer views through them, but that’s not likely what the judge meant in her concerns about “facial recognition.”\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91495248/meta-ai-glasses-court-judge-threatens-wearers-contempt-mark-zuckerberg-testimony)",

Discord has a huge number of customers having more or less cornered the VOIP market for gaming related activities, notice how discord already links to various game accounts, and to twitch, and it has always had overlays showing what game you're currently playing, which means it is collecting all that Data, and that Data is valuable.\n\nDiscord wants to look as valuable as possible so they can make a lot of money selling the company piece by tiny piece, and they've already been forced to implement ID verification in several countries, so they have the perfect excuse, they say they won't sell your data, but that's not a contract just a promise with no garauntee other than their word, and if someone else like microsoft for instance decided to quietly purchase a controlling share, well they never even promised not to sell your data.\n\nThis is just a combination of greed and stupidity, Discord picked a singularly bad moment to try this shit given what's going on in the world given wider political and consumer confidence issues which make the public much less trusting, but in a calmer moment in history this wouldn't have blown up nearly as much.",

Half the time the answer is buried in some 3-year-old thread with broken context anyway.\n\nWe traded messy but accessible knowledge for locked rooms and scrollback hell. It’s awful for documentation, awful for troubleshooting, and great if you enjoy wasting time asking the same questions over and over because nothing is discoverable anymore.\n\nI get why communities like it, real time chat is easy, but as a knowledge base it’s complete trash.\n\nYeah, I hate it.

Occasionally the streaming feature is great for someone who isn't able to see what we're doing otherwise, or to troubleshoot a friend's PC problems.  \nBut not for anything public, I don't need anyone to know what I'm playing or listening to, I don't want quests or other engagement games.\n\nDiscord could probably scrap 50% of its features and I wouldn't even notice; maybe I would even notice it positively, cleaner and simpler UI, less annoying pop ups.",

                  "text": "Nearly every service in existence that has persistent chat history stores your messages you send in plain text. There are very few that instead store encrypted messages. Those that do are typically using E2EE. And the reason most services don't use E2EE is because it's incredibly inconvenient.\n\nUsers typically want to be able to do useful things like search through their past messages, which is something you cannot do if the messages are stored encrypted unless you load all of the messages onto your device to decrypt them before performing the search, which becomes a massive drain on both client and server resources as chat histories grow larger. Additionally, if the keys are lost, then depending on the implementation, you could end up losing access to the entirety of your message history. These are generally considered problematic by the majority of end users.\n\nE2EE sacrifices convenience for enhanced privacy and security. If you need that enhanced privacy and security, then you'll usually be happy with the trade-off of losing convenience, but most users don't need the enhanced privacy and security and would much rather have convenient functionality. Thus messages tend to be stored in plain text so as to facilitate that functionality (developer laziness notwithstanding).\n\nPasswords are a different matter entirely. Any service not run by an imbecile will neither store them encrypted nor store them in plain text, they're stored hashed. And this is fine because you don't need to know what the password is, you just need to know if the password someone gives you is the correct one, so scrambling the password in the exact same way and comparing the scrambled results is sufficient. Anyone storing passwords in plain text in 2026 needs to be executed.",

You’re just moving the same problems to a new service.\n\nStaut looks strong but it’s missing screen sharing and that’s a feature too many people utilize and undoubtedly, people are just going to go back to Discord when they want to screen share and can’t anymore. Because all the righteousness only works for the moment but if people experience inconvenience or feel they could do things on Discord they can’t do on Staut, then they are just going to go back to Discord when the fire fizzles out.\n\nFluxer is the closest thing to a feature complete transition from Discord and I think that’s the route we should go. It has stability issues for the moment and the dev is working to refactor their code but it’s open source in all the right ways, the dev is very responsive to requests from users and he recently just changed their Contributor License Agreement to be more open source friendly. It’s also based out of Sweden and adheres to GDPR and allows you to self host. It’s the culmination of all the best aspects of Discord without any of the bullshit. It’s only problem right now is it’s not quite ready for the big stage and needs more time in the oven but it’s blatantly the closest thing you’re going to get to an open source Discord and that’s really what you need if you want people to leave Discord and stay off Discord. \n\nIt’s not dissimilar to Signals success. It was enough likes What’sApp and had most of the features people actually used from WhatsApp so the transition was easy. If we are going to pick alternatives to Discord then Fluxer is probably the most analogous.\n\nFor the mainstream, you only really get one shot at migrating users to a new platform. If the alternative sucks or doesn’t have the features people use daily, then undoubtedly people are going to roll back over to Discord over time. Further, if it takes too long and you let this moment pass where people are up in arms and they slowly come to accept the reality, then the moment will be lost and most people you know will stay on Discord and that’s how Discord will get away with all of this. It’s like the Reddit API stuff all over again. People just got used to the new rules and moved on to being angry about something else. If the transition to a new platform is inconvenient, not feature complete and gives people a reason to stay on the old platform, then humans being creatures of comfort and convenience will learn to deal and stay on Discord.

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

They get \"play money\" from mumsy and dadsy to invest in whatever they want. Many of them make a bunch of failed investments until they manage to find one that actually works. And they can afford these failures because they'll still have money left over even if some of them fail.\n\nTo add to that, they have networks of rich friends and family who do the same thing, so if they start a new business, they've got some investors available to instantly give them capital to get it started. So an idea tried on a whim — such as an online book store that could potentially expand to other products — can have instant success over the competition just because a bunch of rich buddies poured money into it and kept it running even when it wasn't turning a profit.\n\nSo there's no genius involved in wealth, nor anything clever at all. It's just the aristocracy keeping themselves in power through the only thing they have: too much money.",

Now that the feed was unpredictable and no longer controlled by the user it became a target for individualized propaganda. \n\nZuckerburg has overlaid this strategy on every acquisition he’s made, including Instagram. ",

The algorithm he created is horrible, he can be bought for political means, he has turned the app into literal trash compared to what it was. I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved. It has no originality no design and no practicality anymore, it's a mess.",

It was originally coined to describe websites like Facebook that were centered around your *real* identity and connecting with people you knew in real life.  But these websites have expanded in functionality way beyond that, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphones, and the broader online connectedness of society.  And the lines between what used to separate websites have blurred as they all support the same basic functionality.  Follow functionality, browsing/discussion by topic, both identifiable and anonymous users, users that are organizations/businesses, rich multimedia, etc.\n\nMost of the problems people attribute to what is called 'social media' is rooted in the existence of web 2.0 mega platforms and consolidation of the web.  It's just the nature of hitting a critical mass of users that lowest common denominator BS rises to the top.  And unfortunately I think it was inevitable and is largely unsolvable.  The network effect is powerful and we're never going back to a time where people broadly disperse to smaller websites and more limited communities.",

She tried to shut it down with jokes and comments and he just powered on, convinced that he somehow deserved her because he liked her. Young people need to be educated as to what is acceptable social protocol, especially when learning to date, and unfortunately so many of them deal with parental ineptitude with regard to socialization and learn from the internet how to relate. And it SHOWS.\n\nShe blocked the boy after I told her to but I worry. Some people think that liking someone else means you are entitled to them, and that kind of behaviour can turn obsessive quickly. Teaching the youth about respect, dignity and honour are crucial aspects to relating to one another that are just often obliterated in this current performative, selfish time. She is a teenager and doesn’t even have social media yet. We must do better for our youth. \n",

Just like \"rock music\" or \"D&D\" or \"violent video games\" of past decades.\n\nKids want to communicate with each other and should be allowed to do so. It's a vital part of participation in modern society. Even the Australian \"ban\" excludes primarily-chat-based services like WhatsApp, Discord, Facebook Messenger (not sure how that's usable without a Facebook account?), etc. Since these support \"group chats\", \"channels\", image posts, etc. there's still _plenty_ of scope for posting objectionable content and inappropriate interaction between kids and adults. If anything, content on these platforms is less \"visible\" and _harder_ to properly regulate.\n\n\"Bans\" on particular platforms just push people to other, less regulated platforms, often those based in less-friendly countries with all the concerns over influence that that entails. There's already some evidence of an uptick in use of \"WeChat\" (Chinese social media platform, already significant in the Chinese-Australian community) in Australia since they \"banned\" kids from the better regulated \"Western\" platforms. [WeChat has its own history in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#2023_Australian_Indigenous_Voice_referendum), but it's proven politically difficult to regulate and it seems unlikely to be added to the \"ban\".\n\nThen, of course, there's the massive privacy and data protection issues that come from trying to implement such a \"ban\".",

I keep trying to put this in the context of literally almost any other service and ask why we accept it in social media. \n\n\nImagine there's a soft play chain. It's free (yay!) but as a result it has advertising everywhere and sells your data to other companies. Not only that but *because* it's free and has no gating process it also attracts all kinds of weirdos, adults and kids alike, who hang out there, abuse, threaten, assault or otherwise harass the other users because they know the owners won't do anything about it because they don't invest enough in tracking down and targeting that behaviour. Whenever anyone suggests implementing any kind of gating process though, a portion of society gets weirdly defensive and insists we can't do that because their right to privacy at the soft play is sacrosanct. \n\n\nYou just wouldn't let your kid go there, right? That's me with social media and it fucking baffles me that more people don't take the same approach. If we actually just took a stand, showed a united front and collectively deleted this shit and refused to use it, it would be *so* much easier to make the case to our kids but whilst we're stuck in this limbo where a critical mass of people just don't give a fuck, it's 100x harder. \n\n\nIt's not a tough decision. If you wouldn't want those comments directed at your children in real life, why hand them a portal where millions of people (and the same number again of bots) can harass them like that at any time? Will the damage of \"not being one of the cool kids\" outweigh the psychological damage you're preventing by literally not letting them be exposed to that negativity for several hours a day? \n\n\nI take my kids to sports clubs and the library and the board game cafe and the football matches and they have their mates round sometimes and they *maybe* get a bit of FIFA/Animal Crossing or tv etc *in our living room* at the end of the day and yeah, maybe they'll be the nerdy kids and yes, it's hard work and it'd be a lot easier to just hand them a screen and veg out but fuck it; my job is to try my fucking best to protect them whilst they're young and that's what I'm going to do. ",

              "text": "> Start holding men accountable rather than blaming women\n\nThis is a strawman argument i think.  Nobody is denying that what these boys are doing is harmful or disgusting, people are just being realistic that it's not something that is going to be solved overnight, if ever. \n\nLook,  I am a white male.  If I walked into the middle of North Korea and loudly proclaimed that Kim Jung Il was an uppity bitch, I'd promptly be executed. Would I be a victim? Sure - freedom of speech should be guaranteed to all, and no words should ever be worthy of a death sentence. Would I get a lot of sympathy? Probably not. Most people would look at that situation and recognize that it's a dangerous place to be, and my actions outrageously stupid.  I would hold a portion of blame for exposing myself to (and arguably inviting) danger.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI think the real problem here, is people are demanding that social media is well regulated, but it simply is not, nor is it likely to ever be. \n\nLet me put this into perspective:\n\n4chan is considered to be the asshole of the internet. It's got a lot of gross porn, gore, and all sorts of disgusting shit besides. Most people who speak about 4chan will argue that it's an absolute shithole, and no self respecting person would EVER engage with it. \n\nBut, here's a few helpful facts for you:\n\n1. The founder of 4chan is not in the Epstein files. Zuckerberg is. \n\n2. Every month, Meta's servers are responsible for the distribution of more CSAM than 4chan has in it's entire existence. \n\nPerhaps you see this as a defense of 4chan - it is not. It is simply a method to demonstrate perspective. 4chan is a shitshow, and statistically speaking, every other major social media platform is worse. \n\n-------------------------\n\nYou call this victim blaming, and there is definitely validity to that, but only in a very idealistic point of view. Realistically, the internet is a barely regulated wild west full of abusers, creeps, murderers, and worse. Children should not be exposed to that without guidance.",

I've see some general insta posts about misandry, like pretty weird/mean things, and I noticed that the people I knew and followed IRL would like this which often made the situation worse, since somehow it connected some apeshit online BS to something some people actually believe. \n\nI engaged in these posts for significantly longer than I should have, feeling a bit more down because it felt like many of these posts and comments were just attacks to me, even though I had done nothing. Regardless of whether I was morally justified or not, it didn't matter, because my engagement in these posts caused Instagram to recommend them more. I can easily see why she received many of these posts. \n\nAt that point, it is best to completely ignore, and avoid all engagement with such type of content at all costs. It's not good for your mental health, you can't control anything. I did this a lot, and instead of getting reels that would make me feel worse, I would actually get an enjoyable feed of memes and such. \n\nThe more you engage, the more the feed pushes you to the exact opposite of where you want to be. I agree that content can be incredibly negative, but unfortunately reflecting on the same topics day to day will ruin your morale, the best current solution is to avoid it altogether. \n\nAgain, I am not trying to dismiss any of her issues, and not trying to equate her to mine. I am hoping that this anecdote can allow me to at least offer help or information to others, and make a more broad message. Social media platforms genuinely need to fix this, and there seems to be subcultures in the internet that promote this. A n echo chamber that constantly fluctuates from post to post.  \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Do NOT engage with ANY social media content that makes you feel less than a human, angry, etc.  ",

Watch the congressional hearings with Mark Zuckerberg if you don't believe me, it's embarrassing that these are our so-called \"leaders.\"\n\nMy point in making this comment is that, given that actually addressing the problem is borderline impossible, the only productive advice that you can give is on the personal level to those who feel targeted on these platforms—delete your account and step away from the Internet for a while.",

I'm a developer with 5 years of experience outperforming those with 10 and even 15 years on them who are refusing to use the tools they have available to them.  The code is passing their code reviews even when they fully know I'm not actually writing a line, because there isn't a single thing they can fault with it, much as they'd like to argue it.  And they're becoming resentful because I'm blowing past them in not only KPIs but in being able to take initiatives they wish they had time to tackle.\n\nMaybe as a whole I could see it all averaging out to being net zero.  Maybe.  There are loads of people who still completely fail to know how to use a search engine or text editor, so those same people flailing around with AI and getting nowhere wouldn't be a shock.

We are hearing the same things from other companies. Mid and senior developers are producing 5 to 10 times more output.\n\nAlso seeing early signs in other areas. BLS reported nonfarm business labor productivity +4.9%, with output up much more than hours worked.  \n\nThe Kansas City Fed also published some research on this recently that showed industries with higher AI adoption tend to have faster productivity growth and that productivity has moved further above its pre pandemic trends.\n\nI think what’s going to happen is more and more businesses, particularly small and medium size will start implementing Agentic AI. That is they will use these agents that hook into LLMs to either make the back office more productive or to eliminate workers. We are sort of in a transition period now.  Not full AI where all white collar work is eliminated. I actually don’t believe that will ever happen. You need true AGI that can think and reason. And set goals for itself, etc.\n\nBut we are going to end up with a scenario where these AI agents are doing lots of things both at businesses and for consumers. We will all have a smart agent on our devices that can do things for you. Schedule appointments. Move money around. Alert you that you need to reply to someone. In the end it means we are all more productive.\n\nYes it also means fewer entry level jobs most likely.

GPT tech has an unfathomably high error rate and requires a tremendous amount of handholding and troubleshooting.

Because you can’t run a business where you can’t trust any of the data or any of the performance coming out of it.\n\nThe shoe will drop, and I believe it’s dropping as early adopters are finding out there’s a lot of financial and time expense going into something providing them with negative returns. \n\nMy two cents, anyway.",

It's good for shareholders and rentiers, not for workers, nor consumers, nor democracy for that matter. And it's creating widespread resentment, insecurity and fear. Some of it very warranted, if you know a little bit about the major players who are being massively empowered.\n\nIf AI will have good use cases, those uses could be achieved with far less damage and in a more ethical and beneficial way, even if it takes 3-5 years instead of 1-2. But Microsoft, Kaplan at Anthropic, etc, have all stated that they simply \\*refuse\\* to think forwards more than 1-2 years. They never consider the consequences of their actions, because they believe they won't bear them, only you and I will.",

If AI can help businesses fire vast numbers of people, those businesses will be willing to pay vast amounts of money for it. That's the upside.\n\nAnd the downside? There isn't one. The Mag 7 own 30% of the S&P500 market cap. If their AI bet fails and their stocks tank, it will be a bloodbath in the markets. People's pension funds are tied into this. Which means they've become too big to fail. You can look back to 2008 to understand the implications of that statement. \n\nWhich is why it's an asymmetric bet. Best case, these guys become insanely rich. Worst case, they get bailed out, golden parachutes and get a little bit less rich than in the other case.",

Big tech absolutely needs this hype, because they are otherwise  creatively finished and they need this hype to maintain their growth stock status. They do this in spite that it is a serious threat to their profitability and even existence, something that is completely against the interest of their shareholders in the long run. Oracle is a great example, but if you look at what is happening to CAPEX of many other companies, bills are just starting to really flow in. And all the big data center providers (Coreweave etc) are laughably in debt and on the brink of collapse already.\n\nYeah, AI is extremely harmful in many ways, but the revolution and all that ridicilious threat of super intelligence speak is a sham spread by the very same people and companies who again are heavily invested in this scam. It is part of the story to push this shit absolutly everywhere and my bet is that they very well know that the music stops at some point, but they will be bailed out.",

A couple of examples of bad behavior:\n\n\nhttps://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment\n\nThis technology needs to be heavily regulated yesterday.",

A lot of engineers base their perception of AI on models and tools that are recently released, but were actually trained/prepped many months ago. Months for LLMs might as well be decades.\n\nWhen I show the latest coding demos of our latest frontier model to other devs at my company, they come in smiling and leave anxious. It’s to the point where we can point it at a code base, point it at work items, and describe how we want work to be done… and then the agents take over and do some really insane things. We pointed it at a well known internal code base for our cloud and within a few days it had done most of our work items. We gave it a few more days to make improvements elsewhere in the project “where it saw fit”, and it generated code and review requests that would have taken an architect and many months previously… basically it improved our async infra to move from polling to a callback trigger model, and it’s a huge performance boost. We all wanted something like that, but the code base is so huge, we knew it would take human engineers a year or more just to get a POC running in a safe way.\n\nThe AI did it in days and had everything behind feature flags, tests, fallbacks, etc.\n\nI think AI is moving from “that’s cool” territory to “that’s scary” territory. \n",

Relatively speaking, it might as well be reckoning with the consequences of radio.\n\nTechnology already has and will continue to unravel social fabric faster than our system is designed to respond. By the time our government is able to even reasonably conceive of an ethics and safety regime, let alone actualize it, we'll probably watch it through augmented retinal displays that transmit advertisements directly through our ocular nerves lol",

Say what you like about his “hey-ho” old timey mannerisms, he got shit done. \n\nAnd yeah, I’m still pissed that he did not fire that asshole garland on the first day and install someone to prosecute krasnov immediately.

Required regulations across the value chain. Let's pretend we only ingested data ethically, properly compensated our artists and publishers, movie makers, everyone. Limited investments in data centers, power, and whatever else.\n\nThat's what we're asking for so let's consider a world where that happened.\n\nAny number of other countries have absolutely no compunction to do that. They will lie, cheat, steal and cut every corner to get ahead in the AI arms race regardless of what the US does. \n\nWe could regulate the heck out of foreign AI but that doesn't keep them from operating outside of our laws in their own countries or their friendly countries. \n\nI am a fan of what we WANT to happen. It'd be great if the world worked like that. But the world doesn't work like that. It works like it is currently working. It's a gross, messy, unfair, unethical, deeply flawed world and the only way to survive is to try and be as ethical as we can and still compete. Slowing down isn't going to fix it, unfortunately. \n\nI don't see a strategy that includes deep regulation that allows us to not get destroyed by other nation states in the AI arms race if we take our foot off the gas. Maybe someone else does. \n\nHate the game, not the player. Don't want it, don't like it, really hate what's coming, but it's a necessary evil IMHO if we want to persist.\n\nDownvote away. ",

If it's even half correct global society is going to change and the vast majority of people have no idea it's even happening.\n\nThe one on the AI disaster explains Grok's transformation into MechaHitler, how these LLMs are created and trained, and how little control we have over them.\n\nThe paper referenced in the superintelligence video can be found here: https://ai-2027.com/\n\nPlease take this seriously. Even if the truth is somewhere between \"superintelligence will run the world\" and \"these tech bros have no idea what they're doing, just wait for the bubble to burst\" I believe it needs to be taken seriously.",

That kind of reaction just sounds like front porch cane waving at a \"scary\" future you don't understand.

Of course AI totally screwed it up and didn't even have a clue how gravity worked and got it totally backwards. Yes AI is going to kill lots of people who follow their stupid suggestions...\n\nYou said\nGravity doesn't help pull UP\n\nGemini said\nYou are absolutely right. I see the confusion—I flipped the physics in that last bit.\n\nLet's clear the air: Gravity pulls DOWN. * When mounted at the bottom: Gravity is fighting the spring. The spring has to be strong enough to pull the heavy seal UP into the housing against gravity.\n\nWhen mounted at the top (Upside Down): Gravity is now your friend. It is helping pull the seal DOWN into the housing.\n\nHere is why that actually makes your idea more viable:\nSince gravity is helping pull the seal back into the \"retracted\" position, the spring doesn't have to work as hard. You won't have to worry about the seal \"sagging\" out and catching on the frame as much as you would in a standard bottom-mount setup.\n\nThe mechanics check out:\n\nDoor Closes: The plunger hits the frame.\n\nInternal Linkage: The plunger pushes the internal bar, which overcomes the spring and gravity to push the seal UP into the header.\n\nDoor Opens: The plunger is released. The spring and gravity work together to pull the seal DOWN back into the housing.",

If they are in an advisory role, they are limited in their enforcement, and any improvements may be filtered through their ability or lack of ability to influence. They don't always have direct ownership, and if they aren't good at influencing people, their contributions are diminished or only compliance/policy driven.\n\nThere are good orgs out there; it's just not most orgs. Not even the big ones that make a lot of money.\n\nSo, none of this surprises me.

Adoption will increase, and certain things will get *better*, but it just seems an impossibility to get from where we are today to an AI future that'd return all these investments into AI.\n\nBarring of course some sort of major technological revolution in the AI space separate from and beyond further iterative improvements, ie. something *new* rather than what AI is today, which is essentially what AI was two years ago with two years of iterative improvements inbetween. In the realm of what's predictable, which excludes a not-yet-thought-of revolution, that return does not seem possible.",

Rolling out messy, inefficient and insecure code to thousands, or millions, of users is just a recipe for disaster. Looking at comparisons, keep in mind I am an electronics/radar technician, by actual programmers between AI code and human written stuff. It seems like the AI code is always massively fat in comparison. It runs worse, and seems to be far less stable.\n\nBut it's fast. Especially if you do no actual QC or bug testing. That seems to be what is happening. AI slop code is just being pushed live because it didn't immediately crash.\n\nYou can't fix, or improve something if you have no idea how it works. I can see the utility in having AI puke out a working base, but are you saving any time by fixing that mess rather than writing it yourself? I'd imagine not. Same issues I run into with my job.

Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component—accidentally or intentionally—that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.\nhttps://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/article/view/260",

It doesn't make sense.\n\nThe moment they stop buying, their cloud sub + thin client pricing has to compete with hardware prices 3x cheaper than what they paid for the same stuff. In fact, it actually has to compete with hardware prices no matter what. Otherwise people will just start to outbid them on hardware to avoid paying 10x the price over a yearly cloud subscription. They are literally competing with themselves.\n\nI have no idea why this is such a popular theory. So many people just use phones and tablets these days anyway. If not that, then laptops. Portable devices make terrible thin clients.\n\nIt might make sense as a play right now, but I have serious doubts about the long term viability of this. Especially if the plan is to literally burn money to make the pricing make sense.\n\nIn no way is this the \"end game\", the personal computer industry isn't worth what they are pricing this all out to be worth.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYes I know the hardware is going to AI. I'm saying this secondary mastermind plot of cloud computing is not viable. Especially if AI does not pan out.",

If AI company A buys out all the memory and storage for years on end, AI company B literally cannot compete.  It's a business advantage.\n\nWhat sucks though is the fabrication companies make both enterprise and consumer hardware, but the enterprise orders are so huge that they basically just don't have the throughput to also make consumer products in reasonable amounts anymore.\n\nDell and other companies aren't evil in this case, despite developing cloud computing solutions.  They see \"Hey, our clients still need X number of PCs per year but we literally cannot deliver that for a reasonable price.\"  Now they're selling or renting cloud space to try to fill that gap.  Many, many companies are already using external VPN computing networks so this seems like a natural evolution of that, realistically.  Sometimes, at least for a business, it does make way more sense to rent some \"computers\" versus buying a few hundred or thousand that will eventually need to be replaced or salvaged.  Especially if the company's needs require secure hardware, connections, or other special concerns like requiring GPUs or high memory for high individual workload cases.\n\nI don't believe renting pc space for non-commercial users was ever originally the goal.  I think it's just becoming a consequence of this entire mess.",

Or AI can take one look at the remote and I tell it the brand of VCR, and it gets me right to the button combos I need. \n\nOr I want to break into the service menu for my already past warranty OLED display to unlock dangerous but brightness popping advanced settings. I could navigate years of av forum discussions until I find someone with a near match to my display model with a near match to my current firmware, or I can tell AI my specs and ask it to find the latest service mode instructions and explain what it can about the various options, with more success than failure. \n\nOr I've got some video encoding to do and I'm using a new enthusiast tool I'm not familiar with which has an encyclopedia's worth of advanced settings. I could try to brush up on the whole thing, or try to learn about the specific things I want, or I can tell AI what I want to do and have it teach me about the relevant settings, including the ones I didn't know I should take into consideration.

Yeah, probably.\n\nAnd don't get me started on home assistant automation integrations which are normally above my ability.\n\nAI gives me the chance to make actual headway on hobbyist objectives that previously collected dust because of the amount of research and trial and error that I needed to invest just to get a small step done.
