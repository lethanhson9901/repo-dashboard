We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on. Every \"safety\" feature that requires unmasking is another brick in the wall of a corporate panopticon that would make Bentham blush.",

They re-strategize and re-release. This is a PR stunt meant to quiet the angry masses. If you are concerned with your privacy, you should definitely get rid of your cameras. The only reason we haven’t is because we cannot yet afford to replace them, so yanking them right now would create an even greater security risk. They have really screwed up with this though by leaving people like us in this situation. There is still going to be litigation on this regardless of what they say",

Reolink can handle this for you, and a lot of people are comfortable with that for the convenience. Their app is also better than the standalone IP camera viewer apps I've tried.",

Highly configurable - but you dont need to if you want to keep it basic.\n\nThen paired with the Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 (there’s several other great options too!) - allows local storage on-device and connects to HA, but you can upload to a local NAS storage with HomeAssistant. Aqara is very easy to setup and get working with HA - just plug-and-play.",

I downloaded the app, made an account and used it for a while, but eventually stopped looking at it because I don’t really need to see videos of my driveway.  \nFast forward to this ad, which made me want to be sure I’ve disconnected the camera from the Internet. I downloaded the app and tried to log in. Even though I had my password, it insisted on sending a code via email. But then the email said I was using a different device so I would have to “verify”\nMy account. Keep in mind I already have a password and the ability to receive a code through my verified email.\nTurns out the only ways I can get into the account now are to give them a copy of my government ID, or let them do a biometrical scan of my face.\nI’m considering just ripping the camera down.",

And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

They programmed the masses to accept terrorists meaning someone who can be lawfully killed, tortured/abused, and/or detained indefinitely even without due process despite that concept going back to medieval times with the magna csrta. Now they expanded the definition of terrorism to include whomever they want with the new official loose definitions they changed with an executive order, now anyone especially from the previously mentioned groups are targets for being labeled as domestic terrorists and they have already started testing the water on that with no serious push back from the masses or even politically.\n\n*They are building more camps in every state than they are \"illegal immigrants\" (remember when it was just supposed to be the 'dangerous ones' but now they openly just embrace all migrants regardless of paperwork/status)*\n\n***the Nazis didn't campaign on the final solution or concentration camps, they ran on deportations and de-naturalization of \"non-germans\" following the same rhetoric as the admin currently is rehashing***\n\nRegular folks didn't learn from history, the system intentionally aided from that and folks are and have been to pacified by their work and treats to concern themselves with this progressively more obvious blatent descent descent into what will eventually involve a final solution like it did with the Weimar Republic, there are building massive crematoriums for a reason, the global West in terms of regular folks might not have learned their lessons but the fascists did and this time there won't be all the bodies left over as evidence when they try to erase history.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it frequently rhymes.",

There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

At that point you just have your account with \"the\" big central authority, except with way lesser functionality vs competitors.  You can do E2EE but I think more people care about functional screen sharing, which pretty much no Matrix client really has compared to Discord.\n\nJust to give you an idea, joining a room of 2k+ people can take well over a minute because of how the protocol works.

              "text": "They 100% are, and have been being used to track and search for people, there is zero doubt about that. While the government can't surveil directly without justification (that gets slimmer every year), *private companies* have much more relaxed restrictions with their own products. Then all of the data they collect, including video, facial recognition, audio, etc, just just winds up sold to anyone who can afford to buy it. The US government is just another customer, bypassing regulation (including the Constitution) by purchasing access to the surveillance data from private companies or brokers. \n\nThis is not a new thing or a future concern, it is already happening even if a big chunk of the public was only recently made aware of it.\n\nOne of the more egregious offenses in this field is with Flock Safety. They have close to 1 million AI cameras already set up around the US to identify and track *all* passing vehicles. They identify the license plate, make/model, color bumper stickers, dents/damage, etc. creating a digital profile of your vehicle that will be referenced every time you pass any of their cameras and cataloging the location and time data. This data is then sold to law enforcement who are able to use it for dragnet surveillance without a warrant. They can essentially search for whoever they want, whenever they want, for whatever reason they want or no reason at all. It has been for things like [a jealous police chief repeatedly spying on his ex-girlfriend](https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article291059560.html) \n\nor for [tracking down people who get abortions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down)\n\n or for [identifying and cataloging peaceful protesters and activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists).\n\n The \"customers\" then have the right to distribute and use this data as they see fit, with little to no privacy regulation applying yet. [Here is a map of reported cameras so far](https://deflock.org/map), though since they are individually reported only by a fraction of the population that sees the need to catalog them, there are likely more, and new ones being added every day. Flock makes a big PR stink about \"not working directly with the federal government\", but the way their data rights are structured they are easily able to get access through those they do work with. For instance, it is known that ICE and DHS have access to them, so likely every agency does if they want to.

It is already happening. Also consider how Palantir is fascillitating similar privacy violations. Amazon/Bezos has already been working closely with the federal government this administration, who have shown themselves to be particularly interested in bot AI and surveillance. There is basically no chance that these aren't already being used for tracking, or at least searching people. That is likely one of the primary objectives of setting it up this way to begin with. Lots of data to sell for the company, and civil rights workarounds for the government, a win-win.",

Below are the steps that google provide when I searched how to set up voice channels in Steam. Hope this helps someone. \n\n\n1. Setting Up Voice Options\nBefore using voice chat, configure your microphone to ensure it works correctly: \nAccess Settings: Open the Steam client, click on Friends & Chat in the bottom right corner, and click the gear icon (Settings) at the top of your friends list.\nConfigure Microphone: Select the Voice tab.\nSelect Input/Output: Choose your microphone and headset/speakers from the dropdown menus.\nTest Microphone: Use the microphone test feature to ensure audio is detected.\nSet Transmission Type: Choose between Push-to-Talk (recommended to filter background noise) or Open Microphone.\nAdjust Threshold: Adjust the voice transmission threshold to filter out background noise. \n\n2. Starting a Voice Chat (Desktop)\nWith a Friend: Right-click a friend's name in your friends list and select Start Voice Chat.

That's  how we ended up with food guides that recommended two thirds of a loaf of white bread a day, and 8 servings of meat from your butcher, and 8 eggs lol.  \n\nOnly in the last decade we're learning that the gut biome is so extremely important for our health, and you can damage it irreparably.  We're learning that our gut biome is likely where our circadian rhythms are based.  We're learning that there is a serious correlation between the evolution of the gut biome and the development of intelligence, as we've learned that the gut actually plays a core role in decision making and sends signals directly to the brain.\n\nIt's such a shame that a tool such as this, one of the dumbest kennedies, can come in and gaslight about nutrition which in turn leaves many people rolling their eyes about any sort of nutritional advice at all.",

If you look at servings based on calorie needs available at realfood.gov it suggests 4-5 servings of protein per day if you are at the highest caloric intake of 3200 per day. 1 egg or 3oz of cooked meat is a serving. Grok suggests 3 eggs for breakfast, a 4th egg as a snack and more protein from lunch and dinner. The protein servings are lower for everyone else. It does suggest like 8 teaspoons of butter or olive oil per day to get your health fats in which is weird, but overall not egregious because it also notes that healthy fats exist within some foods already like avocados for example.",

But at the very least it was informational.\n\nBread/starches : 6-11\nVegetables: 3-5\nFruit: 2-4\nDairy: 2-3\nMeat: 2-3\n\nNow obviously, this is not a perfect system, because there are CRAZY variations in the macro and micronutrients in specific items which may fall under a category.\n\nSome white bread and rice are basically the same as sugar, where others could be high in fiber.\n\nGreek yogurt is dairy and has fantastic macros, American cheese is dairy as well, but much different nutrition.\n\nBroccoli has lots of micro nutrients, iceberg lettuce not so much. \n\nBUT, I can at least attempt to follow it. I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

Like, it fucked me up and drove me away from continuing to interact with most of his family.  He had been unable to fight his demons and his own family posting like everything was okay and peachy *through him* was unfathomable.  I don't have words.  It wasn't something any of us foresaw them doing.  I don't know how they gained access - my friend might have left something behind for it, but there's no way he would have approved of what they were doing with his accounts.

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

Some people can't hear distortion or artifacts, but most professional mixing engineers are not full of shit and can absolutely tell when a master has been over compressed or destroyed by multiple different things. \n\nCables, amps, and playback hardware is MUCH less important than whatever happened to audio up to that point. Recording equipment, audio file formats etc are much more important than your phone's DA converter. As long as you don't have random RC circuits or *very* poor impedance matching along your signal chain, it's hard to tell small changes.\n\nThe difference between the lossy compression formats at highest quality settings and lossless formats is negligible perceptually, though very significant for other reasons (actual loss of information, changes to some transients etc).\n\nMost audiophiles have a very superficial understanding of audio technologies, AD/DA technology and why some things matter and others don't. They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable. Almost like some type of *soul* in audio signals. It's pure nonsense. We can mathematically debunk most of that but grifters gonna grift I guess.",

It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

The power cable affects nothing, yet audiophiles will spend 150x more for a power cable claiming to prevent audio interruptions that don’t exist. In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it. Yet audiophiles are claiming that the conductor used between the two changes the sound, and this study shows that to be a lie.",

Anything above that and you’re venturing into indistinguishable for regular people, audio-woo, and risking attaching the price tag to your evaluation of the audio performance. Past mid-tier, you’re not picking out anything new in your favorite songs, so you just have to love audio for audio’s sake if you want top tier, or have enough money that the price makes no difference to you.",

All the effort went into ensuring good connections, wire was sufficient gauge, and amps had enough continuous and peak power.   Most of the money was spent on the microphones used (a phased array) for testing.\n\n\nAll that said, audio \"quality\" is a subjective measure, just like food flavor, IMHO.  Our perception is modified by so much. \n\n\nMy favorite \"personal\" experiment was blind testing CD vs 320kbps mp3s where I had my son randomly choose one version and then the other version of songs while I listened.  I went 9 for 10 in identifying them.\n\n\nNext, I did the same but didn't A/B the same songs and instead did it fully random.   I guessed right on 11 of 20.\n\n\nNone of that is scientifically valid, but it highlights advice I give when people ask me, which is that if it sounds good to you,  it is good!",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

Conversely, better cables are meant to better withstand nose. Does everyone need a better cable? No. But do they wanna go through the asspain of cheaping out on, for example, an in-wall or large home theater installation only to find they need to redo it?",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

My examples are what I use and have setup for friends and family for years. You can get remote access many ways that exclude anyone but you from accessing.\n\nI chose Reolink because I did not want to be forced to use an app to connect or have to use a products app to view. I used both Foscams and Amcrest cams until they made it nearly impossible to view or setup without using a proprietary app. Now most of the cams will \"phone home\" many times, hence the reason for a separate IoT vlan. If your router does not have that ability, look into setting up pi-hole, a fantastic full house ad/popup blocker, of course open source. I know it can be overwhelming if you're not into the tech, but to make it easier there are plenty of good sites that will walk you through setting this up and chatgpt or claude can be invaluable.

          "text": "\nIt is about Abuse of Power so people shouldn’t try to split hairs over a very serious issue. As time goes on it is the Database it builds that becomes increasingly a threat to personal rights. I feel bad for those people that don’t maturely make their own inquiries to see that this is very real. Abuses & violations of individual rights are happening almost daily. You just have to be brave and research it or continue living with your head in the sand. It wont be long til someone comes along and smacks you in your ass.\n\nI’ll give you a head start:\n\nhttps://www.wjfw.com/news/flock-safety-faces-privacy-concerns-cancelled-contracts-across-u-s/article_a9671d6e-014d-4c4c-b726-cd5be21a037e.html\n\nSummary Flock Safety, a company operating tens of thousands of surveillance cameras across the U.S., faces privacy concerns and contract cancellations. Critics argue the company’s AI-powered cameras infringe on privacy rights and lack public consent, while security flaws and unauthorized use have raised further concerns. Despite these issues, some law enforcement agencies continue to support their contracts with Flock Safety.\n\nhttps://www.blackrosefed.org/benn-jordan-interview/\n\nSummary Benn Jordan, a musician and audio engineer, discusses his interest in surveillance technologies, sparked by the prevalence of Flock Safety cameras in Atlanta. He highlights vulnerabilities in Flock’s systems, including unprotected Android devices and potential for misuse. Jordan advocates for privacy practices like lying online and resisting data collection, and emphasizes the importance of DIY projects to empower individuals and foster innovation.\n\nExcerpt: There are a lot of vulnerabilities. I believe over 70 at this point. In my opinion, the most concerning one is that the cameras and compute boxes are unprotected Android devices. I could push a button 3 times on a Falcon and it’ll give me a WiFi access point to connect to. From there, it takes a matter of seconds to infiltrate the device to access the video footage, data, and even some of the server credentials. What’s much worse is that I can “root” the device, which means that I can have control of it outside of the operating system.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/video/2026/01/06/staunton-resident-files-petition-ordinance-banning-license-plate-readers/\n\nSTAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - After the City of Staunton announced its’s canceling its contract with Flock Safety, the company behind the license-plate–reading software that popped up over the last year, some residents rejoiced, but others in the Queen City said more still needs to be done.\n\nLastly, Here’s an Ai internet scrape of examples:\n\nInvestigations by privacy advocacy groups and news organizations in 2025 and early 2026 have exposed multiple instances of law enforcement misusing the Flock Safety camera system, which operates a vast network of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) across the United States. Here are examples of articles and reports exposing these abuses, categorized by type of misuse:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Surveillance Related to Reproductive Rights and Abortion \"A Texas Cop Searched License Plate Cameras Nationwide for a...\" (Truthout/404 Media): This report detailed how a Johnson County, Texas, deputy used the Flock system to conduct a nationwide search, logging the reason as \"had an abortion, search for female\". The investigation highlighted how cross-state data sharing puts abortion seekers at risk. \"Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose...\" (University of Washington Human Rights Center): This analysis discussed how Texas law enforcement tracked a woman who had self-administered an abortion, with data generated by Flock networks in Washington state.\n2.\t⁠⁠Personal Stalking and Harassment by Officers \"Georgia police chief, arrested for using Flock cameras for stalking...\" (Lookout): This article reports on the arrest of a Braselton, Georgia, police chief for allegedly using the city's Flock cameras to stalk and harass private citizens.\n\n\"Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says\" (NBC News): This article highlights a lawsuit regarding a Virginia police department using the system to track a specific driver hundreds of times.\n\n\"Wisconsin Case Exposes Misuse of Flock Traffic Cameras by Police Officers\" (Yahoo News/Wisconsin Examiner): A Menasha police officer was charged with misconduct in office for using the department's Flock system to search for vehicles belonging to a private individual.\n\n\"Police Surveillance is Ripe for Abuse\" (ACLU of Wisconsin): Reports on a former Kansas police chief who used cameras to track his ex-girlfriend 228 times and a North Charleston officer who used them to track his estranged wife.\n\n3. Biased Policing and Profiling \"EFF's Investigations Expose Flock Safety's Surveillance Abuses: 2025 in Review\" (Electronic Frontier Foundation): An analysis found that over 80 law enforcement agencies used the Flock network to conduct searches using racial slurs and biased language, targeting the Romani community without evidence of specific crimes.\n\n\"Flock Enables Surveillance of Protesters\" (EFF): The same report documents how law enforcement used the system to track participants in various political demonstrations.\n\n4. Unauthorized Data Sharing and Immigration \"Flock's Aggressive Expansions Go Far Beyond Simple Driver Surveillance\" (ACLU): This article exposes how local law enforcement has used Flock data to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in immigration enforcement, violating sanctuary policies in some regions.\n\n\"Mountain View, California, pulled the plug on its entire license plate reader camera network\" (Malwarebytes): Following investigations, this report details how Flock cameras were sharing data with federal agencies without the city's permission.\n\n5. Inaccurate Investigations and Privacy Risks \"Public Interest Law Firm Responds to Flock Safety Pausing Federal...\" (Institute for Justice): This article discusses a federal lawsuit against Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the use of Flock cameras, noting that the system captured, \"photos of an innocent family's driveway and part of their front yard every time a vehicle drove by\".\n\nThese reports have led to nearly 30 jurisdictions cancelling or refusing to renew their Flock Safety contracts in 2025–2026, citing privacy violations, surveillance overreach, and illegal data sharing.",

This was already kinda obvious in the early 2000's when flooding spiked HDD prices and an earthquake spiked RAM prices. Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily.

A statement that really sunk in with me is that we grew up in a time when the internet, and by extension computers, represented a place we went rather than a thing surrounding us constantly like it is today. When I was in middle school, we had a computer lab with just enough of those fruity iMacs for one class at a time to use, maybe once every other week.

Teachers appear to see themselves in some sort of arms race between sussing out what was written by AI & what was actually written by a student. Why does there need to be a race at all? Give oral exams in class. Make students show you what they know there on the spot. Invalidate the use of AI to circumvent learning in the first place.",

And that’s ignoring classes that have side apps whose assignments are wholly contained in that app, so add a handful of apps, which I’m not trying to sound overwhelmed with “oh no, I loaded 4 apps and checked 4 pages.”\n\nI’m saying if an adult, professionally employed as a technologist, who logs in to a dozen system a day for work, finds the 30+ specific places to check for TODOs (and then imagine getting “off tracked” actually *doing* an assignment) overwhelming, just imagine how kids are.\n\nAnd, for some unimaginable reason, they have no textbooks; so **when** a child is lost and confused, just think somewhere mixed in with those dozens of places to look for work is a PowerPoint slide pretending to be the chapter from this week’s textbook.",

                  "text": "And it’s also been studied that handwritten note-taking increases the students’ ability to retain knowledge which leads to higher level learning. When students retain the basic information conveyed during lectures, they are able to moved more quickly onto the application, analysis, evaluation of the content and later creation of media and concepts using that content. \n\nThis is evident in elementary students up to post graduates. I even saw the difference in my education myself. During undergrad, I used a laptop and took notes on that in the classes that allowed but moved on to regular notebook paper by junior and senior year, choosing to transfer the notes from my handwritten notebooks to typed files simply to maintain the information in a better to read format later. The handwriting made it much easier to gather the information and the subsequent transferring to digital documents further cemented the knowledge so that I barely had to study before tests. \n\nHowever, during grad school, about 8 years later, I didn’t want to get a laptop so my partner had bought me an iPad Pro second hand. I had iPads in the past and never used them, but the iPad Pros had just introduced the Apple Pencils which completely revolutionized the iPad for me. I took all my notes on the notability app (I believe). I was quickly able to switch between pen and marker colors and really define how I was organizing my notes as I took them. I didn’t feel the need to rewrite them in a digital document because it had the ability to convert what I wrote. I should also note that most of my courses in grad school were music theory and high level analysis, so it wouldn’t have been a help to retype these things. \n\nBut I retained that information and was able to review it so much better than I ever had been able to with typed notes. I’m not saying this is an absolute fact of learning, but studies support my claim. \n\nAnd when I was teaching, students would complain about their struggles to learn concepts. I would ask to see their notes. I was so surprised to learn that they did absolutely everything on their Chromebooks - and the kicker was that most of the teachers simply gave them their lecture outlines instead of making them notate the content down. By doing that, you aren’t making the students do ANYTHING to obtain the information. It’s like handing them a textbook and asking them to put it under their pillow at night to learn by osmosis. Not to mention the textbooks were all now on the chromebooks.",

Absolutely zero content controls. Whats even more ridiculous is that the teacher will show youtube videos in class to aid in teaching but she shows them WITH youtube ads. My kids come home asking about things they should not know about. Wtf? If you are using google classroom why are their ads in YouTube? Ridiculous . \n\nThe bigger problem is that the teachers use the ipads as pacifiers. There are peers in my kids class that get extra time for tests and extra help for work. While the teachers are busy spending time working with other kids, mine spend 2 hours a day reading. 2 hours of screen time reading. Not reading content the teacher prescribes but reading whatever they want like “graphic novels”, also known as comic books. The school developed AR goals for the kids to justify all the reading but its all bullshit. Its a pacifier thats being justified.\n\nKids spend 6 hours in school. 1 hour lunch/recess. 1 hour special. 2 hours reading. Teachers only teach maybe 2 hours. Bullshit\n\nOn top of that, they go edu tech software that one of my kids read to so that AI can determine how well they read. Seriously!?\n\nTwo years ago. The school district moved the goal posts by changing the grading rubric from 5 levels to 3. Guess what, now the kids on the borderline “meet standards”. \n\n\n\nBut hey, every school board meeting i go to im told look how great the school is doing. Well yes, that will happen when you change how you measure success. \n\nBest part was a few weeks ago when my 11 year old tells me the teacher taught them how to start writing by using chatgpt to help them. \n\nSo I completely agree with the many many articles that are highlighting a very bad situation in elementary education right now. I like the parents mentioned in the article plan to meet with the supe and hand him these fucking ipads and tell him to start doing his job. ",

Of course, none of these examples supports always being on chromebooks for every class all the time, but they have a time and place that blanket opt-outs can't address. \n\nI think we're at a critical point where community pushback can moderate technology use in schools, but I also think opting out at an individual level is on balance a bad approach that can disadvantage/ostracize students working in an existing curriculum and puts a huge burden on already overworked teachers to create completely distinct education models for individual kids. \n\n",

Many activities do not have instructions so you're just clicking around to figure out wtf to do anyway.

Every kid from 1st grade up at our school knows a 30 second workaround to get to these sites that host 1000s of in browser games, so we have to be over their shoulder constantly when they're doing work to make sure they don't switch tabs.

          "text": "Computers in schools today aren’t about teaching.  It’s mainly about $$$ and time, not education.\n\nSchool districts don’t have to buy textbooks because they can assemble a mishmash of YouTube and PowerPoint materials for instruction.  \n\nTeachers don’t have to grade tests and write comments.  Everything is mainly multiple choice (even in high school!) and they let things be auto graded.   Most of the time students can’t even see what they missed since kids in other classes haven’t taken the test.   \n\nThey don’t get the hand written comments in red ink showing why their answer is wrong.\n\nNo more signed progress reports and parent involvement.  They can look if they’re interested but aren’t required to do so.\n\nHell, the online platforms can’t even average grades properly.  Not sure if they do batch processing or what, but  4 100s and 1 80/100 don’t average to 100/100 under any type of sane weighting, even with rounding.\n\n\nIf all of this was to support larger class sizes, it’d be one thing.  But not even that.   My elementary school classes were double the size of what’s allowed today and the teachers did everything by hand — even the gradebook.  But we had actual books,  they actually taught, and we wrote paragraph answers on test questions.   (No, we didn’t use washboards then!)\n\nSchool districts today are more interested in raising the lowest quartile slightly than teaching the upper quartile.    Maybe that’s equity but for education it sucks…",

          "text": "***TL;DR:*** *High school daughter has flourished when switching to books and handwritten notes (at a private school) from the typical 1:1 learning when she was in 4th-8th grade.*\n\nDad here of a current 10th grader. My wife and I ended up putting our daughter into private school a few years ago. It wasn't because of the teachers, or the curriculum. It was because classwork, reading, homework, projects, everything was entirely swallowed by tech. Our daughter did not do well with a 1:1 device.\n\nFrom the 4th grade through 8th grade, almost everything was electronically completed. She had teachers that did teach, but it was often taught from some electronic platform, which maybe additional white-board writing for further explanations.\n\nIn general though, things were PDFs or online textbooks or other online platforms where she had to complete her work or readings. She retained so little. Her math? More often than not, it was done on a touch-sensitive Chromebook with a stylus. So if you wanted to try and remember how you did a homework probably from a couple weeks ago? It either didn't exist, or you had to wade through innumerable image files.\n\nAnyway, I could go so much further into it, but everyone here knows how typical 1:1 device and teaching is like.\n\nHere's what we've noticed over the last 1.5 years after enrolling her in a private school that teaches like schools taught 20 years ago. Even when she could focus in her classes, she retained a *lot* less when reading from an online document/book/scanned-image than she does from physical papers and books in her private school now. She also retains sooo much more when she is essentially \"forced\" (out of necessity for capturing the important material and getting a decent grade, not \"physically forced\") to take notes in her own hand, on actual paper, during class versus creating a Google doc or slide deck to \"take notes\" in. She retains a lot more when the important info is coming from a teacher versus when coming from a video. She retains a lot more when math work is expected to be done on physical paper versus on a screen.\n\nBasically, her switching to the non-tech method of learning has done wonders for her retention, interest and ability to connect things. And again, nothing against the teachers. My wife and I really thought they were great overall.\n\nAnyway, at least to people like my daughter (moderate ADHD and typical teen), *every single measurable aspect* of learning and retention improved when she switched to a school that teaches kids using teachers and physical books and papers, and expecting the kids to take notes in their own hand using pen/pencil. It is night and day.\n\nAnd last thing I'll add is that, she was always a very average student. The school she is in now is a very high expectation type of school, which worried my wife and I a lot, wondering if our daughter could handle it. It turns out, she can, and she said a few months ago that she always thought she was bad at math, and never knew she could *actually* be good at it. It nearly brought me to tears.\n\nAt least for a typical kid like my daughter, I honestly believe that the recent way of teaching/learning is **making millions of kids into intellectually** ***less*** **than what they otherwise could have been**. I could say a lot more about all of this, but it's already too long of a post, so I'll stop here.",

But the teachers (at this particular school and district) literally don’t have time to make copies and get all the papers graded. They have 45 minutes of prep before and after school. At least two of those days a week the prep time is taken up by meetings. The school only has one big printer they lease and some of the teachers who were lucky enough to have grants have a printer in their classroom. If u think about it, 30 children. Half hour to 45 minute long lessons. 8 or so lessons a day that’s about 300 pages a day, that’s if they only have one sheet of work to do per lesson. That doesn’t count actually finding the right worksheet for the lessons or in a worse case making the sheet from scratch. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to do everything on paper all day long anymore. With everyone again in this particular school and I know many others being on such different levels of knowledge they can’t realistically be doing the exact same work every day. So that’s even more variation. With the chromebooks they have the work there. And the kids who need help can get it as they need it and the kids who don’t, don’t need to be waiting on everyone else. If there’s some issue with the worksheet for some students the teacher can go and make corrections or change it and tailor it to some students differently then others. Which again wouldn’t really be possible if it was all done on paper.",

It also depends on the purpose of that particular composition; since writing information that you already know in order to communicate it to another person is more focused on the reader's ingestion of that information. This is most communication, and that's why typing it out on a keyboard is ideal - it's faster to make (type) AND easier to read.\n\nTaking notes is a great example of communicating information you DON'T know to yourself. And this self-communication is instant—You're not writing information to a future version of you, either. That would fall into the first category. You are taking notes just to go through the act of writing the information, and the purpose is not to review the notes later (though, that is a bonus).\n\nTLDR: To your brain and muscles, the 'A' key and the 'S' key are almost exactly the same thing (you push a key). However, actually writing the two letters 'A' and 'S' is a very different task, and this added effort solidifies the actual information behind the words into your head. Much more than typing them or reading them.",

And that's probably dependent on competitors (Apple, Tidal) being unable to cut their costs.  Most likely those guys are also saving money, and so all three would end up cutting costs equally, leading to no net gains for anyone.\n\nSo we are basically in a situation where the cost is limited by the consumers' willingness to pay.

It’s not necessarily the fastest solution, and it won’t be able to transfer platform-specific songs… but everything else is genuinely safe and it does a good/accurate job.",

There was a group of internal staff responsible for flagging stories as potentially fake or for deliberately spreading misinformation. This process disproportionately impacted conservative news sources, to the point that they were complaining about the 'obvious bias' at facebook. \n\nBut of course the reason that the stories were being removed was because they were overwhelmingly more likely to post fake news, stories without any sources cited and obvious bullshit that even a child could tell was fishy. \n\nSo, naturally, because of the conservative backlash (which ironically, deliberately distorted the facts), facebook hired some prominent right wing figures to leadership positions, who immediately set about 'fixing' the problem. Which basically amounted to issuing a blanket notice that stories from some preferred news sources could no longer be flagged. \n\nIssue solved. ",

They are consistent, you just pay too much attention to their words so they dont appear that way.\n\nPS: An extreme extension of this belief of hierarchy being good and wanting more of it is support for literally eradicating groups based on health, visual characteristics, etc too...

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order. Once you understand this all their bullshit makes sense.",

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

I really wouldn’t be surprised if I already have Breitbart blocked because I remember blocking them but for them to not show up in search was weird because Fox News, The Daily Mail, and New York Post are already blocked but still let me search for them. Anyone else have the same experience with Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit?\n\nEdit: Breitbart comes up if I search “Breitbart News” which feels funny to type because it isn’t “news”.

But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called [QuitGPT](https://quitgpt.org/). \n\n>The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January. \n\n>For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.\n\n>QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions.",

Having Custom Instructions (and having them be much bigger than ChatGPTs) is really useful to me.\n\nCustom Gems are good, too. I know ChatGPT can do something similar, but being able to easily make a \"VentBot\", a \"WorkBot\", a \"OrganiserBot\" etc, and have them all on the screen, at the ready whenever I need, just generally makes my work much easier to accomplish.\n\nI've also found that the current free version of ChatGPT is incredibly poor... I did a comparison for the free versions of Gemini and ChatGPT and gave them both a PDF to read. GPT hallucinated like half of it. Was ridiculous. Gemini was MUCH better in this regard.\n\nLastly, the ChatGPT desktop app is horrendous... it crashes regularly, stops getting proper responses, and is terribly organised.\n\nSo yeah, Gemini isn't perfect, but it's suiting me better than ChatGPT, and I'm happier than I was paying for it than GPT.

They lag, they need software updates that wipe all custom settings, and heating/cooling functions cannot be accessed when the screen is slightly dirty.\n\nAnd of course:\n7 ) they look really, really dumb in comparison to other vehicles, which is polarizing to a population that is historically opposed to major changes.\n8.) Did i mention that they look really stupid? Because most do. And yes, aesthetics matter. A lot....\n\nIt's not a mystery as to why they are losing money. They want to hide every detail of their new vehciles until they come out.

Even if you can go 400 miles, if you're taking a road trip, that is still a lot of stops, just for a recharge.

If the author of this article were actually paying attention, it's been clear for several days now (so before the February 13th publication of this article) that Canada was going to be purchasing the F-35. Canada has been quietly purchasing spare parts and lower profile items for the F-35 which wouldn't make sense if they were going to cut the contract at 16. \n\n2. Given that Canada has already committed to 16 F-35s, it would cost more for less capability to backfill the rest of the Canadian Air Force equipment with Swedish Gripens. The Gripen and the F-35 are reasonably comparable in purchase price, and while the Gripen maintenance costs are lower, having to maintain two full separate maintenance supply chains and training systems would negate any of that cost advantage. \n\n3. The F-35 is just better. And while it is true that the Gripen is a mature platform, that's also another way of saying that there's not a lot of room for improvement. And the current Gripen is several steps down from the current F-35, while the F-35 has a lot more ceiling to it. \n\nAny technology subreddit, regardless of the politics, would have to understand that the current technology, the future technological ceiling, not to mention the economics regarding ongoing costs and maintenance makes the F-35 the obviously better choice. \n\nSo, of course, Reddit being Reddit, this sub is going to completely ignore that. \n\nAll Canada is doing right now is Kabuki theater to tell everyone that they're angry with the US, while they rack up contractual delay costs just end up buying the planes that they would have bought in the first place. They're just going to spend more money at it, to pay Lockheed Martin some extra delay fees. \n\nYay. Nice to see the Canadian politicians are competent at handling this kind of thing. 🙄",

I just think that the return on investments for AI companies themselves are too low at the moment, I think we will see a steep price hike in the years to come. This might make companies rethink using AI.\n\nIt can also lead to the populace dumbing down overall if we would rely too much on it. This will eventually lead to reduced capacity of the AI models themselves because they need quality data from human input to improve, unless they do really manage to get AGI working.\n\nThe question also remains what if we are still scratching the surface of AI, where will this lead to economically if most jobs become redundant, with no end consumers with money to buy products?",

The cloud either already sells or will soon sell solutions for everything like gaming, office work, corporate projects, data storage, software development, image and video editing, etc.\n\nModern computers are grossly overpowered.  All of our computers sit closer to being turned off than on when they're actively being used.  I have 50 chrome tabs open, a web video stream playing, a game running I'm tabbed out of running in the background, and a video editor open and my cpu usage *sometimes* hits 25%.  You might value a computer build at 2000$, but only spend 30 minutes a day using more than 10% of what it's capable of.  A cloud service provider can use almost all of that processing power, 24 hours a day.  They can sell that same machine as a subscription to 20 or even 50 people each for 20$/month.  At the price you're willing to pay a cloud service provider can have their investments get paid back in months.  Cloud SAAS companies are willing to accept much higher hardware prices because even with those higher costs, they still get paid off practically instantly.",

I believe the majority has been purchased for the year from the actual mfg. like nvidia has bought most of the ram that will actually be produced this year by the mfg. Actual shortage for consumers due to nvidia buying literally the majority of what comes off the assembly line. One company alone is account long for 23% of all ram made Globally to be purchased and used by them. That doesn’t include nvidia. Easily at least 50% of what’s going to be made will not go to stores or retail of any kind. ",

So nothing has been decided yet. And it’s certainly not “illegal.”\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_312",
