We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on. Every \"safety\" feature that requires unmasking is another brick in the wall of a corporate panopticon that would make Bentham blush.",

And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

As bad as this article sounds, the damage is worse. Until non governmental investigations happen, we the people won’t know the full scope because anyone in power now will deny, deflect this into oblivion. The proof is there, but may age out of audit logs before too long unless everyone involved or suspected of involvement is forced to preserve everything. I like the part where doge employees disclosed data to some group seeking to overturn election and 1000 individuals info was given to Elmo. Why? Why would a South African citizen need private data on Americans? \n\nDid you know ISPs are required to retain logs for a year? Did you know they started switching some stuff to starlink? Suppose starlink is retaining these traffic logs? Will anyone do anything until after the retention period expires?",

              "text": "> Even if Discord partners with the most ethical, privacy-respecting age verification company imaginable, the fundamental issue remains: you cannot verify someone's age without collecting identity data, and any database of identity data will eventually be breached.\n\nYou are completely wrong on the technical elements here.\n\nTo start with: the technology to analyze images/video of the end users and calculate an age can exist entirely on the user side. There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation. \n\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w34836",

Does the AI bias us towards bad structure/ideas?\n\nIt kinda goes back to when do you design something yourself vs rely on a library? Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware. It forces software developers to stop assuming every increasing hardware capability can makeup for sloppy and inefficient code -- forces us to actually go back and optimize things.",

It's about 95% correct at it, which is fine - anything it fucks up is caught and reassigned. \n\n\nThat's not a full job, though, it's a few hours a week. I reorganized a few tasks to balance the workload but i'd need 10+ processes all done this way and enough transferrable tasks to consolidate before I could lose a person from it.

AI generated 15 or so pages of content with a lot of detail and well written, but it needed to be closely proofread and checked for accuracy.  It turned a 20 hour job into a 60 hour job, but the end result was a win.",

I'm burnt the fuck out and see no clear path to advance.\n\nI can't upgrade my PC because AI companies with circular deals of imaginary money got to claim the entire hardware market.\n\nAlso we are likely to have the dot com crash slash great depression x 100 because our entire economy is one big gamble on AI that isn't working out.\n\nAlso the environment is being conpletely destroyed.\n\nAlso we live in a surveillance state run by billionaire pedophiles.\n\nAlso China is out competing the US in every conceivable way, and it's not even close.\n\nI love technology, like I actually do. But we could build a good future that works for people broadly and makes our lives better. Or we could build a dystopian hell that we might not survive.... because all the worst most evil people consolidated all the power, we are racing down the worst possible path.",

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term. CBS thinks it can slip in and get some oarks (or avoid some penalties) by cozying up to the ghouls in power, because they assume none of us will care or remember in the long term. \n\nI hope we all make them eat that arrogantm unamerican assumption; but I fear that we won’t. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8x1oSGb/",

But there is another formation very similar to monopolies called oligopolies. An oligopoly is a \"small number of players in a market\" instead of a **mono**poly, which is just one player.\n\nHow we know if a market is an oligopoly or a healthy competitive market is based on how much power each individual player has. If a single player can completely warp a market, then the market is not a healthy competition, and it requires more players.\n\nBillionaires have so much power, enough to buy entire industries, just to shut them down if they feel like it. Their power is so disproportionate compared to the average Joe. We would never accept this in a healthy business market. But it's totally normal (for a lot of people) on a citizen level.\n\nAlmost all of our modern problems is due to the fact billionaires are treating countries like their playgrounds. Tax them until they're no longer billionaires would fix a fuckload of our problems, while also allowing our government to y'know, do things again. I'd much rather a government handle these things than billionaires for the simple fact, if a billionaire is evil, you can't do shit. If a government is evil, you can vote them out.\n\nIf a politician isn't talking about taxing billionaires, they're trying to \"go along to get along.\" When ANYONE can see how fucked up they are making the world.",

He stole the presidency. Exactly like he tried to do in 2020, just this time with the already compromised tabulator machines tuned more aggressively to guarantee it.\n\nDo not take my word for it, here's the actual data (and even though this video is now several months old and there is much more they've found, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as you might expect with criminals). Please see for yourself and if you trust the data (not simply conspiracy theory talk) share with anyone who still thinks \"America got it wrong\" or we need to get out and vote more.  We did, and Kamala would have won, decisively, had our votes actually been counted correctly. It's the compromised, privately owned tabulators (vote counting machines) that turned votes for Kamala into votes for Trump in all the swing states, after a certain threshold of votes were counted on each machine. These folks and other independent teams of analysts like them, are doing us a great service:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ru8SHK7idxs?feature=shared\nelectiontruthalliance.org\n\nAnd we've been on that road for a very long time which, unfortunately, is not surprising. This journalist research article, written just before Obama's 2nd term, dives into the long history of election fraud in the US and how, especially in the digital tabulation age, it has been setup to get us to the point where whomever has control of them can literally steal an election:\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/\n\nSo, whenever Maga or Republicans say they want to investigate Election Fraud (\"by the Dems\"), it's to accuse and look in the right, yet as we know, and as the data evidence demonstrates, their accusation is yet again projection.",

They really do not like what ICE (ICE= US Gestapo don't believe me look up and read about what the Nazi Gestapo did prior to and during WWII) is doing in our states, cities, and our neighborhoods. Read about world history, read about Nazi Germany and the horrors that were perpetrated there. Question everything you are told by those who hold the power.",

Sorry, not sorry, but if you're still relying heavily on ABC, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, etc. you are playing into their hands. Every single one of those is owned by someone who has the exact same class interests as Donald Trump, and as such, will not meaningfully challenge him at the cost of their own position in society. When push comes to shove, they *will* align themselves with him. There is no reason for a billionaire to own a news empire or a social media network that isn't to sanitize their own reputations, and to curry favor for themselves among the centers of power in the world. \n\nIf we REALLY want to deal them a blow, then we need to take our views to non-profit and ideally (because non-profits rely on donos which can be and almost always are from powerful, wealthy individuals who expect a return on that investment) journalist-owned media. The Associated Press is arguably the best \"major\" network, as it is not \"owned\" by any one group - but the controlling members are the major networks who ARE owned and controlled by billionaires. Better sources of news would be, like, 404 Media (tech), Aftermath (gaming), Drop Site News (politics), Hell Gate (New York news), ProPublica, etc. Where we can, we should be giving these sites your membership fees, views, clicks, web hits, etc. These are good journalists, usually a diaspora from some old mainstay website's \"restructuring\". They're not just randos who threw together a website, but real, dogged journalists with real work behind them and they can do BETTER work when they've got food in their bellies, a healthcare plan, a safe and secure place to live, etc. For we who have SOME means, that means it's up to us to not just use these sites, but kick over a little monthly dono as well.\n\nAs long as we depend and expect these news sources owned by people who are actively working against us, to work FOR us, we can continue to expect disappointment. They own these outlets and these platforms for a reason, and that reason is *specifically* to undermine our power and to divide us. Also, like, I know I mentioned the traditionally \"liberal\" news outlets and declined to mention Fox, Newsmax, OANN, but that's because... like, I expect conservatives a.) not to care and b.) generally to be willingly obsequious serfs on the modern digital feifs. They don't care that billionaires own these, because they're deliberate simps to power. I expect liberals, in theory, aren't.",

The tonal shift in the company from Bezos (still a dickhead) to Jassy was so noticeable: fear of layoffs, anti-employee RTO and comp policies, tracking badge swipes and time in office.

I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years.

Discord has a huge number of customers having more or less cornered the VOIP market for gaming related activities, notice how discord already links to various game accounts, and to twitch, and it has always had overlays showing what game you're currently playing, which means it is collecting all that Data, and that Data is valuable.\n\nDiscord wants to look as valuable as possible so they can make a lot of money selling the company piece by tiny piece, and they've already been forced to implement ID verification in several countries, so they have the perfect excuse, they say they won't sell your data, but that's not a contract just a promise with no garauntee other than their word, and if someone else like microsoft for instance decided to quietly purchase a controlling share, well they never even promised not to sell your data.\n\nThis is just a combination of greed and stupidity, Discord picked a singularly bad moment to try this shit given what's going on in the world given wider political and consumer confidence issues which make the public much less trusting, but in a calmer moment in history this wouldn't have blown up nearly as much.",

Which is itself just expensive IRC for new wave tech bros.  Which is ironic because IRC is IRC for old school tech bros.  \n  \nThe point is that for basic realtime group comms, there's no reason to not use whatsapp or signal.  And there's no reason at all to use any of those as forum replacements.  Hell, even reddit would make a better curated forum platform than discord.  The only thing even slightly unique about Discord is the way it broke things out into searchable channels and topics.  \n  \nDiscord only really exists because it got momentum and maybe even a bit of brand loyalty from a group of people who have never really had to migrate between internet services before, so the whole thing just comes off as a bit amusing to people from the ICQ/AIM/mIRC era.",

Discord has settled on Nitro features, but the problem is that the base product is so good that a lot of folks will not have much need for those extended features, which means Discord will have to enshittify or find some killer use case to get people to pay, which I haven't really seen yet.\n\nIt's not the issue in this case, though-- this is a decision that results from the idiotic British age verification rules, that Discord has inexplicably decided needs to roll out across the globe. For most of the world, privacy-abusing and pointless face verification isn't required by law, and a lot of people will not put up with it-- the question is how many people won't put up with it and whether it's justly fatal to the company.

I ask you though, how many threads do you see on those posts about people discussing alternatives to Discord that they should switch to? My experience is that very few people are actually talking about where they are going to migrate to, which signals to me that most people are here to be outraged and not do anything about it. If people actually cared, these posts would have tons of people discussing where to migrate their social circles to.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dinosaur that remembers the days of having TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and Skype all installed to play with different friend groups. Discord has been awfully convenient for consolidating the different gamer groups, but for me, the time has come to move on and return to the days of having multiple platforms installed to keep in touch. Be the change you want to see in the world and stop waiting for everyone else to move first right?",

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

And they can afford these failures because they'll still have money left over even if some of them fail.\n\nTo add to that, they have networks of rich friends and family who do the same thing, so if they start a new business, they've got some investors available to instantly give them capital to get it started. So an idea tried on a whim — such as an online book store that could potentially expand to other products — can have instant success over the competition just because a bunch of rich buddies poured money into it and kept it running even when it wasn't turning a profit.\n\nSo there's no genius involved in wealth, nor anything clever at all. It's just the aristocracy keeping themselves in power through the only thing they have: too much money.",

The algorithm he created is horrible, he can be bought for political means, he has turned the app into literal trash compared to what it was. I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved. It has no originality no design and no practicality anymore, it's a mess.",

                  "text": "Nearly every service in existence that has persistent chat history stores your messages you send in plain text. There are very few that instead store encrypted messages. Those that do are typically using E2EE. And the reason most services don't use E2EE is because it's incredibly inconvenient.\n\nUsers typically want to be able to do useful things like search through their past messages, which is something you cannot do if the messages are stored encrypted unless you load all of the messages onto your device to decrypt them before performing the search, which becomes a massive drain on both client and server resources as chat histories grow larger. Additionally, if the keys are lost, then depending on the implementation, you could end up losing access to the entirety of your message history. These are generally considered problematic by the majority of end users.\n\nE2EE sacrifices convenience for enhanced privacy and security. If you need that enhanced privacy and security, then you'll usually be happy with the trade-off of losing convenience, but most users don't need the enhanced privacy and security and would much rather have convenient functionality. Thus messages tend to be stored in plain text so as to facilitate that functionality (developer laziness notwithstanding).\n\nPasswords are a different matter entirely. Any service not run by an imbecile will neither store them encrypted nor store them in plain text, they're stored hashed. And this is fine because you don't need to know what the password is, you just need to know if the password someone gives you is the correct one, so scrambling the password in the exact same way and comparing the scrambled results is sufficient. Anyone storing passwords in plain text in 2026 needs to be executed.",

You’re just moving the same problems to a new service.\n\nStaut looks strong but it’s missing screen sharing and that’s a feature too many people utilize and undoubtedly, people are just going to go back to Discord when they want to screen share and can’t anymore. Because all the righteousness only works for the moment but if people experience inconvenience or feel they could do things on Discord they can’t do on Staut, then they are just going to go back to Discord when the fire fizzles out.\n\nFluxer is the closest thing to a feature complete transition from Discord and I think that’s the route we should go. It has stability issues for the moment and the dev is working to refactor their code but it’s open source in all the right ways, the dev is very responsive to requests from users and he recently just changed their Contributor License Agreement to be more open source friendly. It’s also based out of Sweden and adheres to GDPR and allows you to self host. It’s the culmination of all the best aspects of Discord without any of the bullshit. It’s only problem right now is it’s not quite ready for the big stage and needs more time in the oven but it’s blatantly the closest thing you’re going to get to an open source Discord and that’s really what you need if you want people to leave Discord and stay off Discord. \n\nIt’s not dissimilar to Signals success. It was enough likes What’sApp and had most of the features people actually used from WhatsApp so the transition was easy. If we are going to pick alternatives to Discord then Fluxer is probably the most analogous.\n\nFor the mainstream, you only really get one shot at migrating users to a new platform. If the alternative sucks or doesn’t have the features people use daily, then undoubtedly people are going to roll back over to Discord over time. Further, if it takes too long and you let this moment pass where people are up in arms and they slowly come to accept the reality, then the moment will be lost and most people you know will stay on Discord and that’s how Discord will get away with all of this. It’s like the Reddit API stuff all over again. People just got used to the new rules and moved on to being angry about something else. If the transition to a new platform is inconvenient, not feature complete and gives people a reason to stay on the old platform, then humans being creatures of comfort and convenience will learn to deal and stay on Discord.

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable.

It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it.

The majority of audiophiles aren't spending that much on cables nowadays since they're well aware that everything is digital. The custom cabling is mostly done for aesthetic reasons.\n\nThe manner in which the audio was recorded, compressed, and encoded, and the quality of the speakers they're played back on absolutely do matter. Lossless audio played through $200 wired headphones sounds far better than bluetooth audio played through $5 earbuds. You can carry a clear signal through mud, but you can't record through mud and you can't play audio back through mud.",

Even emailed several guitar manufacturers asking them what 5 factors give a guitar it's sound and they all said several things but also included the neck design and wood used to be a driving\nfactor.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n02tImce3AE?si=yP9NdyRcu3_OtBhl",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

In the comments is a mix of people trying to talk shit about people not wanting to be secretly record, truly ignorant people who dont get why its a bad thing but are worried to damage the expensive glasses and very obvious perverts who are excited about the info. \n\n\nEdit2: after searching YouTube just for \"meta glasses\" the algorithm is now even serving up \"how to disable the LED\" videos on my YouTube front page.

Unless it's something super egregariously positive, the news that gets reported/ things you remember are more often going to be negative things. \n\nThink about driving, walking, and human interactions throughout your day. You likely see hundreds, if not thousands of examples of positive interactions. People driving predictably so traffic flows, people moving over to let you walk past, someone holds the door for you politely. \n\nYet you generally don't remember that, you will remember the *one* driver that didn't move over to let you merge, the one walker that stopped and blocked your path, or the one person that didn't hold the door. \n\nThe news media gets more interaction out of negative and, doom and gloom, and ragebaiting than they do out of happiness and rainbows reporting. They do need to report **some** good things, otherwise if it's all negative thing their viewers will get burned out and not bother to view anymore, but the negative reporting is still the biggest main draw.",

Kuhl took a moment to issue a stark warning to anyone wearing AI glasses in the courtroom: stop recording with them and delete the footage, or face contempt.\n\nMany courts generally forbid recording during trials, though there are exceptions. However, while the judge did seem to be worried about recording in general, she also had another concern: the privacy of the jury.\n\n“If your glasses are recording, you must take them off,” the judge said, per the *Los Angeles Times*. “It is the order of this court that there must be no facial recognition of the jury. If you have done that, you must delete it. This is very serious.”\n\nCurrently, Meta’s AI glasses do not include the ability to identify the names of the people a wearer views through them, but that’s not likely what the judge meant in her concerns about “facial recognition.”\n\n[Read more on Fast Company.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91495248/meta-ai-glasses-court-judge-threatens-wearers-contempt-mark-zuckerberg-testimony)",

They’re actively pushing against the RTO agenda that’s been a priority since like 2022",

The middle managers running the meeting were trying to give us “tips and tricks to use AI to speed up your day”. Things like using AI to summarize emails for the day, or Teams group chat AI summaries…\n\nThere are definitely places we can use it especially in software. Creating automated tests, building out basic templates for web pages, git merge reviews to catch simple issues, etc… but management just wants us to use it for fucking everything. Every single company is just trying to force it as much as possible because so many people have committed to paying for it or they have a huge fear that they will miss some crazy opportunity if they aren’t forcing everyone to use it.\n\nIt definitely has benefits but the way companies are acting like we can use it for literally every waking moment of our lives is getting exhausting.

If you go three connections further from the bombed out semiconductor fab you notice that almost everything is unable to be produced or repaired any longer. This was already kinda obvious in the early 2000's when flooding spiked HDD prices and an earthquake spiked RAM prices. Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily. It's like a game of global economic MAD without nukes.",

In response most companies like Microsoft are trying to force the use of AI, hoping for a wild adoption by consumers, but it's not working. As AI is being integrated in medicine, driving,... and playing a major role in coding, reports are surging about misdiagnosis, driving failure and butchered code, showing that the AI \"miracle\" might in fact be a mirage. \nWe're heading into a big wall here.

Things are available if you have money to burn but for a lot of people they’ll probably just wait until prices come down.\n\nConsumers are going to get used to holding onto their devices for longer and it’ll take a lot to get them to spend again after the prices drop. Manufacturers are raking in the profits with AI now, but it’ll be a very different story when that bubble bursts.\n\nHopefully the companies that do this end up losing customer loyalty to competitors, I switched to AMD recently and am probably never going back.",

Sometimes the grade book. Sometimes the submit tool, which is neither of the above but sometimes connected. \n\nDoing a daily sweep of all 3 for 8 classes is *a lot*, because you can’t even go “straight down the line,” in any of them - it’s 24 tasks just to confirm you’ve checked your TODO. And that’s ignoring classes that have side apps whose assignments are wholly contained in that app, so add a handful of apps, which I’m not trying to sound overwhelmed with “oh no, I loaded 4 apps and checked 4 pages.”\n\nI’m saying if an adult, professionally employed as a technologist, who logs in to a dozen system a day for work, finds the 30+ specific places to check for TODOs (and then imagine getting “off tracked” actually *doing* an assignment) overwhelming, just imagine how kids are.\n\nAnd, for some unimaginable reason, they have no textbooks; so **when** a child is lost and confused, just think somewhere mixed in with those dozens of places to look for work is a PowerPoint slide pretending to be the chapter from this week’s textbook.",

When students retain the basic information conveyed during lectures, they are able to moved more quickly onto the application, analysis, evaluation of the content and later creation of media and concepts using that content. \n\nThis is evident in elementary students up to post graduates. I even saw the difference in my education myself. During undergrad, I used a laptop and took notes on that in the classes that allowed but moved on to regular notebook paper by junior and senior year, choosing to transfer the notes from my handwritten notebooks to typed files simply to maintain the information in a better to read format later. The handwriting made it much easier to gather the information and the subsequent transferring to digital documents further cemented the knowledge so that I barely had to study before tests. \n\nHowever, during grad school, about 8 years later, I didn’t want to get a laptop so my partner had bought me an iPad Pro second hand. I had iPads in the past and never used them, but the iPad Pros had just introduced the Apple Pencils which completely revolutionized the iPad for me. I took all my notes on the notability app (I believe). I was quickly able to switch between pen and marker colors and really define how I was organizing my notes as I took them. I didn’t feel the need to rewrite them in a digital document because it had the ability to convert what I wrote. I should also note that most of my courses in grad school were music theory and high level analysis, so it wouldn’t have been a help to retype these things. \n\nBut I retained that information and was able to review it so much better than I ever had been able to with typed notes. I’m not saying this is an absolute fact of learning, but studies support my claim. \n\nAnd when I was teaching, students would complain about their struggles to learn concepts. I would ask to see their notes. I was so surprised to learn that they did absolutely everything on their Chromebooks - and the kicker was that most of the teachers simply gave them their lecture outlines instead of making them notate the content down.

              "text": "That is just one small issue. But the point is valid. The devices i give my kids all have parental controls and internet filters. The school issued ipad has zero protection. Absolutely zero content controls. Whats even more ridiculous is that the teacher will show youtube videos in class to aid in teaching but she shows them WITH youtube ads. My kids come home asking about things they should not know about. Wtf? If you are using google classroom why are their ads in YouTube? Ridiculous . \n\nThe bigger problem is that the teachers use the ipads as pacifiers. There are peers in my kids class that get extra time for tests and extra help for work. While the teachers are busy spending time working with other kids, mine spend 2 hours a day reading. 2 hours of screen time reading. Not reading content the teacher prescribes but reading whatever they want like “graphic novels”, also known as comic books. The school developed AR goals for the kids to justify all the reading but its all bullshit. Its a pacifier thats being justified.\n\nKids spend 6 hours in school. 1 hour lunch/recess. 1 hour special. 2 hours reading. Teachers only teach maybe 2 hours. Bullshit\n\nOn top of that, they go edu tech software that one of my kids read to so that AI can determine how well they read. Seriously!?\n\nTwo years ago. The school district moved the goal posts by changing the grading rubric from 5 levels to 3. Guess what, now the kids on the borderline “meet standards”. \n\n\n\nBut hey, every school board meeting i go to im told look how great the school is doing. Well yes, that will happen when you change how you measure success. \n\nBest part was a few weeks ago when my 11 year old tells me the teacher taught them how to start writing by using chatgpt to help them. \n\nSo I completely agree with the many many articles that are highlighting a very bad situation in elementary education right now. I like the parents mentioned in the article plan to meet with the supe and hand him these fucking ipads and tell him to start doing his job. ",

Of course, none of these examples supports always being on chromebooks for every class all the time, but they have a time and place that blanket opt-outs can't address. \n\nI think we're at a critical point where community pushback can moderate technology use in schools, but I also think opting out at an individual level is on balance a bad approach that can disadvantage/ostracize students working in an existing curriculum and puts a huge burden on already overworked teachers to create completely distinct education models for individual kids. \n\n",

They don't even properly edit their manuals.

These are bought from companies that have unqualified people, just a customer sales agent, pushing cookie cutter products. These products are often not well researched and developed. They are blatant money grabs and these companies will slap on the latest labels to attract the unqualified curriculum directors. Ex: Science of Reading being put on everything now. If you're an educator and know just a smidge of SOR, you can easily see through the bs. \n\nYSK: if your district has a curriculum director or curriculum coaches (DON'T even get me started on these leeches), you should petition to remove those positions. They are high paying positions and they do not improve student experience or outcomes. They do put additional pressure on teachers by increasing demands and reducing hands-on support.

They can look if they’re interested but aren’t required to do so.\n\nHell, the online platforms can’t even average grades properly.

If a kid learns how to type and use a basic desktop they really don't need the schools to provide them with laptops and tablets. \n\nA laptop is just a portable desktop so if you know how to use a desktop you will figure out a laptop. A tablet is basically a bigger version of a mobile smartphone which isn't difficult to use either. \n\nI'm tired of people giving excuses for public schools wasting money on tablets and laptops. You don't need to be exposed to easy to use technology every day to learn how to use it. A friend of mine homeschooled her kids until they were in 7th grade and didn't buy them tablets or smartphones. They used desktops at home. When they started public school the kids were able to figure out how to use the tablets in a day. It's not rocket science. You don't need special training every day of your life to learn how to use them. \n\nPeople act like kids are going to enter the job market and be handed a tablet immediately and then their brains explode or something. 🤣",

          "text": "***TL;DR:*** *High school daughter has flourished when switching to books and handwritten notes (at a private school) from the typical 1:1 learning when she was in 4th-8th grade.*\n\nDad here of a current 10th grader. My wife and I ended up putting our daughter into private school a few years ago. It wasn't because of the teachers, or the curriculum. It was because classwork, reading, homework, projects, everything was entirely swallowed by tech. Our daughter did not do well with a 1:1 device.\n\nFrom the 4th grade through 8th grade, almost everything was electronically completed. She had teachers that did teach, but it was often taught from some electronic platform, which maybe additional white-board writing for further explanations.\n\nIn general though, things were PDFs or online textbooks or other online platforms where she had to complete her work or readings. She retained so little. Her math? More often than not, it was done on a touch-sensitive Chromebook with a stylus. So if you wanted to try and remember how you did a homework probably from a couple weeks ago? It either didn't exist, or you had to wade through innumerable image files.\n\nAnyway, I could go so much further into it, but everyone here knows how typical 1:1 device and teaching is like.\n\nHere's what we've noticed over the last 1.5 years after enrolling her in a private school that teaches like schools taught 20 years ago. Even when she could focus in her classes, she retained a *lot* less when reading from an online document/book/scanned-image than she does from physical papers and books in her private school now. She also retains sooo much more when she is essentially \"forced\" (out of necessity for capturing the important material and getting a decent grade, not \"physically forced\") to take notes in her own hand, on actual paper, during class versus creating a Google doc or slide deck to \"take notes\" in. She retains a lot more when the important info is coming from a teacher versus when coming from a video. She retains a lot more when math work is expected to be done on physical paper versus on a screen.\n\nBasically, her switching to the non-tech method of learning has done wonders for her retention, interest and ability to connect things. And again, nothing against the teachers. My wife and I really thought they were great overall.\n\nAnyway, at least to people like my daughter (moderate ADHD and typical teen), *every single measurable aspect* of learning and retention improved when she switched to a school that teaches kids using teachers and physical books and papers, and expecting the kids to take notes in their own hand using pen/pencil. It is night and day.\n\nAnd last thing I'll add is that, she was always a very average student. The school she is in now is a very high expectation type of school, which worried my wife and I a lot, wondering if our daughter could handle it. It turns out, she can, and she said a few months ago that she always thought she was bad at math, and never knew she could *actually* be good at it. It nearly brought me to tears.\n\nAt least for a typical kid like my daughter, I honestly believe that the recent way of teaching/learning is **making millions of kids into intellectually** ***less*** **than what they otherwise could have been**. I could say a lot more about all of this, but it's already too long of a post, so I'll stop here.",

But the teachers (at this particular school and district) literally don’t have time to make copies and get all the papers graded. They have 45 minutes of prep before and after school. At least two of those days a week the prep time is taken up by meetings. The school only has one big printer they lease and some of the teachers who were lucky enough to have grants have a printer in their classroom. If u think about it, 30 children. Half hour to 45 minute long lessons. 8 or so lessons a day that’s about 300 pages a day, that’s if they only have one sheet of work to do per lesson. That doesn’t count actually finding the right worksheet for the lessons or in a worse case making the sheet from scratch. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to do everything on paper all day long anymore. With everyone again in this particular school and I know many others being on such different levels of knowledge they can’t realistically be doing the exact same work every day. So that’s even more variation. With the chromebooks they have the work there. And the kids who need help can get it as they need it and the kids who don’t, don’t need to be waiting on everyone else. If there’s some issue with the worksheet for some students the teacher can go and make corrections or change it and tailor it to some students differently then others. Which again wouldn’t really be possible if it was all done on paper.",

It also depends on the purpose of that particular composition; since writing information that you already know in order to communicate it to another person is more focused on the reader's ingestion of that information. This is most communication, and that's why typing it out on a keyboard is ideal - it's faster to make (type) AND easier to read.\n\nTaking notes is a great example of communicating information you DON'T know to yourself. And this self-communication is instant—You're not writing information to a future version of you, either. That would fall into the first category. You are taking notes just to go through the act of writing the information, and the purpose is not to review the notes later (though, that is a bonus).\n\nTLDR: To your brain and muscles, the 'A' key and the 'S' key are almost exactly the same thing (you push a key). However, actually writing the two letters 'A' and 'S' is a very different task, and this added effort solidifies the actual information behind the words into your head. Much more than typing them or reading them.",

This process disproportionately impacted conservative news sources, to the point that they were complaining about the 'obvious bias' at facebook. \n\nBut of course the reason that the stories were being removed was because they were overwhelmingly more likely to post fake news, stories without any sources cited and obvious bullshit that even a child could tell was fishy. \n\nSo, naturally, because of the conservative backlash (which ironically, deliberately distorted the facts), facebook hired some prominent right wing figures to leadership positions, who immediately set about 'fixing' the problem. Which basically amounted to issuing a blanket notice that stories from some preferred news sources could no longer be flagged. \n\nIssue solved. ",

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

So it was never gonna do amazing.\n\nThe Lightning…just proves they don’t understand their customers. If you need to haul for a decent distance, this would need longer breaks more often to charge. And the charging spots aren’t designed for someone with a trailer or big vehicle. On the other hand, if you look at the usual EV owner, they drive around town in the city. Massive trucks are awful in the city. All that’s aside from the pricing issues.\n\nTransit vans…companies don’t care about the environment. They care about up time and cost. So some probably sold, but companies are gonna have a hard time justifying the premium for an EV.",

For some unknown reason, EV interior design with full electronics is far worse than analog buttons. They lag, they need software updates that wipe all custom settings, and heating/cooling functions cannot be accessed when the screen is slightly dirty.\n\nAnd of course:\n7 ) they look really, really dumb in comparison to other vehicles, which is polarizing to a population that is historically opposed to major changes.\n8.) Did i mention that they look really stupid? Because most do. And yes, aesthetics matter. A lot....\n\nIt's not a mystery as to why they are losing money. They want to hide every detail of their new vehciles until they come out. Which is hilarious because they fired all of their QA departments; the only people who would have told them that these features are terrible. \nThey need to hire honest/normal people to critique new product ideas, not echo chambers of yes-men pandering to their bosses whims. \n\nAlmost feels like all of the car company CEOs got together 10 years ago and hatched a plan to screw over EVs so they can keep reaping oil benefits. \n\nDon't u dare talk about my tin foil hat... it's shiney.",

Even if you can go 400 miles, if you're taking a road trip, that is still a lot of stops, just for a recharge.

Finally, like Canada, Brazil has a relatively modest military budget for its size, so it needed a highly cost effective aircraft.

If the author of this article were actually paying attention, it's been clear for several days now (so before the February 13th publication of this article) that Canada was going to be purchasing the F-35. Canada has been quietly purchasing spare parts and lower profile items for the F-35 which wouldn't make sense if they were going to cut the contract at 16. \n\n2. Given that Canada has already committed to 16 F-35s, it would cost more for less capability to backfill the rest of the Canadian Air Force equipment with Swedish Gripens. The Gripen and the F-35 are reasonably comparable in purchase price, and while the Gripen maintenance costs are lower, having to maintain two full separate maintenance supply chains and training systems would negate any of that cost advantage. \n\n3. The F-35 is just better. And while it is true that the Gripen is a mature platform, that's also another way of saying that there's not a lot of room for improvement. And the current Gripen is several steps down from the current F-35, while the F-35 has a lot more ceiling to it. \n\nAny technology subreddit, regardless of the politics, would have to understand that the current technology, the future technological ceiling, not to mention the economics regarding ongoing costs and maintenance makes the F-35 the obviously better choice. \n\nSo, of course, Reddit being Reddit, this sub is going to completely ignore that. \n\nAll Canada is doing right now is Kabuki theater to tell everyone that they're angry with the US, while they rack up contractual delay costs just end up buying the planes that they would have bought in the first place. They're just going to spend more money at it, to pay Lockheed Martin some extra delay fees. \n\nYay. Nice to see the Canadian politicians are competent at handling this kind of thing. 🙄",

If this chaotic administration survives, it is more likely that the US will get even less trustworthy if that’s possible.\n\nI’d rather integrate  more with Sweden. They act like partners. Not like a psychotic, cheating, abusive spouse.\n\nAnd besides, no matter what jet we get our small number wouldn’t be a game changer in an actual hot war anyways. It’s more likely thy will be used in support of a European partner and the Gripen should work fine in this capacity.",
