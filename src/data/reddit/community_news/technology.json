This happens because their perceived image of \"loving and caring parent\" crashes headfirst into the reality of \"I sent my child away to a place where s/he was abused in every way conceivable\". The two are irreconcilable so to protect their ego they just deflect at every step.       \n\nI'm 100% expecting the same reaction out of MAGA chuds: they'll be unable to cope with the reality of \"I helped elect a fascist government\" because it'd destroy their perceived image of \"proud American defender of democracy and the constitution\" and so they'll go full on Deflectionville mode.              \n\nHell, we've already seen that with the murder of Renee Good: they can't accept that they helped elect a government that can and will freely murder citizens and so cue all the \"she tried to run him over/she was obstructing the way/she should've obeyed\" deflections. With the latest killing they'll go into deflection mode even harder.       \n\nIf it's of any comfort, for both the parents of kids who survived the TTI and MAGA chuds, deep deep deep deep down, under literal mountains of copium, ***they know what they did.***",

It was hilarious seeing him become like Voldemort.  DON'T SAY THAT NAME.  \n\nYou can't let the Republicans just wash this off of them by firing \"the bad ones.\"  They are ALL culpable.  The Republican party needs to fade into history as a disgraced group of fascists that destroyed our alliances and murdered innocent Americans in the street by sending untrained Proud Boys out in uniforms.  The Republican Party needs to go the way of the Nazis and the Partito Nazionale Fascista, España franquista, etc.  Those motherfuckers clapped after they shot Pretti.  That's some evil Republican shit, and they ALL need to own it because they've done it.  Name them.",

The murder of Pretti was too indefensible for people to support them if they kept pushing things.  They want to turn up the temperature and get people to retaliate *without* fully losing their base.\n\nThat’s why they backed down after January 6th too, they knew they couldn’t win back then.  Or why they brought back Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nMy guess is they pull ICE out of Minnesota at some point soon, to act like they’re chickening out, then a few months later pull the same shit in another blue city, hoping to provoke riots with more “ambiguous” killings.  They want to make this shit seem normal before they escalate further.\n\nIt’s not, don’t let anyone tell you that it is.",

Dollars spent at Republican companies are dollars funneled to the Heritage Foundation. Money given to states like Ohio or Louisiana is money spent sending troops to kidnap children and kill people.\n\nIf you consistently do business with a company, you have power. You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to search the exact companies you give money to, and where they give your money.\n\nTrade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to the nonprofits successfully fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard.

There's like 150 million US users... I get the feeling that number hasn't really even been slightly dented\n\nEdit: I've looked through a few articles and I still can't find any actual numbers. Does this 150% account for any bumps in new *install* rates or anything like that? I hate tiktok, but this seems like fluff since nobody seems to be reporting something like \"10% of us tiktok users have deleted their accounts\". Plus, with all the errors the app has had lately, I'm wondering how many people thought it was their phone causing it and did a fresh install to try to fix it",

In the US, TikTok is still the most downloaded app (5 million times last month according to SensorTower in the US) and #1 entertainment app still according to App Store ranking (not overall rank). If 2.5x increases, not that much of US users uninstalled.\n\nThe scale of their user base is the key factor here. Think about it from a simple user math perspective: it's all about whether new users can replace the ones who leave. TikTok has over 130 million users in the US alone. Let's say a normal week sees 1 million uninstalls. A 2.5x spike pushes that to 2.5 million. That sounds huge, but it's still less than 2% of their total US user base. It just means for that one week, their new signups likely didn't keep up with the spike in people leaving. The platform is big enough to take that hit. (In a theoretical sense) \n\nIt's a noticeable dip, for sure. But their user acquisition engine is always running to help offset those losses. It would hurt their growth ratio for that, but a platform that large is built to absorb temporary shocks like that. It really just confirms the slow bleed idea instead of a sudden collapse.\n\nAlso, not that a lot of user would prompt to branch out. In January 21, 2026, apptopia reported that those audience would move to TV, Streaming, and/or gambling apps.\n\nhttps://apptopia.com/en/blog/tiktok-dau-growth-has-fallen-churned-users-are-not-going-to-competitors/\n\nhttps://app.sensortower.com/overview/835599320?country=US",

They wanted to show the world their system was working so they cut back on most the horrible things they did (mostly just tried to hide it better for a few weeks) and openly allowed people in even from races and cultures they were oppressing. \n\nIt's basically the same thing Qatar did for the world cup. They relaxed a lot of their rules to make it more welcoming to others. They didn't actually change anything country wide, they just tried to be a bit nicer during the event so people could come in, see how amazing they are and then leave.\n\nThe US is going the opposite route. It's doubling down on all the shit its doing. Outright saying it will try to deport people who dare go to the games and outright banning many countries from even being able to come watch the games at all.",

So yeah, it's looking like a real shit storm for Fox and anyone around The World Cup....\n\nThat all said, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if nothing changes and The World Cup goes off without any issues. There's way too much money invested already. Much the same as the 1936 Olympics, we will see a few standing up and making a point to say the US didn't deserve the sport being hosted there and that's worth more, historically then any boycott. There was a \"boycott\" for the 36 games, even a whole different games set that year in Spain (didn't happen), but we don't talk about that...we sure as fuck know the image of Jesse Owens standing next to Nazi's geting his gold medal. Sometimes the best protest is run with the enemy and make your voice heard when the stage is yours.",

They're confident you've got a few decades of a reduction in standing before they have to consider American soft power something they need to take into account.\n\nThere's plenty of other indicators of American loss of soft power in the past few years, but the Catholic Church didnt survive a thousand years by taking risky bets. They see American influence going down, and a potential for religious movement within the US to increase, with a potential of their own expansion as a result. Not many places they can position themselves as the more liberal religious position.",

Soft power is not *good,* and by its nature it's even more coercive than hard power.\n\nSoft power can be as much a cudgel as hard power. Soft power is most often like a mafioso coming into your shop saying \"wow, nice place here, shame if something happened to it.\"\n\nIn terms of soft and hard power, it's not \"carrot and stick.\" It's more like \"threat of stick and stick.\"\n\nAmerica's use of sanctions, weaponization of trade arrangements (e.g. twisting Canada's arm to impose their own massive tariffs on Chinese EVs,) withholding of funds, etc. are all examples of the, let's say, \"morally dubious\" applications of soft power.\n\nSoft power erodes the sovereignty of other nations just as much if not more than hard power. It just bypasses the fights by way of threats.\n\nFor instance, USAID was very much an organization designed to bully. That money was not unconditional. It was given first, then used to say \"hey, if you don't deregulate your own country's oil and gas exports and allow US corporate interests to further pilfer your nation's national resources, then this money we're giving you will go away and we'll destabilize your whole-ass regime in the process.\"\n\nPrivate entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do the same things. \n\nWhen Bill Gates says \"I want to eradicate polio!\" and the country says \"yeah, uhh, we don't really have that many problems with polio, but we could really use some malaria meds,\" Bill Gates will put terms and conditions on his \"aid\" such that it CANNOT be used for malaria meds.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, Bill Gates wants a headline saying \"King Dickhead Eradicates Polio,\" not to actually help people in need. The Clinton Foundation has operated in precisely this way in Haiti as well.",

I still remember when I went in 2020, how awful the vibe was.\n\nThe convention itself was dead. There was way more interesting activity in the lobby of the St. Regis than there was at the center. When we got to the center, it was saturated with a bunch of “dead”, shit-tier web3 games and NFT marketplace platforms that we’re supposed to *”disrupt the market”* that were absolutely scams. No gamer who was there was satisfied with the offerings, and majority of the booths and kiosks were empty. I remember saying right then and there that *”This convention is dead.”* There was no reason to spend money on hotels, passes, and the bloated cost of the Bay Area to waltz around the Tenderloin and risk being approached by homeless people.\n\nNow? As if the prohibitive costs and low-participation from developers wasn’t bad enough, you could actually get arrested. Every developer has their own showcase now per platform, so there is no reason for the major players to go, either. The meetup is now almost exclusively for people pitching their games and trying to secure new rounds of funding; even then, if you are in that phase, there are cheaper and easier ways to secure deals than to attend the event. It is definitely going to go the way of E3 and die out, 100%\n\nThe other unrelated but relevant detail I remember; virtually everyone I knew who went that year caught COVID. It was a super spreader event, and the convention did virtually nothing to help prevent it from being that way. It is a weird value proposition to any developer: *”Hey, spend $3000 to come here for a few days, talk to some financiers and BD guys, leave with a chronic illness that can and will spread to your teams when you return and decommission for them for another 7-12 days!”* You combine it with the area being housed with a massive amount of homeless people who can and do steal as much as possible from convention-goers, and it just isn’t worth it.",

I would send screenshots, but I photos cant be uploaded. This is the AI overview response I got,\n\n“Based on newly released, hacked, and leaked documents from 2013–2016, Jeffrey Epstein acted as a behind-the-scenes broker in foreign policy, specifically attempting to facilitate a secret backchannel between Israel and Russia regarding the Syrian civil war.\n\nKey details regarding Epstein's involvement in Syria include:\n\nBackchannel Diplomacy: Between 2013 and 2016, Epstein acted as an intermediary between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Russian authorities to discuss the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussian Connection: Emails show Epstein advising Barak to meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss a Russian-led peace plan for Syria, with Epstein helping to craft messages for the Kremlin.\n\nTargeting Assad: The goal of these, and other, interactions was to shape US and Russian policy to align with Israeli security goals, which included removing Assad from power and opposing the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBrokering Deals: Reports from Drop Site News suggest Epstein used his network to act as a \"fixer\" at an elite level, connecting Israeli intelligence with international actors, including in discussions about Syria.\n\nContext of Leaks: These revelations emerged from emails hacked by \"Handala\" and published in late 2025, which also indicated Epstein's involvement in other geopolitical matters.\n\nSeparately, in 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed in an interview that Epstein did not commit suicide but was killed because he held \"vital secrets\".\n\nSeems pretty suspicious to me",

              "text": "The forced sale legislation was introduced under Biden, not Trump; and at the time its most prominent motivation (though likely not the only motivation) was to suppress speech critical of Israel:\n* The bill was [introduced by Mike Gallagher](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/all-actions).\n* In November 2023, Gallagher wrote an [op-ed piece](https://archive.is/5zkwq) in which he argued for banning TikTok _explicitly_ on the grounds of it being a vehicle for anti-Israel \"propaganda\".\n* Gallagher's highest campaign contributor [in the previous election cycle](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mike-gallagher/summary?cid=N00039330&cycle=2022&type=C) and indeed [across his career](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mike-gallagher/summary?cid=N00039330&cycle=CAREER&type=C), has been pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC.\n* Other pro-Israel organisations are on record expressing concern about TikTok on the same grounds. [Here's ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on MSNBC](https://x.com/realstewpeters/status/1768320953509949464) and [here's a leaked phone call](https://x.com/snarwani/status/1725138601996853424) where he states that Israel's image has \"a TikTok problem, a Gen-Z problem\". [Here's another](https://x.com/jfederations/status/1767989253735133673) calling for TikTok to be banned/censored precisely due to it being a vehicle for criticism of Israel.\n* [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtk_5c9D_Ko) Mitt Romney admitting the reason for the ban on camera, very explicitly.\n\nNot surprising that, having received a loud, clear message that the government will punish social media platforms that don't sufficiently censor content inconvenient for the government of the day, the current owners of Tiktok are now more than happy to comply with the propaganda interests of this new government-of-the-day.",

                  "text": "that's the typical cycle. we are on track to have China surpass the US in economic terms. So what does that mean? well...\n\nChina needed drastic repression when shit was really bad, quality of life was poor, and they wanted to invest massively. Now it's population is generally much better off, strong middle class, expanding and getting wealthy, so they are much more complacent (sound familiar?). China is about to reap the profits of massive investments in industry and infrastructure. they went from being the worlds factory for cheap things with slave labor and using industrial espionage and ignoring copyright laws to learn and advance as much as possible, to now being the worlds factory for nearly everything including the absolute state of the art and top tier products, having incredible universities, they now have the best cars, the best smartphones, the best robots, (they just lack the best chips, which is taiwan, which is why they want it). They have the fastest bullet trains in the world, and they have more railway of it than the circumference of the earth. they have transitioned to a service economy while also maintaining the best industries in the world, a service economy that is now benefiting from the massive infrastructure spending allowing for people to be connected and trade and move around very fast\n\nmeanwhile the US is the opposite. quality of life is deteriorating, infrastructure is crumbling, there's been zero investment just the opposite, they have been dismantling and selling everything for parts and cutting spending everywhere. the US elites now need control over the population. There are no fast trains. Everyone must go into debt to have a car to go to work, to earn to pay for the car. The roads that america kept building and building, more lanes, more highways, more parking lots, now all need repair (25-30y lifecycle of tarmac), and it costs more to replace than to build new. The debt has come asking for interest. And while the interstate highway investment back in 1950's did reap a lot of benefit, more and more roads and more cars doesn't keep scaling up. not like trains do. A train line can take 100 people or 1 million people, you can make trains longer, higher, double deck, more frequent. You can have trains so frequent that you don't even need to look at your watch, you just show up and board. miss it? there's another in 4 minutes. you can show up at the station 2 minutes before and still board. and you board and arrive downtown to downtown. meanwhile cars, good luck with the parking and the traffic. you'll spend more time going from the suburbs to downtown and finding parking than the actual trip. cars don't scale, they clog. roads don't scale - the more lanes you make, the more parking you make, the further away your destination gets. just look at a commercial area having 2 shops separated by parking lots that take 10 minutes to walk from one to the other, and then imagine if there was no parking lot, just a train rail and a platform - the shops would be next to each other and take 20 seconds to walk from one to the other. now multiply that by every shop and house. A walkable distance becomes a 30 minute drive once you add parking lots and massive roads between every house and shop. meaning, economic waste. you spent money on infrastructure that forced people to spend money on cars and oil, only to make people not move faster than simply walking. in a service economy, you need people working and spending - not wasting time inside cars, that is sure to make auto industry and oil industry rich - and no one else.\n\nthis isn't to excuse china or the usa, in past, present or future. China is still China, and the US is still the US, for better and for worse. China now has a complacent population, so they can avoid doing more Tiananmen massacres, but they will still be corrupt autocrats. The USA already had no proper individual freedoms (see 2000's laws, if i accuse you of being a terrorist i can hold you indefinitely without lawyer, court, or accountability, and put you in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and torture you, see border control 2000's laws saying that within 200 miles of an airport or land border or port, anyone can be arrested without charge, lawyer or court, on accusation of being an illegal immigrant). the right violations were already there, they just were almost never used because the USA was rich and the elite were happy keeping the status quo and extracting wealth. now these lack of rights are being used to oppress the population, because the elite wants more wealth to be extracted but people are already living paycheck to paycheck and drowning in student and medical debt, so they ransack the government (doge) and they sell out democracy (laws and executive power is traded for cash, gifts and bribes like a plane from qatar, or $1 billion a year per country for board of peace), and if this continues much more, I can totally see massacres like Tiananmen happing here (Kent state, japanese concentration camps).",

But, the new owners are desperate to make the app into a daily propaganda grind. That said, it's doomed to fail cause force feeding doesn't work.

Any echochamber is bad, and you used to be able to see a lot more diverse opinions across reddit. Think of the most conservative state you can, then go to their subreddit and see if it reflects reality. It skews our perception and makes us out of touch, like reddit was caught completely off guard when Trump won this time.\n\n>I will say that there does seem to be mods across the major subs taking down posts critical of the Trump admin and current US events, so your fear isn’t totally unwarranted.\n\nI haven't seen a single positive Trump post on the front page or /r/all since the_donald was banned like 10 years ago.

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.”\n\nGeorge Orwell, 1984",

Know your rights.\n\n*I am not a lawyer, only a former criminal intelligence analyst, if you are a lawyer please consider taking this up as a case, if you are not a lawyer consider pushing your representative to start a congressional inquiry/investigation. This is a massive violation of established laws and guidelines.*\n\nI’ve been seeing a lot of reports/videos/questions about ICE (or other agencies) taking photos of people recording them and claiming they are being added to a \"terrorist\" or \"criminal\" database solely for filming.\n\nIf this is happening in a multijurisdictional intelligence system, it is a textbook violation of federal law - specifically 28 CFR Part 23.\n\nUnder this federal regulation, law enforcement agencies are strictly prohibited from adding you to an intelligence database unless they meet these criteria:\n\nNO \"Reasonable Suspicion\": Under § 23.20(a), they cannot put you in a system unless there is reasonable suspicion of definable criminal activity. Recording a federal agent in public is a constitutionally protected act, not a crime.\n\nFirst Amendment Violations: § 23.20(b) explicitly forbids agencies from collecting or maintaining info on people based on their social or political activities unless it’s directly related to criminal conduct. Recording the government is a First Amendment right.\n\nHarassment & \"Chilling Effects\": § 23.20(l) states that intelligence projects cannot be used to harass or interfere with lawful political activities. Labeling a legal observer or a bystander a \"terrorist\" for holding a phone is a clear attempt to intimidate. (I believe this applies *even if they are lying*)\n\nFalse Information: § 23.20(g) requires that all data be accurate and relevant. Entering a \"Terrorist\" label for someone who has committed no crime is a violation of data integrity.\n\nIf this happens to you, what you can do: Document everything: Get the officer's name, badge number, and the exact time/location. (Clearly this is a problem with these ICE goons, however, record license plates as though will be tied to the agents operating them).\n\nFile a Privacy Act Request: You can file a FOIA/Privacy Act request with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to see if records exist on you.\n\nContact Advocacy Groups: If you think you've been \"watchlisted\" for filming, reach out to the ACLU or the National Lawyers Guild (NLG).\n\nDon't let them intimidate you into putting the camera down. The law is literally written to prevent this exact type of overreach.\n\nTL;DR: 28 CFR Part 23 says they need \"Reasonable Suspicion\" of a crime to put you in an intelligence database. Filming them isn't a crime; it's a right.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I am a former criminal intelligence analyst, my job involved maintaining one of these databases and the law is extremely strict on what can go in it, despite public perception.\n\nThe video of the ICE agent stating that woman going into a database as a terrorist is a blatant violation of this law and should trigger a congressional investigation.\n\nRead the full text of the regulation on the eCFR website. [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23)\n\nEdit: I believe 28 CFR Part 23 only applies if data is entered into a DOJ-funded criminal intelligence system. We don't know at this point if this is the case. But either way, it merits a congressional investigation.",

They are going against all accepted norms of how federal agents or police of any kind interact with the public.\n\nI don't think ICE particularly gives a shit about the law, as such relying on it to protect you or anyone else has gone out the window.\n\nSound advice right now for anyone planning to protest or record ICE activity would be to protect your identity as much as physically possible. Don't leave your car nearby (ideally don't even travel by your own car), wear a mask, don't post to any socials that could be traced to your real name, take a burner phone, identify escape routes ahead of time, bring clothes and find somewhere with no cameras to change into them, cover identifiable marks or tattoos.",

They shouldn't be afraid of being judged by their peers. The fact the government puts ICE Agents in a position where they feel terrified by the general public seeing what they are doing is a travesty, to say nothing of the implications of the actions themselves.\n\nIf they are breaking the law, then filming their illegal actions is in the interest of everybody but the lawbreakers themselves. If they aren't breaking the law and are doing everything as they should be, then they have nothing to fear.\n\nThis is not \"If you have nothing to hide, then you don't need privacy\" argument - actions taken by public servants are *supposed* to be scrutable. This is why many countries have Freedom of Information laws. We empower these officers of the law to enforce the law, and trust them to do right by us all, and in exchange, we get the ability to hold them account when they break those laws themselves - because giving somebody power without accountability is and always has been a recipe for disaster.\n\nIf the general public cannot hold them account, the government isn't holding up their end of the deal, and the fact the rest of the US government seems complicit in this is a travesty.\n\n---\n\nFor folks interested in the origins of modern Policing, the \"Peelian Principles\" and \"Policing by Consent\" from the UK and how it's morphed into Policing by Law with accountability - public trust is at the heart of democratic law enforcement.

A video shared by freelance journalist Brian Allen appears to show a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent scan a couple’s faces with his phone.\n\n\n“It’s not illegal to record,” the woman filming the ICE agents says after the agent points his phone at her. “Exactly, that’s what we’re doing,” another officer says.\n\n\n“Why are you taking my information down?” the woman behind the camera asks.\n\n\nThe officer responds: “because we have a nice little database, and now you’re considered domestic terrorists.”\n\n\n“For video taping you? Are you crazy?” the woman shoots back before the clip ends.",

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the forced removal and incarceration of over 110,000 to 120,000 people of Japanese descent—two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens—from the West Coast into inland, guarded detention camps during World War II, driven by wartime panic and false claims of military necessity. \nKey Details of Executive Order 9066:\nPurpose: The order empowered the Secretary of War and military commanders to designate \"military areas\" and exclude any person from them.\nTarget: Although it did not name specific groups, it was used specifically to target Japanese aliens and American citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast.\nImpact: Over 120,000 people were forced to leave their homes, businesses, and lives, spending up to three years in relocation centers.\nDuration & Rescission: The order remained in effect for the duration of the war and was formally rescinded by President Gerald Ford on February 19, 1976.\nLegal & Historical Context: While challenged in court (e.g., Korematsu v. United States), the Supreme Court originally upheld the detention as a \"military necessity\". In the 1980s, these convictions were overturned, and the government apologized, admitting the actions were based on racial prejudice rather than evidence of treason. \n\nSame same but different meme***",

Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.”",

Some of those would be discovered. That would be disinformation: something that would call into question whether *any* specific part of the information is valid or not.

I only know this because I've been doing a piece of work recently that researches into this.\n\nMisinformation generally isn't just considers to be \"getting it wrong\" because you can deliberately choose to spread misinformation. The difference is that you don't really have an agenda to influence you  with misinformation. Disinformation has an agenda though.\n\nFor example, I generate an AI video of a group deer running through an American town and share it online with the caption \"Woah, nature meets our little town!\". I'm only really doing this to try and go viral. This is misinformation.\n\nDisinformation would be if I generate the same video and claim the deer are in town because President Trump has authorised ten times more logging than any other President and it's driving animals into towns. That's disinformation.\n\nSo the OP is right this example is likely disinformation because it's being spread with an agenda to influence. However, I can see why you'd label it misinformation to prevent an argument \"I'm not saying you're lying on purpose, it's clearly a confusing and stressful moment, I'm saying you just got it wrong\" etc",

Disinformation puts a lot more intention behind it in my eyes. \n\nThat it’s not just a spokesperson that went out to do damage control and acted like an idiot, but a collaboration between several individuals/an entire organization to intentionally workshop and release what they know for a fact isn’t the truth with the sole goal of rewriting reality. Disinformation seems far more serious than just lies, it casts a wider net over many conspirators, while lying is something that any one of us could easily do on the most minuscule to the grandest levels. \n\nI also imagine that you can lie without knowing everything, if you’re asked a question you know nothing about you can just make almost anything up on the spot even if it’s easily disproven later. Disinformation implies that you already had all the correct information, and what you knew for a fact was the truth, which gives you more leeway to craft a lie using small parts of what we know to be true in order to give it legitimacy. \n\nI’m not sure if this is shared amongst the general public, but that’s what it evokes for me. Lies just feels far too small to emphasize the fact that the entire government is rewriting reality with complete and absolute intention.",

If you keep putting it off, you can find yourself in a situation where the latest Windows update does something that crosses the line for you and you'll be stuck scrambling for a solution.\n\nEven if you don't plan on using Linux *today*, having it installed on a separate drive even if you don't use it right now means you have a plan B.  I recommend Bazzite as a very straightforward \"just works\" option, you don't really need to know much about Linux to get things working and it *really* will not let you muck it up in a way that can't be fixed with a reboot.  Install it on a second drive, and if Windows gets to be too much one day or you have time to kill you can play around with it and see what all you can accomplish.",

Mind you my setup is outside the ‘norm’ and I run most of my games at 7,680 x 2,160. Under Windows I get great frame rates for pretty much all the games I care about on my 5080 but on Linux I get sometimes less than half the frame rates making it unplayable. Once that gets fixed I’m done with Windows. Just tried CachyOS this week with Octopath Traveler 0 and I would tank for no reasons while it’s super smooth on Windows.\n\nI want to switch so bad I’ve even considered putting the AMD rx590 from my NAS in my computer and passing the 5080 to a VM to run games that way, but I feel like that would push my power supply too much and heat up my case too",

An example being an app that knows if a PS2 formatted hard drive is connected, and is able to transfers files to it from the computer that otherwise cannot. Would wine be enough to do that? No idea, but I don't think it's likely.\n\nBoth of my other deciding factors have been tackled though. I stopped playing competitive multiplayer games, and I've now shifted career path from going to school for mechanical engineering to learning the electrician trade. Maybe i'll finally buckle down and learn how to code but that seems incredibly unlikely, so windows it is for the foreseeable future.

Those games that dont' work are *extremely* popular, of course, so that's cold comfort, but if you already don't play Battlefield 6 or Fortnite then the worst that'll heppen is that you'll have to look up what launch options you have to punch into Steam to get the game to work - annoying, but I think manageable for most PC gamers used to looking up workarounds for bugs in games.",

Market share? What the fuck do you think you're talking about?\n\n_Windows_ is a paid product, that supports a giant company with thousands of highly paid staff and shareholders. Microsoft certainly cares about user count.\n\n_Linux Mint_ is a community project, developed primarily by volunteers, given away for free. Which of the [three](https://www.linuxmint.com/teams.php) (3) staff members listed on their website do you think is head of marketing that will spearhead this new campaign? How much extra revenue do you think will be generated by pushing a $0 product to fund this endeavor? Are you currently seeing a lot of ads for Linux Mint? Do you expect to? I'm guessing not. The developers of a community Linux distribution are less like the executives at Microsoft and more like the moderators of a community subreddit.\n\nI see this kind of language all over the internet and I think it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what community developed Linux distributions even are. The truth is, almost universally among community distros, nobody actually involved in the project gives a shit about user numbers. If anything, a large userbase is a problem to be solved; since it still costs money to host repos, and forums, and all manner of infrastructure, each new user is a net negative monetary value to a distribution sustained by donations. If you've ever been to the community forums you should know that useless bitching about problems is readily met with snarky comments that you're entitled to a full refund of $0 and can just leave if you don't like it.\n\nThere won't be a Linux Mint \"marketing blitz\". There will be no campaign. Because they _can't_ make one, and even if they could, they _wouldn't_ because there's just no reason to care about user count. People evangelize Linux distros to their friends for the same reason they evangelize their favorite movies and books — it's why [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/6hur7u/do_you_recommend_windows_10_xpost_rtumblr/) has been a meme for years. People contribute to community distributions because they want the operating system _they_ use to improve, and to reflect their opinions and values about how it should function. A growing userbase is a side effect, not a goal.",

The US military for example still primarily uses Microsoft, and they’re not using the base Windows Premium installation with a hope and a prayer that Microsoft never gets hacked. They don’t even get their updates from Microsoft, they have a security team that downloads the update, checks it out, and then pushes it out to their networks once it’s been deemed safe. They also get custom 0day patches, but those are largely handled by a unit in a special branch like USCYBERCOM so they don’t have to tell Microsoft about the bugs they want to hack other countries with. ",

If anyone but you has access to your keys then your encrypted data is not secure.\n\nIF you have a TPM chip AND you do not give MS your encryption keys AND you set a bitlocker pin (prevents the TPM to sending the key without the pin) AND Microsoft has not put any kind of backdoors into bitlocker, either \"just because\" or at the command of the NSA under threat of treason charges if they reveal it (if you're too young to know who Edward Snowden is Google him, this absolutely happens and all the time), if ***all*** of that then ***maybe*** bitlocker can actually be considered truly secure, even from a corrupt government?\n\nAlso let's not forget \n\nBut honestly this is just another reason to ditch Windows for Linux. There's never been a better time, with a handful of exceptions it's hard to even find modern games that don't run well on Linux either natively or via Proton.\n\nMy personal top 4 distro recommendations:\n\n* **Arch:** For giga-nerds who wanna get pretty good at Linux in the way Mozart was \"pretty good\" at playing a piano. Can be (*will* be) a PITA if you run into an issue that's beyond what you've learned how to do at that point but if you want the absolute most out of your hardware and want the highest level of assurance your computer isn't doing a damned thing you didn't explicitly tell it to short of designing your own PCB this is the distro for you. It's very well documented and there's a lot of community support, so you'll likely never be flying blind, but you'll always be flying with the assists turned off.\n* **Manjaro:** For middling nerds who want something that largely \"just works\" but still offers many of the benefits of Arch. It's Arch under the hood but with the creature comforts baked in instead of installed by you by hand one by one.\n* **Debian:** If you're somewhat techie and want to be able to customize and fiddle around with stuff, but mostly want your computer \"just works.\" Some will recommend other flavors of Debian, like Mint for example, but what I like about vanilla Debian is that it is unbelievably well documented and largely in a way that's a little more layman consumable than Arch's documentation. Chances are if you have a problem there is documentation on how to fix it or another user who's had the same problem and posted their fix.\n* **Ubuntu:** If you just wanna be off Windows and don't want to have to learn anything but a new GUI. You still can get under the hood and tinker if you want to, but you'll probably never need to. This is the Linux distro you put on your mom's computer if it is too old to still function well on Windows but she refuses to buy a new one.\n\n---\n\nEdit: just as an addendum to Arch; don't be intimidated. If you wanna try it out and esp. if you have a bit of Linux knowledge try it out. I'm in manglement (*executive* manglement, so even worse!), barely touch computers beyond sending emails anymore at work, but I daily drove Ubuntu for a few years a long while back, and have used it here and there on raspberry pi's for little projects. That was more than enough for me to figure out installing Arch to my tastes and having it reliably do what I want it to do. It is the PITA choice in many ways but if you think you wanna try it out try it out. Worst case you say \"Fuck this\" and pick another distro. I truly cannot recommend it if you don't want to learn at least the basic ins and outs of Linux. If you want something that just works with no need to fuck around with it it is *not* for you. But if you like learning stuff and tinkering with stuff and want that experience? You'll be fine.",

Any data harvested from Palantir operations in US allies will go right into US misinformation campaigns to support antidemocratic far-right movements. Which the US has explicitly announced it will do in its National Security Strategy and is run by an administration that is actively supported by Palantir.\n\n**EDIT:** Editing this post, in order to reply to the edit in the post below, because apparently that is a normal way of having a discussion. Just as an aside, a bot would likely be significantly more literate. For both the Gaza and Ukraine conflict, I used data from the OHCHR to have a comparable analysis with roughly equal methodology, from the same source:\n\nGaza: [https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-6-january-2026) (70,000 cumulative reported casualties)\n\nUkraine: [https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29\\_ENG\\_0.pdf](https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28October%20%202025%29_ENG_0.pdf) (50,000 cumulative civilian reported casualties)\n\nI'm willing to admit that the Ukraine figure is likely significantly higher, although then again so is the figure in Gaza. The war in Gaza remains a shorter conflict fought over a smaller territory with lower overall populations, with orders of magnitude smaller proportions of armed forces involved. The total figures of military casualties in the case of Ukraine is also significantly higher (2-3 million), even assuming the total number of civilian casualities is around 300.000. Even taking that lower estimate of military casualties (2m) and higher estimate of civilian casualties (300k) it would be about 15%, whereas the [estimated proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza can be as high as 83%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war), according to international scholars.\n\nPart of this is just the core mechanics of this war: Gaza is largely in an urban area, the War in Ukraine has been primarily fought in rural areas, with a meatgrinder doctrine employed by the Russian aggressor. But no international academics in conflict studies are actually claiming that the proportion of civilian casualties in Gaza are on the lower end for modern urban warfare. [Quite the contrary in fact.](https://www.972mag.com/israeli-intelligence-database-83-percent-civilians-militants/)\n\nUnder international law, deliberately withholding food and medical supplies from civilians in a war zone, and blocking foreign or NGO food deliveries as well, is a war crime. Specifically article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Rome Statutes of 1998. There are a range of other international humanitarian laws that can be applied to this as well (including additional protocols to the Geneva Convention), and it has formed [part of the mandate for the arrest warrants for Israeli government members](https://www.csis.org/analysis/starvation-crimes-and-international-law-new-era). Part of the inspiration for much of this international humanitarian law is Soviet Russia's Holodomor in Ukraine (I would recommend Anne Applebaum's Red Famine on this to anyone, also to get a broader idea for some of the historical origins of Ukrainian nationalism).\n\nLet's also be absolutely clear: in no way am I supporting Russia or sympathetic to Russia. One look in my post history will say enough. Unlike certain other people I'm also happy to be transparent about my post history, and don't hide past comments on my newly created profile. I'll give enough to grief to anyone who engages in apologetics for Russia, or tries to justify the Russian war as being provoked by NATO expansion. As a person of the left, I have had friendships broken over my support for (and personal involvement with) Ukraine, by people often upset that Ukraine receives military support and humanitarian aid, while Gaza is left to rot.\n\nBut **truth** matters. And pointing to Ukraine is not a justification for Israel's war of genocide on Palestine. The way you can tell it's a genocide (regardless of what u/AVolantScheme says) is because Israeli ministers such as Smotrich, Ben Gvir, and government coalition members in the Knesset have openly bragged about how it's a genocide and a war for extermination.",

Kind of insane to argue that Israel is trying to eradicate Gaza yet to completely handwave away Russia's attempted eradication of Ukraine. 15k civilian deaths in Ukraine lmfaoooo. Civilian death toll is in the hundred thousands in Ukraine.\n\nIsrael has killed \\~70k, of which between 50%-66% have been civilians, the lowest ratio in urban conflict's history\n\nIsrael has has no been starving or indiscriminately bombing, as proven by the fact said above lowest civilian casualty ratio in urban conflict's history and the fact that yknow, multiple >SINGULAR< actual indiscriminate bombings the USA did killed more civilians during WW2 than Israel has killed total\n\nOn starvation, that a complete lie. According to the World Food Programme: [https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/wfp-palestine-emergency-response-external-situation-report-3-18-october-2023) 951 MT feeds 488k people for a week. 951 x 4.5 (a month) x 4.3 (getting 488k to 2.1m) is 18401 metric tons of food per month, convert metric tons to tons to get 20283 tons\n\n. According to the UN's own numbers: [https://app.un2720.org/tracking](https://app.un2720.org/tracking) In the nearly 2 month period (From May 19th to July 31st) Gaza has been given \\~37000 tons of food, nearly enough for two months worth of supply. Call it not perfect, sure. (Ignoring the fact that Israel has no legal obligation to do this). Just ridiculous how the blood libel is. \"Intentionally starving people\". It also directly conflicts with what COGAT has stated the past few days. The UN site states only 222 trucks were offloaded into Gaza from July 19th to July 26th, COGAT has stated that over 600 trucks were dropped off in that period. And I trust COGAT over the group that has actively blood libeled Israel since the Holocaust was finished.\n\nBut okay, you don't like that, let's get into the daily stuff then. Just a simple browse of Twitter account ImShin shows Palestinians posting their lives. Oh. So from the source they have food and tons of it. Ok. But that's not enough. Ok. So let's go over the Hamas statistics: According to the Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza) 68 total starvation deaths before July 2025 according to the \"Gazan Health Ministry\" (who gain nothing from lying about how low said numbers are)\n\nOk, let's establish a baseline: Illinois. Illinois had 625 deaths from starvation/malnourishment in 2023. Illinois' population is \\~12.7m, Gaza's is roughly \\~2.1m divide 625 by 6, 104 divide 68 by 1.66 (18 months) 41. Illinois's starvation death rate is 2.5 times Gaza's. Illinois.\n\nNo other nation in the world has EVER been expected to feed their opposition, rebuild their enemies. Israel continues to do so despite the blatant genocidal policies and attitudes. of the Palestinians.\n\nSo anecdotally, statistically, and analogically. There is no evidence that Israel is starving Gaza.\n\nBut hey, if you think Israel is doing all this and is trying to \"eradicate Palestine\" while the Palestinians >DIG UP THEIR OWN WATER PIPES AND FIRE THEM AS ROCKETS AT ISRAEL< you may not be using fact based evidence.\n\nAlso forgot to include the tens of thousands Ukrainians abducted by Russia too. But hey. Pro-Palestinians'll do bloody anything to glaze Russia lmao",

At the very least it's a licensing issue.\n\nIf I draw something and put it online under a [Creative Commons NonCommercial license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_NonCommercial_license), they shouldn't use it.  I should be able to sue them for having used it in their training data.\n\nEvery person who posted their early stories to LiveJournal as a teenager would never have allowed a larger corporation to come along as use that data for training without some sort of compensation.  Not to mention LiveJournal probably had a bunch of terms and conditions for reading the site, and all content posted to LiveJournal was owned by LiveJournal and could not be used by any other entity.\n\nEvery musician who posted their music to MySpace and Bandcamp (who again have their own terms and conditions about use) would never have said \"oh yeah sure use that to train an AI band which sounds just like me.....I'll make all my money off live performances.\"  \n\nThey are scraping literally _everything_ they can from the internet to get as much data as possible.  Do you think they look for what license the data was published under?  Of course not.\n\n\"Stolen\" or \"Broke the terms and conditions\" whatever you want to call it.  When I **personally** do it to businesses, they take me to court for repirations (see any RIAA or MPAA case in the past two and half decades regarding torrents and illegal downloads).\n\nAnthropic at least purchased copies of books (which hopefully ended up paying royalties to the authors, but really how many of those books were purchased used or wholesale from libraries discontinuing editions, etc?), https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/, but even then the argument was \"they were having the AI read them just like a human would\".  I bet if you read the copyright at the beginning of most of those books and they don't explicitly license for training AI, and probably say \"for personal use only\" (which if you've ever noticed, all movies / TV programs say for personal use only, not for showing to groups, which again I would get sued for if I do that).\n\nAI should have been it's own, new, completely different license from regular human use.  But then \"oh no Country <X> doesn't follow US Intellectual Property Law\" so they will get ahead of us in AI design / training / modelling if we have to follow some new US law to obtain training data.\n\nFuck that.  Every piece of data used to train AIs was stolen if it wasn't in the public domain, which Disney and other companies keep pushing that further and further back.",

But if the industry norm is that your performance can be used to train an AI, which will replace you, that lifetime career turns into one single job, and then you're permanently out of the industry. And then we'll get less talent entering the industry because they know they'll just get a one and done job, and the entire entertainment industry stagnates and becomes what ai slop is already - more ai slop",

Not in the least bit funny.\n\nAnd here's why: anyone here old enough to remember the absolute cultural phenomenon that was Americas Funniest Home Videos? Millions of Americans sending in moments captured on video.\n\nBut there's the key word. CAPTURED. They were filming, something unplanned occurred, bedlam ensued, and a perfectly imperfect moment of pure human chaos was captured. And now we had a way that we could all share in it.\n\nI remember watching a documentary of the making of the show, and they had a segment where they aired a few of the reject videos. Why were they turned down? They had obviously staged some grand catastrophe and filmed it with the hope of gaining fleeting mainstream fame. And it was painfully obvious which ones were faked. There was no spontaneity. It just felt forced. They weren't captured moments, they were constructs, and the end result reeked of it. More recently I've seen people try to fake internet videos of things like \"jewellery store heist gone wrong\". They're infuriatingly unfunny, and they're pretty obvious to spot.\n\nNow, everyone is trying to create \"funny\" with AI, and it is failing miserably. AI can only force moments to happen. It doesn't capture that moment when our humanity blows up in our faces. It crafts it. And what it crafts will never be anywhere near as good.\n\nI'm watching these companies that have pumped trillions of dollars into AI circle the drain, and I'm not mad at it.",

To give you a few examples of ways I think it can enhance human creativity:\n\n* Small uses of the erase tool and the select tool in Photoshop and similar programs to help isolate foreground subjects. Many Photos hope users aren't even aware they are using AI.\n* A fun video I watched a while back was where two programmers had AI's and had them play Geogesser. One had a general-purpose AI they had spent a lot of time training. The other took responses from his chat in real time and tried to determine the correct answer based on hundreds of human inputs. The result was a mixture of silly mistakes and groups of humans in the chat fighting over giving silly results or trying to win. [Here](https://youtu.be/JmoFvtBBDJw?si=5ToPMhSb94yBPvT_) is the video in question.\n\nI don't think this generally works for comedy. I think whole AI art projects are lazy and lose a lot of what makes art interesting, but I think the line on what is good and can be funny is much fuzzier than many believe.",

It's going to be decades before we even have a glimpse at actual AI, and that's being generous. AI won't actually make an appearance until many of us are long gone. \n\nWhat we have now are nothing more than glorified data scrapers, and that's exactly what these companies pushing AI so hard are using it for. To scrape data from every possible metric related to every man, woman, and child alive today and those to come in the future. It's why we're seeing \"AI\" elements being forcefully shoved into products that simply don't need it. Why more and more products are being bundled together with apps. None of it is for our benefit. None of it improves the user's experience. It's all about swindling as much data as possible about each and every individual on the planet so it can be sold for a profit and then shoved back into our faces as ads.\n\nThe government should be sued. I'm so freaked out and paranoid to type anything online, go outside, run errands, or enjoy anything these days for fear of constantly being under surveillance, and it's absolutely affected my health negatively in multiple ways. So not only are they stealing my info to make a profit, but they're also destroying my mental and physical well-being. And I know I'm not the only one. Far from it. And yet, we're trained to believe that such things are perfectly acceptable and that we have zero power or say over any of it. \n\nIf a company wants to track my info, then they're going to give me 80% of the profit they make when they sell that info to data centers. And all companies should be forced to make dumb versions of every smart product they sell. Versions that have no internal elements that connect to any networks or any apps. Products that have zero tracking or use statistics. \"MAYBE\" some on-board basic diagnostics that \"WE,\" the people who own the product, can easily access to do our own troubleshooting. \n\nI used to think we were well on our way to the greatest timeline in history.

Your voluntary neighborhood watch footage becomes part of something much bigger.\n\n>The partnership works through Ring’s existing [“Community Requests”](https://ring.com/support/articles/uds27/Community-request?srsltid=AfmBOopukxUzsJ6_KUL22s3P1pPPJ0BlMEzOxENQuwhFou6G-kpV6K9-) feature, where police ask users to voluntarily share footage. But once you click “yes” to help solve that package theft, your footage enters Flock’s ecosystem where federal access is built into the system’s structure.\n\nThis is an important distinction for current users: as described, this only affects video clips you choose to share on the Community Requests, your regular footage is not defacto shared with Community or put up for viewing by your local law enforcement agency or by extension, the flock expansion. Users who don't opt to share anything to Community shouldn't (at least, by current appearances) be concerned that everything that your camera sees is being shared to Flock/ICE. \n\nThat said, this is Amazon we're talking about, so stay vigilant with your privacy and watch the space for any further changes beyond this. If you're going to use a doorbell camera etc. be cognizant of how it may affect your privacy in your future - you know, don't do lines of coke or pimp hookers in front of the cloud enabled thing.",

A cults effect on the mind is to change the very way you see and understand truth itself.

Why does he need that gun? Surely he planned to use it. Ergo, he is a terrorist.” This is obvious confirmation bias being used to reinforce and double down on a warped view of truth.\n\nIt is so important to me. I am in fact begging all of you to understand: this has gone beyond reason, beyond peaceful protest, beyond diplomacy. It is already too late and we are going to lose if something more significant is not done. You’re trying to reason with, and send messages to, an impotent government led by warped minds that are not seeing reality. They are indoctrinated.\n\nI have A LOT of experience with cults. I am not just baselessly saying this. I am making an informed and educated observation and desperately want everyone to pass this along before we completely lose the country. What government we have left that has any sense clearly doesn’t understand what we are dealing with. No amount of reason or pleading or intelligent speech is going to change anything.\n\nFor the love of god please get this through your heads before it’s too late.",

Local contractors would notoriously quote these ridiculous numbers for simple jobs around the warehouse because they knew Amazon would just pay for it.\n\nThen, instead of allowing one particular team to work remotely for a site that was still being built, which that team could have worked remote with their job role, they paid to fly them all to a hotel multiple states away and booked a months worth of nights. \n\nIt is perhaps one of the most wasteful companies I've ever heard of.

              "text": "I have a lot of friends who worked at Amazon and basically stayed their three years for their stocks to vest and then got the fuck out. A few of them literally left tech entirely after that. \n\nI also heard that some teams have a requirement of one person getting cut every quarter / year or so (depending on PiPs), so they would intentionally hire someone they knew was sub-par to be able to keep their main team itself.\n\nI worked at one of the big tech companies for almost 6 years before quitting with my soul barely in tact and didn't have too much corporate evil to deal with personally because I worked in part of the company that went from normal hours to COVID hours (product was necessary for our customers to actually function and customers were schools, so moral obligation easy to push)... So working 6am to 1am 7 days a week. Even after the COVID crunch was over, that just became the new normal all the time. And it was still COVID, so what the fuck else was there to do but work? I lost so much weight during that time and never noticed just from barely eating anything.\n\nI loved one of my coworkers (my manager) and had my little flock of people I protected (I had risen to be senior on my team), but honestly now I just have watched from the outside as those people I liked got laid off or now work even more insane hours just to keep a necessary product functioning in order to keep the other crap that made money functioning on top of it. I'm happy to have left when I did. \n\nWhen I joined that company in 2017, the stock was around $42/share. It's now ten times that. I also had an offer from another faang (had interned there) that I turned down after seeing the fact that the free meals just really were meant to keep employees there from early morning through late dinner, to the point where employees really didnt know any humans that didnt work at said company. How do you make a product for people you have no context of?? It was scary how detached from reality they were and how many were just divorced and had no interest in maintaining custody if they had kids. \n\nHalf the thing with working at any of these companies is luck. There are four people just as qualified, two more qualified, that just didn't get a position because someone was having a bad day or a resume just got passed over. It's not a level of amazing prestige that it is seen elsewhere or seen as just a resume unlock tool for anywhere else you want to work, but it's a matter of luck. Any \"holier than thou\" attitude should be seen as purely bullshit.",

          "text": "Paywall\n\n```US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error.\nThe email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to \"strengthen the company.\"\nThe message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled.\nEarly on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to \"remove bureaucracy\" at the firm.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBeth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make \"broad reductions every few months\", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October.\n\"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,\" she said.\nAmazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles.\nAmazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected.\nProject Dawn\nOn Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers.\nThe title of the invitation was \"Send project Dawn email,\" an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job redundancies.\nWhile the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed.\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the email said.\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.\nThe lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified.\nThe broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October.\nThe firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.\nWhile affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Time to rethink'\nSince Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts.\nJassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.\nIn-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.\nAmazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement.\nIn an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\"\nJassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.\nAdditional reporting by Mitchell Labiak```",

She lacks strong technical understanding, yet was placed in a role that requires deep expertise. Many skilled employees were pushed out or let go, and now she is surrounded by people who simply agree with her instead of speaking up. That kind of culture leads to bad decisions and poor results.\n\nThe choice to call a large round of layoffs “Project Dawn” also shows a troubling lack of awareness. Giving a soft, positive name to a process that results in people losing their jobs feels insensitive and out of touch. When leaders avoid honest feedback and real accountability, it is often the people closest to them who end up taking the blame — and that only deepens the problem.",
