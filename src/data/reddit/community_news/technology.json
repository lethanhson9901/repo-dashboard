You’ll owe at least 2.5% import duty, state use tax when you register it, and fees. The real problem is compliance and tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese cars that will be sold in Canada are not certified to U.S. DOT (FMVSS) and EPA standards, which means you’d need a Registered Importer to modify and certify it, often $10k+ or outright impossible. On top of that, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to Section 301 tariffs, which for EVs can effectively double the vehicle’s cost (100%+ duty).\n\nUnless the car is 25+ years old (exempt) or already U.S.-certified, you can easily end up paying more in tariffs and compliance than the car is worth. As mentioned in the begininng, it’s usually not worth it.\n\nEdit: for everyone asking why the EPA is involved here is the link. \n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fuel-economy-and-ev-range-testing",

Our national neighbors to the north have already caved, setting off alarm bells in some U.S. operations, and now NADA is hoping to amplify that warning.\n\nGo absolutely fuck yourselves drive.com. Canada didn’t cave on shit. \n\nThe Biden administration wanted to put tariffs on Chinese EVs, but thought it would be even better to have North America united as a bloc on those tariffs. So Canada imposed the exact same tariffs, despite the fact that NA EVs are almost exclusively in the American market. \n\nChina imposed disproportionately heavy tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports. Because they recognized that Canada wasn’t benefiting from the EV tariffs the same way America was. So Canada took the biggest hit, and got the smallest benefit. But we stood by our decision. \n\nThen Trump tariffed us, told us he didn’t need us, threatened to invade us, and members of his government started having meetings with Alberta separatists to break up our country. \n\nSo Canada said “why are we taking this hit for Americans if this is how they treat us?” Carney made a deal to lessen the Chinese EV tariffs and remove the hurt on our agricultural exports. THAT ONLY EXISTED BECAUSE WE WERE BEING GOOD ALLIES TO AMERICANS!!!!\n\nFuck all you people.",

Products are produced to the price point that is asked for, but in a lot of instances that no longer means they cannot produce to a high standard.\n\nNo one bats an eye about their Chinese made Apple or Android phones, but somehow thinks that we are solely capable of producing anything else better than everyone else. China decided to not play catch up with gas powered vehicles and saw an emerging next generation car opportunity and capitalized. Their battery technology is superior and their manufacturing capacity is huge. \n\nCouple this with the same folks desire to destroy public education, kill R&D funding and the overall anti-intellectualism and you are dooming the country you were lucky enough to be born in.",

                  "text": "Years ago I visited a country with heavy government control over media. I noticed that the time displayed in the corner on live US news broadcasts was about ten minutes off (eg, if the current real world time was 7:32am in DC, and 7:32pm in the city I was in, the US national news timestamp would be 7:22am, meaning we were seeing news with a ten minute delay).\n\nThen I noticed that the screen would go black periodically. It finally clicked that the US live news was being screened and censored. The lag was the time they gave themselves to block out ideas they didn’t want broadcast there. Entire news segments (1-4 minutes) were being blocked.\n\nI like the regular people and culture of the country, so I don’t want to name it in case I want to go back (I’d never get into any sort of political action there, but we can see how things are going with travel and ai surveillance of socials already). \n\nI think about that when things like this happen. It’s the kind of thing the US is supposed to be against. The very first amendment provides this right (free speech, free press, free from national/forced religion, free to choose any religion, free to assemble/protest, etc).\n\nThese rights are usually chipped away gradually, and only just enough to avoid causing a big uproar, and when people accept that change, it’s chipped away a little more later. Then a year or decade later the accumulated change is so drastic that if it had happened all at once there’d be mass uprisings, but instead, because of the slow creep, everyone is just lulled into complacency thinking, “wow, how’d we get here?” And carrying on as if things were normal because, “what can I do?”\n\nPoint being, there needs to be pushback over these little chips being removed from rights, even if they seem inconsequential at the time, because they are likely part of a larger pattern that will ultimately fundamentally change the freedoms we enjoy.",

You may be aware that he has, on at least 2 or 3 occasions, refused to comply with directives from Australia's eSafety Commissioner to remove violent content from the X feed available in Australia (one was Kirk's shooting, another was the stabbing of a Sydney bishop during a live streamed service) and he fought those tooth-and-nail (successfully) because he's supposedly so strong on free speech.

That's not magically going to get rid of the people who voted for him or contain the racist and divisive forces channeled by the Republican party.\n\nHell, if the Republican party is totally dismantled in a US-style de-nazification program in 3 years, and the Dems rule unopposed for 20 years straight sort of like after a mirror of the Civil War, this could STILL HAPPEN AGAIN as long as the Wealth elite exist and continue to cause problems to happen in society and then go and fund fascist solutions because they REFUSE TO SACRIFICE any bit of their wealth for any reason at all.\n\nNo, actually, it's worse than that. Not only do they refuse to sacrifice wealth, they refuse to sacrifice their ability to MAKE EVEN MORE WEALTH. It's not like they're short on wealth or profit right now. There isn't even credible socialist political power in this country. They're funding fascism because they THINK it might emerge, and morons like Peter Thiel are scared shitless its like 2 days away or something. So rich AND delusional; great combo.\n\nPeople don't want to hear it for a variety of reasons, but the problem is, and always will be, Capitalism. Who created the millions of downtrodden people who want to lash out, and thus vote for Trump ? Capitalism. Who created Trump himself ? He's one of the worst examples of a human being made by it. Capitalism. Who poured billions of dollars into souring Sander's campaign even though he isn't even that much of a socialist ? Capitalism. What creates a socially divisive society of competition for the benefit of the elite ? Capitalism.\n\nCapitalists wrote the US Constitution and stuck it full of veto-points because they didn't trust the poors to make choices. You might think that's cause they thought the poors were stupid. And perhaps they did. Lots of people do today still. Except that's not really it. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't, but they were really afraid of the poors voting to take all their wealth. Which is a NON-STUPID response to inequality. That's why there's a house AND Senate. That's why there's an Electoral College. That's why the stupid fillibuster rule exists (it's not in the constitution, either).\n\nThe system makes the unrest and discontent through the process of creating insane wealth for a few, and then those few fund the fascist response to protect that insane wealth. It'll do this over and over and over again as long as Capitalists have any political power (and thus wealth) at all.",

CTV is owned by Bell, which means the big banks all have stakes in it. The Toronto Star was bought by Jordan Bitove a few years ago.

Some people consider this to mean they are \"enabled by default\", because to them any mention of AI whatsoever, having a \"do you want this?\" prompt means it's on.\n\nThis is also misleading though, at least for the link preview thing. You make it sound like they show you a \"do you want this?\" prompt once then hide it if you say \"no\". In reality the AI \"key points\" thing always shows up in the link preview even if it's disabled, and if you click it it will tell you it cannot work because it's disabled. The only way I could ever find to completely remove it is to disable link previews completely, even though they work fine without AI \"Key Points\".\n\nI think it's very hard to argue that it's \"off by default\" if I can't turn it off individually without disabling another feature even by manual action. I would agree that the current design is actually somewhere in the middle, but it's definitely hostile and annoying.\n\nI really hope this new AI killswitch actually disables prompts for all upcoming AI features as claimed and isn't a similar \"you can disable it except it will keep popping up anyway\" kind of thing. If any of the new AI features are actually good I'll find out about them and enable it, like the built-in translation which is actually a good use of ML IMO.",

Also told my supervisor that it was their job to already know the answers to the questions I was being asked. Then I said that if they contacted me again before my leave was up I was going to file a case against them with the labour board. And finally said I was disgusted by the lack of basic human decency. \n\nI talked to my doctor about how stressed out I was and my medical leave was extended from two weeks to six months, which entitled me to six months of half pay Employment Insurance. I am up for retirement months before my medical leave ends. I provided a return to work date so my position has to be held for my return which I am not compelled to do. So now instead of gutting it out for a few months until I retirement I retired early, and because I went on medical leave while still working I get Employment Insurance benefits on top of my pension.\n\nIf that message from my supervisor had not pushed me over the edge I would not have ended up in a much better financial position which included early retirement and me witnessing karma in action.",

Common sense and decency are fatal to conservative ideology. Literally can't have either and want what conservatives have been selling. Even the non-racist stuff like their trickle down tax policies fall apart after a person's first math lesson. The average 1st grader is like \"they said 2-1= 5? That doesn't make any sense!\" which is why the right wing fights so hard against education and the teaching of problem solving skills. Can't know anything about anything and still actually believe the conservative platform.",

In this case it's entirely individual employee donations (they have ~200k) under the then federal maximum of $3,000, so entirely worthless as some sort of demotivational \"both sides\" evidence that Alphabet controlled Harris.

It isnt producing anything of value, is destroying entire classifications of jobs without offering alternatives for those employees, and is using a lot of expensive resources. It hasn't cured cancer, it hasn't made society better in any way, and the scandals involving it being used as a disinformation tool keep piling up.

The elder kid (16 years) who jumped and died was in 4th grade. \n\nYou can see the case is not about tech or korean games. It is straightup cult shit or sexual abuse.",

              "text": "I find it suspect that the article (and their father) decided to focus so heavily on the game they were playing and their interest in Korean culture. They wrote an 8-page suicide note...surely that wasn't the only thing in there.\n\nI went looking for some other articles about this and found some other interesting tidbits:\n\n* The girls dropped out of school in 2020, 5-6 years ago. They weren't doing well in school when they were attending. [This source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) claims the girls dropped out because their father was deeply in debt and could no longer afford to send them.\n* The family lived in a gated community and none of their neighbors knew them. One said “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents.\"\n* According to one source, the girls never had their own phone - they were using their parents' phone to get online. And the parents didn't just take the phone away - they also threatened to marry off the girls.\n* The father, Chetan Kumar, actually has two wives who are sisters. The source linked above says \"two of his partners walked out\" and disappeared for a few days; he filed a missing persons report and they came back within a few days. (Unclear if those two are the same as the two wives...)\n* [This source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece) says there wasn't even any evidence of a game found on the device(s) they were using, and said that they mostly cited TV shows. But [this source ](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2026/02/04/three-sisters-jump-to-their-death-after-parents-cut-off-their-video-gaming-time/)says evidence was found on their devices of long gaming sessions (and also contradicts the other article, which said they didn't have their own phones). However, literally no one has been able to name the game itself, and the description of the game changes from source to source - some say it's a \"love game\" (I assume a dating sim), others a task-based game, and one even claimed that the last task in the game was suicide.\n* Although the suicide note does mention their love of gaming and Korean culture, it also talks about the girls' loneliness. Interesting how that hasn't become part of any of the headlines.\n* Their diary/suicide note also [referenced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) beatings (\"Did we live in this world to get beaten by you… death would be better for us than beatings.\")",

              "text": "That's what struck me too. No mention of what the 8 page letter said, but a lot of finger pointing by the father. The way this is being reported (as of now) is setting off my alarms that those girls were likely dealing with a much more concerning reality than a mere loss of access to a game. Especially the fact that the eldest daughter was part of it all. Generally speaking, whether pressured to or not, eldest daughters tend to take on a secondary mothering role to younger siblings. If death seemed to be preferable to whatever life she and her siblings were facing as a result of losing contact with the outside world, I think that's a pretty big sign that the conditions of their daily life need to be looked into.",

The three sisters last attended Green Valley School, where their academic performance was sub-par,” said the officer.\n\nInside the gated society, several neighbours told The Hindu that they only knew the family from a distance. “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents,” said Gaurav Kohli, a neighbour.\n\nRahul Jha, the secretary of the apartment who accompanied the police during the investigation, told The Hindu that he learnt the family faced financial troubles. “The family lived on rent, and they did not speak to anyone much or participate in any activities. A day before this happened, Mr. Kumar handed me ₹700 for maintenance, but he never delayed any payment,” M.R. Jha said.\n\nAt present, the police have recovered Ms. Sujata’s cell phone and sent it for forensic analysis. The police have also seized the handwritten note left by the girls. ***The DCP said that a case has not been registered yet as the parents have not filed a complaint.***\n\n😒\n https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece",

According to news reports the police have the device(s) the girls were using to play the game. How could you not just pull the name of the game from whatever app they were using? Their suicide note was 8 pages and contained specific references to other Korean and East Asian TV shows, anime, manga, singers and groups - which they called out by name - but not the actual game they were playing?\n\nI call bullshit.",

I did open source dev for a long time, until I saw that companies like Amazon, google, and millions of others profit the stockholders and the billionaires off that unpaid labour.\n\nLess than a percent give anything back to those who they require and depend on, some give back but nowhere near what they profit from it and it’s a tax write off for them.\n\nSo no, I no longer do unpaid open source dev unless it’s for a passion project, and that will never be something someone profits unpaid off of.\n\nMy favorite is copyleft licensing with also a special no bundle/sale clause, so if it’s used the entity cannot sell anything it’s used in and it must be open source also.\n\nSelf hosting and other cloud providers are great and all 99.9 percent of companies need.

But projects die on the vine without expertise, funding, and interoperability. And governments beating their chests about \"sovereignty\" simply aren't donating in amounts that affirm their statements on the importance of it.\n\n  \nFor example, there's a reason Rust is all over the major open source projects right now, and it isn't because it is more popular than C/C++/etc.. It's because Big Tech is forcing it by way of their paid employees who sit on, and steer, governance boards for open source projects. It's risky to say here because so many people treat it like a political statement. It is, but from a corporate-influence standpoint where the minor change in license and the control over compilers lets them really put their hands around the neck of any project they wish.\n\n  \nSo what are seeing now is that Tech firms embed their employees into governance -> governance decides to stop supporting X technology in favor of Y (which just so happens to align with the Tech firms' financial interest and own corporate mandates) -> forced disassociation and repudiation of forks.  \n\n\n\nTech firms have totally taken over a few keystone groups who are able to force corporate-demanded changes in other projects via threat of disassociation. It sometimes gets covered here on an American political level, but that's just a distraction from the corporate takeover of open source in reality (not intentional, but easier for emotional people to focus on rather than the insidious corporate maneuvers happening in front of them inside of projects).\n\n  \n\"Use Open Source\" is basically the 2026 version of this sub's cry to \"use Firefox.\" Sounds good on the surface, but it isn't a panacea because corporate interests are unfortunately prevailing. Just in a less upfront way unless one is actually deeply involved in open source both as a user and contributor.\n\n  \nI don't trust any project effectively run by Alphabet/IBM/Apple/Oracle/etc.. And yet, those are the same projects these supposedly sovereign governments are turning to. And the same projects people here are beating their chests about using, while the paid corporate employees push ahead with EEE.",

Also the fact that Bill Gates was recently mentioned in the epstein files truly disgusts me. I may finally take the plunge on Linux soon\n\nThen Google which feels more and more like a giant spyware network every day. There's something about that company I don't trust at all (also because of the hard push of AI features), because I imagine it's working hand in hand with Palantir and god when you put all the pieces together it quickly gets creepy\n\nIn general, I am watching all the US tech take a part in the rise of a new fascist regime, and that's not something I want to support, with neither my money or my time... I'm trying to talk about it around me, my family, my friends, etc. and I imagine I'm not the only one, but I also imagine there's a big majority that is too comfortable with the paradigm in place to be willing to change their habits. The EU seems like it's finally acknowledging that the lack of alternatives may be dangerous for us, and it gives me hope somehow",

This drives prices up and wages down. \n\nIf you need proof, just go look at the average S&P500 profit *margin* over time. It's basically doubled in the last 2 decades. Note that I said profit margin, not dollar amount. If the margin of the average corporation is going up, that means they have price power, which means there is less meaningful competition. \n\nYou might be tempted to say it's just a reflection of higher margin business, like software. But that's wrong, because if there was meaningful competition in those spaces then the prices would go down, reducing the margins.

Yes, Tolkien devised these languages pretty much single-handedly (at least as far as they got before he wrote LOTR), but the fruits of philology aren't treated as intellectual property the same way as the products of fiction are. I can't claim ownership of words I made up like \"salientize\" or \"salienate\" (meaning \"to make something more noticeable or attention-grabbing\") even though it doesn't look like anyone has ever published anything with those words before, because they are obvious and natural conclusions of philological development. It would be different if Tolkien just made those languages up from scratch with his imagination, but he basically \"discovered\" them in the ether of fictional reality and brought enough receipts for other people to check his work.",

They will have made the US a much weaker, less preferred trading partner, and will eventually crash the dollar. They will drive up poverty, homelessness, and health related issues, which will increase crime. Things *will* become less safe for these elites, and they will ultimately have less power and their fortunes worth far less due to being accounted for in US currency. It honestly would not surprise me if the more logical assholes behind all of this have been secretly planning how to de-escalate this situation once Trump is dead and he cannot turn his rabid base on them.",

              "text": "The ten richest Americans (Musk, Page, Brin, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Ellison, Huang, Ballmer, Buffet, Dell) have a combined net worth of \\~$2.5T. These billionaires want you to believe that the reason things are bad for us every day Americans and why affordability is low is because of the 20 million (so they claim) undocumented people in our land. Let's do some math.\n\nThose hypothetical 20 million people would need to be taking in $125,000 in services, housing and other costs *per person* in order to be doing as much harm as these 10 individuals are by their wealth hoarding. If you spent the $125k on these 20 million people, their dollars go back into their communities, creating jobs and opportunities throughout the country. \n\nIf you expand it to the top 100 individuals, they have a combined \\~$6.3 Trillion hoarded. There are 100 people with over $11.7 BILLION dollars in the US. That's higher than the GDP of Japan ($4.1T) and three times the GDP of Canada ($2.1T). There are nearly 1000 people with a net worth over $1B, giving the top 1000 earners a combined net worth of $8.2T.\n\nThe US has about $160 trillion in private wealth. These 1,000 people (0.0003% of the population) hold over 5% of the nation's wealth. 5% of the nations population is 16.5 million people. That's between the population of Pennsylvania (13M, 5th most populated state) and New York (20M, 4th most populated state). Think about that for a second. \n\nLet's say you get lucky and you find a job that pays you $100,000 per hour. Surely, you would joint his list, right? Working 40 hours a week, you would only make $208m per year. Elon Musk saw his net worth balloon to over $700B recently, earning him over $300B in just one year. That is the equivalent of earning over $34.2 million dollars **per hour**...for every single one of the 8,760 hours in a year, whether he's taking a shit, shitposting on X, or shitting on the American people. \n\nThat means that Elon Musk earned $1m every two minutes. Making $50k a year, around the median personal wage, you would need to work 20 years to earn what Musk earned in 2 minutes.\n\n**The combined net worth of the top 1000 richest people grew by over $1 trillion dollars in 2025. Do you know how much we spent on SNAP, Unemployment, housing assistance and child tax credits? $650 billion. They are telling you that the problem is all of these welfare queens and undocumented people while they are stealing nearly double that.** \n\nSo you tell me? Who is robbing us? The people who occasionally use a social service like welfare, the undocumented people sending their children to school and driving on our public roads, or the uber wealthy? Even if you assume there are 50 million leeches in this country (about 15% of the population), they would each need to be costing us over $20,000 to match the wealth hoarded by these monsters.\n\nAnd the sad part is that they are not done yet. They will never have enough. They will not stop until you die.",

An oligopoly is like a monopoly but with a few players instead of just one. But it's still anti-competitive, because they often act as a cartel and we get the exact same downsides as a monopoly.\n\nHow do we measure whether an industry is an oligopoly or not? Well, the common way is if one industry member died, how big would the effect be on the market? Using an analogy, if a grocery store closed, if people can just use the grocery store next to it, it's not a big deal, but if there are no grocery stores nearby, people are deeply affected.\n\nSo in a perfectly competitive system, no entity should be able to negatively affect the entire market in such a dramatic way.\n\nBillionaires, can buy ENTIRE industries and delete them from existence, for the lulz if they want.\n\nThere is no good argument why any INDIVIDUAL should be able to affect the market in such a dramatic way, the same way no one entity should in a market. It's unhealthy, it's anti-competitive, and it's bad for everyone.\n\nThis of course is only referring to a billionaire's affect on the market, of course, in the US of A, we decided money = speech, so billionaires can just buy entire governments if they want to. There's no argument to why they should be able to do that.\n\nThank you for coming to my 'fuck billionaires and all their defenders' TED talk.",

          "text": ">23\nDonald Trump and his allies raised a record $429mn in donations last year, as tech billionaires and companies lobbying for policy changes helped build a war chest for the president ahead of the midterm elections.\nA single political action committee controlled by Trump allies, Maga Inc, is sitting on $304mn — more than any Pac has ever held heading into a midterm election year, FT analysis found. The sum is tens of millions more than any group connected to the Democratic Party has on hand.\nThe haul, highly unusual for a term-limited president who can no longer fund his own campaign, proves that Trump continues to dominate his party, even as polling shows some swing voters have soured on the president over his immigration crackdown and foreign interventions.\nIt also underlines megadonors’ eagerness to bankroll an administration that has championed the crypto and AI industries, axed or eased regulations and ended legal probes into political allies.\nTrump has not indicated how he will deploy his financial firepower, but allies have already used separate funds to go after Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who has clashed with the president over budget bills and the release of the Epstein files.\nSuper Pacs such as Maga Inc can raise unlimited funds but cannot co-ordinate directly with campaigns.\nIf Trump and his allies do decide to fund loyal candidates in the midterm elections, they have “a lot of money to potentially spend on a handful of competitive Senate and House races,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. Trump could also use the funds “to make himself politically relevant after he leaves the White House,” Conant added.\nIn the past few months, Maga Inc has raised tens of millions of dollars from the crypto and AI industries, as well as from investors and corporations with business before the White House.\nThe largest disclosed contribution came from crypto exchange Crypto.com, which funnelled $30mn into Trump’s main Pac last year. An investigation into the company by the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched during the Biden administration, was closed in March 2025. Crypto.com has also inked several deals with crypto businesses run by Trump’s family.\nA spokeswoman for Crypto.com said the company had been “engaged in discussions regarding the culmination of the SEC’s investigation against the company prior to President Trump’s inauguration” and an agreement had been reached during the Biden administration.\nThe White House referred questions to Maga Inc, which said: “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, Maga Inc will have the resources to help candidates who support President Trump’s America First agenda of securing our border, keeping our streets safe, supercharging our economy, and making life more affordable for all Americans.”\nOther significant donors included Greg Brockman, the co-founder and president of OpenAI, who gave $12.5mn to the group in December, while his wife Anna donated a further $12.5mn.\nBrockman has also backed a group lobbying for restrictions on state AI regulations and funding campaigns against candidates who favour stricter rules for the sector. He has visited the White House in recent months.\nIn December, Brockman, who had never before spent large sums on politics, wrote that his contributions were made to show “support for policies that advance American innovation and constructive dialogue between government and the technology sector”.\nInvestor Jeff Yass, a long-time political donor, gave a total of $16mn to Maga Inc in 2025. His trading firm Susquehanna has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, which the Trump administration helped to avoid a US ban in a deal that favoured existing shareholders.\nFounders of venture capital powerhouse A16Z, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, each gave $3mn to Maga Inc last year. Their company has been at the forefront of lobbying efforts to pass legislation that would benefit crypto start-ups and has led efforts to thwart states from continuing to pass a patchwork of AI legislation.\nTrump signed an executive order in December ordering his administration to review state-level AI laws and threatening to withhold federal funds from states that pass “onerous” legislation. Andreessen celebrated its signing, writing “It’s time to win AI”.\nYass and A16Z did not respond to requests for comment.\nTobacco company RAI Services donated a total of $3mn to Maga Inc in 2025, after the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era plan to ban menthol cigarettes and flavoured cigars. \nExtremity Care donated $5mn to Maga Inc last year, while its co-owners Scott Madden and Oliver Burckhardt also donated $2.5mn apiece. So did its affiliated companies Collie Paw Holding and Buco One.\nA Biden-era plan to limit Medicare coverage of paper-thin bandages made from human tissue was paused by the Trump administration soon after the donations. Extremity Care is a leading provider of the bandages.\nRAI Services and Extremity Care did not respond to requests for comment.\nMore than $21mn of Maga Inc’s haul came from a group called Securing American Greatness, a so-called “dark money” group which does not disclose donors.\nAside from attracting corporate donors, Trump has received donations from individuals looking for clemency.\nIn one example, Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian banker charged with bribing Puerto Rico’s governor, was pardoned earlier this month after his daughter Isabela Herrera donated a total of $3.5mn to Maga Inc since Trump’s re-election. Velutini did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump also remains by far the largest magnet for cash from individual donors. The president’s joint fundraising committee attracted tens of millions of dollars in donations made via WinRed in 2025, according to FEC records, eclipsing all other Republican fundraising vehicles.\n“Trump is the only thing that gets Republican voters excited,” strategist Conant said. “He is really the motivating factor within the party right now and that is reflected in the fundraising.”",

That was thoughtful engineering. The BMW has the volume button and the infotainment dial at two different ends and then a recessed gear shifter. The lag between the iPhone and the infotainment system is substantial. When it snows, the trunk door will drop a significant amount of snow into the trunk when opening. \n\nIn general, the BMW is poorly designed for its having such a strong market share.

Instead of one central location to do all the work there are a bunch of small spots that require a crane to get to. And cranes have stand down wind ratings, and they are always built where it’s windy. I couldn’t imagine the massive pain it would be to maintain them off shore.  \n\nLifecycle cost is an important metric to measure and consider.

It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know anything else about phone unlocking technology?

Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.\n“Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the court record reads, referring to the FBI’s Computer Analysis Response Team, a unit focused on performing forensic analyses of seized devices. The document is written by the government, and is opposing the return of Natanson’s devices. \nThe FBI raided Natanson’s home as part of its investigation into government contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who is charged with, among other things, retention of national defense information. The government believes Perez-Lugones was a source of Natanson’s, and provided her with various pieces of classified information. While executing a search warrant for his mobile phone, investigators reviewed Signal messages between Pere-Lugones and the reporter, the Department of Justice previously said.\nThen, the government obtained search warrants for Natanson’s residence, vehicle, and person to seize her electronic devices. Those warrants included language that would have legally allowed them to press Natanson’s fingers onto the devices, or hold them up to her face, to unlock them if biometrics were enabled.\nUpstairs in Natanson’s residence, the FBI found a powered-off silver Macbook Pro, an Apple iPhone 13, a Handy branded audio recording device, and a Seagate portable hard drive, according to the court record.\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the court record says.\n\n\nA screenshot from the court record.\nThe court record mentioning Lockdown Mode was filed on January 30th, around two weeks after the FBI raided Natanson’s residence, indicating the FBI has not been able to access the iPhone during that time.\nApple primarily markets Lockdown Mode as a feature to mitigate remote access spyware, such as that sold by companies like NSO Group to government agencies. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all,” Apple’s website reads. Essentially, Lockdown Mode makes some changes to how iOS works to make it harder for third parties to hack into an iPhone. It blocks most message attachment types; loads webpages differently; and stops FaceTime calls unless you’ve previously called that person in the last 30 days.\nA small section of the Lockdown Mode page also mentions mitigations around connecting an iPhone to an external accessory. “Device connections: To connect your iPhone or iPad to an accessory or another computer, the device needs to be unlocked,” the Lockdown Mode page says. “To connect your Mac laptop with Apple silicon to an accessory, your Mac needs to be unlocked and you need to provide explicit approval.” Mobile forensics tools such as Graykey and Cellebrite, which law enforcement use to break into phones, work by physically connecting to a phone to then unlock them.\n\n\n“Many advanced forensic techniques and law enforcement tools rely on vulnerabilities that Lockdown Mode explicitly blocks or limits,” Andrew Garrett, CEO of digital forensics firm Garrett Discovery, told 404 Media.\nNeither the Washington Post nor Apple responded to a request to comment. The FBI declined to comment.\nThere is a constant cat and mouse dynamic between the companies that make mobile phones and their operating systems, namely Apple and Google, and the firms making tools to break into those devices. In 2024, 404 Media revealed Apple quietly introduced code that was rebooting iPhones after they had not been interacted with for a period of time, making them harder for police to unlock. Broadly, it is harder for authorities to crack devices that have been powered off or not unlocked since switched on, a state known as Before First Unlock (BFU).\nThe FBI was still able to access another of Natanson’s devices, namely a second silver Macbook Pro. “Once opened, the laptop asked for a Touch Id or a Password,” the court record says. Natanson said she does not use biometrics for her devices, but after investigators told her to try, “when she applied her index finger to the fingerprint reader, the laptop unlocked.” The court record says the FBI has not yet obtained a full physical image of the device, which provides an essentially complete picture of what was stored on it. But the agents did take photos and audio recordings of conversations stored in the laptop’s Signal application, the court record says\n\n\nHungry hippo",

Is that all it is?\n\nI thought police/feds had 3rd party tech to hack your phones passcode, unless you use an actual password/code instead of a 4-6 digit number code. A random password of X length would (I imagine) be hard to crack. But a 4 number code only has 10,000 (0000-9999) possibilities that I feel like a computer could crack fairly easily.",

Retail is 18.99 USD.  I receive $1.20 per book sold.  \n\nRecently I was invited to join the class-action suit against Anthropic.  It had nothing to do with buying my book and destroying the binding.  \n\nAs I understand the suit, it’s that my writing, language and story (under copyright) will be used without my consent (or even knowledge till lately, as I was unaware of this) and uncompensated, to create a product/service that will make a shit ton of money for someone else who is utilizing my — again— copy written work.\n\nCan someone explain to me how a book I wrote - let’s be more specific: the sentence structure, cadence, word choices, metaphors, narrative tone, voice, story, plot, sub-plots etc etc which I created as a human and have contractually agreed to sell to other humans and their institutions can now have no claim to compensation when a company takes all that, feeds it into AI and then makes money off my work via the AI product?  \n\n I’m reading this thread and wondering if there are authors here who’d like to weigh in who’ve had their work used by for profit entities without consent and compensation.  \n\nNot without fault myself as my music back when came from the high seas.  I still bought music directly, and I never saw pirates as making money off torrents.  I also have seen sites where my book can be downloaded in what appears to be a free platform, and that does’t bother me.  If someone can’t afford to buy, I’d rather have them read it as I believe my book has value to others (it’s a memoir and many tell me it’s helped them).\n\nI did join the lawsuit.  I’m opposed to a company co-opting my work for their profit.  These companies have no care for humans. Their CEOs are sociopathic monsters who actually convince people that unfettered AI development will be a benefit to the working class when it’s already clear jobs, and whole industries, will become irrelevant.  \n\nFor the final rant about AI, I’m sickened by the fact that my writing could be contributing to programs that degrade our capacity to write, reason and think creatively and critically.  How’s that working for us so far even without AI?  The Epstein class would love nothing better than to have us mindless and impoverished, or better yet, only good for serving and benefiting them-even more than we already ceaselessly do.  If for that reason alone, there should be some blow back on the actions of Anthropic.",

I think a lot of the thread is a discussion precisely about your thought experiment.  \n\nI’d say that there’s a false equivalency made in your scenario.  What you’re describing is a fabulously creative act by a human  and if ever he or she did that with my book, I’d hope they sell it and I’d be in line to get a copy.  And share a cup of coffee with them.  \n\nThat person is not a machine that Hoovers up every word digitalized in the public realm, at unfathomable speed, second by second as time goes on, feeding it into a machine neural network to create an endless supply of language-for-profit services.  AI activity in that sense cannot be equated to the person I’d someday hope to meet.  This is my perspective at any rate 🤷",

The judge compared the process to “conserv[ing] space” through format conversion and found it transformative. Had Anthropic stuck to this approach from the beginning, it might have achieved the first legally sanctioned case of AI fair use. Instead, the company’s earlier piracy undermined its position.\n\nY'all want AI companies to follow the law, well here it is. They're following the law",

The whole network of terror. Imagine they can monitor every trace of who is talking about it and who might betray them. Anyone already compromised is going to be kept in check by this and their political grip will be infinite. This is way more terrifying than them knowing what a normal person is saying.

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.",

Bloomberg obtained audio from three 911 calls, including one made automatically by the Apple watch of an occupant inside the vehicle, on which people can be heard yelling and moaning. (Only two of those five fatalities are included in Bloomberg’s list, because there was insufficient evidence that the other three occupants had survived the initial crash.)\n\n>In October of this year, a 20-year-old man in Easton, Massachusetts, died after his Tesla Model Y collided with a tree and caught fire. The driver managed to connect with 911 dispatchers, according to the police department’s incident report, and said that “he was trapped inside of the vehicle after a crash and the vehicle was now on fire.” His remains were later found in the back seat.",

The real problem here is that general car buyers don’t even think about such things or the potential risks. So it’s not that they don’t familiarize themselves with these systems, they are completely unaware that they need to. VW/ Audi/ Porsche, Mercedes, Ford, Land Rover and a few others all have models with electronic mechanisms requiring a separate manual release for emergencies and most people don’t realize it. While the features are predominantly on EVs or cars with a lot of tech, that’s not always the case.\n\nTeslas, and all other cars sold here in North America that have electronic door mechanisms also have manual/ mechanical releases. Some of them are intuitive but most are not. Many of these manual releases only work from inside the vehicle so are of little use to those on the outside trying to help if the people inside are panicking or incapacitated. Many of them are quite obscure, not just unintuitive. \n\nIn the Tesla X, to open the Falcon Doors, a person needs to be able to reach the speaker grille on the door down by their feet.  The grille is magnetically attached and can be popped off, there is a nylon strap loop inside that can be pulled to manually release the door. I owned a Model X for over 4 years and this detail of the car always terrified me.  \n \nThe rear doors in the Model S have a manual release pull tab on the front of the rear seat, just below the seat cushion, right behind your knees. I’ve had Model S owners argue with me when I tell them about it. They insist their doors are mechanical and open normally and I’m just making shit up. Whatever.

The little label in the corner of your window will tell you if it's laminated or tempered glass.\n\nWhether the safety improvement of keeping all your parts inside the car is actually worth the safety loss of making it harder for rescue workers to pull you out, well, that's a different question. First responders have started carrying power shears specifically to cut through laminated side glass, but it's still slower than just shattering the window.",

It's not impossible to knock loose, but it's not practical advice in an emergency, and even spring-loaded tools will not reliably break windshields, but Tesla ones in particular.  \n\nThough, you're a bit wrong on the \"structural integrity\" part.  \n\nTechnically, the gasketing material is a glue, but generally laminated glass isn't a structural component of most cars even though it is stronger than tempered glass alone.  With non-Teslas, it has resistance to rollover, but \"structural integrity\" would be the wrong way to describe it [since you use a polyurethane adhesive](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v000146721/), and not some sort of cement or more rigid bond like with the rest of the car.  Windshield adhesive creates a strong bond, but not unlike silicon gasketing material you use on engine parts and seals.  \n\nTesla uses a different type of laminated glass in their cars which lets them reduce roof material without reducing roll over protection, but \"structural integrity\" would be the wrong word, since it's not load-bearing and it's not integral to the car driving.  I can confirm that Tesla also uses ordinary polyurethane adhesive to secure their windshields as well, specifically recommending [Dow Betaseal Express in the Model S service manual for example.  ](https://service.tesla.com/docs/ModelS/ServiceManual/en-us/GUID-16502D26-2DE7-4745-9DE6-28CA8E42EE4E.html)",

The front doors have easily accessible manual releases as well (from factory). The scary thing to me as an owner is the scenario where an accident is bad enough that it  deforms the body and the door or doors are jammed and would require jaws of life just like any vehicle in a serious accident. I’m curious what statistics are for post crash gasoline fires in jammed door scenarios vs electric. With all that being said, the front door releases should be better labeled or a different color and the rears  need a handle release like the front has, or ideally, normal friggin handles on both sides of the door.",
