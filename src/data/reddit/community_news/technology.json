You’ll owe at least 2.5% import duty, state use tax when you register it, and fees. The real problem is compliance and tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese cars that will be sold in Canada are not certified to U.S. DOT (FMVSS) and EPA standards, which means you’d need a Registered Importer to modify and certify it, often $10k+ or outright impossible. On top of that, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to Section 301 tariffs, which for EVs can effectively double the vehicle’s cost (100%+ duty).\n\nUnless the car is 25+ years old (exempt) or already U.S.-certified, you can easily end up paying more in tariffs and compliance than the car is worth. As mentioned in the begininng, it’s usually not worth it.\n\nEdit: for everyone asking why the EPA is involved here is the link. \n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fuel-economy-and-ev-range-testing",

Our national neighbors to the north have already caved, setting off alarm bells in some U.S. operations, and now NADA is hoping to amplify that warning.\n\nGo absolutely fuck yourselves drive.com. Canada didn’t cave on shit. \n\nThe Biden administration wanted to put tariffs on Chinese EVs, but thought it would be even better to have North America united as a bloc on those tariffs. So Canada imposed the exact same tariffs, despite the fact that NA EVs are almost exclusively in the American market. \n\nChina imposed disproportionately heavy tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports. Because they recognized that Canada wasn’t benefiting from the EV tariffs the same way America was. So Canada took the biggest hit, and got the smallest benefit. But we stood by our decision. \n\nThen Trump tariffed us, told us he didn’t need us, threatened to invade us, and members of his government started having meetings with Alberta separatists to break up our country. \n\nSo Canada said “why are we taking this hit for Americans if this is how they treat us?” Carney made a deal to lessen the Chinese EV tariffs and remove the hurt on our agricultural exports. THAT ONLY EXISTED BECAUSE WE WERE BEING GOOD ALLIES TO AMERICANS!!!!\n\nFuck all you people.",

Products are produced to the price point that is asked for, but in a lot of instances that no longer means they cannot produce to a high standard.\n\nNo one bats an eye about their Chinese made Apple or Android phones, but somehow thinks that we are solely capable of producing anything else better than everyone else. China decided to not play catch up with gas powered vehicles and saw an emerging next generation car opportunity and capitalized. Their battery technology is superior and their manufacturing capacity is huge. \n\nCouple this with the same folks desire to destroy public education, kill R&D funding and the overall anti-intellectualism and you are dooming the country you were lucky enough to be born in.",

I noticed that the time displayed in the corner on live US news broadcasts was about ten minutes off (eg, if the current real world time was 7:32am in DC, and 7:32pm in the city I was in, the US national news timestamp would be 7:22am, meaning we were seeing news with a ten minute delay).\n\nThen I noticed that the screen would go black periodically. It finally clicked that the US live news was being screened and censored. The lag was the time they gave themselves to block out ideas they didn’t want broadcast there. Entire news segments (1-4 minutes) were being blocked.\n\nI like the regular people and culture of the country, so I don’t want to name it in case I want to go back (I’d never get into any sort of political action there, but we can see how things are going with travel and ai surveillance of socials already). \n\nI think about that when things like this happen. It’s the kind of thing the US is supposed to be against. The very first amendment provides this right (free speech, free press, free from national/forced religion, free to choose any religion, free to assemble/protest, etc).\n\nThese rights are usually chipped away gradually, and only just enough to avoid causing a big uproar, and when people accept that change, it’s chipped away a little more later. Then a year or decade later the accumulated change is so drastic that if it had happened all at once there’d be mass uprisings, but instead, because of the slow creep, everyone is just lulled into complacency thinking, “wow, how’d we get here?” And carrying on as if things were normal because, “what can I do?”\n\nPoint being, there needs to be pushback over these little chips being removed from rights, even if they seem inconsequential at the time, because they are likely part of a larger pattern that will ultimately fundamentally change the freedoms we enjoy.",

The pretense of \"F-f-for the children!\" is paper thin at best. \n\nThis is just one of many steps into digital surveillance and gross overreach that are going to be taken in the near future as the Technocrats and Governments around the world realize how much they can get from us. \n\nPrivacy is vanishing before our very eyes.\n\nGod, I hate to sound like a tinfoil-hatter but it's becoming impossible to ignore just how much we're being surveilled in our daily lives. \n\nThere is no space that they will not try to take.\n\nEven if I were to pretend they were sincere about PROTECT THE KIDS it still isn't the job of the Government or any Corporation to do so. That's what their parents are for. \n\nIt isn't anyone else's fault that Deborah threw an iPad at her 9 year old to shut them up. That's her failure and her responsibility.\n\nEDIT: This blew up and my notifications are a circus of bad faith morons making some Olympic leaps so here's a few little clarifiers for you.\n\n-Sit your asses down and have a thorough conversation (or several) with your kids/teens about online safety. My parents did this with my brother and I and they didn't even grow up in the internet age. You can do it. You know more than your parents did, and have access to more tools than they had, too. Teach your kids about boundaries and how to set them. When and how to walk away. How to identify and report inappropriate content, and how to Block people. Teach them about identifying information and stress the importance of never ever sharing it. Stranger danger. Let them ask questions and make sure they know that they can and should come to you if something feels off.\n\n-Just don't put them onto the unrestricted internet. Little Jacob doesn't need an iPad. If you must put a screen in front of him, make it something safe like a goddamn Nintendo. \n\n-I am not American but I see what's happening there and understand that the rise of Fascism and this increasing demand for surveillance are not coincidental. The role of Discord in Nepal's recent revolution should be something to consider in the conversation about Discord wanting your ID.\n\n-For the love of God, no, I am not a Pedo Defender. Just a gal who doesn't feel the need to fork over every last piece of identifying information she has to faceless corporations and whoever they want to forward it to. Or, you know, occurrences like the data breach Discord Dearest suffered in October. I can remember that far back and so can you! \n\n-If I refuse to submit my ID, my account gets labeled as a Teen Account. I'm 30something. That doesn't protect kids.\n\n-The Government and Corporations don't give a damn about you or your kids. \"Protect the Children!!\" And \"THIS IS TO FIGHT TERRORISM!!\" are smokescreens used to sneak other, more sinister agendas under your nose. God fucking dammit I sound like a Hatter again.\n\n-The Trojan Horse looked like a Pretty Pretty Horsie. It was more than that. Go read about it and then do some thinking, ok?",

Discord showed up and just said “instant messaging and voice chat for gamers that doesn’t suck and a bunch of cool features most people won’t use for free”. Everyone rejoiced.\n\nYears later Discord kinda became an internet cornerstone.

Then we got Nitro, features nobody asked for, updates pushed faster than the QA team could work, pressure from governments to regulate things and give their spies backdoors into the platform, and just gradual enshitification.\n\nThe only way we can move on from Discord is to go back to self hosting small web forums and wait for Discord to die and another platform to take its place.",

Requiring users to submit even more sensitive personal data under these circumstances is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates a serious lack of awareness of the trust you have already damaged.\n\nBefore demanding additional identification from users, your organization should first explain—clearly and transparently—how such a breach was allowed to occur, what accountability measures were taken, and why users should believe their data will be handled safely this time. At present, there is no credible justification for asking users to assume even greater risk.\n\nTrust is not restored by collecting more data. It is restored by demonstrating competence, accountability, and respect for user security. Until those standards are met, this policy change feels less like a security measure and more like a liability transfer from your organization onto your users.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this requirement or, at minimum, provide a secure alternative that does not involve submitting highly sensitive identification documents.\n\nThis policy, as it stands, is unacceptable.\"",

          "text": "Let me tell you all a little Discord story. Back in 2017 I was attending Blizzcon as I had for many years. One thing about Blizzcon people don't realize is how many epic after parties there are in the area. Heat Ultra Lounge is one of the closest nightclubs and usually has a party hosted by one group or another. Usually a private party where the host is a Blizzcon regular or a PC vendor running promotions (for example in 2015 the party was sponsored by Predator). It's known for being one of the best after parties of the con.\n\nSo in 2017 when I was attending Blizzcon with a friend who had never been before, I wanted to make sure she got the chance to go to this party. But this particular year in typical corporate fashion, Discord rented out the entire venue so they could control who got in. Fortunately I have a friend who's married to a pro gamer and the pro gamers were all given VIP passes. Since they had the VIP passes they didn't need their regular tickets and offered to give them to me and my friend which we gladly accepted.\n\nBut when we got to the door, Discord (not Heat's own bouncers) turned us away. The reason? Our names weren't on the tickets. I asked why that mattered, I could have the ticket owners come vouch and the club would still check our IDs anyway. Still they argued and refused. So I reached out to Mallory Loar, the head of Discords events who I had previously been in contact with. But now when we had a problem, suddenly crickets. We never got in.\n\nNow at the end of the day, it's just a party, not a big deal. But it's more the principal of the thing - that a big company can come and just reserve a venue that usually hosts fan-run or sponsored parties, then decide themselves who has access to a Blizzcon tradition. And adding bureaucratic rules that make no sense with an unresponsive support team.\n\nIt showed me just how corporate Discord had become. I've long since been done with them.",

That's not magically going to get rid of the people who voted for him or contain the racist and divisive forces channeled by the Republican party.\n\nHell, if the Republican party is totally dismantled in a US-style de-nazification program in 3 years, and the Dems rule unopposed for 20 years straight sort of like after a mirror of the Civil War, this could STILL HAPPEN AGAIN as long as the Wealth elite exist and continue to cause problems to happen in society and then go and fund fascist solutions because they REFUSE TO SACRIFICE any bit of their wealth for any reason at all.\n\nNo, actually, it's worse than that. Not only do they refuse to sacrifice wealth, they refuse to sacrifice their ability to MAKE EVEN MORE WEALTH. It's not like they're short on wealth or profit right now. There isn't even credible socialist political power in this country. They're funding fascism because they THINK it might emerge, and morons like Peter Thiel are scared shitless its like 2 days away or something. So rich AND delusional; great combo.\n\nPeople don't want to hear it for a variety of reasons, but the problem is, and always will be, Capitalism. Who created the millions of downtrodden people who want to lash out, and thus vote for Trump ? Capitalism. Who created Trump himself ? He's one of the worst examples of a human being made by it. Capitalism. Who poured billions of dollars into souring Sander's campaign even though he isn't even that much of a socialist ? Capitalism. What creates a socially divisive society of competition for the benefit of the elite ? Capitalism.\n\nCapitalists wrote the US Constitution and stuck it full of veto-points because they didn't trust the poors to make choices. You might think that's cause they thought the poors were stupid. And perhaps they did. Lots of people do today still. Except that's not really it. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't, but they were really afraid of the poors voting to take all their wealth. Which is a NON-STUPID response to inequality. That's why there's a house AND Senate. That's why there's an Electoral College. That's why the stupid fillibuster rule exists (it's not in the constitution, either).\n\nThe system makes the unrest and discontent through the process of creating insane wealth for a few, and then those few fund the fascist response to protect that insane wealth. It'll do this over and over and over again as long as Capitalists have any political power (and thus wealth) at all.",

VPN's allow you to view content that might be blocked in your country by allowing you to view media as if you are located in a different physical country, bypassing regional blocks. As an additional benefit, the advertisers that help sponsor that state media coverage of the event receive less exposure and the event receives lower viewership ratings as more people choose to view the event through a non-filtered perspective from a different nation's coverage. So consider using a VPN today!",

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.",

It would be better to use Americans, but then they'll be laying off Americans later.\n\n\n\nFor people concerned about foreign drivers, a Philippines tourist is allowed to visit the US and drive here with their Philippines driver's license plus an international driver's permit, which is just bureaucratic paperwork.

Holy hell man so offbase.\n\n\n\"Waymo vehicles are not directly remote-controlled or \"joysticked\" by human operators in real-time. Instead, they use a \"fleet response\" system where remote specialists provide high-level guidance or navigation, such as clearing obstacles or directing the car to take alternative routes, while the vehicle handles all driving, steering, and braking itself. \"\n\nKey details regarding Waymo's remote assistance include:\n\n - No Active Driving: Remote agents cannot directly take over, steer, or brake the car.\n\n - Contextual Assistance: When a vehicle encounters a confusing situation (e.g., road construction), it may stop and request help, and a remote human agent helps the system understand the scene to continue safely.\n\n - Safety Rationale: Waymo believes remote driving is unsafe due to potential wireless connection latency (lag).\n\n - Human Intervention: If the vehicle cannot resolve a situation, human roadside assistance is sent to the physical location\n\nWaymo Driver and Remote Assistance has been [third party verified by TÜV SÜD](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/independent-audits) as recently as Nov 2025 and [Automated Vehicle System Consortium](https://avsc.sae-itc.com/publication/avsc-04-2023)\n\nThey don't \"take over\". The car gets into a trouble spot where the safest choice is to stop. That can be remotely monitored and observe what is making them stop and only suggest things to do. This is a security measure and again if Tesla is doing remote driving they are even further behind than thought.\n\nYou can tell people that upvote this have never been in a Waymo. Lots of Tesla boy turfers that hide their history.\n\nWaymo remote assistance is clearly defined. There is CLEARLY a concerted turfing effort to pump remote controlling probably to try to cover for when people find out Tesla does that probably from the control car.\n\nThere is no other reason this type of info would be pumped. Just five minutes of research would tell you why remote control is a horrible idea.\n\nIf Tesla boys are pumping and turfing this \"claim\" on Waymo, Tesla has to be stuck in that mode. Name another reason why this would even come up? It is misinformation and a bad product choice.",

It knows to turn around and go a different route if the way is blocked or hazardous.\n\nBut in those edge cases where it can’t tell what to do*, these people “provide guidance”. They aren’t driving the cars, they look at the video and LiDAR feeds and explain to the AI model what it is seeing, and sometimes to suggest a route to pick. Then the existing decision system uses that additional info to make a decision and keep driving. The AI is still driving the cars.\n\nhttps://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\n\n*As an example, this week they published about handling extreme edge cases, like what the car should do if it encounters a tornado. They are running simulations on what that looks like to LiDAR and cameras, so the cars know to avoid the area.",

Remote human operators handling edge cases or difficult scenarios isn't necessarily bad engineering—it's often the pragmatic solution when full autonomy isn't reliable enough yet. The issue is the lack of transparency about it.\n\nWhat's interesting is this mirrors the early days of a lot of automation. Even Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" has always had the disclaimer that it requires active supervision. The difference is Waymo marketed itself as truly driverless, so finding out there are remote operators (whether in the Philippines or anywhere else) feels like a bait-and-switch. That said, remote assistance for stuck vehicles is different from remote *driving*—if they're just helping with routing decisions or confirming it's safe to proceed in ambiguous situations, that's still way more autonomous than a human driving the whole time.\n\nThe Philippines angle also opens up the labor economics question. If we're outsourcing the \"human in the loop\" part of AI to lower-wage countries, we're essentially just offshoring the jobs rather than eliminating them. It's the mechanical turk problem all over again, except now it's dressed up in Silicon Valley marketing speak about revolutionary AI.",

Common sense and decency are fatal to conservative ideology. Literally can't have either and want what conservatives have been selling. Even the non-racist stuff like their trickle down tax policies fall apart after a person's first math lesson. The average 1st grader is like \"they said 2-1= 5?

In this case it's entirely individual employee donations (they have ~200k) under the then federal maximum of $3,000, so entirely worthless as some sort of demotivational \"both sides\" evidence that Alphabet controlled Harris.

They wrote an 8-page suicide note...surely that wasn't the only thing in there.\n\nI went looking for some other articles about this and found some other interesting tidbits:\n\n* The girls dropped out of school in 2020, 5-6 years ago. They weren't doing well in school when they were attending. [This source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) claims the girls dropped out because their father was deeply in debt and could no longer afford to send them.\n* The family lived in a gated community and none of their neighbors knew them. One said “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents.\"\n* According to one source, the girls never had their own phone - they were using their parents' phone to get online. And the parents didn't just take the phone away - they also threatened to marry off the girls.\n* The father, Chetan Kumar, actually has two wives who are sisters. The source linked above says \"two of his partners walked out\" and disappeared for a few days; he filed a missing persons report and they came back within a few days. (Unclear if those two are the same as the two wives...)\n* [This source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece) says there wasn't even any evidence of a game found on the device(s) they were using, and said that they mostly cited TV shows. But [this source ](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2026/02/04/three-sisters-jump-to-their-death-after-parents-cut-off-their-video-gaming-time/)says evidence was found on their devices of long gaming sessions (and also contradicts the other article, which said they didn't have their own phones). However, literally no one has been able to name the game itself, and the description of the game changes from source to source - some say it's a \"love game\" (I assume a dating sim), others a task-based game, and one even claimed that the last task in the game was suicide.\n* Although the suicide note does mention their love of gaming and Korean culture, it also talks about the girls' loneliness. Interesting how that hasn't become part of any of the headlines.\n* Their diary/suicide note also [referenced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sad-isolated-ghaziabad-sisters-lived-in-k-bubble/articleshow/127918232.cms) beatings (\"Did we live in this world to get beaten by you… death would be better for us than beatings.\")",

The phone was taken away two weeks ago, and sold. There was ongoing conflict about their obsession with Korean culture, and the quote from their writings published in that article is about him taking that away from them, in general, not the phone, or the phone game specifically. The father is quoted as saying: *\"All three girls wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour towards us changed and they went into a shell. They lived in their own world.\"* \n\n\nThere were also apparently writings found on the walls of the room, relating to their loneliness. They were not homeschooled, and they didn't interact with neighbourhood kids either. \n\n\nOh, and they're actually half sisters - and also cousins? Idk if that's the right word for it, but their father lives with and claims marriage to 3 sisters, with the eldest sister being his first wife. Biologically, one of the girls had one mother, the other two had another. There are 2 surviving siblings. ",

The way this is being reported (as of now) is setting off my alarms that those girls were likely dealing with a much more concerning reality than a mere loss of access to a game. Especially the fact that the eldest daughter was part of it all. Generally speaking, whether pressured to or not, eldest daughters tend to take on a secondary mothering role to younger siblings. If death seemed to be preferable to whatever life she and her siblings were facing as a result of losing contact with the outside world, I think that's a pretty big sign that the conditions of their daily life need to be looked into.",

He has been living in the Sahibabad area for the past three years with his wives Sujata and Heena, who are sisters, and their five children - four girls and a boy aged 10. “Before this, the family lived in Tilla Mode for eight years. The three sisters last attended Green Valley School, where their academic performance was sub-par,” said the officer.\n\nInside the gated society, several neighbours told The Hindu that they only knew the family from a distance. “We have seen the children walk in and out with parents, but we were never able to socialise with the children or their parents,” said Gaurav Kohli, a neighbour.\n\nRahul Jha, the secretary of the apartment who accompanied the police during the investigation, told The Hindu that he learnt the family faced financial troubles. “The family lived on rent, and they did not speak to anyone much or participate in any activities. A day before this happened, Mr. Kumar handed me ₹700 for maintenance, but he never delayed any payment,” M.R. Jha said.\n\nAt present, the police have recovered Ms. Sujata’s cell phone and sent it for forensic analysis. The police have also seized the handwritten note left by the girls. ***The DCP said that a case has not been registered yet as the parents have not filed a complaint.***\n\n😒\n https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/three-minors-end-life-in-ghaziabad/article70591451.ece",

Tech bros and private equity just repackaged the same shit we already had into a proprietary data harvesting playground and then sold it back to us as a product. \n\nOn a sidenote, while I also agree wholeheartedly with you in regards to pre-reddit hobby forums, I think it's worth pointing out how badly most other forum sites have adapted over the last couple decades. I still frequent a number of them and it blows my mind that they're all still the same old crappy phpbb type setups where it's impossible to follow a larger conversation without reading 90 pages of nested quotes and shit. I'm not saying they should all just clone Reddit or anything like that, but I do feel very strongly that in-line replies should be the standard. If someone has a response to someone else, I don't want to find it four pages later. Drives me nuts.

If you don’t buy a webcam to share your face for them to link your personal data to a unique face and allowing them to sell that data, you’re basically allowing predators to molest kids. We need to protect the kids. Don’t mind all the tech CEOs and politicians literally raping children and not even being investigated to begin with. It’s the fact that you don’t share your face with random blokes in india who approve your face, that is truly damaging to society. Sharing images of literal kids on instagram or tiktok is fine, but you not sharing a picture of yourself is a big no no for our elite 0.1% epsteiners.",

It also helps protect kids because it can age gate people over a certain age from spaces, and if you try to put yourself in a lower age bracket in this system then that becomes pretty suspicious. And it doesn't create any undue burdens on software developers or people who host web content. In theory it can be used to curate individual users experiences on news, entertainment, and social media sites because individual page elements can be age gated. It creates a frame work where the served up software can say \"this is mature content\" and the operating system can say \"I'm not allowed to view mature content\" and the served up software can say \"okied dokie, not displayed\" and the user doesn't have to do anything.",

But [they do acknowledge this](https://wiki.revolt.chat/notes/project/core-vision/) and many other issues as well, and are slowly working on it.\n\n**Edit:** What comes to the Chinese ties, I couldn't find *any* evidence besides headless rumors. It's an open source software and you can self-host it, the main developers are from the United Kingdom and Canada. Meanwhile Discord is a closed source app confirmed owned by the US *and* the Chinese. Yeah, I'll take my chances with Stoat, thanks.\n\n**Edit2:** Steam voice is another surprisingly good alternative for small friend groups who are happy with just one chat.",

It worked really well and there just wasn't anything like it, and it was much more tightly focused on providing cross platform text and voice chat and that was about it.\n\nNow it's gotten extremely bloated and I don't think it knows what it's supposed to be, and using it has turned into a very strange experience - I would venture it was never really designed to be a forum hosting platform and people have kind of shoehorned it into that role. Also there SO much porn, I'm not really that surprised they're doing age verification because giving pornography to kids is a crime in a lot of places",

When a new device joins a network it joins a default vlan with no egress and no access to the home network. The user must use the app to click the drop-down and assign the device to a group. Groups have very simple config: egress enabled, ingress enabled, and lan access. All your IP cameras can live in one group, with egress, ingress and lan disabled. All your smart devices in another gorup. Think guest wifi network but dynamic for any group that you want.

Truth was lost, a chimera reshaped to match agenda, prejudices, thus consigning the entire political process to a mummer’s charade of false indignation, hypocritical posturing and a pervasive contempt for the commonry.  \n>  \n>Once subsumed, ideals and the honour created by their avowal can never be regained, except, alas, by outright, unconstrained rejection, invariably instigated by the commonry, at the juncture of one particular moment, one single event, of such brazen injustice that revolution becomes the only reasonable response.  \n>  \n>Consider this then a warning. Liars will lie, and continue to do so, even beyond being caught out. They will lie, and in time, such liars will convince themselves, will in all self-righteousness divest the liars of culpability. Until comes a time when one final lie is voiced, the one that can only be answered by rage, by cold murder, and on that day, blood shall rain down every wall of this vaunted, waning society.\n\nSteven Erikson, Reaper's Gale",

Yes, Tolkien devised these languages pretty much single-handedly (at least as far as they got before he wrote LOTR), but the fruits of philology aren't treated as intellectual property the same way as the products of fiction are. I can't claim ownership of words I made up like \"salientize\" or \"salienate\" (meaning \"to make something more noticeable or attention-grabbing\") even though it doesn't look like anyone has ever published anything with those words before, because they are obvious and natural conclusions of philological development. It would be different if Tolkien just made those languages up from scratch with his imagination, but he basically \"discovered\" them in the ether of fictional reality and brought enough receipts for other people to check his work.",

They will have made the US a much weaker, less preferred trading partner, and will eventually crash the dollar. They will drive up poverty, homelessness, and health related issues, which will increase crime. Things *will* become less safe for these elites, and they will ultimately have less power and their fortunes worth far less due to being accounted for in US currency. It honestly would not surprise me if the more logical assholes behind all of this have been secretly planning how to de-escalate this situation once Trump is dead and he cannot turn his rabid base on them.",

These billionaires want you to believe that the reason things are bad for us every day Americans and why affordability is low is because of the 20 million (so they claim) undocumented people in our land. Let's do some math.\n\nThose hypothetical 20 million people would need to be taking in $125,000 in services, housing and other costs *per person* in order to be doing as much harm as these 10 individuals are by their wealth hoarding. If you spent the $125k on these 20 million people, their dollars go back into their communities, creating jobs and opportunities throughout the country. \n\nIf you expand it to the top 100 individuals, they have a combined \\~$6.3 Trillion hoarded. There are 100 people with over $11.7 BILLION dollars in the US. That's higher than the GDP of Japan ($4.1T) and three times the GDP of Canada ($2.1T). There are nearly 1000 people with a net worth over $1B, giving the top 1000 earners a combined net worth of $8.2T.\n\nThe US has about $160 trillion in private wealth. These 1,000 people (0.0003% of the population) hold over 5% of the nation's wealth. 5% of the nations population is 16.5 million people. That's between the population of Pennsylvania (13M, 5th most populated state) and New York (20M, 4th most populated state). Think about that for a second. \n\nLet's say you get lucky and you find a job that pays you $100,000 per hour. Surely, you would joint his list, right? Working 40 hours a week, you would only make $208m per year. Elon Musk saw his net worth balloon to over $700B recently, earning him over $300B in just one year. That is the equivalent of earning over $34.2 million dollars **per hour**...for every single one of the 8,760 hours in a year, whether he's taking a shit, shitposting on X, or shitting on the American people. \n\nThat means that Elon Musk earned $1m every two minutes. Making $50k a year, around the median personal wage, you would need to work 20 years to earn what Musk earned in 2 minutes.\n\n**The combined net worth of the top 1000 richest people grew by over $1 trillion dollars in 2025. Do you know how much we spent on SNAP, Unemployment, housing assistance and child tax credits? $650 billion. They are telling you that the problem is all of these welfare queens and undocumented people while they are stealing nearly double that.** \n\nSo you tell me? Who is robbing us? The people who occasionally use a social service like welfare, the undocumented people sending their children to school and driving on our public roads, or the uber wealthy? Even if you assume there are 50 million leeches in this country (about 15% of the population), they would each need to be costing us over $20,000 to match the wealth hoarded by these monsters.\n\nAnd the sad part is that they are not done yet. They will never have enough. They will not stop until you die.",

An oligopoly is like a monopoly but with a few players instead of just one. But it's still anti-competitive, because they often act as a cartel and we get the exact same downsides as a monopoly.\n\nHow do we measure whether an industry is an oligopoly or not? Well, the common way is if one industry member died, how big would the effect be on the market? Using an analogy, if a grocery store closed, if people can just use the grocery store next to it, it's not a big deal, but if there are no grocery stores nearby, people are deeply affected.\n\nSo in a perfectly competitive system, no entity should be able to negatively affect the entire market in such a dramatic way.\n\nBillionaires, can buy ENTIRE industries and delete them from existence, for the lulz if they want.\n\nThere is no good argument why any INDIVIDUAL should be able to affect the market in such a dramatic way, the same way no one entity should in a market. It's unhealthy, it's anti-competitive, and it's bad for everyone.\n\nThis of course is only referring to a billionaire's affect on the market, of course, in the US of A, we decided money = speech, so billionaires can just buy entire governments if they want to. There's no argument to why they should be able to do that.\n\nThank you for coming to my 'fuck billionaires and all their defenders' TED talk.",

The interior is a gimmick design to make you feel luxurious but nothing of value. \n\nI had the A4 before and the gear shifter doubled as a wrist rest as you controlled the infotainment dial. That was thoughtful engineering. The BMW has the volume button and the infotainment dial at two different ends and then a recessed gear shifter. The lag between the iPhone and the infotainment system is substantial. When it snows, the trunk door will drop a significant amount of snow into the trunk when opening. \n\nIn general, the BMW is poorly designed for its having such a strong market share. It may be great under the hood, but the rest of it can’t beat even a budget brand.",

                  "text": "OK then post it \n\n\nYummy pig\n\n\nThe FBI has been unable to access a Washington Post reporter’s seized iPhone because it was in Lockdown Mode, a sometimes overlooked feature that makes iPhones broadly more secure, according to recently filed court records.\nThe court record shows what devices and data the FBI was able to ultimately access, and which devices it could not, after raiding the home of the reporter, Hannah Natanson, in January as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.\n\n\n\n\nDo you know anything else about phone unlocking technology? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.\n“Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the court record reads, referring to the FBI’s Computer Analysis Response Team, a unit focused on performing forensic analyses of seized devices. The document is written by the government, and is opposing the return of Natanson’s devices. \nThe FBI raided Natanson’s home as part of its investigation into government contractor Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who is charged with, among other things, retention of national defense information. The government believes Perez-Lugones was a source of Natanson’s, and provided her with various pieces of classified information. While executing a search warrant for his mobile phone, investigators reviewed Signal messages between Pere-Lugones and the reporter, the Department of Justice previously said.\nThen, the government obtained search warrants for Natanson’s residence, vehicle, and person to seize her electronic devices. Those warrants included language that would have legally allowed them to press Natanson’s fingers onto the devices, or hold them up to her face, to unlock them if biometrics were enabled.\nUpstairs in Natanson’s residence, the FBI found a powered-off silver Macbook Pro, an Apple iPhone 13, a Handy branded audio recording device, and a Seagate portable hard drive, according to the court record.\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the court record says.\n\n\nA screenshot from the court record.\nThe court record mentioning Lockdown Mode was filed on January 30th, around two weeks after the FBI raided Natanson’s residence, indicating the FBI has not been able to access the iPhone during that time.\nApple primarily markets Lockdown Mode as a feature to mitigate remote access spyware, such as that sold by companies like NSO Group to government agencies. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all,” Apple’s website reads. Essentially, Lockdown Mode makes some changes to how iOS works to make it harder for third parties to hack into an iPhone. It blocks most message attachment types; loads webpages differently; and stops FaceTime calls unless you’ve previously called that person in the last 30 days.\nA small section of the Lockdown Mode page also mentions mitigations around connecting an iPhone to an external accessory. “Device connections: To connect your iPhone or iPad to an accessory or another computer, the device needs to be unlocked,” the Lockdown Mode page says. “To connect your Mac laptop with Apple silicon to an accessory, your Mac needs to be unlocked and you need to provide explicit approval.” Mobile forensics tools such as Graykey and Cellebrite, which law enforcement use to break into phones, work by physically connecting to a phone to then unlock them.\n\n\n“Many advanced forensic techniques and law enforcement tools rely on vulnerabilities that Lockdown Mode explicitly blocks or limits,” Andrew Garrett, CEO of digital forensics firm Garrett Discovery, told 404 Media.\nNeither the Washington Post nor Apple responded to a request to comment. The FBI declined to comment.\nThere is a constant cat and mouse dynamic between the companies that make mobile phones and their operating systems, namely Apple and Google, and the firms making tools to break into those devices. In 2024, 404 Media revealed Apple quietly introduced code that was rebooting iPhones after they had not been interacted with for a period of time, making them harder for police to unlock. Broadly, it is harder for authorities to crack devices that have been powered off or not unlocked since switched on, a state known as Before First Unlock (BFU).\nThe FBI was still able to access another of Natanson’s devices, namely a second silver Macbook Pro. “Once opened, the laptop asked for a Touch Id or a Password,” the court record says. Natanson said she does not use biometrics for her devices, but after investigators told her to try, “when she applied her index finger to the fingerprint reader, the laptop unlocked.” The court record says the FBI has not yet obtained a full physical image of the device, which provides an essentially complete picture of what was stored on it. But the agents did take photos and audio recordings of conversations stored in the laptop’s Signal application, the court record says\n\n\nHungry hippo",

Is that all it is?\n\nI thought police/feds had 3rd party tech to hack your phones passcode, unless you use an actual password/code instead of a 4-6 digit number code. A random password of X length would (I imagine) be hard to crack. But a 4 number code only has 10,000 (0000-9999) possibilities that I feel like a computer could crack fairly easily.",

That’s a recipe for disaster. If they want a better public image they need to keep their side of the street clean, as the saying goes.\n\nThe history of border patrol has an era where they brought on way to many people way to fast, did little to no background checks or training, and sent them out into the world with a new gun and badge to round people up. Countless rights violations and crimes ended up being committed (eg, murders, rapes, using detainees for sex (aka rape), drug dealing, etc).

Even moderate people that support detaining or even deporting felons that are here illegally look at these lapses in background checks and training as an issue, and anyone that knows how this turned out in the past can see it increases the chances of problems in the future.",

          "text": "Since DHS wants to know our opinions of their policies, apparently, here’s mine.\n\nThey’re dumb and harmful to everyone, citizens included, and I think anyone working in DHS *knows*, or at least should know by now, that the end goal of this militarization of ICE is not merely to deport illegal immigrants, but to intimidate both immigrants and US citizens who oppose this regime.\n\nLet’s say for a second it wasn’t though.\n\nImmigrants, both legal and illegal, [commit fewer crimes per capita](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/immigrants-do-not-commit-more-crimes-in-the-us-despite-fearmongering/) than US-born citizens.  [Communities with increases in immigration tend to see decreases in crime.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/debunking-myth-immigrants-and-crime/) [Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they receive in benefits.](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/immigrants-pay-taxes-benefits-study/3973064/?amp=1) And there have been studies showing that [immigrants boost the economy overall.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy).\n\nSo, even if there was a magic button you could press to make all the immigrants, or all the illegal immigrants, go home, without hurting anyone in the process, it would actually make our country poorer and more dangerous to live in, rather than safer and richer.\n\nBut there isn’t a magic button to do that, and ICE’s enforcement actions are hurting and sometimes even killing, not just immigrants, but US citizens as well.  Renee Good and Alex Pretti were both US citizens who ICE murdered on the street during “enforcement operations”, Keith Porter was a US citizen killed by an off-duty ICE officer, and 6 people have died in ICE facilities in 2026 alone: Heber Sanchaz Domínguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Parady La, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, and Geraldo Lunas Campos all died, or in some cases, were murdered, while in ICE custody.\n\nSo if you are a DHS agent or ICE agent reading this, whether you’re spying on me because I criticized the king, or whether you just happen to be on reddit, please resign.  Start looking for work elsewhere.  They are going to ask you to do horrible things, to follow orders that are blatantly illegal, and it is going to be a lot harder for you to defy them than you think it will be.  Start looking for a way out now.",

When i talked to someone i told them that i wanted the calls to stop, they were annoying me. The lady asked for my name and DOB, i said, no ill give you the number and you can just take it off. She told me that without the name and DOB she cant do anything. So i told her i would give my name, she said that was good enough. I proceeded to tell her that this number that i called to reach her, had no name, and i have no idea who im talking to, so im not giving my DOB, she told me she cant do anything. I then looked up red cross' number called it, had to wait about 3 times as long i didnt the first time. When i was answered, i explained the situation and the person asked for my name and DOB, i said, ill give you my name but im not give my DOB over the phone. He took my name and told me it was all good and i have received another call. Now i dont know if that number was really red cross and that lady was just doing her job, but fuck all of that, especially when the number was different from the number listed everywhere and there was no name on the caller id.",

I hope people have more empathy for the victims and try to crack down in these issues by raising more awareness and even exposing these corrupted scam companies.

The financial advisor would not disburse the money and called the kids to talk some sense into the dad.\n\nThis particular financial advisor is a good guy but a bad financial advisor could just as well be the scammer and steal all the money.",

Bloomberg obtained audio from three 911 calls, including one made automatically by the Apple watch of an occupant inside the vehicle, on which people can be heard yelling and moaning. (Only two of those five fatalities are included in Bloomberg’s list, because there was insufficient evidence that the other three occupants had survived the initial crash.)\n\n>In October of this year, a 20-year-old man in Easton, Massachusetts, died after his Tesla Model Y collided with a tree and caught fire. The driver managed to connect with 911 dispatchers, according to the police department’s incident report, and said that “he was trapped inside of the vehicle after a crash and the vehicle was now on fire.” His remains were later found in the back seat.",

The real problem here is that general car buyers don’t even think about such things or the potential risks. So it’s not that they don’t familiarize themselves with these systems, they are completely unaware that they need to. VW/ Audi/ Porsche, Mercedes, Ford, Land Rover and a few others all have models with electronic mechanisms requiring a separate manual release for emergencies and most people don’t realize it. While the features are predominantly on EVs or cars with a lot of tech, that’s not always the case.\n\nTeslas, and all other cars sold here in North America that have electronic door mechanisms also have manual/ mechanical releases. Some of them are intuitive but most are not. Many of these manual releases only work from inside the vehicle so are of little use to those on the outside trying to help if the people inside are panicking or incapacitated. Many of them are quite obscure, not just unintuitive. \n\nIn the Tesla X, to open the Falcon Doors, a person needs to be able to reach the speaker grille on the door down by their feet.  The grille is magnetically attached and can be popped off, there is a nylon strap loop inside that can be pulled to manually release the door. I owned a Model X for over 4 years and this detail of the car always terrified me.  \n \nThe rear doors in the Model S have a manual release pull tab on the front of the rear seat, just below the seat cushion, right behind your knees. I’ve had Model S owners argue with me when I tell them about it. They insist their doors are mechanical and open normally and I’m just making shit up. Whatever.

It's not impossible to knock loose, but it's not practical advice in an emergency, and even spring-loaded tools will not reliably break windshields, but Tesla ones in particular.  \n\nThough, you're a bit wrong on the \"structural integrity\" part.  \n\nTechnically, the gasketing material is a glue, but generally laminated glass isn't a structural component of most cars even though it is stronger than tempered glass alone.  With non-Teslas, it has resistance to rollover, but \"structural integrity\" would be the wrong way to describe it [since you use a polyurethane adhesive](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v000146721/), and not some sort of cement or more rigid bond like with the rest of the car.  Windshield adhesive creates a strong bond, but not unlike silicon gasketing material you use on engine parts and seals.  \n\nTesla uses a different type of laminated glass in their cars which lets them reduce roof material without reducing roll over protection, but \"structural integrity\" would be the wrong word, since it's not load-bearing and it's not integral to the car driving.  I can confirm that Tesla also uses ordinary polyurethane adhesive to secure their windshields as well, specifically recommending [Dow Betaseal Express in the Model S service manual for example.  ](https://service.tesla.com/docs/ModelS/ServiceManual/en-us/GUID-16502D26-2DE7-4745-9DE6-28CA8E42EE4E.html)",

I’m curious what statistics are for post crash gasoline fires in jammed door scenarios vs electric. With all that being said, the front door releases should be better labeled or a different color and the rears  need a handle release like the front has, or ideally, normal friggin handles on both sides of the door.",
