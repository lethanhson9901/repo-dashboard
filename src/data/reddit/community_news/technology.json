So if you ask the AI something it will draw from all the training on Wikipedia, but there's no more traffic to the website. That means people don't know the knowledge is from Wikipedia, they think it's from ChatGPT (or whatever chatbot they're using) and they will not go to Wikipedia, because the chatbots don't source their claims. And if they don't go to Wikipedia to check the sources there, they may be misinformed, but they also don't donate or understand the labor that has gone into assembling that accurate information.\n\nWikimedia has released a few numbers and it shows that while the internet has grown in traffic overall, traffic to Wikipedia has actually decreased in recent years. This means people get their information from elsewhere and without attribution to Wikipedia, why wouldn't it have the destiny of StackOverflow soon?",

I actually started to learn how to use wikipedia. Eventually I started to learn things i never thought I would ever think about in a million years, I even learned things about myself reading articles.\n\n I firmly belive things like Wikipedia and PBS are humanity's single greatest achievements, they should be protected at all costs. If any one reading this feels like they want to help the world and humanity, this is a start in my opinion. Everyone should have access to all the worlds information and Wikipedia is providing us just that FOR FUCKING FREE WITH NO ADS OR ANY OTHER BULLSHIT!!! OF COURSE IM GONNA GIVE THEM MY MONEY IF THEY NEED IT!!!!\n\nTruth be told wikipedia is sort of like my beacon of hope for humanity.",

NASA’s Artemis program has their manned lunar landing program set in 2027. China has their manned lunar landing set in 2030, and they have been nailing every single one of their intermediate missions in the meantime.\n\nAsk yourself why China doesn’t try to cut corners and beat the US back before 2027. Because they know we won’t make it, thanks to MAGA and the growing anti-science movement in the US. That’s why. You may think “oh, but we were there first, so who cares?”. Strategy. We won the initial 100 yard dash in the first space race, but China will win the marathon. And when they do it, in high definition for the world to see, they will use it to stoke the fires of nationalism and Chinese superiority. And when they control the Helium-3 market in the latter half of this century and hold the world by the balls economically due to us having to kiss their ass for access to quantum computing, nuclear fusion and even the ability to continue using magnetic resonance imaging, we probably *still* won’t have learned our lesson.",

Initially, the company I was at was targeting applications that require USA made hardware, such as grid infrastructure, and critical military power backup. CCP back doors into critical infrastructures no joke, it’s a real problem, not just a political dog whistle.\n\nThen, investors wanted to target a bigger market so they moved manufacturing to China. After that all the engineers remaining left on their own accord, seeing which way the wind was blowing. Now with the escalating trade war, I think they’ve effectively boxed themselves out of the US market.\n\nEdit: there was a general economic theory that we could keep the high paying engineering and design jobs here while outsourcing manufacturing to China. More and more it seems that you get better products and faster innovation when engineering and manufacturing are in cahoots and under the same roof, and China has plenty of great engineers.

Small improvements in solar panel efficiency is great and all but solar is already the cheapest energy per kw over the lifetime of a panel.\n\nThe key success of any energy source has been storage, coal was revolutionary with what it unlocked, then petroleum was the same idea lots of untapped we could carry around cheaply.  \n\nThe oil of the 21st century is batteries.  The US isn't the only crazy country, it's absolutely insane that countries like my own (Australia) with a massive amount of lithium didn't spend the last 30 years funding battery research and development, ceding all this to China.",

                  "text": "That would show up on the P&L as a return. The only conclusion to draw is that they saw a revenue drop along with the layoffs which combined with the AI service costs wiped out any return. It’s going to be a bit muddy because attribution is hard, but you’d expect to see a lift if it lived up to its promise. \n\nFWIW this is much more in line with what I’d expect — LLMs can be great productivity tools in some circumstances, but they’re productivity tools. The distribution of that productivity bump is invariably going to be lumpy, so without targeted application Id expect pretty low signal to noise when looking at  returns. They’re not replacing FTEs broadly across your org, which seems to have been some (most?) executives expectations. \n\nIf you look at organizations more broadly many haven’t even bothered rolling out old fashioned automation solutions for many tasks internally. Those organizations are likely the least well positioned to leverage LLMs, even though they have the most potential for a return. Their problems are mostly due to having weak technology orgs, and trying to roll out LLMs internally isn’t going to help them because they’ll have just as much issue with that as with rolling out the automation they could already have been leveraging for returns. \n\nLooking at the benefits of LLMs more specifically they’re just not suitable to be used unsupervised. Their output needs to be scrutinized by a real person, and if that validation takes as much or almost as much time as the person just doing the work in the first place then there’s no lift to be had either. It’s neat that an ML model can mostly do that work, but the benefits to the business are inherently limited by that need for supervision. \n\nSo while I think it’s obvious that LLMs will deliver increased productivity in the long term, I think the current market and investment are grossly disproportionate to those gains. We just aren’t going to see the wholesale displacement of workers by LLMs, absent some additional breakthroughs in model design and training. It’s going to be a loooooong time to get a return on investment at the current levels of spending in the industry. \n\nAll of that is a really long winded way to say that I’m just not surprised by this. There’s been far too much ‘irrational exuberance’ around LLMs and a correction is coming. We don’t know when, who will be impacted the most, or the full magnitude of the correction, but it is coming nonetheless.",

A couple of things I do like about AI:\n\n* As a software engineer, its advanced autocomplete is great for speeding up tedious, repetitive tasks\n* Again as an SWE, I love it for generating unit tests that I just briefly review to ensure they make sense and cover what I want them to cover\n* I can actually give advanced, more natural commands to Gemini on my phone for doing several Google Home tasks and it executes them much more reliably than Google Assistant did\n* If I have to write something, it's cool to get little examples generated to get my own creative juices flowing\n* It's good at summarizing static documents\n\nSo in summary, AI is great as a companion where you're willing to oversee and correct it, not as a Jarvis-esque presence that can automate and take care of whole portions of your life reliably or fully replace humans.",

My grammar sucks and trying to untangle my inner thoughts into a nice straight pattern on paper actually makes me feel like I’m banging my head against the wall. Which is ironic given my major in TV Prod and minor in screenwriting.\n\nI got through high school and college by writing all my essays and then pasting them into grammarly, having it fix all my spelling, grammar, and word-vomit, and then submitting it. Simple, no AI involvement, no change in the points and arguments I made in my writing, just a simple clean up and mistake polishing.\n\nNow I try to use grammarly to do that same thing to help me write emails and cover letters for job apps and it’s practically all AI now. Just yesterday I tried using it to help me fix any mistakes in an email draft and the AI is trying to change everything I said and is actually making what I wrote worse than if I had just wrote it myself and sent it without trying to proofread it. It got to the point where I had to fix mistakes that the AI proofreader had made while also trying to fix my own grammatical errors. Defeating the purpose of me using it in the first place!\n\nWhat drives me up the wall even more though is the insistence of other people around me telling me “just ChatGPT it bro”. If I’m trying to write a tough professional email or message to someone I’d have my dad who works in sales help me out and give me ideas. Now I try to get his help and he’s like, “just ask ChatGPT to draft some up for you”. I don’t ***want*** to ask Chat to do it for me. I ***want*** to learn and figure it out for myself so I know how to better do it in the future.\n\nPlus, all the very few times I actually tried to have AI draft some written thing up for me it’s made so many mistakes and when I tell the people giving that advice to me they tell me, “well you just always have to proofread it and fix any mistakes it made. It’s a tool not a psychic”. That’s not how tools work though? A tool is a second hand that aids in you performing correctly on a task. It’s not supposed to make your task performance worse. That’s like saying you should use a shitty hammer to bang in a nail, and then use you’re bare fists to finish the job and fix the shitty hammer’s mistakes.",

That's what a lot of CEOs expect, but without putting in any effort or investment to enable that.\n\nAnd even for the individual, using AI to help automate or speed-up one part of your job isn't some game-changing, insanely beneficial, high-return move that AI is expected to be. It just means you can do something marginally faster than you did before. You still have to do all the OTHER stuff that AI can't do, so it's super odd how many C-suite folks seem to be seduced by this as some massive productivity enhancer.\n\nThey want to implement AI, but they don't tell people how they want it to be used, and they won't(or can't) implement it at scale into full workflows across their business. So what do they expect? Nobody handed people Outlook and said \"There you go! Email! Now go be ultra productive!\". You had to change your business to operate around it over time, with significant investment into on-premises servers and staff and networking to support it. This is rarely done with AI as CEOs just want an \"out of the box\" solution, but have no idea *how* AI is supposed to fit into their business.

If you consistently do business with a company, you have power. You can use sites like [opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org) to see what a company funds and where your money is really going.\n\nTrade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Brooks. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or buy less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to nonprofits fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect. One less kidnapped child is one less kidnapped child, and one less murder is one less murder",

It's unclear what the agreement entailed.\n> \n* There was no indication that either employee shared social security data with the group, the filing said.\n> \n* The Social Security Administration referred both employees for potential Hatch Act violations, per the filing.\n\n> Zoom out: The Social Security Administration was unable to determine exactly what data were shared via the unapproved third-party server or whether the data remains on the server.\n> \n* The disclosures, filed in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, were among a list of \"corrections\" to the record.\n> \n* The SSA believed its statements \"to be accurate at the time they were made, and they are largely still accurate,\" the DOJ's lawyers wrote in the filing.",

No doubt this was quid pro quo for Musk after he put up nearly 300 million dollars to help Trump win the election. In Trump’s mind, this was probably a small favor since he knew plans were already laid out for establishing a dictatorship. I feel kind of silly for saying things that seem a bit too obvious.

The goal was to exacerbate existing societal divisions rather than favor one party exclusively.\n* **Shift to Favoring Republicans:** Investigations into the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections concluded that Vladimir Putin ordered campaigns specifically designed to assist Donald Trump and the Republican Party while harming Democratic candidates.\n* **Targeted Disinformation:** In 2020 and 2024, Russia focused on spreading misleading allegations against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, often through \"proxies\" and \"troll farms\" to undermine Democratic support.",

Mueller did all the legwork for him, and Biden could've gone after Kushner, Jr., and Trump in one fell swoop. But he refused. Think about that: A presidential candidate conspired with Russian officials at Trump Tower to interfere in the 2016 election in exchange for lifting sanctions. Obama knew about it, but did nothing. We wait for Mueller/Comey to present all their findings, in the expectation that a future Democratic DOJ would indict the Trump family for the crimes -- and zilch. Biden let them go scot-free. \n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that Biden Chamberlain allowed an insurrectionist to illegally run for and steal the presidency in the 2024 election, in direct violation of 14th Amendment, Section 3. We're currently under an illegitimate Presidency, because Democrats refused to enforce the Constitution, despite controlling the Senate for 4 years.",

The \"material conditions\" of the president are often embodied by that president. You can look at the political opposition and the primary challenges and things to see other parts of the conversation and the moment, but rarely is a president a poor reflection of the zeitgeist of the American elite. Since you want to limit it to the end of the roaring 20s at the far end, you push out guys like Mickinely.\n\nTypically someone as stupid as he is doesn't get that far. You get minor and major leagues. You get a junior varsity. Obviously he showed us that because *technically* you don't need to be elected to office at least once before, it is probably a good idea. Corrupt? sure. Plenty I'd say 1 in 4 are so criminally corrupt as to warrant legal action. However the revolving door to becoming a lobbyist isn't criminal corruption. Just the weird America version of political patronage and spoils systems.\n\nNarcissistic? Sure. It wasn't just Nixon and LBJ who had to center themselves in everything.\n\nCruel? Most politicians are just agnostic to cruelty. They are negligent to it, not terribly overtly cruel. It doesn't serve their other aims. Blowing political capital in hurting others for no reason is quite rare. Sure Nixon comes back up here with his petty vendettas and shit. However Nixon was very bright.\n\nAll of these men reflect the moment. They all reflect tens of millions of men just like them who are nobodies. Reflect their political desires and viewpoints. That is certainly the case with Trump.\n\n1/3 of America is all of those things. However we're learning the hardway that having someone be elected to a local office and use the executive power is probably a good first step. Trump is bald faced democracy run amok.

I should be able to sue them for having used it in their training data.\n\nEvery person who posted their early stories to LiveJournal as a teenager would never have allowed a larger corporation to come along as use that data for training without some sort of compensation.  Not to mention LiveJournal probably had a bunch of terms and conditions for reading the site, and all content posted to LiveJournal was owned by LiveJournal and could not be used by any other entity.\n\nEvery musician who posted their music to MySpace and Bandcamp (who again have their own terms and conditions about use) would never have said \"oh yeah sure use that to train an AI band which sounds just like me.....I'll make all my money off live performances.\"  \n\nThey are scraping literally _everything_ they can from the internet to get as much data as possible.  Do you think they look for what license the data was published under?  Of course not.\n\n\"Stolen\" or \"Broke the terms and conditions\" whatever you want to call it.  When I **personally** do it to businesses, they take me to court for repirations (see any RIAA or MPAA case in the past two and half decades regarding torrents and illegal downloads).\n\nAnthropic at least purchased copies of books (which hopefully ended up paying royalties to the authors, but really how many of those books were purchased used or wholesale from libraries discontinuing editions, etc?), https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/, but even then the argument was \"they were having the AI read them just like a human would\".  I bet if you read the copyright at the beginning of most of those books and they don't explicitly license for training AI, and probably say \"for personal use only\" (which if you've ever noticed, all movies / TV programs say for personal use only, not for showing to groups, which again I would get sued for if I do that).\n\nAI should have been it's own, new, completely different license from regular human use.  But then \"oh no Country <X> doesn't follow US Intellectual Property Law\" so they will get ahead of us in AI design / training / modelling if we have to follow some new US law to obtain training data.\n\nFuck that.  Every piece of data used to train AIs was stolen if it wasn't in the public domain, which Disney and other companies keep pushing that further and further back.",

But if the industry norm is that your performance can be used to train an AI, which will replace you, that lifetime career turns into one single job, and then you're permanently out of the industry.

Not in the least bit funny.\n\nAnd here's why: anyone here old enough to remember the absolute cultural phenomenon that was Americas Funniest Home Videos? Millions of Americans sending in moments captured on video.\n\nBut there's the key word. CAPTURED. They were filming, something unplanned occurred, bedlam ensued, and a perfectly imperfect moment of pure human chaos was captured. And now we had a way that we could all share in it.\n\nI remember watching a documentary of the making of the show, and they had a segment where they aired a few of the reject videos. Why were they turned down? They had obviously staged some grand catastrophe and filmed it with the hope of gaining fleeting mainstream fame. And it was painfully obvious which ones were faked. There was no spontaneity. It just felt forced. They weren't captured moments, they were constructs, and the end result reeked of it. More recently I've seen people try to fake internet videos of things like \"jewellery store heist gone wrong\". They're infuriatingly unfunny, and they're pretty obvious to spot.\n\nNow, everyone is trying to create \"funny\" with AI, and it is failing miserably. AI can only force moments to happen. It doesn't capture that moment when our humanity blows up in our faces. It crafts it. And what it crafts will never be anywhere near as good.\n\nI'm watching these companies that have pumped trillions of dollars into AI circle the drain, and I'm not mad at it.",

To give you a few examples of ways I think it can enhance human creativity:\n\n* Small uses of the erase tool and the select tool in Photoshop and similar programs to help isolate foreground subjects. Many Photos hope users aren't even aware they are using AI.\n* A fun video I watched a while back was where two programmers had AI's and had them play Geogesser. One had a general-purpose AI they had spent a lot of time training. The other took responses from his chat in real time and tried to determine the correct answer based on hundreds of human inputs. The result was a mixture of silly mistakes and groups of humans in the chat fighting over giving silly results or trying to win. [Here](https://youtu.be/JmoFvtBBDJw?si=5ToPMhSb94yBPvT_) is the video in question.\n\nI don't think this generally works for comedy. I think whole AI art projects are lazy and lose a lot of what makes art interesting, but I think the line on what is good and can be funny is much fuzzier than many believe.",

Once the era of technical slop recedes, we'll get a generation of new vision, in which the barriers to making art will fall back. I don't think actors are going to disappear: no matter how good the tools gets, humans are probably easier for creating the base data you'll manipulate using AI, as you can't create video in real time, so using actors generates the data you want faster. \n\nBut you won't need $10m to make a low budget film.

It's going to be decades before we even have a glimpse at actual AI, and that's being generous. AI won't actually make an appearance until many of us are long gone. \n\nWhat we have now are nothing more than glorified data scrapers, and that's exactly what these companies pushing AI so hard are using it for. To scrape data from every possible metric related to every man, woman, and child alive today and those to come in the future. It's why we're seeing \"AI\" elements being forcefully shoved into products that simply don't need it. Why more and more products are being bundled together with apps. None of it is for our benefit. None of it improves the user's experience. It's all about swindling as much data as possible about each and every individual on the planet so it can be sold for a profit and then shoved back into our faces as ads.\n\nThe government should be sued. I'm so freaked out and paranoid to type anything online, go outside, run errands, or enjoy anything these days for fear of constantly being under surveillance, and it's absolutely affected my health negatively in multiple ways. So not only are they stealing my info to make a profit, but they're also destroying my mental and physical well-being. And I know I'm not the only one. Far from it. And yet, we're trained to believe that such things are perfectly acceptable and that we have zero power or say over any of it. \n\nIf a company wants to track my info, then they're going to give me 80% of the profit they make when they sell that info to data centers. And all companies should be forced to make dumb versions of every smart product they sell. Versions that have no internal elements that connect to any networks or any apps. Products that have zero tracking or use statistics. \"MAYBE\" some on-board basic diagnostics that \"WE,\" the people who own the product, can easily access to do our own troubleshooting. \n\nI used to think we were well on our way to the greatest timeline in history. Now I fear we're well into the worst timeline. And it's only going to get worse.",

And what people are calling AI today is within the bounds of what has always been called AI. Things like natural language processing and computer vision have been staples of AI research since the 60s when the term was first used.\n\nReally it's more the other way around, a lot of what used to be called AI is unlikely to be called that today.",

If there is a non-American alternative to the same thing, they'll probably take it.\n\nWhat should worry America the most right now is the loss of public opinion and consensus around them. The speed at which the USA went from being glazed by everyone in the world and considered a trustworthy entity, to starting to be compared to Russia and China in perceived trustworthiness - sometimes even unfavourably - needs to be studied. And I mean, I don't think I can be surprised either: the entire world is on Ukraine's side, and now the White House is evidently allied to the Kremlin. On top of all that's happening, there is now a perceived association between the USA and not one, but two, countries which have been committing war crimes in attempts to conquer a territory. You start to lose the cool factor. And here's the thing: people don't like wars. People are afraid of wars, people like stability and prosperity. If you wanted to be liked, war mongering is not it.\n\nAs it turns out, if you keep reading on the news that Trump wants to impose sanctions on you and is now even threatening some member countries of the Union you are part of, you will not really feel safe with that entity having such an important role, and you will not want to be personally responsible in fuelling their economy.",

You'll see a lot of propaganda crying out that it's pointless and it won't work.\n\nYou see it for strikes and unions. Then, you always see they get results. You see it for boycotts - it's so ingrained that even some of your friends will tell you it's pointless. Time and time again, companies cave and start listening to the complaint after a good boycott campaign.\n\nAt a minimum, boycotting damages the image of a company, and that in itself has a snowball effect.\n\nMost purchase decisions are done with an irrational component. When two products are comparable, people mostly tend to like with the company that they like the better: track record, brand identity, any cool ads they've seen that have stuck, etc. A brand that is under boycott will start to have this unpleasant aura around them. You won't order a Coca Cola when you're out with friends and some of them feel very strongly about Palestine. You will be more reluctant to order Coca Cola alone, too.\n\nBoycotting works, both because it tarnishes brand reputation, and because we are social animals who go with the herd and tend to want to get approval from the pack, involuntarily. Boycotting works great because it plays exactly on that aspect of humans.\n\nThis is why they want so desperately to make you give up. They don't want us to wake up and realize that we actually hold a huge amount of power. See all those banks, insurance companies, enterprise B2B companies? At the very end of the pipeline, there's us. There is B2C. The end goal is always controlling where we decide to put out money. If we stop putting in our money, the entire thing goes belly up. We are quite literally the weak link of the entire supply chain, and they don't want us to realize that we are the table on top of which the castle of cards was built.",

          "text": "Every technology investment follows the same basic principles. First you have a small group explore the technology and do some demonstrators. Then you measure how well it functioned and stack it up against comparable technology/products/processes. You look at things like learning curve, support in the community, commercial support, cost to train, cost to migrate, and all your normal ROI estimates. Then maybe you have some pilot users try out the tools in the real world and closely monitor the outcomes. Plan for an 18 month to 3 year transition (or longer because of holdouts, entrenched legacy tech stacks, prioritization, and leadership turnover). \n\nInstead everyone went with \"feels like 20%\" and assumed they'd be quickly into some gains because AI is so interactive and conversational. They're not treating it as infrastructure intensive, training intensive, or realizing there's still a learning curve and a time to proficiency to deal with. Meanwhile they're also laying off seasoned developers who are pointing out the flaws in the strategy and foregoing hiring on junior devs because the savings is just one more quarter away. \n\nThen there are the costs. Companies always have this bait and switch on costs. First you go free tier, get individuals using the product on their own. Maybe you have a low cost license, low enough that some hobbyists and professionals might buy in just to \"get a leg up\". Once they spread the gospel to their friends and companies you start demoing it and giving out some free licenses for evaluation purposes. Maybe you renew those licenses a few times to get teams hooked and further into the sunk cost side of things. They invest their time and when it comes down to the end of the evaluation they don't want to give up the last 6 months of work they've done and the production code they shipped (even though they weren't supposed to). Nor do they want to tell the other teams that were adopting on the side that they'll have to stop. \n\nSo now the product has a foothold and the contract negotiations start. Maybe the sales people go easy and it's a cheap license $20 bucks a month per dev, or 100-250k for the whole enterprise. Company leadership thinks it's a steal and worth the investment. Then after the contracts are signed the product gets slated for use in all the major parts of the company's product line. Once entrenched it will be hard and expensive to get rid of.\n\nIn the meantime the company who sold the product is BLEEDING cash because they're taking a loss in trade for higher adoption and a growing client list. The client list, even if those clients are only demoing the product, is what draws in investors and new clients. At some point though they have to start balancing the books. That means 1. Selling to a competitor 2. Increasing licensing costs. Regardless this often means big bumps to companies who are using the product after the initial contract ends and has to be renegotiated. Sometimes those bumps are massive, doubling or tripling the cost of use. Imagine if you had a floating license for 25 users spread across the company and the vendor does away with that option and starts charging by CPU/GPU use, number of requests, or volume of data, how many end-users your product interacts with, or any number of other metrics that turns a $100k license into a $1m+. Drop in the bucket for a large company maybe, but devastating to smaller companies. Plus it comes at a huge cost now if you want to switch to a comparable cheaper product because either you didn't abstract yourself enough from the service and/or you'll have to maintain contracts on two product lines for the duration of the migration process (not a simple, oh just flip this on and that off). \n\nThis is why some companies spend 5-10 years trying to get out from under old technology and some keep old technology around for decades because it's too big, too old, and too critical to swap. Plus telling the story to investors is hard without numbers to say how it will benefit the company to do such a swap. If you tell an investor \"we need to spend $2m to unwind from this stack that will now cost us $1m in licensing\" they say pay the licensing and save $1m now, they don't care about next year or even next quarter necessarily. They want their return now. If you tell them you won't make their targets this quarter with the new tech like they wanted then they'll trigger a sell off and you'll lose millions or billions in equity. \n\nThe result is you end up in shitty and expensive contracts you can't get out of or you do some calculus to do the hard thing to get onto something else. This often means cutting labor to hit quarterly targets. And you justify the labor cuts by talking up the benefits of the technology shifts you are taking on and how it will (eventually) improve productivity. \n\nWhen that doesn't happen you reorg.",

          "text": "So what im getting from this article is 12% did achieve improvements and 56% didn’t lose any money but also didnt gain any. How exactly is that a sign that AI is useless to implement? If im a business man, im just going to compare what those 12% did to what i did and adjust accordingly. I mean AI is only just recently good enough to do actual work with so of course early adoption is going to lead to a large portion of businesses not using the tech to its full effect. Everyone in the comments seems very short sighted and pessimistic because of their inherent anti-AI bias. But unless you fell for the obvious marketing hype, these numbers are really not bad. AI is a tool like every other technology. Some things are instantly helpful like the internet but other tech needs time to settle in. Actually, even the internet needed time to settle in but no one remembers that i guess",

They can’t even do a sensitivity analysis looking AI it’s efficiencies because there are so many more inefficiencies being brought to light and exemplified because of their trash hiring and firing systems that they employ. The way our economy works now is new hires make more than 10 year employees and then they get surprised when those 10 year employees finally leave and they’re just left with in adequate staff that cost a lot and it takes 4 to 5 people to do the job of that one person who just left. The American economy does not reward good workers skilled workers efficient workers. It just makes some random number the bar and punishes those who can’t meet that expectation. Everyone can’t be the most efficient worker. The bar should not be the most efficient worker that is unrealistic. Instead of doing any critical, thinking into how their labor forces are adapting to AI executive leadership are doing the same things being looking at some numbers that can give them indications on certain trends using that as an excuse to fire people or re-organize and then going from company to company doing the exact same thing while siphoning off a portion of the companies revenue as resources for them only. When companies do great employees don’t get rewarded. They get pizza parties, cupcake parties, and maybe the occasional day off but for executive employees they directly benefit monetarily when people who are not them work hard harder, more efficient meat numbers and do better every quarter. These people can’t even indicate where they would even see efficiencies from AI and yet statements like this or just thrown out there. Everything doesn’t need AI in AI won’t fix every problem, especially in the state now. Most programs are integrated with AI at most mini coding platforms are integrated with AI. It can help turn out solutions but most jobs mean work by most employees in America are not Microsoft or internet search based.  \nMost programs that employees used to do their work are either standalone applications or Internet applications that are not integrated with AI. This is another example of how leadership doesn’t even know what they’re talking about is some are going to make decisions to get rid of AI when in reality that’s not even the issue.",

You know, the ones that only start up when the grid actually needs them, and they are typically fossil fuel plants which exist only to cover energy deficiencies caused by grid failures or just high energy demand.\n\n\nThe Crypto folks were literally designing Crypto farming shipping containers that could be rapidly deployed to idle power plants, and Crypto mine (basically become a power vampire) just to run a power plant that could've been idle.\n\n\n\nLiterally. You call up the company. They drop off a shipping container full of miners. You connect the shipping container to the grid. Turn it on. It lines Crypto. You, as the power plant get a portion of the mining revenue, and the owner of the container gets a portion. The surrounding residents get to deal with all of that extra noise and pollution.\n\n\nThose projects died when Etherium switched to Proof of Stake rather than Proof of Work.  ",

I'd guess many utilities are feeling the same way. Data centers are providing a lot of fresh problems without providing any real solutions. The attitude seems to be that our hands are tied in the matter.\n\nFrom my experience, utilities are making moves to offset this with things like battery storage sites to reduce peak demand, but those have their own problems (not least the fact that a lot of them seem to end up on fire).

          "text": "We used to get these all the time in the summer when I was younger. We'd lose power randomly for a few hours in the middle of a sunny day in July. The power company since spent a lot of money to beef up the grid, and our power has been pretty reliable. There have been a lot of solar projects locally to help beef up the micro-grid situation too.\n\n\nBack then we also used to lose power a lot whenever a strong enough blizzard would blow through. That doesn't happen anymore. \n\n\nMy area was one of those areas which survived the 2002 Great Blackout, because an engineer at the local Hydroelectric plant managed to isolate the region of the grid I was on before a cascading failure could spread. Hopefully with all of this electric grid demand, the power companies will focus on forcing the data centers onto their own power sources rather than whacking homes and businesses without their own power generation. ",

          "text": "Some key issues:\n\n>Efforts to gut the federal workforce by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency significantly derailed operations at a Pentagon tech team with a key U.S. military role, according to materials reviewed by The Intercept.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Defenders of DOGE, including Musk, have claimed the project solely ferreted out fraud, waste, and abuse. But according to a December 2025 contracting memo from the Defense Information Systems Agency, DOGE’s tactics caused major problems at the Pentagon’s IT office — which is core to the operation of the U.S. military.\n>\n>The memo describes how DISA’s Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Enterprise Directorate, known as J6, was hobbled by DOGE cuts to such an extent that it was unable to obtain necessary software. This unit is responsible for maintaining secure channels that keep the Pentagon connected to military assets around the world, including nuclear capabilities.\n>\n>“During calendar year 2025, the DISA/J6 program office has been unexpectedly and significantly impacted by Government programs that incentivized personnel separation or extended periods of leave,” the memo reads, “e.g., Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments, Paid Parental Leave.”\n>\n>A second DISA memo notes that the Deferred Resignation Program resulted in the departure of an officer responsible for an important Pentagon cloud-computing contract, resulting in that contract expiring entirely. The DOGE-induced staffing shortage resulted in a situation, according to the memo, where DISA’s systems faced “extreme risk for loss of service” across the Department of Defense.\n>\n>While DISA operates behind the scenes, its globe-spanning networks are critical to the armed forces, explained DISA J6’s then-director Sharon Woods in a Pentagon-produced June 2025 interview: “Command, Control, Communications, and Computers — it is what underlies everything and the department’s ability to communicate with itself.” Asked what would happen on a day where DISA J6 couldn’t operate, Woods replied, “In my mind, it cripples the Department [of Defense]… This is really a mission where failure is not an option.”\n\nGiven how central information technology is to modern conflicts, slashing and burning the departments and people who are tasked with providing these critical connections and infrastructure is foolhardy to say the least. \n\nIt looks like this approach is almost the same approach as Elon took with Twitter when he took over. The difference here of course is that Twitter was a useful but ultimately optional social media platform for information where outages and bugs are annoying but rarely life threatening whereas with DISA there is far more at stake.",

Sure the tech part was, but the business model isn't. \n\nThis part makes no sense.\n\nThe business idea of Netflix was also great: acquire streaming rights for all the content they possibly could, early on. \n\nIt's not Netflix's business failure that the rights holders got greedy and they wanted to also get a piece of the streaming pie and now we're at dozens of streaming services. \n\nAnd it's still better than Cable. You can subscribe for 1 month, watch what you want, cancel, swap service. It's a chore, yes, but still better than cable, and still lower price overall.",

Don't even know where to start.\n\nHow about the fact that AI tends to fail in subtle ways which is something you probably don't want in a healthcare system.\n\nHow about the fact that even *if* it works, it will most definitely not be reflected on the patient in any way.

AI-generated pictures are cute and all...  But I'm not sure that warrants all the money being poured into this endeavor.  Show me something impressive.  Something amazing.  Something Earth-shaking.\n\n> Workers should learn AI skills and companies should use it because it's a \"cognitive amplifier,\" claims Satya Nadella.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with that \"cognitive amplifier\" bit...  I mean, yeah, in theory it can correlate a lot of data...  But we've got two major problems with that in a useful, productive sense.\n\n1)  AI still hallucinates.  It's still just basically pattern-matching.  It doesn't actually *understand* anything.  This routinely results in garbage output - so everything has to be checked for accuracy.\n\n2)  People often misunderstand what AI is/does.  They *think* it understands things.  They trust its output, don't check it for accuracy, and wind up using bad data to make bad decisions.\n\nThis combination makes me incredibly skeptical of how much cognitive amplification is happening.  I suspect people are putting just as much time/effort into the work with AI as without...  It's just maybe shifting the workflow from correlating data to verifying results.  Or maybe to remediating damage.\n\n---\n\nI don't **hate** AI.  I use agentic tools like OpenCode almost daily...  But it's not really saving me a lot of cognitive work.  I'm still having to carefully understand what I'm trying to accomplish, how the codebase works, what the issue is and where it's coming from, what the resulting code does...  It's basically saving me the actual typing and generally avoiding stupid syntactic errors.  But my output hasn't suddenly doubled thanks to AI.\n\nAnd this is in a very specific, very AI-friendly context.  Writing code is very pattern-based.  We've got strict rules about what does/doesn't work.  We've got a carefully-curated repository of code to reference.  We've got error logs and test suites to verify the output.\n\nI can't imagine trying to do anything useful with AI in a less-structured context.",

Google and Nvidia can pivot. But LLM’s were a magic trick that should never have happened.\n\nI made an unsupervised learning tool with data sets in my 2014 AI class as part of my bscs. We thought it was magic and the only limitation was the data you can feed it. Enter OpenAI and Microsoft scraping copyrighted material to create GPT-3. \n\nLogarithmic returns means this technology will always result in average results with unpreventable hallucinations. It’s been in scientific papers throughout all the fanboys. It’s not proper to replace automation that is 99.99% accurate with something that specializes in everything and is good at nothing.\n\nIntelisense has been running code completion at a higher acceptance rate than LLM’s when they started; showing that the technology existed without LLM’s scraping broken and abandoned projects. LLM’s found design patterns, but if you were doing multi-line cursor inserts and using Intellisense, adding an LLM like copilot slows you down.\n\nThe industry has to reduce standards to let AI LLM’s be helpful. Microsoft knew this first as it offshored thousands of jobs to India including their AI engineers. And they were positioned to be the main proprietor of OpenAI, but tossed AI in their products and lost market share.\n\nNow you have OpenAI, xAI, and Meta putting up data centers and it feels like the rockets club of yesteryear. Rich, nonintellectual, men trying to rush nuclear reactors to run their graphics card rigs to build a better LLM. I don’t know a single engineer who bets on this or heavily invests in AI companies. \n\nThey might be wrong. \n\nBecause as another poster has pointed out- we’ve funded their development through subscriptions, but the product never turned helpful besides rewriting emails for people who have the time to write, proofread, and analyze prompts before sending that email. There’s no business case. \n\nChina, alternatively, poked a hole in AI with Deepseek. Showed you could do it for a couple $million. Their society has continued to push for automation over AI and ours is sitting patiently waiting for Mark Zuckerburg to figure it out while his main business is drowning in AI generated news, pics, and videos.",

It is mostly because people don't want to live in rural areas.\n\n\n\n*Edit person below claims I blocked them, but I haven't. Is Reddit bugged again?\n\n\nAnyway, rural being remote and undesirable for educated professionals to relocate to is the number one thing driving the lack of medical access in these communities. Ask any medical recruiter (my wife and I met with dozens as we decided where to settle down).\n\n\nA parallel point that a state setting dog shit policy that causes poor medical outcomes for a specific subset of the population doesn't disprove that. That issue exacerbates the underlying issue. Without looking at the data, my hypothesis would be that remote communities in Alabama are even more under served then their counter parts in states with sensible legislation. This user is confounding two different things. They also cherry picked one set of data from one state on one subset of patients. I could do the same to show that US healthcare is better than Canadian healthcare.\n\n\nTeleoperated robots that could serve remote communities (the thing Bernie is complaining about in the OP), could help aliviate both of these issues. If Bernie's point is that the profit driven American model of medical service sucks, then yah, he is right, but that has nothing to do with teleoperated robots. This government was never going to provide universal health care and even if it did it wouldn't solve the under served issue in rural communities. Teleoperated robots at least have a chance of providing medical care to some people that wouldn't have had it otherwise.",

I'm in a rural area of the mountains in the South in the US, and we're well staffed with doctors and nurses, because the area is gorgeous, and middle-aged and close-to such age professionals that move away from the city rarely can stand to move back.\n\nBut out in the flat, boring, awful Midwest and beyond and Texas? Flat, hot, humid Alabama? Yeah, from what I understand, even paying all they can afford, getting people to move there is not exactly an alluring proposition.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to move away from the city but are worried about medical access, go somewhere pretty where the temperatures don't get crazy high or crazy low.

You still need a dedicated in-home assistant for some hours, or they end up needing to go to a group home just for the single-digit percentage of  help they need, or worse, they end up at one of those predatory companies specifically designed to drain ever dollar of an old person's retirement fund.  \n     \nWe have serious problems in how healthcare is being run, we need a serious overhaul of the healthcare industry, but it's very much a corporate-interests problem and a problem of perverse incentives.

Well educated, rich doctors on average want to live in the city with city amenities, culture, and access, not live in a mansion in the country.\n\nWe already heavily subsidize rural doctors, and it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't even an American problem.

And once they start replacing the rural openings that people won't fill with robots, they start replacing the suburban and urban openings with them, too.  Now it's harder to find a full time job anywhere.  Think about it like replacing four cashiers with one cashier and four self checkout registers - that's three cashier jobs gone.\n\nIf the goal is to move toward a future where only like 1/4 or 1/5 of us have to work, and/or that those who have to work are basically just babysitting robots and sanity checking them or correcting issues, and working 20-30 hour weeks - that's amazing.  That's great.  If, and only if, we solve the problem of \"okay, but can you afford to pay your bills on ONE job\" and \"okay, but where are the people who don't have jobs because there aren't enough jobs going to live?\"\n\nSolve THOSE problems, and then let's replace everything with Rosie the Robot.",

There's almost nothing to do. The school systems are abysmal. Decent shopping - whether it's for necessities or luxeries - is really hard to find. My guess is you could offer healthcare providers willing to work out there 20-30% more than they'd make in a major city (Huntsville, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, or even Auburn & Tuscaloosa) and they'd still turn it down because the quality of life sucks. Pretty much the only people who live there are people whose families have *always* been there. \n\nSo the \"real solution\" is more than just increasing enrollment in nursing & medical schools or offering better pay/incentives for the healthcare providers. The would need to completely overhaul the community to make people want to bring their families there.\n\nUntil that happens (which it won't) I believe, unfortunately, robots and telehealth type appointments may be the best these people can get without driving long distances.\n\nSo I totally agree with the point Sanders is making...I just don't think there's a better solution. Sanders is kinda making perfect the enemy of good.",

This is similar to how the robots work that are commonly used for surgeries (in most cases the surgeon is nearby, but the concept is roughly the same). \n\nThe technology itself isn't completely unproven; I don't know the technical specifics of these particular systems, but the surgical robots usually have a force-feedback mechanism so that the operator has real-time feedback similar to the physical feedback they would get if they were standing in the room. \n\nAnd of course, all medical technology has to undergo fairly rigorous certifications in terms of fail-safes etc. before you're allowed to use it at all. \n\nObviously it's your (or any other patient's) right to reject a procedure if you/they are uncomfortable with it, that's not dispute. But I don't think it's entirely fair to call the technology unproven as if it's like a brand-new and dangerous technology; it's a new derivative of a technology that has existed for a long time and is already well-proven in even more technically challenging applications (laparoscopic surgery). \n\nWhat Sanders was actually criticizing, which is much more important than the specifics of the technology itself, is that the robots are a band-aid on the bullet wound of not having enough rural OBGYNs. Like the ultrasound robots are probably a good thing in and of themselves (compared to the status quo where patients would need to travel to get an ultrasound), but just being able to remotely do ultrasounds isn't a replacement for the full suite of care that an OBGYN provides. And it would be nice if Dr. Oz (don't we all wish that was a joke?) would be focused on fixing that instead of patting himself on the back over this, which is at best a half-baked nonsolution to the bigger problem.\n\nedit: I looked up how the system actually works, and there is still a nurse or assistant who actually sets up the robot and is in the room the whole time. The system basically just allows the doctor sitting somewhere else to move the probe around to image whatever they want to image. https://www.adechotech.com/en/melody-ultrasound-robot/",

          "text": "From the article: \n\n>The tech press has been lit up like Chernobyl reactor #4 for months about shortages in memory, solid-state drives, and hard drives. The shortages are driven by explosive AI demand, and the latest report says that up to 70 percent of the memory produced worldwide in 2026 will be consumed by data centers. However, those specific topics have yet to be part of the global zeitgeist. That's quickly changing, as evidenced by a Wall Street Journal article (WSJ) describing just how dire the situation is, and how the fallout from the RAM shortage is set to irradiate several markets not directly linked to computing.\n\n>The WSJ details how the exponential rise in memory is all but guaranteed to hit the automotive sector, TVs, and consumer electronics, among many others. The publication goes as far as comparing the automobile situation to the production delays experienced during Covid, an event nobody has fond memories of.\n\n>Even though cars and most consumer gear use older types of memory, RAM makers have downsized or discontinued production of legacy chips altogether. To bluntly illustrate the point, the article cites Counterpoint Research's MS Hwang: \"you gotta buy a plane ticket and get that allocation from manufacturers right now,\" going on to say that manufacturing capacity for 2028 is already being sold, never mind this year.\n\n>To state that most everything these days uses RAM is obvious, but even common household items like televisions, Bluetooth speakers, set-top boxes, and even \"smart\" appliances like fridges could become extremely pricey. The margins on these items are razor-thin, and one key component, like memory multiplying in price, implies a cost that manufacturers will be willing or unable to afford, thus passing it to the customer, assuming there is even any memory available to make the devices.\n\n>While component prices across all areas of industry float all the time, the waves are generally temporary enough to keep prices level, but that's not the case this time around. For his part, Huang thinks that RAM might become as much as 10% of the price of most electronics and 30% of the bill on items like smartphones.\n\n>IDC already updated its 2026 forecast with a 5% dip in smartphone sales and 9% on PCs — deals that may be altered further in just a few months' time. The firm also calls the current situation a \"permanent reallocation\" of supplier capacity towards AI datacenters. TrendForce's Avril Wu concurs, as \"[she has] tracked the memory sector for almost 20 years, and this time really is different [...] It really is the craziest time ever.\"",

The big Cons are run by one or two companies. We're not money makers like actors. So a LOT of conventions are starting to price artists out. Those artist alley tables are typically $300-$500 dollars (vendor booths? 1k+). A lot of the cons have shrunk their alley space to try to force artists up into vendor booths. \n\nThe scuttlebutt I hear about how these cons work is atrocious. For 2 years now, every con has had to be screamed at to remove AI.\n\nIf you want more of your money going to artists, especially locals, look for smaller conventions near you. Pretty much every state has smaller conventions, or more niche conventions, and those ones are usually easier to work with, and often MUCH cheaper than the big conventions.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More context here:\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con changed an AI art friendly policy following an artist-led backlash last week. It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money. \n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world’s premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. According to [archived rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20240724010823/https://www.comic-con.org/cc/things-to-do/art-show/) for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn’t for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used.\n\n“Material produced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be placed in the show, but only as Not-for-Sale (NFS). It must be clearly marked as AI-produced, not simply listed as a print. If one of the parameters in its creation was something similar to ‘Done in the style of,’ that information must be added to the description. If there are questions, the Art Show Coordinator will be the sole judge of acceptability,” Comic-Con’s art show rules said until recently.\n\nThese rules have been in place since at least 2024, but anti-AI sentiment is growing in the artistic community and an artist-led backlash against Comic-Con’s AI-friendly language led to the convention quietly changing the rules. Twenty-four hours after artists called foul the AI-friendly policy, Comic-Con updated the language on its site. “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/comic-con-bans-ai-art-after-artist-pushback/](https://www.404media.co/comic-con-bans-ai-art-after-artist-pushback/)",

I do color quantization at different steps, specific dithering in some of my works, vision systems for masking and redraws, and then there's hand touches at the end.\n\nFiguring out all the different processes and sub processes I need to make a drawing mine, is hard. Then you've got figuring out the right loras and checkpoints, sometimes even having to train your own if you can't find one you need.\n\nThere are people who just put 1-2 sentences into a prompt. Most serious AI artists do way more than that.\n\nThere's also things you can do with AI that are just VERY difficult to do by hand, such as creating artistic QR codes. Like these: https://huggingface.co/monster-labs/control_v1p_sd15_qrcode_monster\n\nGenerating an image that a machine reads as a QR code is just, hard. AI makes it actually doable.\n\nIf you want to get seriously into it, look up comfyui and try it. It's basically a simplified engine for working with the various python tools and engines. It's a lot fun.\n\nEDIT: This stuff is cool and it's way more complicated than a few prompts. Your downvotes and disagreements don't change that. I've said nothing disrespectful or wrong. You all want to stick your head in the ground go a head. \n\nEveryone that actually cares about technology and what this subreddit is about, go look up what you can actually do with it on your own hardware and the open models out there. It's pretty cool how far this has all in just a few years. It's only going further in the next few.\n\nLast edit: The amount of disinformation is kind of disturbing. Learning off web accessible data is legal, as the world's various courts repeatedly say. Getty has lost almost every court case regarding web scrapping, but even prior to AI like \"HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn\", and even older cases like \"Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service\" show the same thing, collecting publicly available data and transforming it is legal. \n\nCopyright only exists because our laws make it exist, and those laws have exceptions. Teaching AIs falls under that based off all current court and legal theory. Again, you don't have to like AI, but trying to argue training off publicly available data is some how wrong is naive. It flows in the face of decades of president regarding information access and fair use. If most of your arguments would put cross hairs on things like libraries and even search engines. \n\nNothing is stolen. The court and law agrees.",

The incident, which happened last year in Oregon, casts doubt on that claim.\n>\n>“ICE has treated Mobile Fortify like it’s a 100% accurate record retrieval system of everybody’s immigration status for the entire population of the U.S. when this is obviously not true, and could never be true from a technical perspective,” Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior public interest technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told 404 Media. “It is sickening that ICE is using this flawed app and unacceptable invasion of biometric privacy to supposedly determine whether someone is undocumented and deport them or even worse.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Mobile Fortify uses CBP systems ordinarily used to verify travelers as they enter the U.S., according to the leaked material. The app turned the capability inwards onto American streets. In partnership with Reveal, 404 Media reported the app has been used against U.S. citizens.\n>\n>404 Media previously obtained an internal DHS document under the Freedom of Information Act which showed ICE does not let people decline to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Rep. Thompson previously told 404 Media, “ICE officials have told us that an apparent biometric match by Mobile Fortify is a ‘definitive’ determination of a person’s status and that an ICE officer may ignore evidence of American citizenship—including a birth certificate—if the app says the person is an alien.”\n>\n>Inaccuracy has long been a concern of facial recognition systems, and mistakes have led to innocent people being detained or charged with crimes. When facial recognition tools do make mistakes, it is often against people of color. \n>\n>“For over a decade, researchers have shown that facial recognition is a flawed technology that performs particularly poorly on women of color. Using it to determine a person’s status is inviting misidentifications and false positives,” Chris Gilliard, a privacy researcher, told 404 Media. “The willful use of such an error-prone technology suggests that the appearance of a process is more important than accuracy or fairness.”\n\nIt's pretty clear that these image identification systems, though much improved from generations past, are still not at a point where they are \"100% accurate\". To then use them in a way that assumes that outcomes are completely accurate all the time is, to say the least, a wildly irresponsible use of these technologies.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's more from the story:\n\nWhen authorities used Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) facial recognition app on a detained woman in an attempt to learn her identity and immigration status, it returned two different and incorrect names, raising serious questions about the accuracy of the app ICE is using to determine who should be removed from the United States, according to testimony from a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official obtained by 404 Media.\n\nICE has told lawmakers the app, called [Mobile Fortify](https://www.404media.co/ice-is-using-a-new-facial-recognition-app-to-identify-people-leaked-emails-show/), provides a “definitive” determination of someone’s immigration status, and should be trusted over a birth certificate. The incident, which happened last year in Oregon, casts doubt on that claim.\n\n“ICE has treated Mobile Fortify like it’s a 100% accurate record retrieval system of everybody’s immigration status for the entire population of the U.S. when this is obviously not true, and could never be true from a technical perspective,” Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior public interest technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told 404 Media. “It is sickening that ICE is using this flawed app and unacceptable invasion of biometric privacy to supposedly determine whether someone is undocumented and deport them or even worse.”\n\nDo you know anything else about this app? Do you work at ICE or CBP? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.\n\nFull story: [https://www.404media.co/ices-facial-recognition-app-misidentified-a-woman-twice/](https://www.404media.co/ices-facial-recognition-app-misidentified-a-woman-twice/)",
