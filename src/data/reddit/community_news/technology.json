We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on. Every \"safety\" feature that requires unmasking is another brick in the wall of a corporate panopticon that would make Bentham blush.",

They re-strategize and re-release. This is a PR stunt meant to quiet the angry masses. If you are concerned with your privacy, you should definitely get rid of your cameras. The only reason we haven’t is because we cannot yet afford to replace them, so yanking them right now would create an even greater security risk. They have really screwed up with this though by leaving people like us in this situation. There is still going to be litigation on this regardless of what they say",

Reolink can handle this for you, and a lot of people are comfortable with that for the convenience. Their app is also better than the standalone IP camera viewer apps I've tried.",

You can even install home assistant for free on an old computer - completely local and doesn’t even need to be connected to the internet.\n4.\t⁠⁠Delete your ring account.\n\n**Do NOT passively support ICE or the US federal government subjugating your neighbours and community, do NOT allow them the ease of access to a turnkey nationwide surveillance system to further enable a police state.**\n\nEdit: For the knuckledragging cavemen below *“Wah it’s toooo hard”.* No… it’s really not. If you want dead simple, there’s options for the average tech-fearing Luddite.

You can also build your own home server or use an old PC (almost anything can run HA!) and install HA for free. This is a starting point for full local control of your smarthome ecosystem. Highly configurable - but you dont need to if you want to keep it basic.\n\nThen paired with the Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 (there’s several other great options too!) - allows local storage on-device and connects to HA, but you can upload to a local NAS storage with HomeAssistant. Aqara is very easy to setup and get working with HA - just plug-and-play.",

I downloaded the app, made an account and used it for a while, but eventually stopped looking at it because I don’t really need to see videos of my driveway.  \nFast forward to this ad, which made me want to be sure I’ve disconnected the camera from the Internet. I downloaded the app and tried to log in. Even though I had my password, it insisted on sending a code via email. But then the email said I was using a different device so I would have to “verify”\nMy account. Keep in mind I already have a password and the ability to receive a code through my verified email.\nTurns out the only ways I can get into the account now are to give them a copy of my government ID, or let them do a biometrical scan of my face.\nI’m considering just ripping the camera down.",

And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation. \n\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w34836",

Saves one person about 10 to 12 hours per month (and oh my God is it mind numbing to do like 6k times, so I'm sure she is happy). The two months of R&D will take a while to ROI, except that we will be able to reproduce the type of effort quicker next time. (Some of that was also the name matching which isn't done via LLM, and may be reusable elsewhere)\n\nAnother app: categorizes messages for routing to the correct work queue.\n\nThese are not huge agentic improvements to our operations, but they are quiet little time savers.",

The blur that gives us a good idea that something can work. But it raises a question -- would the project be better if there was human intent from the very start? Does the AI bias us towards bad structure/ideas?\n\nIt kinda goes back to when do you design something yourself vs rely on a library? Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware. It forces software developers to stop assuming every increasing hardware capability can makeup for sloppy and inefficient code -- forces us to actually go back and optimize things.",

It's about 95% correct at it, which is fine - anything it fucks up is caught and reassigned. \n\n\nThat's not a full job, though, it's a few hours a week. I reorganized a few tasks to balance the workload but i'd need 10+ processes all done this way and enough transferrable tasks to consolidate before I could lose a person from it. Maybe from a full organizational perspective we could reduce headcount, but it's extremely hard to consolidate across teams like this. ",

Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.\n\nLOL, I just LOVE that they make the connection to 1987 and folks wondering why the computer revolution hadn't happened yet.

It generated pages and pages of detailed content that I would not have been able to produce myself.  It was actually amazing and my bosses were blown away.  The problem is I spent far more time verifying that it was correct, and there were tons of errors, than it would have taken to write it myself.\n\nEDIT: If I had written it all myself I would have generated maybe a 2 or 3 page report.  AI generated 15 or so pages of content with a lot of detail and well written, but it needed to be closely proofread and checked for accuracy.  It turned a 20 hour job into a 60 hour job, but the end result was a win.",

Every step of the way AI makes horrible mistakes that you can’t solve if you can’t understand and do it yourself. \n\nAnd then when you get to self service and people start asking questons about the data to AI, it hallucinates half the numbers. So we created a custom AI that doesn’t hallucinate, but you need to prepare the data in tables exactly right to answer the questions and if it gets a little complicated, you get wrong answers anyway.\n\nWhat it is useful for? Boring tasks that take a lot of time, like adding tabelstructures to excel for documentation, adding comments to queries, writing queries by just giving the source table structure and telling it what to do, checking errors, writing DAX measures, brainstorming, etc.\n\nI’m not worried for my job.",

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

So I ask him why and he said “every job we walk there’s 20 company’s trying to bid for it, and they all show up with iPads. They’re using CHATGPT for their quotes and scopes” \nSaid they’re all like 20-30 year olds, and they’re losing work to them, but my opinion? Which has been my opinion since I started doing sales?

You’re talking permits, warranties, warranty inspections, city inspections, insurance policies, CALIFORNIA. These are Bay Area buildings on their 3rd roof, that’s at least a 50 year old building. Company’s come in from other states for bidding. This shit makes no sense. They all fail, they all take bigger bites than they can chew. They don’t know the climate of the area, what to look out for, what California will NEVER let you do, especially in some counties I’ve seen companies kicked off a job mid way through because of their lack of understanding and respect. They all lose their ass in the end. It’s really just a ticking time bomb until building owners that have used cheap work too long and dumb company’s realize their building are fixed with straw and gum, warranted by a prayer and trying to sell it before it comes tumbling down into a heap of garbage. Insurance companies dipped like 3 years ago from here and now I’m sure it’s because of the boom of contractors and their instant needs of a claim that were beyond their ability to afford.

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term. CBS thinks it can slip in and get some oarks (or avoid some penalties) by cozying up to the ghouls in power, because they assume none of us will care or remember in the long term. \n\nI hope we all make them eat that arrogantm unamerican assumption; but I fear that we won’t. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8x1oSGb/",

We're learning that our gut biome is likely where our circadian rhythms are based.  We're learning that there is a serious correlation between the evolution of the gut biome and the development of intelligence, as we've learned that the gut actually plays a core role in decision making and sends signals directly to the brain.\n\nIt's such a shame that a tool such as this, one of the dumbest kennedies, can come in and gaslight about nutrition which in turn leaves many people rolling their eyes about any sort of nutritional advice at all.",

If you look at servings based on calorie needs available at realfood.gov it suggests 4-5 servings of protein per day if you are at the highest caloric intake of 3200 per day. 1 egg or 3oz of cooked meat is a serving. Grok suggests 3 eggs for breakfast, a 4th egg as a snack and more protein from lunch and dinner. The protein servings are lower for everyone else. It does suggest like 8 teaspoons of butter or olive oil per day to get your health fats in which is weird, but overall not egregious because it also notes that healthy fats exist within some foods already like avocados for example.",

I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

Like, it fucked me up and drove me away from continuing to interact with most of his family.  He had been unable to fight his demons and his own family posting like everything was okay and peachy *through him* was unfathomable.  I don't have words.  It wasn't something any of us foresaw them doing.  I don't know how they gained access - my friend might have left something behind for it, but there's no way he would have approved of what they were doing with his accounts. They're the *exact* kind of people who would embrace something like this because they already *want* it.",

The tonal shift in the company from Bezos (still a dickhead) to Jassy was so noticeable: fear of layoffs, anti-employee RTO and comp policies, tracking badge swipes and time in office.

I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years.

But there is another formation very similar to monopolies called oligopolies. An oligopoly is a \"small number of players in a market\" instead of a **mono**poly, which is just one player.\n\nHow we know if a market is an oligopoly or a healthy competitive market is based on how much power each individual player has. If a single player can completely warp a market, then the market is not a healthy competition, and it requires more players.\n\nBillionaires have so much power, enough to buy entire industries, just to shut them down if they feel like it. Their power is so disproportionate compared to the average Joe. We would never accept this in a healthy business market. But it's totally normal (for a lot of people) on a citizen level.\n\nAlmost all of our modern problems is due to the fact billionaires are treating countries like their playgrounds. Tax them until they're no longer billionaires would fix a fuckload of our problems, while also allowing our government to y'know, do things again. I'd much rather a government handle these things than billionaires for the simple fact, if a billionaire is evil, you can't do shit. If a government is evil, you can vote them out.\n\nIf a politician isn't talking about taxing billionaires, they're trying to \"go along to get along.\" When ANYONE can see how fucked up they are making the world.",

It's worse.\n\nReminder and a surprise for some: the US, privately owned digital vote counting machines (tabulators) have been compromised for years and we didn't elect Trump. He stole the presidency. Exactly like he tried to do in 2020, just this time with the already compromised tabulator machines tuned more aggressively to guarantee it.\n\nDo not take my word for it, here's the actual data (and even though this video is now several months old and there is much more they've found, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as you might expect with criminals). Please see for yourself and if you trust the data (not simply conspiracy theory talk) share with anyone who still thinks \"America got it wrong\" or we need to get out and vote more.  We did, and Kamala would have won, decisively, had our votes actually been counted correctly. It's the compromised, privately owned tabulators (vote counting machines) that turned votes for Kamala into votes for Trump in all the swing states, after a certain threshold of votes were counted on each machine. These folks and other independent teams of analysts like them, are doing us a great service:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ru8SHK7idxs?feature=shared\nelectiontruthalliance.org\n\nAnd we've been on that road for a very long time which, unfortunately, is not surprising. This journalist research article, written just before Obama's 2nd term, dives into the long history of election fraud in the US and how, especially in the digital tabulation age, it has been setup to get us to the point where whomever has control of them can literally steal an election:\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2012/11/how-to-rig-an-election/\n\nSo, whenever Maga or Republicans say they want to investigate Election Fraud (\"by the Dems\"), it's to accuse and look in the right, yet as we know, and as the data evidence demonstrates, their accusation is yet again projection.",

I look for information from other sources who continue to question the administration and who bring us the videos of what is really happening in the streets of this nation.\n\nQuestion what is being fed to you via the media. Question what the politicians tell you. What I am hearing from family and friends is that they do not like what is happening in this nation. They really do not like what ICE (ICE= US Gestapo don't believe me look up and read about what the Nazi Gestapo did prior to and during WWII) is doing in our states, cities, and our neighborhoods. Read about world history, read about Nazi Germany and the horrors that were perpetrated there. Question everything you are told by those who hold the power.",

Sorry, not sorry, but if you're still relying heavily on ABC, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, etc. you are playing into their hands. Every single one of those is owned by someone who has the exact same class interests as Donald Trump, and as such, will not meaningfully challenge him at the cost of their own position in society. When push comes to shove, they *will* align themselves with him. There is no reason for a billionaire to own a news empire or a social media network that isn't to sanitize their own reputations, and to curry favor for themselves among the centers of power in the world. \n\nIf we REALLY want to deal them a blow, then we need to take our views to non-profit and ideally (because non-profits rely on donos which can be and almost always are from powerful, wealthy individuals who expect a return on that investment) journalist-owned media. The Associated Press is arguably the best \"major\" network, as it is not \"owned\" by any one group - but the controlling members are the major networks who ARE owned and controlled by billionaires. Better sources of news would be, like, 404 Media (tech), Aftermath (gaming), Drop Site News (politics), Hell Gate (New York news), ProPublica, etc. Where we can, we should be giving these sites your membership fees, views, clicks, web hits, etc. These are good journalists, usually a diaspora from some old mainstay website's \"restructuring\". They're not just randos who threw together a website, but real, dogged journalists with real work behind them and they can do BETTER work when they've got food in their bellies, a healthcare plan, a safe and secure place to live, etc. For we who have SOME means, that means it's up to us to not just use these sites, but kick over a little monthly dono as well.\n\nAs long as we depend and expect these news sources owned by people who are actively working against us, to work FOR us, we can continue to expect disappointment. They own these outlets and these platforms for a reason, and that reason is *specifically* to undermine our power and to divide us. Also, like, I know I mentioned the traditionally \"liberal\" news outlets and declined to mention Fox, Newsmax, OANN, but that's because... like, I expect conservatives a.) not to care and b.) generally to be willingly obsequious serfs on the modern digital feifs. They don't care that billionaires own these, because they're deliberate simps to power. I expect liberals, in theory, aren't.",

Discord has a huge number of customers having more or less cornered the VOIP market for gaming related activities, notice how discord already links to various game accounts, and to twitch, and it has always had overlays showing what game you're currently playing, which means it is collecting all that Data, and that Data is valuable.\n\nDiscord wants to look as valuable as possible so they can make a lot of money selling the company piece by tiny piece, and they've already been forced to implement ID verification in several countries, so they have the perfect excuse, they say they won't sell your data, but that's not a contract just a promise with no garauntee other than their word, and if someone else like microsoft for instance decided to quietly purchase a controlling share, well they never even promised not to sell your data.\n\nThis is just a combination of greed and stupidity, Discord picked a singularly bad moment to try this shit given what's going on in the world given wider political and consumer confidence issues which make the public much less trusting, but in a calmer moment in history this wouldn't have blown up nearly as much.",

Half the time the answer is buried in some 3-year-old thread with broken context anyway.\n\nWe traded messy but accessible knowledge for locked rooms and scrollback hell. It’s awful for documentation, awful for troubleshooting, and great if you enjoy wasting time asking the same questions over and over because nothing is discoverable anymore.\n\nI get why communities like it, real time chat is easy, but as a knowledge base it’s complete trash.\n\nYeah, I hate it.

The CEO who made the decision doesn't care, guys like that just move on to enshitiffy another platform or service in 2-3 years. If I read correctly it's a new CEO put in place as preparation for Discord being publicly traded. \n\nIn wrestling, there's the concept of the \"Face\" and the \"Heel\".\n\nThe face is the 'good guy', the 'heel' is the bad guy. Everyone boos the heel, but the heel's job is to be the bad guy, it's literally why they're paid.\n\nThese CEOs are heels. The board wants to do something deeply unpopular, but they know it'll be tolerated if they can just stick in the tip. \n\nSo they appoint a new ~~Heel~~ CEO, to implement the policies people don't want. People boo the heel as he suplexes the good out of the product or platform. Once he's made all the changes the board wants, they can come in and fire the heel, and people cheer!\n\nBut the changes never do quite seem to fully revert, do they? Maybe they revert some token bits of the change, but those were likely planned concessions that they planned to ditch, anyway.",

Which is itself just expensive IRC for new wave tech bros.  Which is ironic because IRC is IRC for old school tech bros.  \n  \nThe point is that for basic realtime group comms, there's no reason to not use whatsapp or signal.  And there's no reason at all to use any of those as forum replacements.  Hell, even reddit would make a better curated forum platform than discord.  The only thing even slightly unique about Discord is the way it broke things out into searchable channels and topics.  \n  \nDiscord only really exists because it got momentum and maybe even a bit of brand loyalty from a group of people who have never really had to migrate between internet services before, so the whole thing just comes off as a bit amusing to people from the ICQ/AIM/mIRC era.",

Discord has settled on Nitro features, but the problem is that the base product is so good that a lot of folks will not have much need for those extended features, which means Discord will have to enshittify or find some killer use case to get people to pay, which I haven't really seen yet.\n\nIt's not the issue in this case, though-- this is a decision that results from the idiotic British age verification rules, that Discord has inexplicably decided needs to roll out across the globe. For most of the world, privacy-abusing and pointless face verification isn't required by law, and a lot of people will not put up with it-- the question is how many people won't put up with it and whether it's justly fatal to the company.

              "text": "I'm probably jaded, but I have to agree. The fact is that you see lots of these \"People are outraged about Discord's age verification process!\" posts on multiple different subreddits. I ask you though, how many threads do you see on those posts about people discussing alternatives to Discord that they should switch to? My experience is that very few people are actually talking about where they are going to migrate to, which signals to me that most people are here to be outraged and not do anything about it. If people actually cared, these posts would have tons of people discussing where to migrate their social circles to.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dinosaur that remembers the days of having TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and Skype all installed to play with different friend groups. Discord has been awfully convenient for consolidating the different gamer groups, but for me, the time has come to move on and return to the days of having multiple platforms installed to keep in touch. Be the change you want to see in the world and stop waiting for everyone else to move first right?",

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

A truck rear ended a stationary Waymo, then drove in front and reversed into the front of the vehicle. The driver of the offending vehicle then attempted to flee the scene, drove into a ditch, requiring \"minor, w hospitalization.\"",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

Because I'm guessing you're going to say something regarding the algorithms showing people propaganda in their feed, but I guess I don't understand how that is Facebook's fault and not the fault of the users who are trying to use Facebook in that evil way. Is it not the case that Facebook attempts to police the content on the site to avoid bad outcomes like that, but it's just a really hard problem to solve? So many of the social media and content aggregation platforms are facing that problem and struggling to solve it. Reddit, too!\n\nFrom my perspective, if someone makes a knife for the good intent of helping people with things like cooking, but then some bad actor uses that knife to kill someone then it's not the knife makers fault.

And they can afford these failures because they'll still have money left over even if some of them fail.\n\nTo add to that, they have networks of rich friends and family who do the same thing, so if they start a new business, they've got some investors available to instantly give them capital to get it started. So an idea tried on a whim — such as an online book store that could potentially expand to other products — can have instant success over the competition just because a bunch of rich buddies poured money into it and kept it running even when it wasn't turning a profit.\n\nSo there's no genius involved in wealth, nor anything clever at all. It's just the aristocracy keeping themselves in power through the only thing they have: too much money.",

The algorithm he created is horrible, he can be bought for political means, he has turned the app into literal trash compared to what it was. I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved. It has no originality no design and no practicality anymore, it's a mess.",

You could even find a used one that was broken and send it in for a replacement.\n\nIm not even sure they were advertising to audiophile buyers at this point but I think your hyperbole is a bit too thick.

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

Some people can't hear distortion or artifacts, but most professional mixing engineers are not full of shit and can absolutely tell when a master has been over compressed or destroyed by multiple different things. \n\nCables, amps, and playback hardware is MUCH less important than whatever happened to audio up to that point. Recording equipment, audio file formats etc are much more important than your phone's DA converter. As long as you don't have random RC circuits or *very* poor impedance matching along your signal chain, it's hard to tell small changes.\n\nThe difference between the lossy compression formats at highest quality settings and lossless formats is negligible perceptually, though very significant for other reasons (actual loss of information, changes to some transients etc).\n\nMost audiophiles have a very superficial understanding of audio technologies, AD/DA technology and why some things matter and others don't. They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable. Almost like some type of *soul* in audio signals. It's pure nonsense. We can mathematically debunk most of that but grifters gonna grift I guess.",

It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

The power cable affects nothing, yet audiophiles will spend 150x more for a power cable claiming to prevent audio interruptions that don’t exist. In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it.

All the effort went into ensuring good connections, wire was sufficient gauge, and amps had enough continuous and peak power.   Most of the money was spent on the microphones used (a phased array) for testing.\n\n\nAll that said, audio \"quality\" is a subjective measure, just like food flavor, IMHO.  Our perception is modified by so much. \n\n\nMy favorite \"personal\" experiment was blind testing CD vs 320kbps mp3s where I had my son randomly choose one version and then the other version of songs while I listened.  I went 9 for 10 in identifying them.\n\n\nNext, I did the same but didn't A/B the same songs and instead did it fully random.   I guessed right on 11 of 20.\n\n\nNone of that is scientifically valid, but it highlights advice I give when people ask me, which is that if it sounds good to you,  it is good!",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

While there is snake oil out there, cable quality is more about isolation/protection, especially in long runs where interference could be an issue. \n\nYou could make literally any conductor sound perfect in a short, banana-length run without interference but the longer the run and the more interference the worse the outcome. Conversely, better cables are meant to better withstand nose. Does everyone need a better cable? No. But do they wanna go through the asspain of cheaping out on, for example, an in-wall or large home theater installation only to find they need to redo it?",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

Its damaging to future generations. This is just the beginning. \n\nI think everyone is waiting for some completely AI-driven company to bust out totally insane projects/products in record time to be concerned. \n\nThe facts are this:\n\nAI is currently being heavily invested in, and while it has a long way to go to be all everyone’s trying to make it out to be, we will only continue to lose jobs as that trend continues. \n\nThere may be a bubble burst, but that won’t kill AI. This will continue, and until we have social safety nets, we can expect it to suck. And honestly? In America, we can expect these social safety nets to be fucking horrible (if we can expect them at all!)",

Someone on business tv said, that a known community bank gets 1000+ applications for some back office jobs that net 60k. The demand for (lower) middle class life outstrips the real job market 1:10 already. Organisations like [lisep.org](http://lisep.org) track this for ages, they call it \"underemployment\", that means you have the smart people but they are \"not needed\", so people give up, live in the basement or deliver food with their run of the mill MBA degree.

Occasionally the streaming feature is great for someone who isn't able to see what we're doing otherwise, or to troubleshoot a friend's PC problems.  \nBut not for anything public, I don't need anyone to know what I'm playing or listening to, I don't want quests or other engagement games.\n\nDiscord could probably scrap 50% of its features and I wouldn't even notice; maybe I would even notice it positively, cleaner and simpler UI, less annoying pop ups.",

Should've been when facebook asked for your address. Should've been when your phone asks you every time you use an app if it can share your location (as if that's really an option). Should've been when netflix limited amount of devices to share accounts. Should've been when youtube (google) started requiring age verification to see \"nsfw\" or \"sensitive\" content on their sfw site claiming the responsibility that parents should have. Should've been when all streaming services raised their monthly subscription/rent for literally no raise in value. Should've been when some states started blocking porn sites.",

Fair play.\n\nBut rather than understand that some other sites/services simply don't have the financial flexibility to give up 100% of their business in certain markets, and instead choose to comply with age verification laws in order to stay afloat, most of reddit is suddenly oblivious to the fact that those laws even exist.

                  "text": "Nearly every service in existence that has persistent chat history stores your messages you send in plain text. There are very few that instead store encrypted messages. Those that do are typically using E2EE. And the reason most services don't use E2EE is because it's incredibly inconvenient.\n\nUsers typically want to be able to do useful things like search through their past messages, which is something you cannot do if the messages are stored encrypted unless you load all of the messages onto your device to decrypt them before performing the search, which becomes a massive drain on both client and server resources as chat histories grow larger. Additionally, if the keys are lost, then depending on the implementation, you could end up losing access to the entirety of your message history. These are generally considered problematic by the majority of end users.\n\nE2EE sacrifices convenience for enhanced privacy and security. If you need that enhanced privacy and security, then you'll usually be happy with the trade-off of losing convenience, but most users don't need the enhanced privacy and security and would much rather have convenient functionality. Thus messages tend to be stored in plain text so as to facilitate that functionality (developer laziness notwithstanding).\n\nPasswords are a different matter entirely. Any service not run by an imbecile will neither store them encrypted nor store them in plain text, they're stored hashed. And this is fine because you don't need to know what the password is, you just need to know if the password someone gives you is the correct one, so scrambling the password in the exact same way and comparing the scrambled results is sufficient. Anyone storing passwords in plain text in 2026 needs to be executed.",

If you go three connections further from the bombed out semiconductor fab you notice that almost everything is unable to be produced or repaired any longer. This was already kinda obvious in the early 2000's when flooding spiked HDD prices and an earthquake spiked RAM prices. Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily. It's like a game of global economic MAD without nukes.",

We lost sight of its purpose.\n\nWe'd benefit more from adapting techniques & practices in most places, IMO. AI, for example, is often complained about by making homework pointless. Teachers appear to see themselves in some sort of arms race between sussing out what was written by AI & what was actually written by a student. Why does there need to be a race at all? Give oral exams in class. Make students show you what they know there on the spot. Invalidate the use of AI to circumvent learning in the first place.",

When students retain the basic information conveyed during lectures, they are able to moved more quickly onto the application, analysis, evaluation of the content and later creation of media and concepts using that content. \n\nThis is evident in elementary students up to post graduates. I even saw the difference in my education myself. During undergrad, I used a laptop and took notes on that in the classes that allowed but moved on to regular notebook paper by junior and senior year, choosing to transfer the notes from my handwritten notebooks to typed files simply to maintain the information in a better to read format later. The handwriting made it much easier to gather the information and the subsequent transferring to digital documents further cemented the knowledge so that I barely had to study before tests. \n\nHowever, during grad school, about 8 years later, I didn’t want to get a laptop so my partner had bought me an iPad Pro second hand. I had iPads in the past and never used them, but the iPad Pros had just introduced the Apple Pencils which completely revolutionized the iPad for me. I took all my notes on the notability app (I believe). I was quickly able to switch between pen and marker colors and really define how I was organizing my notes as I took them. I didn’t feel the need to rewrite them in a digital document because it had the ability to convert what I wrote. I should also note that most of my courses in grad school were music theory and high level analysis, so it wouldn’t have been a help to retype these things. \n\nBut I retained that information and was able to review it so much better than I ever had been able to with typed notes. I’m not saying this is an absolute fact of learning, but studies support my claim. \n\nAnd when I was teaching, students would complain about their struggles to learn concepts. I would ask to see their notes. I was so surprised to learn that they did absolutely everything on their Chromebooks - and the kicker was that most of the teachers simply gave them their lecture outlines instead of making them notate the content down. By doing that, you aren’t making the students do ANYTHING to obtain the information. It’s like handing them a textbook and asking them to put it under their pillow at night to learn by osmosis. Not to mention the textbooks were all now on the chromebooks.",

              "text": "That is just one small issue. But the point is valid. The devices i give my kids all have parental controls and internet filters. The school issued ipad has zero protection. Absolutely zero content controls. Whats even more ridiculous is that the teacher will show youtube videos in class to aid in teaching but she shows them WITH youtube ads. My kids come home asking about things they should not know about. Wtf? If you are using google classroom why are their ads in YouTube? Ridiculous . \n\nThe bigger problem is that the teachers use the ipads as pacifiers. There are peers in my kids class that get extra time for tests and extra help for work. While the teachers are busy spending time working with other kids, mine spend 2 hours a day reading. 2 hours of screen time reading. Not reading content the teacher prescribes but reading whatever they want like “graphic novels”, also known as comic books. The school developed AR goals for the kids to justify all the reading but its all bullshit. Its a pacifier thats being justified.\n\nKids spend 6 hours in school. 1 hour lunch/recess. 1 hour special. 2 hours reading. Teachers only teach maybe 2 hours. Bullshit\n\nOn top of that, they go edu tech software that one of my kids read to so that AI can determine how well they read. Seriously!?\n\nTwo years ago. The school district moved the goal posts by changing the grading rubric from 5 levels to 3. Guess what, now the kids on the borderline “meet standards”. \n\n\n\nBut hey, every school board meeting i go to im told look how great the school is doing. Well yes, that will happen when you change how you measure success. \n\nBest part was a few weeks ago when my 11 year old tells me the teacher taught them how to start writing by using chatgpt to help them. \n\nSo I completely agree with the many many articles that are highlighting a very bad situation in elementary education right now. I like the parents mentioned in the article plan to meet with the supe and hand him these fucking ipads and tell him to start doing his job. ",

In general I've become a tech-luddite who rails against AI, mandatory chromebooks, and constant screen time, but this opt-out approach bugs me too. \n\nChromebooks do have some advantages over pencil & paper - they support differentiated education (via adaptive math programs, for example), offer multimedia opportunities like slideshow creation, and can support remote learning during inclement weather (in the southeast we just had two straight weeks of school closure thanks to the arctic vortex). Of course, none of these examples supports always being on chromebooks for every class all the time, but they have a time and place that blanket opt-outs can't address. \n\nI think we're at a critical point where community pushback can moderate technology use in schools, but I also think opting out at an individual level is on balance a bad approach that can disadvantage/ostracize students working in an existing curriculum and puts a huge burden on already overworked teachers to create completely distinct education models for individual kids. \n\n",

Every kid from 1st grade up at our school knows a 30 second workaround to get to these sites that host 1000s of in browser games, so we have to be over their shoulder constantly when they're doing work to make sure they don't switch tabs.

They don't even properly edit their manuals. If we're paying $2k per grade level, I expect perfection from the company producing the phonics curriculum. \n\nUnqualified people (curriculum directors) purchase curriculum and tech for entire districts. These are bought from companies that have unqualified people, just a customer sales agent, pushing cookie cutter products. These products are often not well researched and developed. They are blatant money grabs and these companies will slap on the latest labels to attract the unqualified curriculum directors. Ex: Science of Reading being put on everything now. If you're an educator and know just a smidge of SOR, you can easily see through the bs. \n\nYSK: if your district has a curriculum director or curriculum coaches (DON'T even get me started on these leeches), you should petition to remove those positions. They are high paying positions and they do not improve student experience or outcomes. They do put additional pressure on teachers by increasing demands and reducing hands-on support. Your tax money is being pissed away and your kids education is getting worse. Your average principal has zero control over this. Go straight to your boards and superintendent.",

Everything is mainly multiple choice (even in high school!) and they let things be auto graded.   Most of the time students can’t even see what they missed since kids in other classes haven’t taken the test.   \n\nThey don’t get the hand written comments in red ink showing why their answer is wrong.\n\nNo more signed progress reports and parent involvement.  They can look if they’re interested but aren’t required to do so.\n\nHell, the online platforms can’t even average grades properly.  Not sure if they do batch processing or what, but  4 100s and 1 80/100 don’t average to 100/100 under any type of sane weighting, even with rounding.\n\n\nIf all of this was to support larger class sizes, it’d be one thing.  But not even that.   My elementary school classes were double the size of what’s allowed today and the teachers did everything by hand — even the gradebook.  But we had actual books,  they actually taught, and we wrote paragraph answers on test questions.

I assigned a paper assignment last week. Every student was given one. I got 20 back. That's 221 zeros. \n\nY'all don't understand the state of these kids. \n\nAbout 70% of them don't even bother with backpacks. None of them have pencils. If I provide pencil and paper, most of them end up on the floor in pieces. These kids are a different breed. They do not care. Anything that requires more than 3 seconds of thought, they give up. Organization is a foreign concept to them. \"Effort\" is not in their vocabulary. \n\nThe ONLY way I get them to do any work at all is if I spoon feed it to them on a Chromebook, and even then, I get 60% participation on a *good* day. \n\nThere is *no way* a 100% analog class would work, at least not where I teach.",

          "text": "***TL;DR:*** *High school daughter has flourished when switching to books and handwritten notes (at a private school) from the typical 1:1 learning when she was in 4th-8th grade.*\n\nDad here of a current 10th grader. My wife and I ended up putting our daughter into private school a few years ago. It wasn't because of the teachers, or the curriculum. It was because classwork, reading, homework, projects, everything was entirely swallowed by tech. Our daughter did not do well with a 1:1 device.\n\nFrom the 4th grade through 8th grade, almost everything was electronically completed. She had teachers that did teach, but it was often taught from some electronic platform, which maybe additional white-board writing for further explanations.\n\nIn general though, things were PDFs or online textbooks or other online platforms where she had to complete her work or readings. She retained so little. Her math? More often than not, it was done on a touch-sensitive Chromebook with a stylus. So if you wanted to try and remember how you did a homework probably from a couple weeks ago? It either didn't exist, or you had to wade through innumerable image files.\n\nAnyway, I could go so much further into it, but everyone here knows how typical 1:1 device and teaching is like.\n\nHere's what we've noticed over the last 1.5 years after enrolling her in a private school that teaches like schools taught 20 years ago. Even when she could focus in her classes, she retained a *lot* less when reading from an online document/book/scanned-image than she does from physical papers and books in her private school now. She also retains sooo much more when she is essentially \"forced\" (out of necessity for capturing the important material and getting a decent grade, not \"physically forced\") to take notes in her own hand, on actual paper, during class versus creating a Google doc or slide deck to \"take notes\" in. She retains a lot more when the important info is coming from a teacher versus when coming from a video. She retains a lot more when math work is expected to be done on physical paper versus on a screen.\n\nBasically, her switching to the non-tech method of learning has done wonders for her retention, interest and ability to connect things. And again, nothing against the teachers. My wife and I really thought they were great overall.\n\nAnyway, at least to people like my daughter (moderate ADHD and typical teen), *every single measurable aspect* of learning and retention improved when she switched to a school that teaches kids using teachers and physical books and papers, and expecting the kids to take notes in their own hand using pen/pencil. It is night and day.\n\nAnd last thing I'll add is that, she was always a very average student. The school she is in now is a very high expectation type of school, which worried my wife and I a lot, wondering if our daughter could handle it. It turns out, she can, and she said a few months ago that she always thought she was bad at math, and never knew she could *actually* be good at it. It nearly brought me to tears.\n\nAt least for a typical kid like my daughter, I honestly believe that the recent way of teaching/learning is **making millions of kids into intellectually** ***less*** **than what they otherwise could have been**. I could say a lot more about all of this, but it's already too long of a post, so I'll stop here.",

          "text": "I know no one will see this comment but something that is a huge problem in schools is getting the paper copies made… someone who I am very close with is a teacher at an elementary school and the children in my opinion shouldn’t be using chrome books so much. But the teachers (at this particular school and district) literally don’t have time to make copies and get all the papers graded. They have 45 minutes of prep before and after school. At least two of those days a week the prep time is taken up by meetings. The school only has one big printer they lease and some of the teachers who were lucky enough to have grants have a printer in their classroom. If u think about it, 30 children. Half hour to 45 minute long lessons. 8 or so lessons a day that’s about 300 pages a day, that’s if they only have one sheet of work to do per lesson. That doesn’t count actually finding the right worksheet for the lessons or in a worse case making the sheet from scratch. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to do everything on paper all day long anymore. With everyone again in this particular school and I know many others being on such different levels of knowledge they can’t realistically be doing the exact same work every day. So that’s even more variation. With the chromebooks they have the work there. And the kids who need help can get it as they need it and the kids who don’t, don’t need to be waiting on everyone else. If there’s some issue with the worksheet for some students the teacher can go and make corrections or change it and tailor it to some students differently then others. Which again wouldn’t really be possible if it was all done on paper.",

Schools don’t have an unlimited paper supply and we’ve already had to make changes to what we are handing out to students because we’re running out of paper and toner for the copiers. \n\nBring back actual textbooks and I will happily put the computers away until it’s time for test prep.

It also depends on the purpose of that particular composition; since writing information that you already know in order to communicate it to another person is more focused on the reader's ingestion of that information. This is most communication, and that's why typing it out on a keyboard is ideal - it's faster to make (type) AND easier to read.\n\nTaking notes is a great example of communicating information you DON'T know to yourself. And this self-communication is instant—You're not writing information to a future version of you, either. That would fall into the first category. You are taking notes just to go through the act of writing the information, and the purpose is not to review the notes later (though, that is a bonus).\n\nTLDR: To your brain and muscles, the 'A' key and the 'S' key are almost exactly the same thing (you push a key). However, actually writing the two letters 'A' and 'S' is a very different task, and this added effort solidifies the actual information behind the words into your head. Much more than typing them or reading them.",

And that's probably dependent on competitors (Apple, Tidal) being unable to cut their costs.  Most likely those guys are also saving money, and so all three would end up cutting costs equally, leading to no net gains for anyone.\n\nSo we are basically in a situation where the cost is limited by the consumers' willingness to pay.

I find about 70-90% of the code is solid as long as the prompt and spec you use going in is good. On the flip side I spend more time on the prompt and actively review and adjust as it goes. This is for trivial problems like coding out an API, database operations, etc\n\nFor complex and novel work its pretty rough still especially novel technology that the model hasn't been trained on yet. \n\nI don't think this has spread industry wide but it is more common then last year. \n\nI really hope no company is still merging into prod without some form of ci/cd and automated testing.",

Just all works so well.\n\nPeople get so defensive and draw lines and start yelling \"fanboi!\" and everything else. But honestly choices make everything better. Can you imagine how even crappier everything would be if we only had the choice of spotify for music streaming and android for phone OS?

You’re paying a premium that Never hits artists, and is currently being used to aggressively push their “AI artists” so that Spotify doesn’t have to pay genuine workers/employees or musicians. \n\nAt least something like Apple Music, even despite its intermittent clunkiness, supports real artists and is starting to implement things like “Discovery” playlists that are getting as accurate as any of Spotify’s weekly recommendations with a bit of time… and at least they have some basic form of those features without some attempt to almost quite literally 2x the price every 6-12 months.\n\nBesides, with apps like **SongShift** you can easily do what it’s made for and transfer thousands of songs + some playlists from Spotify while it catalogs and matches all those things overnight. It’s not necessarily the fastest solution, and it won’t be able to transfer platform-specific songs… but everything else is genuinely safe and it does a good/accurate job.",

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

Fox news isn't actually news, it's entertainment, and last I checked, everyone had the ability to listen/read to what they wanted to listen/read. Everything Fox and other shit make is slop that can *barely* be called news. Republicans and this administration don't get to shit on DEI and then force their version of conservative DEI down our throats. Apple is a private company, they can promote or post what they want, the FTC doesn't get to enforce shit. Apple doesn't have a liberal bias, Fox and other right wing sources just create bullshit that can't be called news, they don't get to act like they're suddenly biased when Fox makes things that obviously isn't going to be highlighted on Apple News.\n\nIf Fox wants more airtime on the platform, then they need to start making *actual* news, same with literally every other right wing platform.",

It actually looked like Breitbart showed up in the search for a flash and then quickly went away. It might be because I already have Fox News, The Daily Mail, and New York Post already blocked. I really wouldn’t be surprised if I already have Breitbart blocked because I remember blocking them but for them to not show up in search was weird because Fox News, The Daily Mail, and New York Post are already blocked but still let me search for them. Anyone else have the same experience with Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit?\n\nEdit: Breitbart comes up if I search “Breitbart News” which feels funny to type because it isn’t “news”. I went ahead and blocked it though, thanks for the reminder FTC lololol",
