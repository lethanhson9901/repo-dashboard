Because China obviously censors their internet as well. The distinction is, China's government directly blocks things. This is technically different, because the US government is only \"asking\" providers to block domains. So those companies are technically responsible for the censorship.

The slogan is asymmetrical by design -- police will not livestream investigations, the government will not publish internatl deliberations, judges will not disclose private communications.\n\nThose will never happen because **power requires privacy to function**. By taking away peoples' privacy, they take away peoples' power.\n\n- The _foundational_ principle of justice is **innocent until proven guilty**.\n\nA society that believes in \"nothing to hide = nothing to fear\" reverses that burden. Everyone is presumed guilty until they prove their innocence.\n\nA stranger with something in their pocket is suddenly a potential threat that they need to explain.\n\n- Even if you truly _did_ have nothing to hide -- the very act of surveillance changes behaviour. Chills speech. Suppresses dissent. Narrows experimentation and creativity.\n\nThe harm is not punishment; it is self-censorship. A society selecting for \"nothing to hide nothing to fear\" is selecting for conformity above all else -- not truth or happiness or ...\n\n----------\n\n#If someone says this to you:\n\n> When you use a public washroom you leave the door open, right? Because you have nothing to hide?\n\n> When you mail a letter you don't seal the envelope, do you?

Surely you have nothing to hide and that's fine?\n\n----------\n\nIf laws were just...\n\nIf enforcement was error-free...\n\nIf government officials were incorruptible...\n\nIf data was never misused...\n\nThen _maybe_ we can talk -- but history consistently disproves every single one of those assumptions.",

This app will need location permissions in order to show you the map, therefore it *could* be harvesting your data. It says it doesn't, but it's on the honor system. It could be lying.\n\nPlease, for the love of fucking everything, be discerning what you download to your phones right now! There are honeypots on all the app stores, I guarantee it. They would masquerade as something that looks exactly like this. I don't know how to tell the difference between an app that's legit and an app that's dangerous. I don't think it's possible at this point, unless you personally know people who can vouch for people who can vouch for the devs. And you're not going to find that level of connection in a reddit post.\n\nBy all means, look up maps of where the flock cameras are. This is a good idea. But think twice before installing an app that can double as spyware. Manually navigating to a website is *far* more secure, as you have more control over what information is being shared(you can, and should, navigate away from pages that won't load until you give them permissions to access your location).",

          "text": "Supreme Court Hacked, Proving Its Cybersecurity Is As Robust As Its Ethical Code\n\nMan pleading guilty to accessing Supreme Court database over and over again.\n\nBy Joe Patrice on January 14, 2026 1:01 pm\n\nRemember when the Supreme Court was absolutely consumed with figuring out who leaked the Dobbs draft opinion? They assigned the Marshal to investigate, brought in outside help, and made scores of employees sign affidavits. The response was immediate, muscular, and deeply unserious. The investigation did basically everything except interview the justices, because why interview anyone with both opportunity AND motive? Say, a justice credibly accused of leaking the results of other decisions who might have feared that colleagues would water down the maximalist draft before the case came down? No need to check in on anyone like that!\n\nA witchhunt ironically launched to defend an opinion based on witchhunters. And after several months, it inevitably fizzled. It was we’re all trying to find the guy who did this meme if the cops just accepted the man in the hot dog costume at his word.\n\nWell, it turns out they might’ve spent less time worrying about threats from inside the building and more time assessing how easily someone could waltz in through the digital front door.\n\nA 24-year-old from Springfield, Tennessee, named Nicholas Moore is set to plead guilty to hacking the Supreme Court’s electronic filing system. Not once or twice, but 25 times over a two-month span. If the Supreme Court didn’t know he was hanging out in the system for two months, is it still trespassing? When does adverse possession kick in?\n\nCourt Watch’s Seamus Hughes, who first spotted the filing, posted his reaction on X:\n\n￼\n\nIndeed.\n\n\nThe filing is notably spare on details. Maybe Jeanine Pirro learned that less is more if she needed to pursue an indictment without D.C. grand jurors responding with a resounding, “Are you kidding, lady?” The former Fox News personality who now serves as U.S. Attorney has had a rough go of it in D.C., between the juries refusing to convict and judges openly questioning whether her office understands basic Fourth Amendment principles — but now she’s found a case where the defendant is just going to plead guilty and save her the risk of another embarrassing fail.\n\nThe charge itself rests on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a statute prosecutors love the way DIYers love duct tape. The CFAA is intended to put sophisticated hackers in prison, but in practice, prosecutors deploy it whenever a computer makes someone feel bad. Its vague “unauthorized access” language has become a hammer used against people for logging into computers when company policy should have blocked access. It’s a computer crime law written for an era where our grasp of the technology came from movies like The Net, with that girl from the bus.\n\nDid Moore maliciously hack into the system, or did he just walk blithely through an open door? Unfortunately, it wouldn’t matter much under the CFAA. Prosecutors told TechCrunch they “cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.” But based on the bare-bones of the Information, the defendant only gained access to the electronic filing system as opposed to the Court’s emails or document management system. Moore presumably wasn’t getting access to internal deliberations or Clarence Thomas’s next billionaire-funded luxury vacation through the filing system.\n\nNot to downplay the seriousness of the breach — insider access to the filing system would afford access to any sealed documents — but this doesn’t sound like the start of a future Dobbs leak.\n\nThis marks the latest humiliating incident for the federal judiciary’s cybersecurity prowess. Last August, we learned that Russian government hackers had breached the broader federal court filing system. After years of claiming that PACER was a multibillion-dollar endeavor — before we learned that it was basically a federal judiciary slush fund — the federal judiciary belatedly committed to beefing up cybersecurity. This case serves as a reminder of how behind the times the judiciary was in 2023.\n\nAre they any better in 2026? If they approached cybersecurity with the same vim and vigor they brought to revamping the Court’s ethical code, let’s say no.\n\n\n￼Joe Patrice is a senior editor at Above the Law and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer.

I think out of 1700 saved Spotify songs, they had about 1450 of them, and the missing ones were mostly pretty obscure remixes \n- qobuz's sound quality is WAY better than spotify's. to the point where I was like holy crap, I dont think I can go back\n- qobuz recommends albums and artists, but not individual songs the way Spotify does. i admit that i prefer the way spotifys recommendations work. ive been using my (now unpaid) Spotify account to listen to discover weekly and then adding the songs I like to my qobuz. its an extra step with ads, but a simple one, and one im happy to take to not support murderers\n- I was a paid Spotify member for a decade and loved the service. but they've made their position very clear, right down to the fat donation they made to Trump's inauguration. at this point, i dont care if they change tactics. I dont care if they apologize. its all bullsh*t. frankly even if they fired their entire c suite and donated every penny they made from running those recruitment videos to people in need of legal representation as a result, the damage is already done. they spread ICE's message and their blood money signing bonus far and wide, and that bell cant be unrung. they will never see another penny from me.",

I’d suggest that the simplest option is to have the loophole require that exceptions must grant the same nonstandard license used to the general public, and that that license may not include any provisions that *de facto* restrict the benefits of that license to the host.",

All could be running Linux. Is Linux perfect? No. Is it better than throwing out good working hardware? Hell yes it is! The average user will be fine on Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian. If you want to learn more, branch out from there, just remember that AMD over Nvidia for Linux. Nvidia will work but, not as well. \n\nThink about what you use a computer for. Most of it is to be online or use word processing. Don't buy into all the new shit, and just switch to Linux. The more marketshare it gets, the more software vendors will start porting their software to Linux.We have to stop giving so much power to these big corporations.",

And right now the AI bubble/hardware shortage seems like a pretty good hook to pressure companies/people into cloud compute.\n\nJust look at Adobe, once you could buy a fixed version of their programs/suite and use it forever, until you absolutely need a new killer feature. And now it's a subscription and you own nothing. Didn't make Adobe less of an industry standard, they had a monopoly and unilaterally forced the conversion and people sucked it up.\n\nSame with Office365, if Microsoft wants to kill the standalone office suite, businesses will suck it up, because if they wanted to switch to libre office, then they already would've.\n\nEven hardware isn't safe. They don't *have* to make the next version of HDCP available on Linux. If you don't have access to the DRM necessary to decrypt, there's nothing you can do. Same with web browsers, Google controls basically ALL web browsers except Firefox through chromium. If they make changes to the next manifest, add DRM or other proprietary shit, that Firefox legally can't implement and gets all big web players to utilize that standard, it's game.\n\nSame with any other service/protocol, if you convince enough big players to make a move and business/customers can't wait or go through the pain of switching to an alternative it's game. Same reason why all new social media platforms fail, unless everyone agrees to switch over at the same time, then the people that do, don't have any peers to use it.\n\nI'm not saying all this doom and gloom is going to happen, but the big players have plenty of screws they could turn to make moves in a way that Linux and open source won't be the savior. Are there open source alternatives to Adobe? Yes. Will you get a job if you can't prove proficiency with the industry standard tools? Probably not. What if Rockstar decides to release GTA6 only in the cloud? Do you really think people can ignore their FOMO and boycott it? Like they did with HL2 when Valve forced steam and always on DRM onto people? Oh wait..",

Anyway, it feels more and more like you need to get an upgrade simply due to lack of optimization more often than not, which doesn't make sense to me.\n\n  \nFor example, I had zero issues with the 3060ti playing E33 max settings from start to finish no matter the area, but if I were to jump into BL3, it was rough trying to play on Medium settings. Honestly, it's still quite interesting on the 5080.",

But im still satisfied with its performance in gaming and anything else I do with it.\n\nSo... I just cloned my PC. I bought all the same components I currently have *used on eBay* (except a gtx 1080 instead of rtx 2070, its what i originally had) and it only cost me $320 total for the whole build. \n\nFor only another $320 I have 2 almost identical rigs that I can ride off into the sunset. I can still run even somewhat newer games at 1440p and 60-120 fps and that will be good enough for me for a long time...\n\nOh, and i feel like most new games these days suck so hard that im really not missing much when i cant meet system reqs anymore.",

For people used to getting it continuously, the idea of losing any of it fills them with a sense of deep discomfort so to us it seems rational to ban something that is causing any kind of harm, but that is because we are rational. People who are completely consumed by their addictions behave irrationally. Its like how a gambling addict will use his last paycheck to gamble instead of paying his past-due rent.\n\n\nOnce you understand this, you will have an answer to the question \"why are these people allowing this?\" And the answer to the question of why governments will drag their feet or refuse to take action entirely(unless expressly banned, politicians can have investments which include shares of the companies theyre supposed to be regulating)",

          "text": "Some details of this software and what it enables:\n\n>“Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) is a targeting tool designed to improve capabilities for identifying and prioritizing high-value targets through advanced analytics,” a user guide for ELITE obtained by 404 Media says. The tool aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend.\n>\n>One feature of ELITE is the “Geospatial Lead Sourcing Tab,” according to the user guide. This lets ICE see people it may potentially want to detain on a map interface, based on various criteria such as “Bios & IDs,” “Location,” “Operations,” and “Criminality.” An ICE officer can then select people one by one, or draw a shape on the map to see people in that selected area.\n>\n>ELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, immigration officers waited in three unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex in Woodburn. They went on to bust a driver’s window and pull a 45-year-old woman from a van, used ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her, and agents had the goal of making eight arrests per team per day, Oregon Live reported. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people in a “dragnet.” \n>\n>“One of our apps, it’s called ELITE. And so it tells you how many people are living in this area and what’s the likelihood of them actually being there,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit, identified in court records as JB, testified about the raid in early December. 404 Media purchased a transcript of JB’s testimony from the court. “It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address. ELITE notes the source of the address (such as the government agency that supplied it), and gives an “address confidence score.” One address confidence score example in the guide is 98.95 out of 100; another is 77.25 out of 100. This score is based on both the source of the address and how recent the data is, the user guide says. (ICE is paying skip tracers, private investigators, and bounty hunters to help verify peoples’ addresses.)\n>\n>...\n>\n>“These records give us behind-the-scenes insight into the kind of mass surveillance machine ICE is building with help from powerful tech companies like Palantir,” Laura Rivera, senior staff attorney at Just Futures Law, told 404 Media. “When combined with what we know from ICE testimony and other public information, it gives us a blueprint into how ICE is going into communities and identifying people for arrest in real-time.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Palantir has worked with ICE for years and was focused on criminal investigations, supporting Homeland Security Investigations’ (HSI) Investigative Case Management (ICM) system. That changed in the second Trump administration, with Palantir now working on ICE’s deportation efforts. \n>\n>After participating in a three-week coding sprint, ICE updated an ongoing Palantir contract related to “Enforcement Prioritization and Targeting,” to “support the development of an accurate picture of actionable leads based on existing law enforcement datasets to allow law enforcement to prioritize enforcement actions,” according to an internal Palantir wiki previously obtained by 404 Media. The goal was to find the physical location of people marked for deportation, and Palantir said it believes its work with ICE is “intended to promote government efficiency, transparency, and accountability.”\n>\n>The leaked material described Palantir’s deportation-focused work as “concentrated on delivering prototype capabilities” and lasting around six months. It left open the room for more work with ICE, and said “Palantir has developed into a more mature partner for ICE.” Documents ICE published described Palantir’s work as building a tool called ImmigrationOS.\n\nThis situation, from a privacy standpoint, is looking worse and worse. It seems that we are well into the era of mass surveillance, and not just by the state but by private for-profit entities who are happy to sell to the state and anyone else who would want these data. It's pretty much guaranteed that all these systems are collecting data on all of us, and not just \"those people over there\".",

The Soviet Union routinely committed atrocities against their internal opposition by detaching their brutal reactions through a complex mechanism of sham trials and false legal processes, so they could pretend their gulag victims were 'appropriately' deserving.\n\nIt's actually kind of hard to convince even a militant to round up a hundred people and then, personally, walk past them and shoot a bullet in the back of a person's head a hundred times. After a while they start having nightmares and weird human feelings, even if they are otherwise true believers.

At some Central repository, because your mother tags your face with the Ring app, now you are recognizable anywhere a ring camera is installed. \n\nThe UK, Canada, Australia, etc. all need desperately to keep palantir and these systems out - once they are integrated or operational in your country long enough, they will exfiltrate your information back to the US data centers.  In Alberta, Edmonton I believe, a US company is trialing body cams that utilize AI and facial recognition automatically check faces against criminal databases. Do you think all that processing is happening entirely within Canada? I don't. Meanwhile, they've got a police force walking around indexing the positions every citizen in public that can be recognized. License plate recognition systems like Flock or those used by police forces are building databases of movement and association which could be queried after the fact. Remember those cell movement visualizations during the pandemic? None of this leads to more freedom.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f6if1EY6I-I?si=joVq3NaJllnqQJHW\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4pN_sweMXQI?si=wC2ISVbVqYp1QbYr\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aeXIgKuX_zY?si=d8pgJ64iWiXcu_cF",

Rather than backing up homeowners and mom and pops, we only backed up the  banks and the automakers, and the investment firms, golden parachutes for all the perpetrators.  \n\nThe 2016 election marked the largest upward transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in known history.  Trillions of dollars, overnight.\n\nThe last dem admin put a tiny little child's bandage on a massive, gaping, festering, infected wound.\n\nThe looting of the american economy, the renewal of the reverse robin hood tax cuts, gutting of social safety nets, privatization of damn near every corner of government, We are like a decade away from a \"Minority Report\" crossed with \"Elysium.\"  Scratch that, it's pretty much already here.  The app described in this article is doing a minority report.  Arresting and murdering people for 'pre-crime.'\n\nIs your gut churning yet?

No, they just wanted a limited government when Obama was in and a market free from Democrat's regulations. The prop-up by Kochs just was a Scooby Doo style mask, until they took it off themselves.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our scoop. Here's more: \n\n404 Media has learned that Palantir is working on a tool for ICE that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier of each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address. \n\nAnd ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based. \n\nThis is the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground.\n\nAccording to the user guide 404 Media obtained, the tool, called ELITE, aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend. \n\nELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, agents waited in unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex before busting a driver’s window and pulling a 45-year-old woman from a van, using ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people [in a “dragnet.”](https://www.chronline.com/stories/oregon-lawyers-seek-court-order-to-halt-ice-warrantless-arrests,394264) \n\n“It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit identified in court records as JB, said about ELITE during testimony of the raid.\n\nMore details: [https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)",

They tend to think \"that's not my problem to solve, someone else will do it.\" Problem is, no one is willing to be the guinea pig/leader.\n\n2) Let's say you organize and decide to take matters into your own hands. What are your targets? Do you think the police/SS/NG/US Army won't fire back?\n\n3) Even if you do manage to get a few shots in, how long will that last? To fight a war, even a short one, you need supplies and logistics, assuming you're organized to begin with. How many bullets and food does the average gun owner keep in their house? Do you think the military or air NG won't drop a 500 pound bomb on your house to eliminate you and your stockpile if you are considered an enemy of the state?\n\nThe entire \"well-regulated militia\" idea worked when military units were small and armed with muskets and cannons. It completely fails when confronted with a well-trained and -supplied military backing a tyrant.\n\nThere's only two ways this ends:\n\n1) Congress and the SC grow some balls and turf him and hopefully the entire cabal of \"advisors\" that are enabling him. This also assumes that the SS/police/military will enforce any orders to arrest him. I don't see this as plausible at least in the near-term i.e. the next few years.\n\n2) A military coup, but I believe we are extremely far away from anything like that happening.",

If ICE produces a warrant, the Guard will stand by and intervene if ICE initiates violence. If ICE does *not* produce a warrant, they will be ordered to leave the property. \n  \nIf ICE becomes belligerent and/or attempts to incite violence with a Guardsman, the Guard is authorized to respond with deadly force. \n \nImportant: The Guard is there to police ICE, *not* citizens. That is the job of local police. The Guard is constitutionally barred from policing the citizenry. They *are* constitutionally sworn to defend American citizens from \"enemies, foreign and *domestic*\".  \n\nThis will accomplish a number of things at once. \n \n1) This positions America's military on the side of American citizens - not ICE and DHS.     \n2) The public perception and popularity of the National Guard will skyrocket.  \n3) Citizens will immediately become safter, as this will have a cooling effect on ICEs predilection for inciting violence.    \n4) ICE officers will be safter. Because citizens will feel less threatened and less likely to assert their 2nd Amendment options - diminishing the pretext Trump is trying to foment for declaring martial law.    \n5) Armed Guardsmen in uniform cannot be confused for 'domestic terrorists' - used  as a pretext for ICE attacking/killing them.     \n6) If ICE dares attack, injure, or kill National Guardsmen (God help them if they do), this will instantly position them as an enemy to our armed forces - and Hegseth, Noem, and Trump won't last long after that.      \n  \nEvery so-called 'Blue State' Governor needs to deploy the Guard in this manner, which will make the position of the Trump Administration much more precarious, rather than the other way around.\n  \nThis would instantly flip the script on Trump, and make his regime worry about HIS people getting violent with the Guard, creating pretext for the Armed Forces to step in and do something about them. I promise you, Generals and Commanders are just looking for a reason. \n\nIt needs to be done NOW.",

It's also why ICE can use palantir tech. People keep saying the Trump admin is doing illegal things, but laws including the patriot act(Bush) and laws passed since have enabled trump to do what he's doing. It's not illegal, the U.S. has slowly turned the presidency into an emperor with power to send us into wars, and make sweeping decrees. This is the system working as intended, but a madman took charge. That's just what happens when you consolidate power into one place. Madmen see this and crave the power.\n\nEdit:Truthful and nuanced views get downvotes. Downvoting me isn't going to fix the american political system.",

Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.",

There were a lot of lives saved during tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, etc., due to quick reporting by locals on Twitter.\n\nBut yeah, I also had to go into my Twitter settings once every 1–3 months and curate its recommendation engine _by hand_ because it kept slowly recategorizing me according to popular trends in my demographic, in order to keep my feed strictly focused on software engineering. \"No, I don't want my feed to be dominated by sports, celebrities, politics, or cars.\" You could keep a pretty pristine feed if you maintained it deliberately, but it did take work.",

It sends the codes to decrypt your drive over as plain text without the pin. Granted, TPM 2.0 can be integrated to the CPU, removing this issue, but that's not as trust worthy as a separate chip; most laptops all use a dedicated chip, even when the CPU has an integrated one.\n\nWindows file explorer takes a few solid seconds to open up. Their solution? Have it always running in the background, taking up RAM and CPU usage, which barely speeds it up. Edit: This is just about the GUI portion, not the whole program.\n\nTaskbar, right-click menu, and many other basic settings are either removed or require you to use RegEdit to change. I don't want to have to navigate to a submenu on almost every right-click I do.\n\nOneDrive is gonna move all your files from your PC to the internet, then delete them or gate-keep them behind a paywall because your Documents folder is too large for OneDrive. If you're not connected to the internet, you aren't able to access any of the files not downloaded to your computer. I want those files on my PC, that's why they were placed in the Documents folder.\n\nYou need a Microsoft account to install Windows 11. No workarounds. Not everyone wants a Microsoft account, and no one wants to be flooded with emails about using stupid features.\n\nCopilot AI is just garbage. Half the info you get from an LLM is just hallucinations. \n\nThis is Windows 10, but I still hate it: I WANT TO SEARCH MY PC FOR A FILE, NOT BING, NOT IN EDGE!",

It sounds like mostly marketing, but it probably makes Teams run more efficiently, so I wouldn't be opposed to that.

What a radical idea. Sell a product that people actually want. And then sell add ins for all the useless crap that they’re trying to force on us.\n\nEdit at 400+ up votes. \n\nWow! Didn’t expect this level of comment \n\nI’ve read everyone but can’t reply to the all but the discussion is tremendous. So… I’ve been thinking. I use windows for work. I’m a consultant in the construction industry and I have to use software that the industry uses which is all windows based. \n\nI’ve also thought about Linux and even though it’s free and open source it’s not the easiest to configure if you’re not a techy type person. Which I am not. I understand that many of the responses I’ve read are from those “techy” type people and gamers who also tend to be into software and hardware.  But for the rest of us it’s a tool to do our jobs. No different than a hammer and tape measure. \n\nSo here’s my thought. Someone smarter than me (well in all honesty someone a whole lot smarter than me) develop from Linux a package that is easy to install and configure (like windows once was) and can run windows based programs. I.e. Office, P6, email, Autodesk, and other business applications, etc.  Have clear instructions and support. And sell it. It may be various packages.  One for business. One for home use, one for gamers, whatever.  Maybe that’s already out there but most of us are focused on our day jobs and aren’t smart enough to navigate Linux. I know everyone says it’s easy but it isn’t.  Am I just crazy? Lazy? Or is their a place go this? \n\nAnd once again thanks for all the comments.",

              "text": "It's a PC with an inference engine in it. An inference engine is a specialized piece of hardware which is good at evaluating the mathematic score (value) of huge numbers of parameters (big equations). Sometimes it can only do the math on the outcomes (evaluate a neural network) and that can be just called a neural engine. Sometimes it can perform some of the next level of inference which is to try to jiggle the system a bit to improve the score. If the hardware cannot do this latter part then the main CPU does that instead.\n\nWith these assists you can \"run\" large models (large language models, LLMs) and in this way can \"run AI\" on your system quickly.\n\nAll the creation of the model is far, far more complex. This is called training. It takes a lot more compute and so this is typically (currently) done on video cards or things which are a lot like video cards because the higher reprogrammability of those things comes in handy when training, much more so than during inference. I mean maybe it comes in handy in inference, but since inference is so much less complicated it is faster and there's just less time to save anyway. You may train for months. You typically infer for some number of seconds.\n\nUnstated here is that even for inference having more RAM really comes in handy. So an AI PC would likely have an inference engine and more RAM. In the past this was a natural, as RAM was cheap for them to acquire but by saying it's for AI they could, in a way, increase the perceived value of that RAM and so charge you more than they pay for it. But now RAM is so expensive that may not be the case.\n\nYou can always do inference on the CPU in software. It just won't be as fast. You can do it on a GPU too, if your GPU isn't doing anything else at the time. If you're playing games that may not work out. So to play graphically intensive \"AI games\" would require some inference hardware and a GPU which do not rob too much from each other. Note that when you use the various upscaling algorithms that graphics card makers consider to be a standard part of rendering now (DLSS, etc.) then you are basically doing inference and graphics rendering at the same time.",

                  "text": "They’re standard in all phone, apple, and now very belatedly modern PC cpus / SOCs.\n\nThey are useful. For things like some photoshop features. Or as a much better example pixelmator on macos, which is sadly mac only (single purchase, cheap, really good featureset, very competitive w/ unconfigured vanilla photoshop out of the box)\n\nThe main thing is that the NPUs don’t - ish, caveat - really come as much of a cost to anything else. With modern silicon nodes there is basically a lot of free silicon to spend on cache, iGPUs, video accelerators, and NPUs. The die cost for NPUs / tensor processors (ie fast matrix processing units) is AFAIK very low, and furthermore basically guarantees very good SOC perf + power efficiency where present.\n\nIt should generally be worth noting that - *for laptops* - the “AI” branded chips basically are in actuality a generational (ish) boost / improvement in overall perf + power efficiency, and basically are a finally feature complete, incremental, answer to apple’s M-series, ish. It’s not necessarily a *massive* jump from the prev gen to those, but it js also (ish) an improvement.\n\nThe windows copilot *software* bullshit is pure garbage and MS / nadella fully deserves to suffer for - as usual - having their head up their ass. Nevermind the tech industry as a whole.\n\nNPUs are also not a particularly *important* feature. They are *sometimes* useful. For very specific, minor features in stuff like eg pixelmator (or photoshop) having slightly better magic selection / flood fill algorithms, that *should* run locally, offline, and instantly. Stuff like that. Not shove LLMs (or any other *stupid* applications of neural nets) into everything.\n\nCaveats and costs to NPUs. NPUs on laptops / general purpose mobile SOCs are basically just specialized iGPU subcomponents / coprocessors and have and benefit (and will be crippled by) the same things. One obvious cost (and benefit) to them is soldered RAM everywhere, which can *potentially* uplift NPU (and igpu!) performance. I’m not actually clear that that is improving perf though. Fast DDR5 definitely helps, ish, to basically just band aid this, but apple explicitely uses a really wide GPU esque data bus. PC OEMs basically / typically don’t, even if the RAM *is* soldered w/ shorter traces and the ability to do that, probably for compatibility + cost reasons. And that definitely will cripple (ish) NPU (and iGPU perf) compared to what apple did. ish. AFAIK\n\nOverall though yeah we basically are getting the same, very general purpose / bundle of everything hardware / SOCs on… basically everything.\n\nAnd which is on the HW level much more driven by basically TSMC nodes / moore’s law (w/r silicon availability, not clock speeds). And also by other companies (intel, amd, qualcomm) very literally following on after apple, which did some of these things first. And which has been shipping “AI coprocessors” etc in everything, with a much better / saner “devs are free to use these for something if they want, a la our gpus, general compute, compression accelerators, etc”, for the last 5+ years.\n\nThe current AI branding is, uh, what happens when microsoft, uh, goes all in on head-up-ass corporate synergy bullshit, and agressively pushes all of this stuff to their consumers + suppliers (end users + OEMs + AMD/Intel/Qualcomm HW branding), to… basically try to justify not just their AI (openai, github) but also datacenter (azure) investments etc to shareholders, and to basically generally justify + hype up their executive management despite a recurring tendency of comprehensively fucking up their own business initiatives and product rollouts and/or maintenance/updates in… basically every other (or heck more things) that they’ve ever released\n\n(xbox, kinect, zune, windows phone, hololens AR/VR (basically gave up immediately despite their own impressive advances due to a somewhat inferior product launch + completely glacial rate of development, to go chase after the next shiny thing. a la nearly *everything else they’ve ever released*). AI will go on that pile. AI is also very literally being used to push/pad their fake azure adoption/use metrics. ditto lighting their xbox division on fire w/ cloud gaming initiatives at present + prior to this)\n\nThe thing to basically understand about MS is that their corporate leadership is run by MBAs and ergo terrible, and their internal development teams + way they actually organize and run their company is structurally terrible with rare exceptions.\n\nThey’re also basically perpetually fine / unscathed by this anyways b/c they’re market dominant and above all have huge revenue streams. So they’ll just continue to make the same mistakes / successes forever, basically",

As we have seen in the past they will go to great lengths to remove \"offensive\" advertisements. \n\nThis is not out of the goodness of their heart, but because no company wants their ad shown next to an AI porn ad. Once enough people report them, if that particular company goes away. They can create a new company, create new Google ads but that cost them money and eventually if every single questionable ad is reported, it just won't be worth it to buy real identities on the darknet in order to register for a Google AdSense account. \n\ntl:dr: if you had a newspaper that ran questionable ads that ran counter to your beliefs, and they had a phone number to call to report these ads to them.. but instead you told your kids just ignore the ads that are completely amoral; then the problem is you for not trying at all. Google works on metrics, if enough people reported them, a human being will look at it. If everybody had your point of view, absolutely nobody would report it and these ads would be completely free to create for anybody who knows how to bypass the system. Clicking the three dots menu and selecting that this ad violates a particular policy is never going to be more detrimental than doing nothing.\n\nEdit: I think my tldr was longer than my actual post. Hell, I never claimed to be perfect. If we just engage our brains a little bit.. ok, we know what kind of a society we live in (speaking to Western people in particular) so just remember—google, facebook, twitter... they will use numbers and algorithms to make their decisions. If you opt out of the algorithms and numbers that they give you, and you opt out of the service, then I'm legitimately impressed. If you opt out of the reporting options, the ability to say \"this ad is fucked up\" but still choose to complain about it and consume content on the platform, then that's on you. Enjoy the endless list of AI ads that break the rules because nobody reports them.",

The word is that she was taking it like a big fat joke, taking her meeting from his mansion in a bikini from the pool side while sipping on a margarita and otherwise having very little clue about the domain or how to run a business.\n\nSo on one side we have a man with too much money who purchases affection by showering them with cash which most likely gives him an impression of ownership and on the other someone that seems more about parting stupid rich old man from their money than being an actual tech anything.\n\nOptics isn't great with either of them. Honestly there's much chances of the allegation being true or being a last cash grab. Or both.\n\nNot going to bet on that one.",

She still has her shares, but I guess she wants rights over the company as well. I have no doubt this is a common story in the cryptobro community.\n\nI'm not sure if I can link her LinkedIn post, but here it is:\n\n> I never thought I'd be writing something like this, but transparency matters.\nOver four years ago, I founded a company in the financial payments space and later brought on a cofounder. I built it from the ground up and was the largest equity holder aside from a single investor and board member. After a professional relationship with that investor - one I later discovered was inseparably tied to personal dynamics - ended, I was pushed out. That was over 15 months ago. \n\n> Despite my contributions and equity ownership as the second largest shareholder, I have received no updates on equity, no information about the company, and no compensation for the work, value, and intellectual property I created. I worked solely for equity and am proud of what we built. I was told that in order to receive any such updates I would have to forfeit any rights as a shareholder in speaking with others. (Remember, I was the second largest shareholder and worked for equity.)\nThis isn't just about me. It's about how easily founders - especially women - can be erased from the very companies they create when personal power dynamics overshadow business. Equity is not a gift; it's earned. To withhold it is not only unethical but retaliatory. Business is business.\n\n>I'm sharing this to raise awareness, to stand for fairness in entrepreneurship, and to remind others: protect your equity, protect your voice, and don't be afraid to speak up. The company I am referring to is Knox Networks, which was renamed Knova. Never shy away from standing up for yourself. At some point, enough is enough.",

This was forced onto Xbox when it shipped and I remember going to my friends house to see the Xbox in action. I watched him try over and over and over to choose a username but everything you can think of, each permutation was already taken because of email.\n\nHe then put in \"analbeast\" and it accepted. He thought he could change it later...he couldn't. Bills would come to his house address to analbeast. Xbox chat would always blow up because, you know, kids. Microsoft eventually contacted him and allowed him to change it.",

I try to ask the damn thing how to get to my email from there and it gives me the URL for outlook… \n\nI click everything in the margins until I get one that expands and has an “applications” option that expands into word ,excel, outlook and such so I can finally get into my email. I immediately set up email forwarding so I don’t have to go through this 10 step process just to reach my student inbox. \n\nWhat the fuck is the point of Copilot being a starting point? It’s not capable of navigating or helping direct traffic, it’s a chatbot, it responds  to specific questions. 100% of the time that’s not the reason I logged in, any other Microsoft thing would be a more appropriate guess as to my initial need; word, PowerPoint, fucking minesweeper, at least it’ll be right SOME of the time. Or better yet MY EMAIL, like google does I know how to get to other google stuff from there, I just normally don’t need to. \n\nI hate copilot for this effort to make it central to work, Much like McDonald’s, I will specifically avoid it because of the effort they’re putting into making it a thing. I know it’s all for naught because advertisement works and we may eventually have copilot be the default starting screen the moment you turn on any device, regardless of my input, but I’m at least not going to help make that the case.\n\nEdit- And further, WHY DOES AN EMPTY COPILOT CHAT BOX NEED TO TAKE UP SO MUCH OF THE PAGE THAT OTHET MICROSOFT FUNCTIONS AND PORTALS NEED TO BE  COLLAPSED AND HIDDEN I MARGINS?! It’s a big empty white box that’s using 90% of the page to get air for you to ask it something. It’s effectively an advanced search box, it doesn’t need that kinda dedicated visual web space.",

First, the article quotes *Windows Latest* which *itself* misquotes Perplexity: “particularly by Perplexity AI, claiming that Microsoft has killed the Office brand and that millions of users were now using AI overnight.”   \nWhat Perplexity actually said: \"Microsoft just renamed Office to \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app. 400 million users just became ‘AI users’ overnight.\"\n\nForbes notes, \"It’s misleading.\"\n\nLet's establish the two things Perplexity said: the renaming to Copilot, and the users becoming 'AI users.' \n\nForbes notes, \"What actually happened is Microsoft’s latest rebrand.\" Er, isn't that what renaming *is*? Forbes continues, \"Having renamed Office Hub to Microsoft 365, its AI everything product marketing team have now grabbed an opportunity to rename it again, this time to “Microsoft 365 Copilot.”\"\n\nOh, so it did rename to Copilot. Why did you say it was misleading to say it was renamed to Copilot?\n\nForbes repeats, \"And so while Office isn’t dead, the branding is slowly being erased. “Microsoft has been phasing out 'Office’ as the consumer-facing brand for years and pushing Microsoft 365 instead, which remains Microsoft 365.”\"  \n\nThey then quote Microsoft saying, \"In November 2022, we renamed only the Office ‘hub’ app for web and mobile to the Microsoft 365 app. In January 2025, we updated it to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app to reflect its role in bringing Copilot and Microsoft 365 productivity experiences together in one place.”\" Further repeating that yes, they did in fact change the name.\n\nYou'd think everything I'm saying is just useless right, as it all agrees? Apart from the misquotes and contradictory statements, well here comes the confusion.\n\nIt starts with this *Register* quote: “while Microsoft had successfully confused people across the internet, Redmond hadn’t actually renamed Microsoft 365. Not yet, anyway. I mean, they're slapping the Copilot label on everything else, and they've integrated it into Office, excuse me, Microsoft 365, why not Microsoft 365 Copilot?”\n\nHuh? We just established *several times over* that it *was* being renamed. Now Forbes quotes the *Register* who is saying 'no, they didn't actually rename it... but they should!' What?!\n\nForbes continues, by quoting *ZDNet*: “No, Microsoft Office was not renamed Microsoft 365 Copilot - here’s why you’re confused. With Microsoft's bewildering naming conventions, the mistake is easy to make. But Office is still Office, at least when it's not Microsoft 365.”\n\nAgain, completely disagreeing with everything previous in the article.\n\nForbes ends, \"Hopefully, you’re all following along at home and that’s now clear.\"\n\n**What an astonishingly terrible article.**",

Everything local, using old iPods. Like the old days. \n\nEnshittification was already turning me into a luddite and AI is just finishing the job.",

But I swear that shit is climbing, at least from casual conversations.\n\nNow I get it, \"maximum wage\" is kind of a misnomer, most of these rich people don't get money from wages, they get them through investments, so it'd be more like \"maximum wealth\".\n\nBut it's just the fact that I think some people are realizing, once you have enough money to buy ENTIRE INDUSTRIES, and shut them down just because the head of one of the companies in that industry called you a \"doodoo head\". That's probably too much money and power for one person to have.\n\nWe all know what a monopoly is, but an oligopoly is similar, instead of a single person owning everything, it's just a small number of people who own everything. And how do we test if it's an oligopoly, if one of the players suddenly disappeared, would the rest of the industry be affected? If yes, there are likely too few players. And oligopolies are considered bad, because 1) with reduced competition, consumers lose 2) they're significantly less stable than if there are many players.\n\nBut we allow PEOPLE to have so much wealth that they make the classifications for shit like oligopolies look like a joke, and most people (until late) have been more than fine with it.\n\nThe maximum wealth should be set at a decently high number, so people who work hard can still like lascivious lifestyles, but not so high people can buy whole fucking industries because they feel like it.",

When Nvidia would deliberately have sponsored games use features that ran worse on ATI/AMD (remember crysis 2 doing tessallation under the ground, where it wasn't even visible), people still bought nvidia. When the Nvidia FX series was an absolute disaster, being beaten in DX7 games by Geforce 3 cards, people bought the FX cards like their lives depended on it. Finally, when the GTX 970 had gimped ram (last 500mb out of 4gb were extremely slow), people still bought them like crazy.\n\nAnd even now, when we’re drowning in slop, somehow people still buy nvidia.\n\nWe (the consumers) put them on that throne, and we’re getting exactly what we deserve.",

While everyone adopted it and used it to share music, music became horribly devalued. Now it’s worth fractions of a penny per song and people treat it all like muzak. People consume it, but they don’t value it like it once was. Hardly anyone knows how valuable it was unless they were alive before the internet existed. \n\nThis is what AI is doing, but it’s much broader and damaging. Everything is just like dollar-store junk now: the work people are/were doing, the information that is/was developed/shared/expressed… everything AI touches is turned into vapid products then consumed and forgotten about.\n\nAnd to think I haven’t even mentioned the slop\n\nSure it has its uses, but the sell is really over stated when you consider the societal damage that’s left in its wake.",

(And they're destroying large stretches of farmland for Data centers.)\n\nAll the wealth is kept at the top 0.001% and AI is the reason you have mass stalking of people and used by ICE in the States using Palintir technology. \n\nAI is literally the greatest evil and danger to society as it is right now.\n\nSo spare me when the guy fueling AI is a little upset that people are pissed off about it.",

Reddit is an absolute shell of what it once was.\n\n* Is causing complete havoc on energy consumption and water usage to build AI data centers to support hypothetical projects that lead to improbable profits, while footing the bill on taxpayers. \n\n* Being used to enshitify every other fucking service or software. I thought Microsoft was doing rough in the mid-2000s, but what we're witnessing with copilot takes the cake.\n\n* Driving the cost of consumer hardware through the roof because supply is being reshifted to satisfy AI development, leading to extremely high-demand since consumers get the crumbs of what's available.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on.

If you tried uploading a photo of a child in any kind of sexual depiction to it, it won’t allow that. Even if it’s a teenager with a baby face. If you do upload a photo of an adult, you aren’t going to be able to make it strip her naked or do sexual things. All of your attempts will get moderated.\n\nNow here’s the important part: Grok has its own image generation. These images are far less restricted than uploaded ones (and most AI generators that allow nsfw content are like this). You still can’t make anything with genitals involved, but you can generate a woman and the make her take her shirt off and jiggle her boobs around. Grok knows it’s an AI image so it doesn’t care.\n\nIf you try to generate images of children in sexual situations, the process will fail. However, I’ve found in my experience that sometimes wires will get crossed and you can end up with an “adult woman” that looks a bit too young. I’ve never seen straight up children, but I have seen girls come across that looked like they could 14-15, etc. if that happens, I reload the gen. I’m not trying to make illegal shit… but that doesn’t mean others are so like minded.\n\nSo no, you can’t generate porn of an actual child, but you could generate an AI image of a woman that looks under age and possibly make sexual content with that image.",

The car was built for driving the working class to their factory jobs, not killing. We don't call out that cars should be banned when they are used incorrectly. We punish the human driving it. \n\nI don't like Grok or Elon or anything about the current rise of billionaire fascist pedos, but Grok is a tool. It can convince some people that it is a thinking machine but it really is still just predicting tokens. If a person asks it to generate something that is illegal to posses, let's blame the person? \n\nThat being said, Grok really needs more guardrails. My car has a pedestrian protection that slams on the brake if it detects a person in front of me. \n\nThe reason Grok is so unhinged is 2-fold. One reason is that fine-tuning a language model to be safer makes it dumber. Since Elon wants Grok to be the best and smartest AI, they have reduced the amount of safety tuning it does. \n\nThe other reason is that people keep getting Grok to say things that Elon doesn't like, so he has told his team to make Grok believe Elon's fantasy reality, which also makes Grok dumber. But it also makes Grok say dumb shit like Elon has elite athlete level fitness. \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

On one hand it is disgusting and unforgivable, but on the other hand it may reduce total harm done to children. However, my gut feeling is that by allowing AI to render such images we will be normalizing the act. The consequence of this is that more pedophiles will be drawn to CP and in turn there are more chances for children to be harmed. I fear the only way to stop CP is by making it culturally unacceptable and unforgivable.\n\nIn the world of AI, I think that we need to continue to push for stricter filtering on all models, not just the ones provided as a service (GROK) but also the open source models published throughout the internet.",

How will law enforcement be able to determine if the real child was harmed versus just their image being modified? \n\n It's super easy to use AI to change backgrounds, hiding the location used for abuse.

Film may be an even better example, some are fine with the formulaic commercial blockbuster spam of the MCU, but others wanna get weird with it like Everything Everywhere All At Once, AI definitely feels like it'll always lean into the former.\n\nEdit: Random thot but a lil surprised by how much this got downvoted.

And, with the artist furor over AI growing every day, it’s no surprise that the company has decided to take a stand against it. In a Reddit post, Bandcamp announced that AI-generated content would not be permitted on the platform and would be subject to removal.\n\n>The guidelines leave little room for interpretation. In the post, the company says that “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp.” It also prohibits using AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles, similar to a rule implemented by Spotify in September. The support team also encourages people to use the site’s reporting tool to flag any music that “appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI.”\n\n>In the thread, Bandcamp support also pointed people to the company’s Acceptable Use and Moderation policy page, which includes an explicit ban on scraping content or using audio uploaded to Bandcamp for training AI. It says that users agree, “Not to train any machine learning or AI model using content on our site or otherwise ingest any data or content from Bandcamp’s platform into a machine learning or AI model.”\n\n>Other platforms, such as Spotify and Deezer, have taken a much more conservative approach to combating AI-generated content, focusing primarily on imitation or relying on labels rather than bans. iHeartRadio pledged never to play AI-generated music or use AI DJs in late November. But Bandcamp is the first major music platform to outright ban AI-generated content.\n\nDirect link to Bandcamp's Blog Announcement: [https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/)",

Most modern music production, including major artists, relies heavily on virtual instruments, mainly for economic and productivity reasons.\n\nMusicians can’t suddenly be put in the position of creating music as if it were the 60s again. Everyone uses quantization, drum replacement, samples, time-shaping algorithms, MIDI arrangements for most percussive and string instruments, vocal harmonization tools, pitch correction, wave-shaping, etc. These are all algorithmic processes.\n\nSo where do we draw the line? Do we delete all music created in the last two decades? That feels like a pointless exercise to me. Avoiding AI detection is trivial anyway, Replacing stems with drums and bass from something like a Toontrack product and re-quantizing the MIDI would already make an AI-generated song extremely hard, or nearly impossible to detect. Just because someone clicked “generate” inside a DAW using a couple of tools, is that suddenly more valid?\n\nWith that said, I’m not a fan of fully prompted, end-to-end AI-generated songs. But I do think musicians are going in the wrong direction with this heated discussion. A more productive approach would be to clearly define when AI is being used as a production tool versus when it is generating a full song from scratch, and focus regulation and labeling there.\n\nBlanket bans like this feel disconnected and honestly a bit dishonest, compared to how music is actually made today. Unless people want to start making records on tape again.",

The fact that the term genocide has been given a new 'legal'  definition so Israel can be accused of it is a disgusting attempt at forcing a blood libel on Israel. Genocide is when you try to eradicate a race/people. The numbers prove Israel isn't doing that.\n\n\nFun fact, if Iran keeps mass murdering their own civilians at the current rate, they will have killed as many civilians in a few weeks as Israel has over 2 years. \n\n\nIran does beat Israel with a 100% civilian kill rate vs Israel's 40~",

Probably not since stores are constantly being closed down. But I’ll be generous and say it’s worth a $1 billion. So that’s $5b net assets /$9.5 market cap = 53 cents on the dollar for $1 invested. \n\nSo you can invest in a hedge fund where $1 = $1, or GameStop where $1 = 53 cents. \n\nI don’t think Ryan Cohen would be a good enough investor compared to actual real hedge fund managers to justify paying almost twice the value of the assets in the fund.",

The margins are too low for most stuff to satisfy Wall Street and the used resale game is just a form of arbitrage that frankly GameStop were never all that good at. All the subsequent attempts to pivot (ThinkGeek, Funco, etc.) were never going to be long-term answers. Stuff like PowerPacks seems like it might work for a while-- there are no shortage of people who are down to gamble recklessly-- but even that seems to have a determinate shelf life. Not sure how GameStop's gonna manage this transition, but as more stores the back-end infrastructure to support the remaining ones is going to make less and less sense. I'd guess in three years, maybe four, GameStop doesn't have any physical locations left. Cohen's deal is almost entirely incentive-based, so I don't have much issue with that. If he's actually able to drive the results needed (he almost certainly won't), he'll have earned that money.",

They were brutal about hours to the point that our manager made us work off the clock for 15-30 minutes after closing because they didn’t account for any closing tasks in labor. There could be major releases with a line out the door and at most they’d staff 1-2 employees. They only care about selling memberships and Gameinformer magazine. I definitely like gaming enough as a hobby to go peruse a physical location and I’d even buy some gaming swag here and there but shopping at GameStop is such a miserable experience.",

They make it impossible to buy by condition on their website “loose vs CIB” etc. \n3. Their website is so hard to search for things you actually want and can be delivered or picked up at a certain store.\n4. They keeping getting the rights to some pretty cool physical pre order bonuses (steel books etc.) but then have have a massive shortage of supply and have no mechanisms to ensure they go to the right people. And when they run out, they tell the people who also pre ordered to get fucked. \n5. Not sure if they do this anymore but they used to throw away tons of cases for games to save space.\n\nI think if they want to turn things around they have to appeal to collectors and retro enthusiasts but I think they’ve burned so many bridges there I’m not sure they can.

Until we don't change our collective mentality from trying to assign and shift blame to actually figuring out ways to cooperatively find ways to make the world a better place, this fascist cancer will remain untamed.\n\nCase in point, we're having a presidential election here in Portugal on Sunday, and the fascist leader of the far right populist group is leading the polls, in a context of a Venezuela invasion and threats to take Greenland by force. And you know what's funny? This year marks the 100th anniversary of the military ku that was supposed to fix the problems of loss of authority of republican institutions in our early democracy after the first world war, and accidentally ended up with an oppressive authoritarian regime taking over in 1933 that lasted until another military ku in 1974 restored democracy.",

You can \"see what you will get\" before you choose to proceed.\n\nAs a comparison, Windows install media only allows you to install Windows. You are not able to \"try out\" anything in advance of installation.",

The point isn't making long-term profit from their number of schemes of over-pricing, artificial scarcity, planned obsolescence, reg capture, or addiction. They aren't truly (pretending to) provide US with a service in exchange for any form of data or payment (studies constantly prove no one cares about Ai). That is not where the money is coming from. They are instead crashing and burning everything they can gambling in the stock market to rush out before the last sucker and make bank. We are ruled by evil pedophile villains that literally no one elected. They sit on top of human organizations, fire everyone who's not a pedophile and steal infinite money from the organization. This system needs to end. They all \"caved\" to the current administration because their incentive structure BEGS them every day to be corrupt in all of the same ways. To see us as cattle where their job is to put every resource they have towards taking more and more from us than they give back. It's fundamentally incompatible with democracy. It's a ideology that sees democracy as a obstacle.\n\nSo they love being able to tell fellow investors the story that they will be able to replace us all with Ai, and pay no one, or at least have an excuse to begin a very profitable venture, firing sprees. But it's overwhelmingly just them finding an excuse to pass money between one another yet again. If we had made arrests after 2008 and refused to bail anyone out, this system would've lasted us a bit longer, buisnesses would be a bit more frugal like they are in Japan. And until they are held accountable to law like the rest of us, we will continue to see them increase and increase abuse and exploitation of us. And if we don't defang them entirely by having their position subject to regular elections, once we hold them accountable, (the most successful of them) will sit slowly chipping away at the laws like they've spent the last 80 years doing after the buisness plot failed, and they failed to kill Fdr. While every decent hearted person on earth will be grinded into the dirt. I fear for a human population that is subject to this system once brain implants are perfected, some private company gets leverage over our brains directly, we will never recover, they will languish in their unaccountable godhood where they can do no wrong and every imperfection is our fault while the world decays around ALL of us. We will continue watching it while feeling guilt without ANY of the economic power to address it. And these ppl use their power to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions, they continue with their pedophilia while destroying everything and feeling NO guilt whatsoever.",

          "text": "TL;DR: You aren't the problem. They are. Stop letting them treat you like the problem. Continue to call it shit and asking them to be better. \n\n\nI am seeing quite a few comments asking why and while I am no professional or expert in why this is happening. \n\n\nMy working theory is exposure. My best guess is Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI are seeing loss in profits because it is expensive and the cost can't be out weight by the use or the demand. \n\n\nIE servers and connections are expensive. Negative response has reduced the amount of users they want to see adopting but the end goal problem is more users means more cost. So the cost of use or subscriptions would have to go up but can't because current use would plummet and cost would outweigh demand. \n\n\nThey are seeing this in the RAM shortage and GPU shortage because Dell now feels A.I. isn't the future and is backing away proving to Microsoft, \"hey guys your OS is getting worse, people are now looking for alternatives, and A.I. as the solution just isn't one. \n\n\nThis impacts NVIDIA'S market share as well. If you aren't buying a machine or interested in A.I. then the RAM shortage and GPU cost aren't being justified by A.I. we are starting to see numbers show a big problem and these CEOs and big tech companies aren't sharing everything going on but investors are now seeing an issues with adoptions.\n\n\nThe systems aren't getting enough adoption. Money isn't flowing, and adoption rates and usage are slowing down. So how do you spin this? You blame the public. Easy as that, \"well mr consumer if you would stop being so negative others would use it and it would get better.\" \n\n\nBut it isn't and the systems are faltering and I think companies are seeing a problem and trying to blame use but are now starting to sweat.\n\n\nI think our A.I. market pop is coming a lot sooner than later and these companies are seeing the writing on the wall now and are realizing they have to now establish the narrative it isnt us...it is the consumer mr investor and mr bank. If people were just more positive it would have worked.\n\n\nSo when people stop using your product less you start to go, \"how can we say adoption is up and they are using it more. How can we expose the average user to use this.\" Obviously, you implement it in everything everywhere. For Google this is somewhat working. Gemini just makes sense on your phone it isn't overly intrusive but it is there as a side toggle and option. Is it still annoying it is in every Google product? Hell yes but is it optional and not hitting me in every app to interact and engage with it with no toggle to turn it off? No.\n\n\nI work for an organization and right now we genuinely have people complaining they can't turn Copilot off in Excel. We don't have the licenses for them to use it but yet Excel pushes it. So these employees get a prompt to engage but really can't fully do so. So it is just an annoying on product advert and all it does is annoy said employees to the point they don't even want it.\n\n\nSure enough Microsoft has no toggle to turn this engagement pop up off. It is literally Microsoft trying to get people to go, \"oh well maybe I want Copilot\" but instead the opposite reaction is happening, \"I just want to open Excel and move on.\" \n\n\nCoPilot isnt selling and they see it and are now freaking out but if they put it in everything you can't ignore it there for you may embrace it or try to use it or maybe it sucks in something else but if it sticks in File Explorer then mission accomplished.\n\n\nPoint being, now they need to point fingers because they don't understand why no one is interested. These companies have lost all touch with consumer realty. They thought A.I. would be the up and coming next big tech trend and it is or was for awhile but now we are seeing negative press and we are seeing the problems it causes and going, \"maybe my job is on the line next in this market.\" Or \" I just want to play a game. Why do I need an A.I. in my game or my spreadsheet?\"\n\n\nI think Gemini has been received better because Google has been transparent about its use and it feels like this passive assistant that is just there when something crosses my mind. It isnt perfect and I am not defending Gemini because it isn't great being in every little thing either.\n\n\nI think it is, however, to compare their use cases and compare why one is being received in a different lighting than another because that emphasizes what a consumer does want or prefer. \n\n\nThe problem is it is aggressively being shoved into things while the main product you are consuming is getting worse. Windows 11 performance is worse than ever. GPU costs and tech cost in general are insane and these companies only have to blame themselves. You can't tell me my PC can't move to Win 11 or my RAM and GPU can't use your product so I must upgrade my tech to use it but then he shocked when the use of said product has made the tech difficult to buy for someone that can't afford it then continued to be shocked when I am sticking to Windows 10 and not using CoPilot because you genuinely fucked the system to be that way.\n\n\nThese companies have no one to blame but themselves don't let them point fingers at you for being angry. Point the fingers back and say, \"it is shit and I am continuing to say it is shit until you back track on where you went wrong and do something differently.\" \n\n\nMake a product, stop being aggressive and slow include it if you want a more well rounded and received view of a product rather than letting the main component of your product fall behind. It is like NVIDIA and Microsoft want Linux and AMD to just take the market.",
