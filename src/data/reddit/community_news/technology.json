We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on. Every \"safety\" feature that requires unmasking is another brick in the wall of a corporate panopticon that would make Bentham blush.",

They re-strategize and re-release. This is a PR stunt meant to quiet the angry masses. If you are concerned with your privacy, you should definitely get rid of your cameras. The only reason we haven’t is because we cannot yet afford to replace them, so yanking them right now would create an even greater security risk. They have really screwed up with this though by leaving people like us in this situation. There is still going to be litigation on this regardless of what they say",

Reolink can handle this for you, and a lot of people are comfortable with that for the convenience. Their app is also better than the standalone IP camera viewer apps I've tried.",

You can even install home assistant for free on an old computer - completely local and doesn’t even need to be connected to the internet.\n4.\t⁠⁠Delete your ring account.\n\n**Do NOT passively support ICE or the US federal government subjugating your neighbours and community, do NOT allow them the ease of access to a turnkey nationwide surveillance system to further enable a police state.**\n\nEdit: For the knuckledragging cavemen below *“Wah it’s toooo hard”.* No… it’s really not. If you want dead simple, there’s options for the average tech-fearing Luddite.

You can also build your own home server or use an old PC (almost anything can run HA!) and install HA for free. This is a starting point for full local control of your smarthome ecosystem. Highly configurable - but you dont need to if you want to keep it basic.\n\nThen paired with the Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 (there’s several other great options too!) - allows local storage on-device and connects to HA, but you can upload to a local NAS storage with HomeAssistant. Aqara is very easy to setup and get working with HA - just plug-and-play.",

I downloaded the app, made an account and used it for a while, but eventually stopped looking at it because I don’t really need to see videos of my driveway.  \nFast forward to this ad, which made me want to be sure I’ve disconnected the camera from the Internet. I downloaded the app and tried to log in. Even though I had my password, it insisted on sending a code via email. But then the email said I was using a different device so I would have to “verify”\nMy account. Keep in mind I already have a password and the ability to receive a code through my verified email.\nTurns out the only ways I can get into the account now are to give them a copy of my government ID, or let them do a biometrical scan of my face.\nI’m considering just ripping the camera down.",

And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

We're learning that our gut biome is likely where our circadian rhythms are based.  We're learning that there is a serious correlation between the evolution of the gut biome and the development of intelligence, as we've learned that the gut actually plays a core role in decision making and sends signals directly to the brain.\n\nIt's such a shame that a tool such as this, one of the dumbest kennedies, can come in and gaslight about nutrition which in turn leaves many people rolling their eyes about any sort of nutritional advice at all.",

Grok suggests 3 eggs for breakfast, a 4th egg as a snack and more protein from lunch and dinner. The protein servings are lower for everyone else. It does suggest like 8 teaspoons of butter or olive oil per day to get your health fats in which is weird, but overall not egregious because it also notes that healthy fats exist within some foods already like avocados for example.",

The new recommendation is still lower than most people recommend for optimal muscle growth while engaged in regular resistance training.\n\n>The new guidance maintains daily fiber recommendations, which are generally 25 g for women and 38 g for men. But Grok’s “realistic” estimate for fiber in its meal plan had a range of 25 to 35 grams, falling short for men.\n\nSo you ask for a 2,000 calorie example diet, and it falls marginally short of the recommendation for men, who typically eat more than 2,000 calories? Upping it to 2,500 would put the fiber at 31-44g. There's plenty of reasons to criticize RFK's health recommendations, but you undercut your point with crap like this.",

I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

The right consistently puts other people in serious physical danger.

Pre compliance and collaboration with fascists in power has always been a hallmark of big businesses throughout history, and that’s one of the most powerful dangers of fascism. Other powered people will comply because fascism benefits those who ride along in the short term. CBS thinks it can slip in and get some oarks (or avoid some penalties) by cozying up to the ghouls in power, because they assume none of us will care or remember in the long term. \n\nI hope we all make them eat that arrogantm unamerican assumption; but I fear that we won’t. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8x1oSGb/",

During Reagan's presidential runs in 1980 and 1984 they basically shut down broadcasting of his movies, but they were also strict on liberal presenting media around this time. However, over time several exceptions were made, one being that talk shows can be exempted on a case by case basis. In practice, over the years talk show interviews became pretty much exempted by default. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George Bush, Guiliani, Bernie, Harris, Desantis, Ramaswamy, Haley etc etc have all been on talk shows during campaigns. However, the 'case by case basis' nature of the exemption is a huge flaw and now being weaponized by this administration.",

While about two-thirds of executives reported using AI, that usage amounted to only about 1.5 hours per week, and 25% of respondents reported not using AI in the workplace at all.

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation. \n\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w34836",

Few coders need to rewrite the cout functionality in C++, just import from the standard library, but there are many cases where I've needed to design something myself instead of relying on a library that does something like what I'm aiming for.\n\nAnother part about this -- the decline in significant hardware performance increases for end user hardware. It forces software developers to stop assuming every increasing hardware capability can makeup for sloppy and inefficient code -- forces us to actually go back and optimize things.",

Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.\n\nLOL, I just LOVE that they make the connection to 1987 and folks wondering why the computer revolution hadn't happened yet.  We humans always expect change to be this dramatic thing, same as now with articles about AI replacing all jobs by the end of 2024.  LOL.  That's not how new technology rolls out.  It's slower and more gradual.\n\nAnd yes, in 1987, we weren't even in the infancy of computer age yet.  Same as we are today with LLMs.",

          "text": "I managed a large design engineering group in the 1990s, and participated in the computerization of the workplace.  I saw the mentioned result first hand.   I expect the implementation of AI will follow a similar path.\n\nTLDR: At the start, computerization was simply an additional cost.   It took years to show actual productivity increases.  \n\nWe had Sun workstations, Macs and MS DOS machines. A campus wide VAX was used for document generation, FORTRAN programs (yes, we used those a lot) and embedded code assembly. \n\n1) The Sun stations allowed us to tackle more complex designs, but there was actually resistance to depending upon the CAD capabilities of the workstations.  Macs immediately improved productivity some and required little IT support, but were expensive.  When an engineer got an MS DOS machine, the engineer went off line for about 6 weeks fighting incompatibilities and other snags.  Didn't happen with MACs or the VAX. The VAX was interesting in that every character you typed was sent to the central campus processor, and returned to your display to be presented.  The VAX line printers were scary in their ability to print huge paper documents in minutes.  Printing using the other computers was an adventure you tried to avoid.\n\n2) During the early 1990s, it was not externally detectable that an engineering firm had computerized by looking at productivity until much later than projected.  I believe it was 1995, I can't remember exactly. \n\n3) Computerization allowed lower level engineers to accomplish tasks that previously required higher level engineering experience.  Experienced engineers quickly became less valuable, even if they became computer literate.   The productivity difference between top and bottom became smaller.  By the late 1990s, the manhours required to implement a task dropped in half, mostly due to integration of modern methods enabled by computerization, not just the use of computers to do the same tasks.\n\n4) In the beginning, existing work was not computerized.  Instead, new computerized tasks were added which frankly, experienced engineers and secretaries didn't really need to get their jobs done. So computerization started out as an additional task/cost.  We were in our second or third generation before manual operations were completely supplanted and improvements were clearly visible.\n\n5)  One contract manufacturer we worked with had an interesting approach.  They maintained their paper based facility, but built a completely new computer based facility that would no longer depend on conventional paper prints or documents.  You could get bids from both.  The results depended upon how computerized the documentation you provided was.  If your inputs were compatible with their computerized manufacturing process, their quotes were lower and their quality was better.",

So I ask him why and he said “every job we walk there’s 20 company’s trying to bid for it, and they all show up with iPads. They’re using CHATGPT for their quotes and scopes” \nSaid they’re all like 20-30 year olds, and they’re losing work to them, but my opinion? Which has been my opinion since I started doing sales? Let the other guy have a job or 2, and come back to me when I need to fix his mistakes and the client won’t even like it. Happens everytime! But bro, ROOFS?! You’re talking permits, warranties, warranty inspections, city inspections, insurance policies, CALIFORNIA. These are Bay Area buildings on their 3rd roof, that’s at least a 50 year old building. Company’s come in from other states for bidding. This shit makes no sense. They all fail, they all take bigger bites than they can chew. They don’t know the climate of the area, what to look out for, what California will NEVER let you do, especially in some counties I’ve seen companies kicked off a job mid way through because of their lack of understanding and respect. They all lose their ass in the end. It’s really just a ticking time bomb until building owners that have used cheap work too long and dumb company’s realize their building are fixed with straw and gum, warranted by a prayer and trying to sell it before it comes tumbling down into a heap of garbage. Insurance companies dipped like 3 years ago from here and now I’m sure it’s because of the boom of contractors and their instant needs of a claim that were beyond their ability to afford.

Now half the time they send random people in cars that see that I'm in an apartment complex, send a message saying \"How do I get in?\" and then *immediately* mark that they couldn't get in. Then they drive off before I can even get outside.\n\nAnd searching for ANYTHING other than the most specific brands gives you a hundred results of the same product under fake company names. If I want to use AliExpress, I'll use AliExpress. If Amazon slaughtered 95% of the listings on the site it would be far more usable. I'm willing to spend ever so slightly more money on legitimate and durable products. If they just curated their own storefront then I'd buy way more stuff.",

It will be less convenient, yes, but Bezos's gutting of the WaPo made his skeazy support of fascism so public and obvious, I just can't stand the taste in my mouth anymore. Amazon itself has become garbage anyway. Search is ridiculously broken and you can't trust reviews or products anymore. In 2026, I will strive to not support billionaires, fascists, or their toadies in any way. I plan to literally just deprogram CBS in May the day after Colbert's last show. Removing it from my free channel lineup and informing the local affiliate and their advertisers of why. Sinclair can bite my ass. I'll miss some NFL games next season, ah well. If I could dump Paramount + I would, happily. Hoping half of America does. Eat. The. Rich.",

The tonal shift in the company from Bezos (still a dickhead) to Jassy was so noticeable: fear of layoffs, anti-employee RTO and comp policies, tracking badge swipes and time in office. The guy has no creativity other than to 'drive efficiency' after he made specific decisions that made the company inefficient to begin with (bureaucracy, over hiring, etc.).\n\nThe guy has got to go. I know I sound like (and am to an extent) a disgruntled employee, but I got out after the most recent slate of layoffs for a remote job where people take themselves far less seriously.\n\nThis AI race to the bottom Jassy is engaging with will be his end and will probably hamper Amazon's ability to grow or be successful at all in the coming years. People compare him to Ballmer, and I'm starting to really believe this is the current era this company is in.",

I mean the only possible way to survive such an accusation is if you just happened to be being recorded on video and the framer doesn't have the power to replace the legitimate video of you not committing conspiracy to commit terrorism with an AI video of you typing on your phone.",

Discord has a huge number of customers having more or less cornered the VOIP market for gaming related activities, notice how discord already links to various game accounts, and to twitch, and it has always had overlays showing what game you're currently playing, which means it is collecting all that Data, and that Data is valuable.\n\nDiscord wants to look as valuable as possible so they can make a lot of money selling the company piece by tiny piece, and they've already been forced to implement ID verification in several countries, so they have the perfect excuse, they say they won't sell your data, but that's not a contract just a promise with no garauntee other than their word, and if someone else like microsoft for instance decided to quietly purchase a controlling share, well they never even promised not to sell your data.\n\nThis is just a combination of greed and stupidity, Discord picked a singularly bad moment to try this shit given what's going on in the world given wider political and consumer confidence issues which make the public much less trusting, but in a calmer moment in history this wouldn't have blown up nearly as much.",

And there's no reason at all to use any of those as forum replacements.  Hell, even reddit would make a better curated forum platform than discord.  The only thing even slightly unique about Discord is the way it broke things out into searchable channels and topics.  \n  \nDiscord only really exists because it got momentum and maybe even a bit of brand loyalty from a group of people who have never really had to migrate between internet services before, so the whole thing just comes off as a bit amusing to people from the ICQ/AIM/mIRC era.",

For most of the world, privacy-abusing and pointless face verification isn't required by law, and a lot of people will not put up with it-- the question is how many people won't put up with it and whether it's justly fatal to the company.

My experience is that very few people are actually talking about where they are going to migrate to, which signals to me that most people are here to be outraged and not do anything about it. If people actually cared, these posts would have tons of people discussing where to migrate their social circles to.\n\nMaybe I'm just a dinosaur that remembers the days of having TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and Skype all installed to play with different friend groups. Discord has been awfully convenient for consolidating the different gamer groups, but for me, the time has come to move on and return to the days of having multiple platforms installed to keep in touch.

So essentially before even going public with SpaceX Musk is already clearing his Twitter Debt. I think before he did the same with xAI, he used it's \"value\" to buy up Twitter debt. \n\nSo time line, buys twitter, doesn't pay for it directly but has a bunch of bank loans and collateral from Tesla and SpaceX. Starts xAI and uses that to \"buy\" twitter and xAI assumes all it's debt and \"separates\" himself from the Twitter debt, so now his Tesla and SpaceX are \"safe\" \n\nIn the final act what he did recently he merged xAI to SpaceX and he's using SpaceX's insane valuation to avoid paying the actual cash debt of Twitter. Just kicking the can down the road, like margin purchasing on steroids. I'm guessing he's hoping SpaceX is hyped and just starts trading at overvalued levels so he can further leverage it to push off the debt further. ",

Based on Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed the fleet reached roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the outlet estimates the fleet likely surpassed 800,000 miles by mid-January. With 14 crashes in that time period, that comes out to roughly one crash every 57,000 miles.\n\nEven by Tesla’s own metrics, that’s not great. ",

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

Some people can't hear distortion or artifacts, but most professional mixing engineers are not full of shit and can absolutely tell when a master has been over compressed or destroyed by multiple different things. \n\nCables, amps, and playback hardware is MUCH less important than whatever happened to audio up to that point. Recording equipment, audio file formats etc are much more important than your phone's DA converter. As long as you don't have random RC circuits or *very* poor impedance matching along your signal chain, it's hard to tell small changes.\n\nThe difference between the lossy compression formats at highest quality settings and lossless formats is negligible perceptually, though very significant for other reasons (actual loss of information, changes to some transients etc).\n\nMost audiophiles have a very superficial understanding of audio technologies, AD/DA technology and why some things matter and others don't. They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable. Almost like some type of *soul* in audio signals. It's pure nonsense. We can mathematically debunk most of that but grifters gonna grift I guess.",

              "text": "I consider myself an Audiophile, and I agree that it is almost entirely about the speakers… as long as they speakers are fed from a quality source (amp and/or DSP amp). It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

The power cable affects nothing, yet audiophiles will spend 150x more for a power cable claiming to prevent audio interruptions that don’t exist. In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it. Yet audiophiles are claiming that the conductor used between the two changes the sound, and this study shows that to be a lie.",

All the effort went into ensuring good connections, wire was sufficient gauge, and amps had enough continuous and peak power.   Most of the money was spent on the microphones used (a phased array) for testing.\n\n\nAll that said, audio \"quality\" is a subjective measure, just like food flavor, IMHO.  Our perception is modified by so much. \n\n\nMy favorite \"personal\" experiment was blind testing CD vs 320kbps mp3s where I had my son randomly choose one version and then the other version of songs while I listened.  I went 9 for 10 in identifying them.\n\n\nNext, I did the same but didn't A/B the same songs and instead did it fully random.   I guessed right on 11 of 20.\n\n\nNone of that is scientifically valid, but it highlights advice I give when people ask me, which is that if it sounds good to you,  it is good!",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

Conversely, better cables are meant to better withstand nose. Does everyone need a better cable? No. But do they wanna go through the asspain of cheaping out on, for example, an in-wall or large home theater installation only to find they need to redo it?",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

My examples are what I use and have setup for friends and family for years. You can get remote access many ways that exclude anyone but you from accessing.\n\nI chose Reolink because I did not want to be forced to use an app to connect or have to use a products app to view. I used both Foscams and Amcrest cams until they made it nearly impossible to view or setup without using a proprietary app. Now most of the cams will \"phone home\" many times, hence the reason for a separate IoT vlan. If your router does not have that ability, look into setting up pi-hole, a fantastic full house ad/popup blocker, of course open source. I know it can be overwhelming if you're not into the tech, but to make it easier there are plenty of good sites that will walk you through setting this up and chatgpt or claude can be invaluable.

You can buy doorbell cameras that only work on your network.",

          "text": "\nIt is about Abuse of Power so people shouldn’t try to split hairs over a very serious issue. As time goes on it is the Database it builds that becomes increasingly a threat to personal rights. I feel bad for those people that don’t maturely make their own inquiries to see that this is very real. Abuses & violations of individual rights are happening almost daily. You just have to be brave and research it or continue living with your head in the sand. It wont be long til someone comes along and smacks you in your ass.\n\nI’ll give you a head start:\n\nhttps://www.wjfw.com/news/flock-safety-faces-privacy-concerns-cancelled-contracts-across-u-s/article_a9671d6e-014d-4c4c-b726-cd5be21a037e.html\n\nSummary Flock Safety, a company operating tens of thousands of surveillance cameras across the U.S., faces privacy concerns and contract cancellations. Critics argue the company’s AI-powered cameras infringe on privacy rights and lack public consent, while security flaws and unauthorized use have raised further concerns. Despite these issues, some law enforcement agencies continue to support their contracts with Flock Safety.\n\nhttps://www.blackrosefed.org/benn-jordan-interview/\n\nSummary Benn Jordan, a musician and audio engineer, discusses his interest in surveillance technologies, sparked by the prevalence of Flock Safety cameras in Atlanta. He highlights vulnerabilities in Flock’s systems, including unprotected Android devices and potential for misuse. Jordan advocates for privacy practices like lying online and resisting data collection, and emphasizes the importance of DIY projects to empower individuals and foster innovation.\n\nExcerpt: There are a lot of vulnerabilities. I believe over 70 at this point. In my opinion, the most concerning one is that the cameras and compute boxes are unprotected Android devices. I could push a button 3 times on a Falcon and it’ll give me a WiFi access point to connect to. From there, it takes a matter of seconds to infiltrate the device to access the video footage, data, and even some of the server credentials. What’s much worse is that I can “root” the device, which means that I can have control of it outside of the operating system.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/video/2026/01/06/staunton-resident-files-petition-ordinance-banning-license-plate-readers/\n\nSTAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - After the City of Staunton announced its’s canceling its contract with Flock Safety, the company behind the license-plate–reading software that popped up over the last year, some residents rejoiced, but others in the Queen City said more still needs to be done.\n\nLastly, Here’s an Ai internet scrape of examples:\n\nInvestigations by privacy advocacy groups and news organizations in 2025 and early 2026 have exposed multiple instances of law enforcement misusing the Flock Safety camera system, which operates a vast network of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) across the United States. Here are examples of articles and reports exposing these abuses, categorized by type of misuse:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Surveillance Related to Reproductive Rights and Abortion \"A Texas Cop Searched License Plate Cameras Nationwide for a...\" (Truthout/404 Media): This report detailed how a Johnson County, Texas, deputy used the Flock system to conduct a nationwide search, logging the reason as \"had an abortion, search for female\". The investigation highlighted how cross-state data sharing puts abortion seekers at risk. \"Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose...\" (University of Washington Human Rights Center): This analysis discussed how Texas law enforcement tracked a woman who had self-administered an abortion, with data generated by Flock networks in Washington state.\n2.\t⁠⁠Personal Stalking and Harassment by Officers \"Georgia police chief, arrested for using Flock cameras for stalking...\" (Lookout): This article reports on the arrest of a Braselton, Georgia, police chief for allegedly using the city's Flock cameras to stalk and harass private citizens.\n\n\"Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says\" (NBC News): This article highlights a lawsuit regarding a Virginia police department using the system to track a specific driver hundreds of times.\n\n\"Wisconsin Case Exposes Misuse of Flock Traffic Cameras by Police Officers\" (Yahoo News/Wisconsin Examiner): A Menasha police officer was charged with misconduct in office for using the department's Flock system to search for vehicles belonging to a private individual.\n\n\"Police Surveillance is Ripe for Abuse\" (ACLU of Wisconsin): Reports on a former Kansas police chief who used cameras to track his ex-girlfriend 228 times and a North Charleston officer who used them to track his estranged wife.\n\n3. Biased Policing and Profiling \"EFF's Investigations Expose Flock Safety's Surveillance Abuses: 2025 in Review\" (Electronic Frontier Foundation): An analysis found that over 80 law enforcement agencies used the Flock network to conduct searches using racial slurs and biased language, targeting the Romani community without evidence of specific crimes.\n\n\"Flock Enables Surveillance of Protesters\" (EFF): The same report documents how law enforcement used the system to track participants in various political demonstrations.\n\n4. Unauthorized Data Sharing and Immigration \"Flock's Aggressive Expansions Go Far Beyond Simple Driver Surveillance\" (ACLU): This article exposes how local law enforcement has used Flock data to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in immigration enforcement, violating sanctuary policies in some regions.\n\n\"Mountain View, California, pulled the plug on its entire license plate reader camera network\" (Malwarebytes): Following investigations, this report details how Flock cameras were sharing data with federal agencies without the city's permission.\n\n5. Inaccurate Investigations and Privacy Risks \"Public Interest Law Firm Responds to Flock Safety Pausing Federal...\" (Institute for Justice): This article discusses a federal lawsuit against Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the use of Flock cameras, noting that the system captured, \"photos of an innocent family's driveway and part of their front yard every time a vehicle drove by\".\n\nThese reports have led to nearly 30 jurisdictions cancelling or refusing to renew their Flock Safety contracts in 2025–2026, citing privacy violations, surveillance overreach, and illegal data sharing.",

The demand for (lower) middle class life outstrips the real job market 1:10 already.

A human being with a notes app is more reliable than any AI I’ve used. And that’s not coming from an AI hater- I use it several hours a day. I also spend a ton of that time being pissed off at how lazy, imprecise, and stupid it can be.",

Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily.

When students retain the basic information conveyed during lectures, they are able to moved more quickly onto the application, analysis, evaluation of the content and later creation of media and concepts using that content. \n\nThis is evident in elementary students up to post graduates. I even saw the difference in my education myself. During undergrad, I used a laptop and took notes on that in the classes that allowed but moved on to regular notebook paper by junior and senior year, choosing to transfer the notes from my handwritten notebooks to typed files simply to maintain the information in a better to read format later. The handwriting made it much easier to gather the information and the subsequent transferring to digital documents further cemented the knowledge so that I barely had to study before tests. \n\nHowever, during grad school, about 8 years later, I didn’t want to get a laptop so my partner had bought me an iPad Pro second hand. I had iPads in the past and never used them, but the iPad Pros had just introduced the Apple Pencils which completely revolutionized the iPad for me. I took all my notes on the notability app (I believe). I was quickly able to switch between pen and marker colors and really define how I was organizing my notes as I took them. I didn’t feel the need to rewrite them in a digital document because it had the ability to convert what I wrote. I should also note that most of my courses in grad school were music theory and high level analysis, so it wouldn’t have been a help to retype these things. \n\nBut I retained that information and was able to review it so much better than I ever had been able to with typed notes. I’m not saying this is an absolute fact of learning, but studies support my claim. \n\nAnd when I was teaching, students would complain about their struggles to learn concepts. I would ask to see their notes. I was so surprised to learn that they did absolutely everything on their Chromebooks - and the kicker was that most of the teachers simply gave them their lecture outlines instead of making them notate the content down. By doing that, you aren’t making the students do ANYTHING to obtain the information. It’s like handing them a textbook and asking them to put it under their pillow at night to learn by osmosis. Not to mention the textbooks were all now on the chromebooks.",

My kids come home asking about things they should not know about. Wtf? If you are using google classroom why are their ads in YouTube?

While the teachers are busy spending time working with other kids, mine spend 2 hours a day reading. 2 hours of screen time reading. Not reading content the teacher prescribes but reading whatever they want like “graphic novels”, also known as comic books. The school developed AR goals for the kids to justify all the reading but its all bullshit. Its a pacifier thats being justified.\n\nKids spend 6 hours in school. 1 hour lunch/recess. 1 hour special. 2 hours reading. Teachers only teach maybe 2 hours.

Well yes, that will happen when you change how you measure success. \n\nBest part was a few weeks ago when my 11 year old tells me the teacher taught them how to start writing by using chatgpt to help them. \n\nSo I completely agree with the many many articles that are highlighting a very bad situation in elementary education right now. I like the parents mentioned in the article plan to meet with the supe and hand him these fucking ipads and tell him to start doing his job. ",

It requires giving your brain a challenge to overcome. f you remove the challenge, you reduce the opportunity for real learning. But because the computer makes it easier to produce \"work,\" you end up with students creating products and completing assessments in a way that indicates \"knowledge,\" but that mostly shortcuts around the process of actual learning.\n\nGreat for grade books, terrible for humanity.\n\nEdit: By \"one to one\" I mean one computer per child, which was a big movement that took off while I was teaching. It happened super fast, and within a decade or so we're starting see massive pushback because educators, employers, etc. are finally starting to see the results and the results are catastrophic.

In general I've become a tech-luddite who rails against AI, mandatory chromebooks, and constant screen time, but this opt-out approach bugs me too. \n\nChromebooks do have some advantages over pencil & paper - they support differentiated education (via adaptive math programs, for example), offer multimedia opportunities like slideshow creation, and can support remote learning during inclement weather (in the southeast we just had two straight weeks of school closure thanks to the arctic vortex). Of course, none of these examples supports always being on chromebooks for every class all the time, but they have a time and place that blanket opt-outs can't address. \n\nI think we're at a critical point where community pushback can moderate technology use in schools, but I also think opting out at an individual level is on balance a bad approach that can disadvantage/ostracize students working in an existing curriculum and puts a huge burden on already overworked teachers to create completely distinct education models for individual kids. \n\n",

Both tech and curriculum for schools is entirely designed to make money and very, very little to do with actually educating children. \n\nThe research put into most curriculum is minimal and same with the piloting. They don't even properly edit their manuals. If we're paying $2k per grade level, I expect perfection from the company producing the phonics curriculum. \n\nUnqualified people (curriculum directors) purchase curriculum and tech for entire districts. These are bought from companies that have unqualified people, just a customer sales agent, pushing cookie cutter products. These products are often not well researched and developed. They are blatant money grabs and these companies will slap on the latest labels to attract the unqualified curriculum directors. Ex: Science of Reading being put on everything now. If you're an educator and know just a smidge of SOR, you can easily see through the bs. \n\nYSK: if your district has a curriculum director or curriculum coaches (DON'T even get me started on these leeches), you should petition to remove those positions. They are high paying positions and they do not improve student experience or outcomes. They do put additional pressure on teachers by increasing demands and reducing hands-on support. Your tax money is being pissed away and your kids education is getting worse. Your average principal has zero control over this. Go straight to your boards and superintendent.",

It’s mainly about $$$ and time, not education.\n\nSchool districts don’t have to buy textbooks because they can assemble a mishmash of YouTube and PowerPoint materials for instruction.  \n\nTeachers don’t have to grade tests and write comments.  Everything is mainly multiple choice (even in high school!) and they let things be auto graded.   Most of the time students can’t even see what they missed since kids in other classes haven’t taken the test.   \n\nThey don’t get the hand written comments in red ink showing why their answer is wrong.\n\nNo more signed progress reports and parent involvement.  They can look if they’re interested but aren’t required to do so.\n\nHell, the online platforms can’t even average grades properly.  Not sure if they do batch processing or what, but  4 100s and 1 80/100 don’t average to 100/100 under any type of sane weighting, even with rounding.\n\n\nIf all of this was to support larger class sizes, it’d be one thing.  But not even that.   My elementary school classes were double the size of what’s allowed today and the teachers did everything by hand — even the gradebook.  But we had actual books,  they actually taught, and we wrote paragraph answers on test questions.   (No, we didn’t use washboards then!)\n\nSchool districts today are more interested in raising the lowest quartile slightly than teaching the upper quartile.    Maybe that’s equity but for education it sucks…",

          "text": "***TL;DR:*** *High school daughter has flourished when switching to books and handwritten notes (at a private school) from the typical 1:1 learning when she was in 4th-8th grade.*\n\nDad here of a current 10th grader. My wife and I ended up putting our daughter into private school a few years ago. It wasn't because of the teachers, or the curriculum. It was because classwork, reading, homework, projects, everything was entirely swallowed by tech. Our daughter did not do well with a 1:1 device.\n\nFrom the 4th grade through 8th grade, almost everything was electronically completed. She had teachers that did teach, but it was often taught from some electronic platform, which maybe additional white-board writing for further explanations.\n\nIn general though, things were PDFs or online textbooks or other online platforms where she had to complete her work or readings. She retained so little. Her math? More often than not, it was done on a touch-sensitive Chromebook with a stylus. So if you wanted to try and remember how you did a homework probably from a couple weeks ago? It either didn't exist, or you had to wade through innumerable image files.\n\nAnyway, I could go so much further into it, but everyone here knows how typical 1:1 device and teaching is like.\n\nHere's what we've noticed over the last 1.5 years after enrolling her in a private school that teaches like schools taught 20 years ago. Even when she could focus in her classes, she retained a *lot* less when reading from an online document/book/scanned-image than she does from physical papers and books in her private school now. She also retains sooo much more when she is essentially \"forced\" (out of necessity for capturing the important material and getting a decent grade, not \"physically forced\") to take notes in her own hand, on actual paper, during class versus creating a Google doc or slide deck to \"take notes\" in. She retains a lot more when the important info is coming from a teacher versus when coming from a video. She retains a lot more when math work is expected to be done on physical paper versus on a screen.\n\nBasically, her switching to the non-tech method of learning has done wonders for her retention, interest and ability to connect things. And again, nothing against the teachers. My wife and I really thought they were great overall.\n\nAnyway, at least to people like my daughter (moderate ADHD and typical teen), *every single measurable aspect* of learning and retention improved when she switched to a school that teaches kids using teachers and physical books and papers, and expecting the kids to take notes in their own hand using pen/pencil. It is night and day.\n\nAnd last thing I'll add is that, she was always a very average student. The school she is in now is a very high expectation type of school, which worried my wife and I a lot, wondering if our daughter could handle it. It turns out, she can, and she said a few months ago that she always thought she was bad at math, and never knew she could *actually* be good at it. It nearly brought me to tears.\n\nAt least for a typical kid like my daughter, I honestly believe that the recent way of teaching/learning is **making millions of kids into intellectually** ***less*** **than what they otherwise could have been**. I could say a lot more about all of this, but it's already too long of a post, so I'll stop here.",

          "text": "I know no one will see this comment but something that is a huge problem in schools is getting the paper copies made… someone who I am very close with is a teacher at an elementary school and the children in my opinion shouldn’t be using chrome books so much. But the teachers (at this particular school and district) literally don’t have time to make copies and get all the papers graded. They have 45 minutes of prep before and after school. At least two of those days a week the prep time is taken up by meetings. The school only has one big printer they lease and some of the teachers who were lucky enough to have grants have a printer in their classroom. If u think about it, 30 children. Half hour to 45 minute long lessons. 8 or so lessons a day that’s about 300 pages a day, that’s if they only have one sheet of work to do per lesson. That doesn’t count actually finding the right worksheet for the lessons or in a worse case making the sheet from scratch. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to do everything on paper all day long anymore. With everyone again in this particular school and I know many others being on such different levels of knowledge they can’t realistically be doing the exact same work every day. So that’s even more variation. With the chromebooks they have the work there. And the kids who need help can get it as they need it and the kids who don’t, don’t need to be waiting on everyone else. If there’s some issue with the worksheet for some students the teacher can go and make corrections or change it and tailor it to some students differently then others. Which again wouldn’t really be possible if it was all done on paper.",

This is most communication, and that's why typing it out on a keyboard is ideal - it's faster to make (type) AND easier to read.\n\nTaking notes is a great example of communicating information you DON'T know to yourself. And this self-communication is instant—You're not writing information to a future version of you, either. That would fall into the first category. You are taking notes just to go through the act of writing the information, and the purpose is not to review the notes later (though, that is a bonus).\n\nTLDR: To your brain and muscles, the 'A' key and the 'S' key are almost exactly the same thing (you push a key). However, actually writing the two letters 'A' and 'S' is a very different task, and this added effort solidifies the actual information behind the words into your head.

Making a firehose of code to manage when the hard part is managing change in a complex code base, not pumping out SLOC. It's IBM trying to maximise lines of code all over again.",

And that's probably dependent on competitors (Apple, Tidal) being unable to cut their costs.  Most likely those guys are also saving money, and so all three would end up cutting costs equally, leading to no net gains for anyone.\n\nSo we are basically in a situation where the cost is limited by the consumers' willingness to pay.

I had a Pixel phone but all my android stuff, including my Android TVs were just throwing ads everywhere at me. Got tired of it and got an Apple TV and saw how well it just worked, with 0 ads anywhere. Got an iphone when it was time to update my phone and i have been so happy with the lack of pop up news i cant get rid of, and random ads i never wanted. Just all works so well.\n\nPeople get so defensive and draw lines and start yelling \"fanboi!\" and everything else. But honestly choices make everything better. Can you imagine how even crappier everything would be if we only had the choice of spotify for music streaming and android for phone OS? Thankfully we have multiple choices for music and dont need to give spotify anything. Tidal, Deezer, Amazon music, Youtube music Apple Music and i am sure there are plenty more. ",

It’s not necessarily the fastest solution, and it won’t be able to transfer platform-specific songs… but everything else is genuinely safe and it does a good/accurate job.",

Which basically amounted to issuing a blanket notice that stories from some preferred news sources could no longer be flagged. \n\nIssue solved. ",

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

They lag, they need software updates that wipe all custom settings, and heating/cooling functions cannot be accessed when the screen is slightly dirty.\n\nAnd of course:\n7 ) they look really, really dumb in comparison to other vehicles, which is polarizing to a population that is historically opposed to major changes.\n8.) Did i mention that they look really stupid? Because most do. And yes, aesthetics matter. A lot....\n\nIt's not a mystery as to why they are losing money. They want to hide every detail of their new vehciles until they come out. Which is hilarious because they fired all of their QA departments; the only people who would have told them that these features are terrible. \nThey need to hire honest/normal people to critique new product ideas, not echo chambers of yes-men pandering to their bosses whims. \n\nAlmost feels like all of the car company CEOs got together 10 years ago and hatched a plan to screw over EVs so they can keep reaping oil benefits. \n\nDon't u dare talk about my tin foil hat... it's shiney.",

Even if you can go 400 miles, if you're taking a road trip, that is still a lot of stops, just for a recharge.

Is it not the case that Facebook attempts to police the content on the site to avoid bad outcomes like that, but it's just a really hard problem to solve? So many of the social media and content aggregation platforms are facing that problem and struggling to solve it. Reddit, too!\n\nFrom my perspective, if someone makes a knife for the good intent of helping people with things like cooking, but then some bad actor uses that knife to kill someone then it's not the knife makers fault.

I'm an artist that at my peak got up to 700k followers (at 400k now because that's just Instagram). Everyone I know has lost a ton of followers from people leaving. I've watched so many videos and read so much about how to appeal to the algorithm and it's just not something I can keep up with anymore. First you HAD to do videos, then you have to pay for your OWN followers to see your posts, post a portrait photo instead of landscape so the algorithm knows people are looking at your post just a liiiittle bit longer, for that same reason make a video or carousel, want your followers to see your posts more? We will reward you if you use Instagram everyday all the time. Oh and make sure you post everyday and use every feature we add, then we will boost your post for you.\n\nThe stuff they do...is actually horrible and inhumane. TikTok too. There needs to be regulations to keep the companies that make  these horrible algorithms from colonizing our minds by demanding all our free time. We aren't meant to be staring at these phones for so long everyday. I used to be able to make an IG post of a photo so quickly of art I had made and I could easily make a living on it. Now me and almost every artist I know is struggling while they demand more and more from us to the point we burnout. I stopped enjoying making art for a while because of the app which is actually insane, it punishes you for not being enslaved.
