How would Elon know Trump was involved in sorted stuff with Epstein? And why would Elon have been silent about it and ok with it for so long? And why would he then delete his tweet and never talk about it again?\n\nElon being a pedophile creep, just like Trump, is the least surprising news ever. I just hope we get a real investigation and people finally go to jail, but it'll have to be after the Trump admin is out of office. By last count, we are currently up to eight Trump admin members being named in the files as visiting Epstein's island.",

I ran it through and asked if it noted anything striking.\n\n# What’s striking (patterns)\n\n* A large share of tips show limited follow-up outcomes in the “Response” field (e.g., “no contact made,” “voicemail left, no response,” “no probative information”), even when the allegations described serious conduct.​\n* At least one complainant was “spoken to and deemed not credible,” showing explicit credibility triage inside the list.​\n* Several tips converge on recurring themes: modeling recruitment/industry pathways, parties at wealthy/private residences, and alleged involvement of high-profile figures (Trump, Clinton, Maxwell are repeatedly named in different tips).​\n* One tip describes a caller who attended multiple parties at Epstein’s NY residence at age 16 and alleges sexual assault by Epstein; it also names “Allen,” “Oren,” and “Tal” and notes they may be identifiable as the Alexander brothers.​\n* Some allegations are extremely severe (e.g., claims of missing/murdered girls, threats, purported video evidence), which stands out because these are extraordinary claims presented in tip-summary form rather than as fully developed investigative memos.​\n\n# Why the modeling angle stands out\n\n* Multiple tips reference recruiting/“modeling” as a lure or access channel (including a “Trump Modeling Agency” timeframe and mention of older Victoria’s Secret models at parties).​\n* Independently of these tips, Epstein has been publicly reported as having connections in the Victoria’s Secret/Wexner orbit, which is why readers flag modeling as a recurring motif in Epstein-related reporting.\n* Separately, Trump’s modeling agency has had public scrutiny in the past over labor/immigration issues involving models, which may be why tipsters anchor stories to that pathway (even though the tips themselves are not proof).",

You can use sites like [opensecrets.org/orgs/search](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/search) to search the exact companies you give money to, and where they give your money.\n\nTrade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Hoka. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to the nonprofits successfully fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect",

Does this 150% account for any bumps in new *install* rates or anything like that? I hate tiktok, but this seems like fluff since nobody seems to be reporting something like \"10% of us tiktok users have deleted their accounts\".

It's not INCREDIBLY slow, but it's no faster than mssql which in my experience has no benefits over postgres, which is free and open source. Even mysql (that oracle tried to infantalise to make it's paid for dB seem better) would be a generally better choice for an enterprise app IMO.\n\n\nWithout their banking and government projects I'd expect oracle to just fade away into overpriced obscurity.\n\n\nOf course I thought the same about We sphere ($27k a license when I worked with it) and weblogoc (a bargain $17k a license). Neither of them work as well or as quickly as jboss, which isn't even my favourite free open source alternative.\n\n\nRegulations in that sector tend to help the incumbent with very little benefit for the people it's supposed to help. With AI significantly enhancing an open source developers productivity (in certain areas) I wonder if we will see this sort of silly nonsense continue. ",

It's not TikTok, though, it's friggin’ YouTube Kids. My niece keeps finding content we'd rather she not be watching, and the only way to stop it is to go into viewing history and block the channel. Except then the algorithm turns around and serves up the *exact same content from the exact same creators*, ***but in a different language***. Instead of “Ashley’s Playhouse” it's “Ashley’s Playhouse ESP.”\n\nI've had to weed out content from the same creators in English, German, Spanish, Italian, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, and I don't know how many other languages. And there's no proactive way to block the stuff before it bubbles up through the algorithm. You can't say “only serve up content in English,” and because the algorithm found them in English, *of course* it's going to find them in other languages too, because the algorithm doesn't care.\n\nThe whole thing is monstrously disturbing to me.",

In the US, TikTok is still the most downloaded app (5 million times last month according to SensorTower in the US) and #1 entertainment app still according to App Store ranking (not overall rank). If 2.5x increases, not that much of US users uninstalled.\n\nThe scale of their user base is the key factor here. Think about it from a simple user math perspective: it's all about whether new users can replace the ones who leave. TikTok has over 130 million users in the US alone. Let's say a normal week sees 1 million uninstalls. A 2.5x spike pushes that to 2.5 million. That sounds huge, but it's still less than 2% of their total US user base. It just means for that one week, their new signups likely didn't keep up with the spike in people leaving. The platform is big enough to take that hit. (In a theoretical sense) \n\nIt's a noticeable dip, for sure. But their user acquisition engine is always running to help offset those losses. It would hurt their growth ratio for that, but a platform that large is built to absorb temporary shocks like that. It really just confirms the slow bleed idea instead of a sudden collapse.\n\nAlso, not that a lot of user would prompt to branch out. In January 21, 2026, apptopia reported that those audience would move to TV, Streaming, and/or gambling apps.\n\nhttps://apptopia.com/en/blog/tiktok-dau-growth-has-fallen-churned-users-are-not-going-to-competitors/\n\nhttps://app.sensortower.com/overview/835599320?country=US",

I do have a bluetooth speaker but when the battery dies (it won't last 8hr) it makes a very loud BLEEPBLOOP to announce shutdown. I guess 'not having phone next to me when I wake up' is a great start if I can figure out how to have brown noise playing from my phone, without my phone.

And these robots will have a massive market because everyone will want one to do all their menial tasks even though the only task Musk has ever shown one do was fold a T-shirt while being directly controlled to do so by a guy standing next to it.  \n\nMusk's an idiot but he does have one talent, which is to see which direction the dumb VC money is flowing. EVs were yesterday, now it's AI and humanoid robots.",

Toyota makes multiple models that fit the Model Y class so their sales numbers are spread out for a lot more car models. Tesla just makes the 3, S, X, Y (and Cybertruck which has abismal sales). Imagine if Toyota only sold 4 different models, they would absolutely beat the Model Y sales if that were the case. \n\nThe other huge factor is EV tax incentives, which just ended in the US. A lot of Tesla Model 3 and Y sales were solely because the government gave great price incentives that made them more affordable to buy. With the US incentives ending and more EV models coming to the rest of the world, I feel Tesla is only going to have lower and lower sales in the coming years. BYD or others make better EVs at a cheaper price and I really wish we got that competition in the US.",

They've got some of the best efficiency ratings outside of something weird looking like Aptera.  From all accounts, they were designed and redesigned continuously by some great engineers within the company.  Then Musk wanted his own project with the Cybertruck, and it has flopped hard.  I think people would get over its looks if it wasn't so expensive and the range and reliability were what they had promised.  But from what I've heard, Musk mostly took control of the design and took a ton of shortcuts on things, like the suspension, in favor of eye catching stuff.  Then he got sucked into the alt-right pipeline and went more insane and bought twitter and mostly has abandoned Tesla to the chaos he leaves behind.\n\nBut no, he had to go full Nazi and do a bunch of stuff that has/will statistically lead to the deaths of something like 300,000 people worldwide.  All because he wouldn't go to therapy, and let his insecurities get hijacked by alt-right influencers... not that he was an angel before that...",

Paralytics can stop breathing, cause cardiac complications, and leave people with permanent damage. Anyone with clinical training knows this. Advocating harm is the exact opposite of the oath and responsibility that comes with working in healthcare.\n\nI am not even political, which makes it more disturbing to watch people defend this. The moral gymnastics are wild. The justification sounds eerily similar to the logic J6 supporters used. They convinced themselves democracy was being stolen (it wasn’t not), so they felt their actions were justified. Now others are convincing themselves they are fighting literal Nazis (they are not), so they feel justified advocating medical harm.\n\nWe are living in unhinged times. I genuinely hope someone studies this era from a psychological standpoint, because the level of self righteousness required to publicly call for medically harmful acts is unreal.

They relaxed a lot of their rules to make it more welcoming to others. They didn't actually change anything country wide, they just tried to be a bit nicer during the event so people could come in, see how amazing they are and then leave.\n\nThe US is going the opposite route.

There's way too much money invested already. Much the same as the 1936 Olympics, we will see a few standing up and making a point to say the US didn't deserve the sport being hosted there and that's worth more, historically then any boycott. There was a \"boycott\" for the 36 games, even a whole different games set that year in Spain (didn't happen), but we don't talk about that...we sure as fuck know the image of Jesse Owens standing next to Nazi's geting his gold medal.

They're confident you've got a few decades of a reduction in standing before they have to consider American soft power something they need to take into account.\n\nThere's plenty of other indicators of American loss of soft power in the past few years, but the Catholic Church didnt survive a thousand years by taking risky bets. They see American influence going down, and a potential for religious movement within the US to increase, with a potential of their own expansion as a result.

Soft power is not *good,* and by its nature it's even more coercive than hard power.\n\nSoft power can be as much a cudgel as hard power. Soft power is most often like a mafioso coming into your shop saying \"wow, nice place here, shame if something happened to it.\"\n\nIn terms of soft and hard power, it's not \"carrot and stick.\" It's more like \"threat of stick and stick.\"\n\nAmerica's use of sanctions, weaponization of trade arrangements (e.g. twisting Canada's arm to impose their own massive tariffs on Chinese EVs,) withholding of funds, etc. are all examples of the, let's say, \"morally dubious\" applications of soft power.\n\nSoft power erodes the sovereignty of other nations just as much if not more than hard power. It just bypasses the fights by way of threats.\n\nFor instance, USAID was very much an organization designed to bully. That money was not unconditional. It was given first, then used to say \"hey, if you don't deregulate your own country's oil and gas exports and allow US corporate interests to further pilfer your nation's national resources, then this money we're giving you will go away and we'll destabilize your whole-ass regime in the process.\"\n\nPrivate entities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do the same things. \n\nWhen Bill Gates says \"I want to eradicate polio!\" and the country says \"yeah, uhh, we don't really have that many problems with polio, but we could really use some malaria meds,\" Bill Gates will put terms and conditions on his \"aid\" such that it CANNOT be used for malaria meds.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, Bill Gates wants a headline saying \"King Dickhead Eradicates Polio,\" not to actually help people in need. The Clinton Foundation has operated in precisely this way in Haiti as well.",

I still remember when I went in 2020, how awful the vibe was.\n\nThe convention itself was dead. There was way more interesting activity in the lobby of the St. Regis than there was at the center. When we got to the center, it was saturated with a bunch of “dead”, shit-tier web3 games and NFT marketplace platforms that we’re supposed to *”disrupt the market”* that were absolutely scams. No gamer who was there was satisfied with the offerings, and majority of the booths and kiosks were empty. I remember saying right then and there that *”This convention is dead.”* There was no reason to spend money on hotels, passes, and the bloated cost of the Bay Area to waltz around the Tenderloin and risk being approached by homeless people.\n\nNow? As if the prohibitive costs and low-participation from developers wasn’t bad enough, you could actually get arrested. Every developer has their own showcase now per platform, so there is no reason for the major players to go, either. The meetup is now almost exclusively for people pitching their games and trying to secure new rounds of funding; even then, if you are in that phase, there are cheaper and easier ways to secure deals than to attend the event. It is definitely going to go the way of E3 and die out, 100%\n\nThe other unrelated but relevant detail I remember; virtually everyone I knew who went that year caught COVID. It was a super spreader event, and the convention did virtually nothing to help prevent it from being that way. It is a weird value proposition to any developer: *”Hey, spend $3000 to come here for a few days, talk to some financiers and BD guys, leave with a chronic illness that can and will spread to your teams when you return and decommission for them for another 7-12 days!”* You combine it with the area being housed with a massive amount of homeless people who can and do steal as much as possible from convention-goers, and it just isn’t worth it.",

All these US corps supporting this admin and turning a blind eye or supporting the atrocities going on in their backyard will only understand once they feel it in their wallets.

Unfortunately it will likely take all these sacrifices and suffering of normal consumers for these money hungry corps to finally take action.",

(they barely make it into the Top 20,. and even then it's only \"assault by firearm\" which doesn't necessarily mean death)  Statistically you're more likely to die from falling space debris than you are in a mass shooting. \n\nFirearms deaths in the USA average around 45,000 to 50,000 a year. There's an estimated 400 million to 500 million guns in the USA. That means only something like 0.0001 of existing firearms are ever even used in a shooting. Firearm suicides in the USA account for nearly 27,000 deaths annually, representing over half of all gun-related deaths and approximately 55%–60% of all suicides in the country.\n\nIf we really wanted to do something measurable and tangible to \"reduce firearms deaths\".. logically and scientifically the best thing we could do would be to invest heavily in mental health and suicide-prevention resources.",

I watched all weekend, and what I saw was a people under occupation by a masked paramilitary force that reports to one parties interests.

I would send screenshots, but I photos cant be uploaded. This is the AI overview response I got,\n\n“Based on newly released, hacked, and leaked documents from 2013–2016, Jeffrey Epstein acted as a behind-the-scenes broker in foreign policy, specifically attempting to facilitate a secret backchannel between Israel and Russia regarding the Syrian civil war.\n\nKey details regarding Epstein's involvement in Syria include:\n\nBackchannel Diplomacy: Between 2013 and 2016, Epstein acted as an intermediary between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Russian authorities to discuss the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussian Connection: Emails show Epstein advising Barak to meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss a Russian-led peace plan for Syria, with Epstein helping to craft messages for the Kremlin.\n\nTargeting Assad: The goal of these, and other, interactions was to shape US and Russian policy to align with Israeli security goals, which included removing Assad from power and opposing the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBrokering Deals: Reports from Drop Site News suggest Epstein used his network to act as a \"fixer\" at an elite level, connecting Israeli intelligence with international actors, including in discussions about Syria.\n\nContext of Leaks: These revelations emerged from emails hacked by \"Handala\" and published in late 2025, which also indicated Epstein's involvement in other geopolitical matters.\n\nSeparately, in 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed in an interview that Epstein did not commit suicide but was killed because he held \"vital secrets\".\n\nSeems pretty suspicious to me",

Schumer has said it himself, their main objective is to keep their voter base pro-isreal. This opinion shift took place over the course of a year with people seeing the brutality levied at the civilians of gaza. The head of ADL was pretty explicit as well saying they have a young person problem because of tiktok.\n\nThe democrats changed their stance because of shifting opinion on American foreign policy. Isreal is a top priority of our foreign policy and rights be damned. So they voted to ban the app. Using this bullshit Chinese data harvesting conspiracy theory. China doesn’t need to harvest American data, they can buy better more intimate data harvested by basically every American company.\n\nThe ban is and always was about narrative control and democrats banned it to stem the tide of public opinion shifting on isreal",

[Here's another](https://x.com/jfederations/status/1767989253735133673) calling for TikTok to be banned/censored precisely due to it being a vehicle for criticism of Israel.\n* [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtk_5c9D_Ko) Mitt Romney admitting the reason for the ban on camera, very explicitly.\n\nNot surprising that, having received a loud, clear message that the government will punish social media platforms that don't sufficiently censor content inconvenient for the government of the day, the current owners of Tiktok are now more than happy to comply with the propaganda interests of this new government-of-the-day.",

                  "text": "that's the typical cycle. we are on track to have China surpass the US in economic terms. So what does that mean? well...\n\nChina needed drastic repression when shit was really bad, quality of life was poor, and they wanted to invest massively. Now it's population is generally much better off, strong middle class, expanding and getting wealthy, so they are much more complacent (sound familiar?). China is about to reap the profits of massive investments in industry and infrastructure. they went from being the worlds factory for cheap things with slave labor and using industrial espionage and ignoring copyright laws to learn and advance as much as possible, to now being the worlds factory for nearly everything including the absolute state of the art and top tier products, having incredible universities, they now have the best cars, the best smartphones, the best robots, (they just lack the best chips, which is taiwan, which is why they want it). They have the fastest bullet trains in the world, and they have more railway of it than the circumference of the earth. they have transitioned to a service economy while also maintaining the best industries in the world, a service economy that is now benefiting from the massive infrastructure spending allowing for people to be connected and trade and move around very fast\n\nmeanwhile the US is the opposite. quality of life is deteriorating, infrastructure is crumbling, there's been zero investment just the opposite, they have been dismantling and selling everything for parts and cutting spending everywhere. the US elites now need control over the population. There are no fast trains. Everyone must go into debt to have a car to go to work, to earn to pay for the car. The roads that america kept building and building, more lanes, more highways, more parking lots, now all need repair (25-30y lifecycle of tarmac), and it costs more to replace than to build new. The debt has come asking for interest. And while the interstate highway investment back in 1950's did reap a lot of benefit, more and more roads and more cars doesn't keep scaling up. not like trains do. A train line can take 100 people or 1 million people, you can make trains longer, higher, double deck, more frequent. You can have trains so frequent that you don't even need to look at your watch, you just show up and board. miss it? there's another in 4 minutes. you can show up at the station 2 minutes before and still board. and you board and arrive downtown to downtown. meanwhile cars, good luck with the parking and the traffic. you'll spend more time going from the suburbs to downtown and finding parking than the actual trip. cars don't scale, they clog. roads don't scale - the more lanes you make, the more parking you make, the further away your destination gets. just look at a commercial area having 2 shops separated by parking lots that take 10 minutes to walk from one to the other, and then imagine if there was no parking lot, just a train rail and a platform - the shops would be next to each other and take 20 seconds to walk from one to the other. now multiply that by every shop and house. A walkable distance becomes a 30 minute drive once you add parking lots and massive roads between every house and shop. meaning, economic waste. you spent money on infrastructure that forced people to spend money on cars and oil, only to make people not move faster than simply walking. in a service economy, you need people working and spending - not wasting time inside cars, that is sure to make auto industry and oil industry rich - and no one else.\n\nthis isn't to excuse china or the usa, in past, present or future. China is still China, and the US is still the US, for better and for worse. China now has a complacent population, so they can avoid doing more Tiananmen massacres, but they will still be corrupt autocrats. The USA already had no proper individual freedoms (see 2000's laws, if i accuse you of being a terrorist i can hold you indefinitely without lawyer, court, or accountability, and put you in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and torture you, see border control 2000's laws saying that within 200 miles of an airport or land border or port, anyone can be arrested without charge, lawyer or court, on accusation of being an illegal immigrant). the right violations were already there, they just were almost never used because the USA was rich and the elite were happy keeping the status quo and extracting wealth. now these lack of rights are being used to oppress the population, because the elite wants more wealth to be extracted but people are already living paycheck to paycheck and drowning in student and medical debt, so they ransack the government (doge) and they sell out democracy (laws and executive power is traded for cash, gifts and bribes like a plane from qatar, or $1 billion a year per country for board of peace), and if this continues much more, I can totally see massacres like Tiananmen happing here (Kent state, japanese concentration camps).",

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.”\n\nGeorge Orwell, 1984",

          "text": "I made this post and shared it elsewhere, but I will share it here as well since this came up.\n\n# FYI: Recording ICE and being added to a \"Terrorist\" database is a direct violation of 28 CFR Part 23. Know your rights.\n\n*I am not a lawyer, only a former criminal intelligence analyst, if you are a lawyer please consider taking this up as a case, if you are not a lawyer consider pushing your representative to start a congressional inquiry/investigation. This is a massive violation of established laws and guidelines.*\n\nI’ve been seeing a lot of reports/videos/questions about ICE (or other agencies) taking photos of people recording them and claiming they are being added to a \"terrorist\" or \"criminal\" database solely for filming.\n\nIf this is happening in a multijurisdictional intelligence system, it is a textbook violation of federal law - specifically 28 CFR Part 23.\n\nUnder this federal regulation, law enforcement agencies are strictly prohibited from adding you to an intelligence database unless they meet these criteria:\n\nNO \"Reasonable Suspicion\": Under § 23.20(a), they cannot put you in a system unless there is reasonable suspicion of definable criminal activity. Recording a federal agent in public is a constitutionally protected act, not a crime.\n\nFirst Amendment Violations: § 23.20(b) explicitly forbids agencies from collecting or maintaining info on people based on their social or political activities unless it’s directly related to criminal conduct. Recording the government is a First Amendment right.\n\nHarassment & \"Chilling Effects\": § 23.20(l) states that intelligence projects cannot be used to harass or interfere with lawful political activities. Labeling a legal observer or a bystander a \"terrorist\" for holding a phone is a clear attempt to intimidate. (I believe this applies *even if they are lying*)\n\nFalse Information: § 23.20(g) requires that all data be accurate and relevant. Entering a \"Terrorist\" label for someone who has committed no crime is a violation of data integrity.\n\nIf this happens to you, what you can do: Document everything: Get the officer's name, badge number, and the exact time/location. (Clearly this is a problem with these ICE goons, however, record license plates as though will be tied to the agents operating them).\n\nFile a Privacy Act Request: You can file a FOIA/Privacy Act request with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to see if records exist on you.\n\nContact Advocacy Groups: If you think you've been \"watchlisted\" for filming, reach out to the ACLU or the National Lawyers Guild (NLG).\n\nDon't let them intimidate you into putting the camera down. The law is literally written to prevent this exact type of overreach.\n\nTL;DR: 28 CFR Part 23 says they need \"Reasonable Suspicion\" of a crime to put you in an intelligence database. Filming them isn't a crime; it's a right.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I am a former criminal intelligence analyst, my job involved maintaining one of these databases and the law is extremely strict on what can go in it, despite public perception.\n\nThe video of the ICE agent stating that woman going into a database as a terrorist is a blatant violation of this law and should trigger a congressional investigation.\n\nRead the full text of the regulation on the eCFR website. [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-28/chapter-I/part-23)\n\nEdit: I believe 28 CFR Part 23 only applies if data is entered into a DOJ-funded criminal intelligence system. We don't know at this point if this is the case. But either way, it merits a congressional investigation.",

They ought to be wearing bodycams and filming their own actions so others don't have to do it for them.\n\nActions taken by *public servants* shouldn't have to hide their faces. They shouldn't be afraid of being judged by their peers. The fact the government puts ICE Agents in a position where they feel terrified by the general public seeing what they are doing is a travesty, to say nothing of the implications of the actions themselves.\n\nIf they are breaking the law, then filming their illegal actions is in the interest of everybody but the lawbreakers themselves. If they aren't breaking the law and are doing everything as they should be, then they have nothing to fear.\n\nThis is not \"If you have nothing to hide, then you don't need privacy\" argument - actions taken by public servants are *supposed* to be scrutable. This is why many countries have Freedom of Information laws. We empower these officers of the law to enforce the law, and trust them to do right by us all, and in exchange, we get the ability to hold them account when they break those laws themselves - because giving somebody power without accountability is and always has been a recipe for disaster.\n\nIf the general public cannot hold them account, the government isn't holding up their end of the deal, and the fact the rest of the US government seems complicit in this is a travesty.\n\n---\n\nFor folks interested in the origins of modern Policing, the \"Peelian Principles\" and \"Policing by Consent\" from the UK and how it's morphed into Policing by Law with accountability - public trust is at the heart of democratic law enforcement. Empowering an organisation that people don't trust and then taking actions to undermine any trust they could build is a great way to increase the friction between the people and the state and will likely make things escalate further.",

Exemptions are typically only granted under rather extraordinary circumstances.\n\nApparently the reason he wanted to enter Canada was to attend a TED talk in Vancouver.\n\nBut, here's where things get pretty interesting, at least to me, is that other documents suggest he was able to enter Canada in 2014.\n\nIt's not clear if he applied for and received the same type of permit, or if he was here illegally, but I find both concerning- the former actually more than the latter.\n\nIf he got the exemption, that's very troubling to me, because if so the only difference between 2014 and 2018 would be which political party was \"in charge\" at the time; 2014 it was Harper and the Conservatives; 2018 was Trudeau and the Liberals. But in both cases his 2008 indictment would have made him inadmissable except in rather extraordinary circumstances.\n\nI hope Occam's razor applies here and he simply entered illegally. But, with everything- well, I can't help but lend myself to conspirational thinking, and it really makes me wonder about the possibility that the CPC, like the American Republican Party, have links to Epstein. PP's Trumpsucking certainly doesn't disavow me of the notion. Back then, did they let him in the country on purpose? Did they pull strings to allow him a permit? Was it planned? Was he trafficking in Canada, too? did he have Canadian victims? Were Conservative politicians in Canada participating in this? were they blackmailed to allow the exemption?\n\nAmid all this we have a rather brutal irony as well, in that the exemption process was partly created specifically to provide protection and assistance to victims of human trafficking and abuse.",

              "text": "I have a lot of friends who worked at Amazon and basically stayed their three years for their stocks to vest and then got the fuck out. A few of them literally left tech entirely after that. \n\nI also heard that some teams have a requirement of one person getting cut every quarter / year or so (depending on PiPs), so they would intentionally hire someone they knew was sub-par to be able to keep their main team itself.\n\nI worked at one of the big tech companies for almost 6 years before quitting with my soul barely in tact and didn't have too much corporate evil to deal with personally because I worked in part of the company that went from normal hours to COVID hours (product was necessary for our customers to actually function and customers were schools, so moral obligation easy to push)... So working 6am to 1am 7 days a week. Even after the COVID crunch was over, that just became the new normal all the time. And it was still COVID, so what the fuck else was there to do but work? I lost so much weight during that time and never noticed just from barely eating anything.\n\nI loved one of my coworkers (my manager) and had my little flock of people I protected (I had risen to be senior on my team), but honestly now I just have watched from the outside as those people I liked got laid off or now work even more insane hours just to keep a necessary product functioning in order to keep the other crap that made money functioning on top of it. I'm happy to have left when I did. \n\nWhen I joined that company in 2017, the stock was around $42/share. It's now ten times that. I also had an offer from another faang (had interned there) that I turned down after seeing the fact that the free meals just really were meant to keep employees there from early morning through late dinner, to the point where employees really didnt know any humans that didnt work at said company. How do you make a product for people you have no context of?? It was scary how detached from reality they were and how many were just divorced and had no interest in maintaining custody if they had kids. \n\nHalf the thing with working at any of these companies is luck. There are four people just as qualified, two more qualified, that just didn't get a position because someone was having a bad day or a resume just got passed over. It's not a level of amazing prestige that it is seen elsewhere or seen as just a resume unlock tool for anywhere else you want to work, but it's a matter of luck. Any \"holier than thou\" attitude should be seen as purely bullshit.",

          "text": "Paywall\n\n```US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error.\nThe email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to \"strengthen the company.\"\nThe message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled.\nEarly on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to \"remove bureaucracy\" at the firm.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBeth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make \"broad reductions every few months\", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October.\n\"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,\" she said.\nAmazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles.\nAmazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected.\nProject Dawn\nOn Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers.\nThe title of the invitation was \"Send project Dawn email,\" an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job redundancies.\nWhile the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed.\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the email said.\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.\nThe lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified.\nThe broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October.\nThe firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.\nWhile affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Time to rethink'\nSince Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts.\nJassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.\nIn-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.\nAmazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement.\nIn an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\"\nJassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.\nAdditional reporting by Mitchell Labiak```",

And the way it's **already playing out** is like this: one engineer using AI can now do the work of 2+ engineers who aren't using it. As people get better at using the tools, that ratio is going to continue to increase. It's not a separate employee that is \"1% as competent\", it's a force multiplier that is **already** greater than 10x for certain early adopters. No amount of denial or copium is going to reverse that trend. As someone working on a team where many of my coworkers are using agentic coding assistants, it's becoming very obvious who uses it and who doesn't, and I'm not talking about shitty code, I'm talking about massively increased number of new features per week. If I don't want to use AI, I will simply not going to be keeping up with my coworkers. Within a couple years the gap would be so big that I'd probably be fired.\n\n> there are 10 people waiting outside for your job\n\nYes, the real issue is definitely excessive competition for jobs. AI will make that competition even more extreme. If AI weren't continuously improving then we'd simply have to wait for the \"cycle\" to play out - eventually people are so unhappy with labor conditions that protesting and being shot by corporate police is better than going into the office. However, with AI, I don't know if we'll actually get to that point.\n\nIMO the bigger question is, what comes first: mass rioting severe enough to interrupt big tech, or AI-enhanced surveillance and policing so effective that it becomes permanently impossible to organize any resistance.",

Also told my supervisor that it was their job to already know the answers to the questions I was being asked. Then I said that if they contacted me again before my leave was up I was going to file a case against them with the labour board. And finally said I was disgusted by the lack of basic human decency. \n\nI talked to my doctor about how stressed out I was and my medical leave was extended from two weeks to six months, which entitled me to six months of half pay Employment Insurance. I am up for retirement months before my medical leave ends. I provided a return to work date so my position has to be held for my return which I am not compelled to do. So now instead of gutting it out for a few months until I retirement I retired early, and because I went on medical leave while still working I get Employment Insurance benefits on top of my pension.\n\nIf that message from my supervisor had not pushed me over the edge I would not have ended up in a much better financial position which included early retirement and me witnessing karma in action.",

There has been a noticeable increase in sudden deaths, including young people (sometimes even adolescents) for no apparent reason, sometimes with no previous symptoms. Multiple studies show that Covid can lead to vascular damage, clotting and heart damage, among lots of other sequelae. And yes, Covid is still around, about half of the cases are asymptomatic, yet they can still add up to the damage, which compounds with each infection. Vaccines do help a bit but not enough, and their partially protective effect only lasts typically a few months.",

Their “security” system was that each city had a few people who personally knew each other. They never talked about their work on the phone or wrote anything down. Their national leader was a young man who lived entirely off-grid and basically had no recorded address or bank account or anything like that. He did not own a car, and traveled by hopping on and off freight trains. When he went to a city where members of the group were, he would look for a little notebook hidden someplace (like a hollow tree or an abandoned car). The notebook would just indicate the time of the next meeting (in a simple code). No substantial info about who would attend or what would be discussed. The group was discovered by a federal agent working undercover within the voluntarily homeless, dumpster diving (“freegan”) community.",

The infiltrations into signal are primarily due to lax security by the users, not the protocol itself. I'm willing to bet they have ways of breaking open signal chats, but I would be surprised if they did not require physical access to the device to do so.\n\n\nIf you have biometric authentication, turn that shit off. Make sure your phone's passkey is not just 4 digits that happen to be some form of your birthday. \n\n\nPractice better security. Perhaps don't speak plainly in your messages to others if you are discussing something you may not want the federal government to know. \n\n\nIf you are going to be engaging in protests, think about leaving your phone behind or get a burner that you only use for recording and is mostly removed from your identity. \n\n\nSecurity is often described as an onion. Signal is only one layer.\n\nEDIT: Something I forgot. If your phone has been confiscated by LE of any flavor, it should no longer be considered safe. Intelligence agencies and defense contractors have developed software that can root a phone and then return it to normal state. The device will remain compromised and may even periodically report back to the hackers. This is one way that signal message groups can be broken. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellebrite",

AI can do all the heavy lifting there.  Then there’s the militarization of law enforcement.

I remember years ago when I was a Detective and I had attended a training seminar pertaining to online predator “hunting” / locating adults online that were engaging in grooming tactics with children. \n\nDuring the training, there was a segment on facial recognition technology. The instructor was saying that Facebook had better FRT than the FBI and to prove it, the instructor presented a video of fans leaving an arena after an NHL championship final game. As fans were leaving, they were being recorded from a camera on a building across the street from the arena. As soon as they were in view of the camera (pretty much as they exited the arena) FB’s technology was identifying them by name, like “tagging” them as one does when making a FB post. The instructor then used the FBI’s tech with the same exact video, and the results were staggering in that FB had faster and superior FRT than the Feds. \n\nThe point being is that social media companies and the Feds have been studying this technology for years, w/o letting us know that in a way, we are being recorded, and identified, rather quickly, without our consent. \n\nI had retired from law enforcement in 2016, but had been medically forced to stop working in 2015. I was a Detective until the end of 2014 (had went back to being a patrol officer for nearly a year before I got injured). I bring this up because I cannot remember the exact year that I went to this training. I believe however that I would have attended this training around 2010’ish or slightly before as I became “that guy” for our agency after a major predator case I handled that began in 2007, ending in 2008ish. After that case, the agency started sending me to specialized training - different training sessions for a couple of years.",

What makes this particularly effective is that each layer was built for a different purpose--facial recognition for finding missing persons, Palantir for counterterrorism, geofencing for marketing--but when combined, they create a persistent surveillance capability that didn't require any new technology. It's the integration that's new, not the tools. The legal gap is that most of these data sources are technically \"public\" or were collected with user consent (buried in app terms of service), so Fourth Amendment protections don't clearly apply. Courts are still figuring out whether aggregating public data at this scale constitutes a search.",

The VPN is another layer of protection so that they can’t track down your location by your IP address. Just doing those two things makes it a lot more difficult for someone to associate any political comments/posts you make with your personal information. There might be ways to still figure out who you are, but it would take a lot of effort and someone looking to doxx people is just going to move onto an easier target.

The calculation of social media in 2016 as a vector for conducting successful psyops on the general public and AI, particularly Palantir, in 2020 was a now-or-never moment for these bad actors. They HAD to win the 2024 election to prevent the possibility of being regulated out of existence and so the bet was made that while the moment was imperfect, the time was now to double-down on AI and pray it would deliver Project 2025 to a level of success that would crush opposition.\n\nIt‘s important to understand because now everybody realizes the threat, but it was always sitting there right in the open for anyone to see whose eyes weren’t blinded. So if you didn’t see the threat then or you didn’t vote or you voted with luxury on a non-winnable third-party, take this as a wakeup call. Far too late, but since we’re still alive step it TF up and do something more to defend what’s left.",

The financials remain strong, but expectations were even higher, so the market punished the stock.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Actually Happening\n\n1. Slowing Azure Cloud Growth\n\nMicrosoft beat earnings expectations, but Azure’s growth rate moderated.\n\n\n\nInvestors expected faster acceleration due to AI demand.\n\n\n\nThis slowdown was a major reason the stock fell 7% after the Q2 FY26 report.\n\n\n\n2. Huge AI Infrastructure Spending\n\nMicrosoft spent $37.5 billion in capital expenditures in the quarter — far above Wall Street expectations.\n\n\n\nThese investments (data centers, GPUs, networking) reduce short‑term margins even though they support long‑term AI growth.\n\n\n\n3. Margin Guidance Came in Light\n\nEven with strong revenue, Microsoft warned that operating margins would be lower due to AI infrastructure costs.\n\n\n\nInvestors dislike lower future profitability, so the stock dropped.\n\n\n\n4. Weakness in the “More Personal Computing” Segment\n\nRevenue fell in areas like Gaming and some Windows-related categories.\n\n\n\nThis partially offset strong cloud and productivity growth.\n\n\n\n5. Market Expectations Were Extremely High\n\nMicrosoft’s stock had recently hit record highs.\n\n\n\nEven small disappointments — like slower cloud growth or cautious forecasts — triggered a sell‑off.\n\n\n\n6. AI Growth Is Huge, but Not Enough to Offset Concerns\n\nMicrosoft’s AI business grew 175% year-over-year, but Azure growth still came in lower than expected.\n\n\n\nInvestors focused more on the cloud slowdown than the AI surge.\n\n\n\nIs Microsoft Actually Losing Money?\n\nNo.\n\nMicrosoft is still reporting higher revenue, higher operating income, and strong cloud growth.\n\nThe “loss” people are talking about is stock price decline, not financial losses.",

You can stylize it as W10ii so you can piss off apple people and all your customers so you get that out of your system and you just do windows 10 again, except, get this, this is key: ZERO connected standby. I checked with everyone on earth and they all said 100% they don't want it. They want their laptop to go to sleep when they close it and not check for emails or run any updates or do any telemetry, just sleepy laptop keeping everything on pause, but not flushing ram to disk like hibernate. Super fast resume. Not one single human on earth wants emails while their computer is closed, and we all have phones and most people check their email live in a browser so it's all pointless. OK, got that down? Great. Next: Zero ads. I know, if you do not squeeze blood from your users at all corners you will lose some money, but seeing as we PAY for the OS, we should not be subjected to non-consensual ads. Same with telemetry and data in general. Everything about every human belongs to that human and you don't have any consent to take any of it and sell it. You are just going to stop doing that.\n\nThe forever updates? I get it, for security especially. Super important. We can avoid fatigue by prioritizing actually necessary updates. Guess what? Teams is done. You did it, you win! Stop updating it unless it's necessary to resolve an actual issue, or patch an actual vulnerability. It doesn't need to update 16 times a day. It's actually working. Almost as good as it did 3 years ago, when some of us really liked it! Leave it alone. Same with word and all the office apps. Calm down and stop the infinite dev cycle for products that can be \"complete\" at some point. \n\nNext is AI. just be the company who's like \"actually, we're not doing that.\" You might actually claw back some users! And nobody really likes copilot.\n\nFinally, Search. I know you love searching bing for bullshit. I know it brings you money, somehow, in some impossible to quantify way. But every single windows user on the planet misses when they could type stuff into search and find things. I want to type a filename I know, and have it come up. I want to type \"my recipe for fried pan noodle sauce\" and have it come up. This is the kind of thing AI could be doing, after you give us a fixed, easy toggle for \"search PC via filename\" and \"search PC via local AI system\" and then, this is key, you don't take the stuff we search and sell it. You stop doing all of that. \n\nYou just charge. For. The. Operating system. That's it! You charge people to buy it. They give you money, and you give them software, and when they turn around, you don't bleed them dry and pick their pockets for crap to sell to data brokers. \n\n\nMan can you imagine if microsoft hired a new CEO and was like \"hey we're just gonna give people what they want\"",

Windows 11 - continues the tradition of good/bad OS versions, required new hardware to run it even though your existing pc was perfectly capable, added crap features no one asked for, bombards you with ads and pop-ups like a new version of Clippy.\n2. Office apps - added features that no one asked for, took away useful features (e.g. can’t see more than 1 month in Outlook, WTF), Copilot is the new Clippy, only even more annoying. Clearly developers don’t use it.\n3. AI - rammed down everyone’s throats, was slapped by the Australian Government for forcing it in subscriptions without an option, only useful if you pay for the premium version and even then there are better ones out there.\n4. Xbox - played coy for so long about it’s future, raised console prices and didn’t give a shit when retailers stopped selling them, raised their GamePass price and had mass exodus of subscribers, gave gamers a reason to go to PS since there are no more exclusives, bought studios then screwed them over.\n\nHonestly, they should be lucky it’s only $357 billion, it should’ve been much much more.",

It's not all on parents, parents don't control entourage, influence from others. All you  can do is shape the kid to have values and reject bad behaviour, but no matter what you tell yourself, sooner or later that will be tested heavily and it's really not up to the parent what comes next",

I would ask her to talk to her adult female friends about how old they were the first time an adult man said something sexual and inappropriate to them.  This came up for me a few years ago, and I was surprised to discover that, for almost everyone, we were about 10 or 11.  We weren't teenagers that might have looked like adults.  We were definitely little girls.  And it was a near universal experience.  And then I would point out that those same men are on Roblox and other kid-centric sites right now, actively looking for her kid.\n\n3. I would show her how to check her kid's browser and YT viewing history (or other video apps).  I would bet that this would already be eye-opening for her.",

You went to school, you came home and if you didn't get to use the phone your bubble was very thick and only molded by those around you.\n\nNow?  Even if you as a parent do a good job with it, you send your kid to school whose friends have a cell phone and they can still see everything.  In the US, most parents are gonna have a smart phone and probably some form of screen with apps on it.  Either a smart tv, tablet, computer, gaming console, etc.  App content isn't nearly as scrutinized as TV/Broadcast content is either.  \n\nSo your kid goes to school with a friend, who has a cell phone, which has ChatGPT and that's it, or Grok or whatever. \n\nOther replies talk about how being a single job household is impossible now too, which I already experienced as someone grew up with a single mother who worked two jobs.

I had taught her in previous years, and so she knew me well. She seemed older than her age. Like she knew a lot more than the others. \n\n> One day in the playground, she said to me: “I’ve seen you online.” I asked what she meant; she said she had Google-searched me and found a photo of me standing by a mountainside. I’m not sure what the picture was, but she had somehow managed to track me down.\n\n> A few weeks later, some parents complained to the headteacher that an inappropriate video had been sent around a WhatsApp group that the children had made. WhatsApp groups were common in that age group.\n\n> The child who shared the video didn’t make it, they had been coerced into sending it by the creator of the video.\n\n> That child had told her parent, and we then discovered that the creator was the girl who told me she had searched for my photo.\n\n> That was when the complaints from parents arrived. The child who posted the video was mortified. Her mum asked for a meeting with me, apologised repeatedly and ensured her daughter apologised too.\n\n> But the girl who had made the video showed no remorse. She sniggered when she saw me. It was all very strange. What was most disturbing was how incredibly young she was: eight or nine years old. To even know what a threesome is at that age is shocking enough, never mind creating a deepfake.\n\n> Some schools are cautious when things like this happen. They don’t want drama or any bad press leaking out.\n\n> This meant the girl wasn’t excluded (not even just for the day), and she wasn’t encouraged to apologise. There were no real consequences for her at all. There was just a single meeting with her mum.\n\n> from what I understood, it didn’t seem as if she was being protected at home from sexualised material.\n\n> It later came out that the daughter had also made a video at home pretending to give a blowjob to a dildo. It then emerged that she had made another video of herself pretending to pole dance.\n\nChecks out with other reports I've seen of early sexual behaviors among minors. Kids exposed to pornography at home or sexually abused + the very beginning of puberty (at 9-10 yo, more common nowadays due to hormonal disruption) = uncontrolled sexual behaviors.",

If the children are sharing deepfake tools among eachother, that's really important information.\n\nIf their family members gave it to them, then that's bog standard CPS situation.\n\nIf the child somehow found it themselves and are doing this, then they need professional intervention and evaluation.\n\nNo one should need to be on the other end of this, but what's being reported here is a symptom.",

Made by an 8 year old???\n\nThis is WELL before AI could simply faceswap you in video. 2021 was a time when the tech to \"nudify\" people had JUST landed, just fucking barely, in IMAGES.\n\nDeepfakes, like the actual \"old\" technology that everything is now named after, is SUPER hard on your computer and takes days to render even a few seconds of decent video, and usually requires thousands of reference photos.\n\nCreating a deepfake video with 3 people (which would require you to cut the video up into 3 separate sections and then edit them back together later) seems wildly unrealistic for an 8 year old girl. Something seems super fucked up in that household. The article also mentions that the girl made videos mimicking porn with sex toys, and dancing on a stripper pole - she's 8 years old, ffs. Something is super fucking off and weird about this story.",
