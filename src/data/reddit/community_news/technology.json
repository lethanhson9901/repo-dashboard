I know that automation helped a bit, but it was a big issue for at least a couple of years. There were also some arbitration panel issues, and a lot of the stuff that keeps things running become a mess.",

I actually started to learn how to use wikipedia. Eventually I started to learn things i never thought I would ever think about in a million years, I even learned things about myself reading articles.\n\n I firmly belive things like Wikipedia and PBS are humanity's single greatest achievements, they should be protected at all costs. If any one reading this feels like they want to help the world and humanity, this is a start in my opinion. Everyone should have access to all the worlds information and Wikipedia is providing us just that FOR FUCKING FREE WITH NO ADS OR ANY OTHER BULLSHIT!!!

Most people don’t realize that the US and China are currently in another space race, and this one will secure economic and military dominance in space for the latter half of the 21st century, which will be absolutely vital to our civilization. NASA’s Artemis program has their manned lunar landing program set in 2027. China has their manned lunar landing set in 2030, and they have been nailing every single one of their intermediate missions in the meantime.\n\nAsk yourself why China doesn’t try to cut corners and beat the US back before 2027. Because they know we won’t make it, thanks to MAGA and the growing anti-science movement in the US. That’s why. You may think “oh, but we were there first, so who cares?”. Strategy. We won the initial 100 yard dash in the first space race, but China will win the marathon. And when they do it, in high definition for the world to see, they will use it to stoke the fires of nationalism and Chinese superiority. And when they control the Helium-3 market in the latter half of this century and hold the world by the balls economically due to us having to kiss their ass for access to quantum computing, nuclear fusion and even the ability to continue using magnetic resonance imaging, we probably *still* won’t have learned our lesson.",

So they had a hard time retaining good IT staff, even before the court's dramatic shift to the right since 2020, which made it even harder to attract and retain good IT people.",

          "text": "Supreme Court Hacked, Proving Its Cybersecurity Is As Robust As Its Ethical Code\n\nMan pleading guilty to accessing Supreme Court database over and over again.\n\nBy Joe Patrice on January 14, 2026 1:01 pm\n\nRemember when the Supreme Court was absolutely consumed with figuring out who leaked the Dobbs draft opinion? They assigned the Marshal to investigate, brought in outside help, and made scores of employees sign affidavits. The response was immediate, muscular, and deeply unserious. The investigation did basically everything except interview the justices, because why interview anyone with both opportunity AND motive? Say, a justice credibly accused of leaking the results of other decisions who might have feared that colleagues would water down the maximalist draft before the case came down? No need to check in on anyone like that!\n\nA witchhunt ironically launched to defend an opinion based on witchhunters. And after several months, it inevitably fizzled. It was we’re all trying to find the guy who did this meme if the cops just accepted the man in the hot dog costume at his word.\n\nWell, it turns out they might’ve spent less time worrying about threats from inside the building and more time assessing how easily someone could waltz in through the digital front door.\n\nA 24-year-old from Springfield, Tennessee, named Nicholas Moore is set to plead guilty to hacking the Supreme Court’s electronic filing system. Not once or twice, but 25 times over a two-month span. If the Supreme Court didn’t know he was hanging out in the system for two months, is it still trespassing? When does adverse possession kick in?\n\nCourt Watch’s Seamus Hughes, who first spotted the filing, posted his reaction on X:\n\n￼\n\nIndeed.\n\n\nThe filing is notably spare on details. Maybe Jeanine Pirro learned that less is more if she needed to pursue an indictment without D.C. grand jurors responding with a resounding, “Are you kidding, lady?” The former Fox News personality who now serves as U.S. Attorney has had a rough go of it in D.C., between the juries refusing to convict and judges openly questioning whether her office understands basic Fourth Amendment principles — but now she’s found a case where the defendant is just going to plead guilty and save her the risk of another embarrassing fail.\n\nThe charge itself rests on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a statute prosecutors love the way DIYers love duct tape. The CFAA is intended to put sophisticated hackers in prison, but in practice, prosecutors deploy it whenever a computer makes someone feel bad. Its vague “unauthorized access” language has become a hammer used against people for logging into computers when company policy should have blocked access. It’s a computer crime law written for an era where our grasp of the technology came from movies like The Net, with that girl from the bus.\n\nDid Moore maliciously hack into the system, or did he just walk blithely through an open door? Unfortunately, it wouldn’t matter much under the CFAA. Prosecutors told TechCrunch they “cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.” But based on the bare-bones of the Information, the defendant only gained access to the electronic filing system as opposed to the Court’s emails or document management system. Moore presumably wasn’t getting access to internal deliberations or Clarence Thomas’s next billionaire-funded luxury vacation through the filing system.\n\nNot to downplay the seriousness of the breach — insider access to the filing system would afford access to any sealed documents — but this doesn’t sound like the start of a future Dobbs leak.\n\nThis marks the latest humiliating incident for the federal judiciary’s cybersecurity prowess. Last August, we learned that Russian government hackers had breached the broader federal court filing system. After years of claiming that PACER was a multibillion-dollar endeavor — before we learned that it was basically a federal judiciary slush fund — the federal judiciary belatedly committed to beefing up cybersecurity. This case serves as a reminder of how behind the times the judiciary was in 2023.\n\nAre they any better in 2026? If they approached cybersecurity with the same vim and vigor they brought to revamping the Court’s ethical code, let’s say no.\n\n\n￼Joe Patrice is a senior editor at Above the Law and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer.

I’d suggest that the simplest option is to have the loophole require that exceptions must grant the same nonstandard license used to the general public, and that that license may not include any provisions that *de facto* restrict the benefits of that license to the host.",

And right now the AI bubble/hardware shortage seems like a pretty good hook to pressure companies/people into cloud compute.\n\nJust look at Adobe, once you could buy a fixed version of their programs/suite and use it forever, until you absolutely need a new killer feature. And now it's a subscription and you own nothing. Didn't make Adobe less of an industry standard, they had a monopoly and unilaterally forced the conversion and people sucked it up.\n\nSame with Office365, if Microsoft wants to kill the standalone office suite, businesses will suck it up, because if they wanted to switch to libre office, then they already would've.\n\nEven hardware isn't safe. They don't *have* to make the next version of HDCP available on Linux. If you don't have access to the DRM necessary to decrypt, there's nothing you can do. Same with web browsers, Google controls basically ALL web browsers except Firefox through chromium. If they make changes to the next manifest, add DRM or other proprietary shit, that Firefox legally can't implement and gets all big web players to utilize that standard, it's game.\n\nSame with any other service/protocol, if you convince enough big players to make a move and business/customers can't wait or go through the pain of switching to an alternative it's game. Same reason why all new social media platforms fail, unless everyone agrees to switch over at the same time, then the people that do, don't have any peers to use it.\n\nI'm not saying all this doom and gloom is going to happen, but the big players have plenty of screws they could turn to make moves in a way that Linux and open source won't be the savior. Are there open source alternatives to Adobe? Yes. Will you get a job if you can't prove proficiency with the industry standard tools? Probably not. What if Rockstar decides to release GTA6 only in the cloud? Do you really think people can ignore their FOMO and boycott it? Like they did with HL2 when Valve forced steam and always on DRM onto people? Oh wait..",

But im still satisfied with its performance in gaming and anything else I do with it.\n\nSo... I just cloned my PC.

I can still run even somewhat newer games at 1440p and 60-120 fps and that will be good enough for me for a long time...\n\nOh, and i feel like most new games these days suck so hard that im really not missing much when i cant meet system reqs anymore.",

          "text": "Some details of this software and what it enables:\n\n>“Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) is a targeting tool designed to improve capabilities for identifying and prioritizing high-value targets through advanced analytics,” a user guide for ELITE obtained by 404 Media says. The tool aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend.\n>\n>One feature of ELITE is the “Geospatial Lead Sourcing Tab,” according to the user guide. This lets ICE see people it may potentially want to detain on a map interface, based on various criteria such as “Bios & IDs,” “Location,” “Operations,” and “Criminality.” An ICE officer can then select people one by one, or draw a shape on the map to see people in that selected area.\n>\n>ELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, immigration officers waited in three unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex in Woodburn. They went on to bust a driver’s window and pull a 45-year-old woman from a van, used ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her, and agents had the goal of making eight arrests per team per day, Oregon Live reported. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people in a “dragnet.” \n>\n>“One of our apps, it’s called ELITE. And so it tells you how many people are living in this area and what’s the likelihood of them actually being there,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit, identified in court records as JB, testified about the raid in early December. 404 Media purchased a transcript of JB’s testimony from the court. “It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address. ELITE notes the source of the address (such as the government agency that supplied it), and gives an “address confidence score.” One address confidence score example in the guide is 98.95 out of 100; another is 77.25 out of 100. This score is based on both the source of the address and how recent the data is, the user guide says. (ICE is paying skip tracers, private investigators, and bounty hunters to help verify peoples’ addresses.)\n>\n>...\n>\n>“These records give us behind-the-scenes insight into the kind of mass surveillance machine ICE is building with help from powerful tech companies like Palantir,” Laura Rivera, senior staff attorney at Just Futures Law, told 404 Media. “When combined with what we know from ICE testimony and other public information, it gives us a blueprint into how ICE is going into communities and identifying people for arrest in real-time.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>Palantir has worked with ICE for years and was focused on criminal investigations, supporting Homeland Security Investigations’ (HSI) Investigative Case Management (ICM) system. That changed in the second Trump administration, with Palantir now working on ICE’s deportation efforts. \n>\n>After participating in a three-week coding sprint, ICE updated an ongoing Palantir contract related to “Enforcement Prioritization and Targeting,” to “support the development of an accurate picture of actionable leads based on existing law enforcement datasets to allow law enforcement to prioritize enforcement actions,” according to an internal Palantir wiki previously obtained by 404 Media. The goal was to find the physical location of people marked for deportation, and Palantir said it believes its work with ICE is “intended to promote government efficiency, transparency, and accountability.”\n>\n>The leaked material described Palantir’s deportation-focused work as “concentrated on delivering prototype capabilities” and lasting around six months. It left open the room for more work with ICE, and said “Palantir has developed into a more mature partner for ICE.” Documents ICE published described Palantir’s work as building a tool called ImmigrationOS.\n\nThis situation, from a privacy standpoint, is looking worse and worse. It seems that we are well into the era of mass surveillance, and not just by the state but by private for-profit entities who are happy to sell to the state and anyone else who would want these data. It's pretty much guaranteed that all these systems are collecting data on all of us, and not just \"those people over there\".",

The Soviet Union routinely committed atrocities against their internal opposition by detaching their brutal reactions through a complex mechanism of sham trials and false legal processes, so they could pretend their gulag victims were 'appropriately' deserving.\n\nIt's actually kind of hard to convince even a militant to round up a hundred people and then, personally, walk past them and shoot a bullet in the back of a person's head a hundred times. After a while they start having nightmares and weird human feelings, even if they are otherwise true believers.

At some Central repository, because your mother tags your face with the Ring app, now you are recognizable anywhere a ring camera is installed. \n\nThe UK, Canada, Australia, etc. all need desperately to keep palantir and these systems out - once they are integrated or operational in your country long enough, they will exfiltrate your information back to the US data centers.  In Alberta, Edmonton I believe, a US company is trialing body cams that utilize AI and facial recognition automatically check faces against criminal databases. Do you think all that processing is happening entirely within Canada? I don't. Meanwhile, they've got a police force walking around indexing the positions every citizen in public that can be recognized. License plate recognition systems like Flock or those used by police forces are building databases of movement and association which could be queried after the fact. Remember those cell movement visualizations during the pandemic?

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our scoop. Here's more: \n\n404 Media has learned that Palantir is working on a tool for ICE that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier of each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address. \n\nAnd ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based. \n\nThis is the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground.\n\nAccording to the user guide 404 Media obtained, the tool, called ELITE, aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend. \n\nELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, agents waited in unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex before busting a driver’s window and pulling a 45-year-old woman from a van, using ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people [in a “dragnet.”](https://www.chronline.com/stories/oregon-lawyers-seek-court-order-to-halt-ice-warrantless-arrests,394264) \n\n“It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit identified in court records as JB, said about ELITE during testimony of the raid.\n\nMore details: [https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)",

If ICE produces a warrant, the Guard will stand by and intervene if ICE initiates violence. If ICE does *not* produce a warrant, they will be ordered to leave the property. \n  \nIf ICE becomes belligerent and/or attempts to incite violence with a Guardsman, the Guard is authorized to respond with deadly force. \n \nImportant: The Guard is there to police ICE, *not* citizens. That is the job of local police. The Guard is constitutionally barred from policing the citizenry. They *are* constitutionally sworn to defend American citizens from \"enemies, foreign and *domestic*\".  \n\nThis will accomplish a number of things at once. \n \n1) This positions America's military on the side of American citizens - not ICE and DHS.     \n2) The public perception and popularity of the National Guard will skyrocket.  \n3) Citizens will immediately become safter, as this will have a cooling effect on ICEs predilection for inciting violence.    \n4) ICE officers will be safter. Because citizens will feel less threatened and less likely to assert their 2nd Amendment options - diminishing the pretext Trump is trying to foment for declaring martial law.    \n5) Armed Guardsmen in uniform cannot be confused for 'domestic terrorists' - used  as a pretext for ICE attacking/killing them.     \n6) If ICE dares attack, injure, or kill National Guardsmen (God help them if they do), this will instantly position them as an enemy to our armed forces - and Hegseth, Noem, and Trump won't last long after that.      \n  \nEvery so-called 'Blue State' Governor needs to deploy the Guard in this manner, which will make the position of the Trump Administration much more precarious, rather than the other way around.\n  \nThis would instantly flip the script on Trump, and make his regime worry about HIS people getting violent with the Guard, creating pretext for the Armed Forces to step in and do something about them. I promise you, Generals and Commanders are just looking for a reason. \n\nIt needs to be done NOW.",

                  "text": "That would show up on the P&L as a return. The only conclusion to draw is that they saw a revenue drop along with the layoffs which combined with the AI service costs wiped out any return. It’s going to be a bit muddy because attribution is hard, but you’d expect to see a lift if it lived up to its promise. \n\nFWIW this is much more in line with what I’d expect — LLMs can be great productivity tools in some circumstances, but they’re productivity tools. The distribution of that productivity bump is invariably going to be lumpy, so without targeted application Id expect pretty low signal to noise when looking at  returns. They’re not replacing FTEs broadly across your org, which seems to have been some (most?) executives expectations. \n\nIf you look at organizations more broadly many haven’t even bothered rolling out old fashioned automation solutions for many tasks internally. Those organizations are likely the least well positioned to leverage LLMs, even though they have the most potential for a return. Their problems are mostly due to having weak technology orgs, and trying to roll out LLMs internally isn’t going to help them because they’ll have just as much issue with that as with rolling out the automation they could already have been leveraging for returns. \n\nLooking at the benefits of LLMs more specifically they’re just not suitable to be used unsupervised. Their output needs to be scrutinized by a real person, and if that validation takes as much or almost as much time as the person just doing the work in the first place then there’s no lift to be had either. It’s neat that an ML model can mostly do that work, but the benefits to the business are inherently limited by that need for supervision. \n\nSo while I think it’s obvious that LLMs will deliver increased productivity in the long term, I think the current market and investment are grossly disproportionate to those gains. We just aren’t going to see the wholesale displacement of workers by LLMs, absent some additional breakthroughs in model design and training. It’s going to be a loooooong time to get a return on investment at the current levels of spending in the industry. \n\nAll of that is a really long winded way to say that I’m just not surprised by this. There’s been far too much ‘irrational exuberance’ around LLMs and a correction is coming. We don’t know when, who will be impacted the most, or the full magnitude of the correction, but it is coming nonetheless.",

They can spend all day working with/belittling their agents, who will always respond in ways that reinforce the execs’ egos.  \n\nThey get food, shelter, and clothing, plus they get to watch their net value constantly go up, regardless of their actions. They can be loved or hated by their agents (whichever stokes their ego more), but it doesn’t matter because they will always be right, and their ideas will always be the bestest ideas in the whole world.  \n\nThis is the only solution because they are clearly insane.  Any rational person would believe that money does not outweigh societal health and happiness, but execs that chase infinite growth are mentally ill.  They should be treated as such.",

A couple of things I do like about AI:\n\n* As a software engineer, its advanced autocomplete is great for speeding up tedious, repetitive tasks\n* Again as an SWE, I love it for generating unit tests that I just briefly review to ensure they make sense and cover what I want them to cover\n* I can actually give advanced, more natural commands to Gemini on my phone for doing several Google Home tasks and it executes them much more reliably than Google Assistant did\n* If I have to write something, it's cool to get little examples generated to get my own creative juices flowing\n* It's good at summarizing static documents\n\nSo in summary, AI is great as a companion where you're willing to oversee and correct it, not as a Jarvis-esque presence that can automate and take care of whole portions of your life reliably or fully replace humans.",

For coding tasks, business productivity type stuff, summarization, etc. LLMs are quite useful - not a replacement for real human labor, but an excellent tool. \n\nYou can connect LLMs to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that allow more direct control of computer systems mediated by normal, human language. That is hugely powerful.\n\nFor instance, at work, I can use an LLM to query a database in databricks, find whatever tables are relevant to my query, and build a complicated reporting dashboard with HTML elements & interactive features in like... idk 20 minutes? And that's without initially knowing where the data is stored. And without having to type a single SQL query or line of HTML or Python. I am a technical-enough user that I could do all those things with enough time and research, but LLM/MCP server connection improves my abilities several fold. Other folks who aren't technical and couldn't do it even with research are enabled with that capability as well. That is extremely useful.\n\nMy friend built a subagent that can look at a picture of a powerpoint graph or even a hand-drawn graph locate a data table with the information that would be needed for whatever is being communicated (asking questions if it isn't sure), verify its accuracy, summarize what assumptions/filters the analyst used to create it, modify it with new assumptions, and publish it to a Databricks dashboard or Jupyter notebook connected to live data sources in the Databricks data warehouse. \n\nLLMs suck at a lot of things, but writing them off as useless is like folks who said ARPANET/the early internet was useless because all you could do was talk to people at other universities and send text when a phonecall/telegram/mailed package would be basically just as good or better.",

Recipes based on what it sees? Can we tie that to something they can put in their dry food pantry? Reminder when important items are low? Can it send a shopping list to their phone automatically?

How do we actually make this seem smart?\" And let the R&D department really spend a couple of years making it feel like some scifi magic before releasing a product that uses it.\n\nBut no, they just rushed a bunch of random shit out, that basically boils down to: a generic chatbot is now embedded and unavoidable on (enter any consumer electronic or software here).\n\nMy phone can do that already. The AI most companies are shoving around are simply redundant at this point, in most consumer goods. Even the thing you're talking about, can be done with an AI on my phone.

The goal was to exacerbate existing societal divisions rather than favor one party exclusively.\n* **Shift to Favoring Republicans:** Investigations into the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections concluded that Vladimir Putin ordered campaigns specifically designed to assist Donald Trump and the Republican Party while harming Democratic candidates.\n* **Targeted Disinformation:** In 2020 and 2024, Russia focused on spreading misleading allegations against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, often through \"proxies\" and \"troll farms\" to undermine Democratic support.",

Think about that: A presidential candidate conspired with Russian officials at Trump Tower to interfere in the 2016 election in exchange for lifting sanctions. Obama knew about it, but did nothing. We wait for Mueller/Comey to present all their findings, in the expectation that a future Democratic DOJ would indict the Trump family for the crimes -- and zilch. Biden let them go scot-free. \n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that Biden Chamberlain allowed an insurrectionist to illegally run for and steal the presidency in the 2024 election, in direct violation of 14th Amendment, Section 3. We're currently under an illegitimate Presidency, because Democrats refused to enforce the Constitution, despite controlling the Senate for 4 years.",

You can look at the political opposition and the primary challenges and things to see other parts of the conversation and the moment, but rarely is a president a poor reflection of the zeitgeist of the American elite. Since you want to limit it to the end of the roaring 20s at the far end, you push out guys like Mickinely.\n\nTypically someone as stupid as he is doesn't get that far. You get minor and major leagues. You get a junior varsity. Obviously he showed us that because *technically* you don't need to be elected to office at least once before, it is probably a good idea. Corrupt? sure. Plenty I'd say 1 in 4 are so criminally corrupt as to warrant legal action. However the revolving door to becoming a lobbyist isn't criminal corruption. Just the weird America version of political patronage and spoils systems.\n\nNarcissistic? Sure. It wasn't just Nixon and LBJ who had to center themselves in everything.\n\nCruel? Most politicians are just agnostic to cruelty. They are negligent to it, not terribly overtly cruel. It doesn't serve their other aims. Blowing political capital in hurting others for no reason is quite rare. Sure Nixon comes back up here with his petty vendettas and shit. However Nixon was very bright.\n\nAll of these men reflect the moment. They all reflect tens of millions of men just like them who are nobodies. Reflect their political desires and viewpoints. That is certainly the case with Trump.\n\n1/3 of America is all of those things. However we're learning the hardway that having someone be elected to a local office and use the executive power is probably a good first step. Trump is bald faced democracy run amok.

They have all shown clearly that they don’t respect the rule of law and the constitution means nothing. Steven Miller said in an interview that there are way too many illegals to give them due process. That the courts would be swamped and it would take years. So they feel perfectly fine breaking the law and ignoring search warrants and due process. If you don’t like a law you change it. You don’t get to just ignore it. Especially while spouting propagandas about law and order. They are evil and only follow laws that benefit them. An election will not benefit them.",

And now PJM threatens rolling blackouts if they don't get their way to service the only customers they care about.\n\nThe states need to kick PJM's ass and force the data companies to stop subsidizing their growth onto people in other states.",

There have been a lot of solar projects locally to help beef up the micro-grid situation too.\n\n\nBack then we also used to lose power a lot whenever a strong enough blizzard would blow through. That doesn't happen anymore. \n\n\nMy area was one of those areas which survived the 2002 Great Blackout, because an engineer at the local Hydroelectric plant managed to isolate the region of the grid I was on before a cascading failure could spread. Hopefully with all of this electric grid demand, the power companies will focus on forcing the data centers onto their own power sources rather than whacking homes and businesses without their own power generation. ",

The system itself is shaky; you hear of things like finding cartons of dropped votes by the side of the road which would immediately invalidate the elections in just about any other nation on Earth. \n\nSo yeah.

Let’s call a spade a spade and some number of far right winger people are going to exist in the minority.  In my opinion that is still true, but how does this turd have so much support?  Cognitive dissonance is very painful for the human mind.  Wildly populist asshole runs for office and is elected. Let’s say I was once an uninformed Trump voter. Once it becomes clear that many of his actions, beliefs, qualifications, racism, sexism, hates everybody actually exists I have a thought.  I don’t believe that stuff, what the fuck.  Now I have cognitive dissonance - my personal beliefs do not align with my actions of being a Trump supporter and that is EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE to the brain. While anybody can just say “you need to just revaluate” it is actually pretty difficult, ESPECIALLY if you don’t mentally step back and realize it is going on.  The brain really likes shortcuts and the quickest most efficient way to stop feeling uncomfortable is to rationalize the actions you take to the beliefs you hold.  When Trump says things like “What you see and hear is not really what’s happening” and trying to just discredit everything negative said about him it is a form of confirmation bias.  This leads to me, the uninformed Trump voter experiencing cognitive dissonance an easy way out.  I don’t even have to SEEK OUT reasons to justify my action of supporter human poop.  It’s literally delivered to me via twitter, truth, fox, etc. multiple times per day thanks to our information delivery systems.  Add in AI, strategic disinformation, flooding the zone, and on and on and it is weaponized psychology.  So yes, while I still emotionally feel like people are idiots I think we all need to collectively understand this type of stuff literally has treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy.  So at surface level people are idiots but realistically they don’t understand they are being conned because unless you are actually able to be aware of what you are experiencing, which most people won’t.  Usually takes a therapist to help you identify this type of shit.  It’s not new and has been around in some form for a very long time.  Great for authoritarian rule.",

If you consistently do business with a company, you have power. You can use sites like [opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org) to see what a company funds and where your money is really going.\n\nTrade with Schwab? Move elsewhere like Fidelity. Get booze from wannabe Confederate states and all else is equal? Be adventurous, and try something new. New Balance can be replaced with Brooks. It’s not hard to find alternatives for Goya, Roark (which owns Subway, Jimmy John's, Arby's), and Koch (which owns Brawny, Angel Soft, Dixie). You don't have to spend more or buy less, just differently.\n\nIf you have disposable income, consider the tax benefits of donating to nonprofits fighting the regime like the [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/litigation/), [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-cases-against-trump-tracker/), or [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/). And if you invest, consider DEMZ or an ESG fund\n\nNexstar and Sinclair got pummeled, and they reinstated Jimmy Kimmel. Real, individual people did that. There's no reason  WWE or Uline can't be next.\n\nCompletely avoiding companies that at least partially lean Republican is hard. But there’s a big difference between massive GOP donors (Chevron/Conoco) vs neutral or even Democrat-leaning ones (Circle K/Costco). Good is not the enemy of perfect. One less kidnapped child is one less kidnapped child, and one less murder is one less murder",

It's unclear what the agreement entailed.\n> \n* There was no indication that either employee shared social security data with the group, the filing said.\n> \n* The Social Security Administration referred both employees for potential Hatch Act violations, per the filing.\n\n> Zoom out: The Social Security Administration was unable to determine exactly what data were shared via the unapproved third-party server or whether the data remains on the server.\n> \n* The disclosures, filed in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, were among a list of \"corrections\" to the record.\n> \n* The SSA believed its statements \"to be accurate at the time they were made, and they are largely still accurate,\" the DOJ's lawyers wrote in the filing.",

No doubt this was quid pro quo for Musk after he put up nearly 300 million dollars to help Trump win the election. In Trump’s mind, this was probably a small favor since he knew plans were already laid out for establishing a dictatorship. I feel kind of silly for saying things that seem a bit too obvious.

          "text": "Some key issues:\n\n>Efforts to gut the federal workforce by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency significantly derailed operations at a Pentagon tech team with a key U.S. military role, according to materials reviewed by The Intercept.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Defenders of DOGE, including Musk, have claimed the project solely ferreted out fraud, waste, and abuse. But according to a December 2025 contracting memo from the Defense Information Systems Agency, DOGE’s tactics caused major problems at the Pentagon’s IT office — which is core to the operation of the U.S. military.\n>\n>The memo describes how DISA’s Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Enterprise Directorate, known as J6, was hobbled by DOGE cuts to such an extent that it was unable to obtain necessary software. This unit is responsible for maintaining secure channels that keep the Pentagon connected to military assets around the world, including nuclear capabilities.\n>\n>“During calendar year 2025, the DISA/J6 program office has been unexpectedly and significantly impacted by Government programs that incentivized personnel separation or extended periods of leave,” the memo reads, “e.g., Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments, Paid Parental Leave.”\n>\n>A second DISA memo notes that the Deferred Resignation Program resulted in the departure of an officer responsible for an important Pentagon cloud-computing contract, resulting in that contract expiring entirely. The DOGE-induced staffing shortage resulted in a situation, according to the memo, where DISA’s systems faced “extreme risk for loss of service” across the Department of Defense.\n>\n>While DISA operates behind the scenes, its globe-spanning networks are critical to the armed forces, explained DISA J6’s then-director Sharon Woods in a Pentagon-produced June 2025 interview: “Command, Control, Communications, and Computers — it is what underlies everything and the department’s ability to communicate with itself.” Asked what would happen on a day where DISA J6 couldn’t operate, Woods replied, “In my mind, it cripples the Department [of Defense]… This is really a mission where failure is not an option.”\n\nGiven how central information technology is to modern conflicts, slashing and burning the departments and people who are tasked with providing these critical connections and infrastructure is foolhardy to say the least. \n\nIt looks like this approach is almost the same approach as Elon took with Twitter when he took over. The difference here of course is that Twitter was a useful but ultimately optional social media platform for information where outages and bugs are annoying but rarely life threatening whereas with DISA there is far more at stake.",

          "text": "Every technology investment follows the same basic principles. First you have a small group explore the technology and do some demonstrators. Then you measure how well it functioned and stack it up against comparable technology/products/processes. You look at things like learning curve, support in the community, commercial support, cost to train, cost to migrate, and all your normal ROI estimates. Then maybe you have some pilot users try out the tools in the real world and closely monitor the outcomes. Plan for an 18 month to 3 year transition (or longer because of holdouts, entrenched legacy tech stacks, prioritization, and leadership turnover). \n\nInstead everyone went with \"feels like 20%\" and assumed they'd be quickly into some gains because AI is so interactive and conversational. They're not treating it as infrastructure intensive, training intensive, or realizing there's still a learning curve and a time to proficiency to deal with. Meanwhile they're also laying off seasoned developers who are pointing out the flaws in the strategy and foregoing hiring on junior devs because the savings is just one more quarter away. \n\nThen there are the costs. Companies always have this bait and switch on costs. First you go free tier, get individuals using the product on their own. Maybe you have a low cost license, low enough that some hobbyists and professionals might buy in just to \"get a leg up\". Once they spread the gospel to their friends and companies you start demoing it and giving out some free licenses for evaluation purposes. Maybe you renew those licenses a few times to get teams hooked and further into the sunk cost side of things. They invest their time and when it comes down to the end of the evaluation they don't want to give up the last 6 months of work they've done and the production code they shipped (even though they weren't supposed to). Nor do they want to tell the other teams that were adopting on the side that they'll have to stop. \n\nSo now the product has a foothold and the contract negotiations start. Maybe the sales people go easy and it's a cheap license $20 bucks a month per dev, or 100-250k for the whole enterprise. Company leadership thinks it's a steal and worth the investment. Then after the contracts are signed the product gets slated for use in all the major parts of the company's product line. Once entrenched it will be hard and expensive to get rid of.\n\nIn the meantime the company who sold the product is BLEEDING cash because they're taking a loss in trade for higher adoption and a growing client list. The client list, even if those clients are only demoing the product, is what draws in investors and new clients. At some point though they have to start balancing the books. That means 1. Selling to a competitor 2. Increasing licensing costs. Regardless this often means big bumps to companies who are using the product after the initial contract ends and has to be renegotiated. Sometimes those bumps are massive, doubling or tripling the cost of use. Imagine if you had a floating license for 25 users spread across the company and the vendor does away with that option and starts charging by CPU/GPU use, number of requests, or volume of data, how many end-users your product interacts with, or any number of other metrics that turns a $100k license into a $1m+. Drop in the bucket for a large company maybe, but devastating to smaller companies. Plus it comes at a huge cost now if you want to switch to a comparable cheaper product because either you didn't abstract yourself enough from the service and/or you'll have to maintain contracts on two product lines for the duration of the migration process (not a simple, oh just flip this on and that off). \n\nThis is why some companies spend 5-10 years trying to get out from under old technology and some keep old technology around for decades because it's too big, too old, and too critical to swap. Plus telling the story to investors is hard without numbers to say how it will benefit the company to do such a swap. If you tell an investor \"we need to spend $2m to unwind from this stack that will now cost us $1m in licensing\" they say pay the licensing and save $1m now, they don't care about next year or even next quarter necessarily. They want their return now. If you tell them you won't make their targets this quarter with the new tech like they wanted then they'll trigger a sell off and you'll lose millions or billions in equity. \n\nThe result is you end up in shitty and expensive contracts you can't get out of or you do some calculus to do the hard thing to get onto something else. This often means cutting labor to hit quarterly targets. And you justify the labor cuts by talking up the benefits of the technology shifts you are taking on and how it will (eventually) improve productivity. \n\nWhen that doesn't happen you reorg.",

How exactly is that a sign that AI is useless to implement? If im a business man, im just going to compare what those 12% did to what i did and adjust accordingly. I mean AI is only just recently good enough to do actual work with so of course early adoption is going to lead to a large portion of businesses not using the tech to its full effect. Everyone in the comments seems very short sighted and pessimistic because of their inherent anti-AI bias. But unless you fell for the obvious marketing hype, these numbers are really not bad. AI is a tool like every other technology. Some things are instantly helpful like the internet but other tech needs time to settle in. Actually, even the internet needed time to settle in but no one remembers that i guess",

And, with the artist furor over AI growing every day, it’s no surprise that the company has decided to take a stand against it. In a Reddit post, Bandcamp announced that AI-generated content would not be permitted on the platform and would be subject to removal.\n\n>The guidelines leave little room for interpretation. In the post, the company says that “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp.” It also prohibits using AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles, similar to a rule implemented by Spotify in September. The support team also encourages people to use the site’s reporting tool to flag any music that “appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI.”\n\n>In the thread, Bandcamp support also pointed people to the company’s Acceptable Use and Moderation policy page, which includes an explicit ban on scraping content or using audio uploaded to Bandcamp for training AI. It says that users agree, “Not to train any machine learning or AI model using content on our site or otherwise ingest any data or content from Bandcamp’s platform into a machine learning or AI model.”\n\n>Other platforms, such as Spotify and Deezer, have taken a much more conservative approach to combating AI-generated content, focusing primarily on imitation or relying on labels rather than bans. iHeartRadio pledged never to play AI-generated music or use AI DJs in late November. But Bandcamp is the first major music platform to outright ban AI-generated content.\n\nDirect link to Bandcamp's Blog Announcement: [https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/)",

Most modern music production, including major artists, relies heavily on virtual instruments, mainly for economic and productivity reasons.\n\nMusicians can’t suddenly be put in the position of creating music as if it were the 60s again. Everyone uses quantization, drum replacement, samples, time-shaping algorithms, MIDI arrangements for most percussive and string instruments, vocal harmonization tools, pitch correction, wave-shaping, etc. These are all algorithmic processes.\n\nSo where do we draw the line? Do we delete all music created in the last two decades? That feels like a pointless exercise to me. Avoiding AI detection is trivial anyway, Replacing stems with drums and bass from something like a Toontrack product and re-quantizing the MIDI would already make an AI-generated song extremely hard, or nearly impossible to detect. Just because someone clicked “generate” inside a DAW using a couple of tools, is that suddenly more valid?\n\nWith that said, I’m not a fan of fully prompted, end-to-end AI-generated songs. But I do think musicians are going in the wrong direction with this heated discussion. A more productive approach would be to clearly define when AI is being used as a production tool versus when it is generating a full song from scratch, and focus regulation and labeling there.\n\nBlanket bans like this feel disconnected and honestly a bit dishonest, compared to how music is actually made today. Unless people want to start making records on tape again.",

It is mostly because people don't want to live in rural areas.\n\n\n\n*Edit person below claims I blocked them, but I haven't. Is Reddit bugged again?\n\n\nAnyway, rural being remote and undesirable for educated professionals to relocate to is the number one thing driving the lack of medical access in these communities. Ask any medical recruiter (my wife and I met with dozens as we decided where to settle down).\n\n\nA parallel point that a state setting dog shit policy that causes poor medical outcomes for a specific subset of the population doesn't disprove that. That issue exacerbates the underlying issue. Without looking at the data, my hypothesis would be that remote communities in Alabama are even more under served then their counter parts in states with sensible legislation. This user is confounding two different things. They also cherry picked one set of data from one state on one subset of patients. I could do the same to show that US healthcare is better than Canadian healthcare.\n\n\nTeleoperated robots that could serve remote communities (the thing Bernie is complaining about in the OP), could help aliviate both of these issues. If Bernie's point is that the profit driven American model of medical service sucks, then yah, he is right, but that has nothing to do with teleoperated robots. This government was never going to provide universal health care and even if it did it wouldn't solve the under served issue in rural communities. Teleoperated robots at least have a chance of providing medical care to some people that wouldn't have had it otherwise.",

I'm in a rural area of the mountains in the South in the US, and we're well staffed with doctors and nurses, because the area is gorgeous, and middle-aged and close-to such age professionals that move away from the city rarely can stand to move back.\n\nBut out in the flat, boring, awful Midwest and beyond and Texas? Flat, hot, humid Alabama? Yeah, from what I understand, even paying all they can afford, getting people to move there is not exactly an alluring proposition.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to move away from the city but are worried about medical access, go somewhere pretty where the temperatures don't get crazy high or crazy low. You'll find well staffed hospitals.",

Well educated, rich doctors on average want to live in the city with city amenities, culture, and access, not live in a mansion in the country.\n\nWe already heavily subsidize rural doctors, and it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't even an American problem.

And once they start replacing the rural openings that people won't fill with robots, they start replacing the suburban and urban openings with them, too.  Now it's harder to find a full time job anywhere.  Think about it like replacing four cashiers with one cashier and four self checkout registers - that's three cashier jobs gone.\n\nIf the goal is to move toward a future where only like 1/4 or 1/5 of us have to work, and/or that those who have to work are basically just babysitting robots and sanity checking them or correcting issues, and working 20-30 hour weeks - that's amazing.  That's great.  If, and only if, we solve the problem of \"okay, but can you afford to pay your bills on ONE job\" and \"okay, but where are the people who don't have jobs because there aren't enough jobs going to live?\"\n\nSolve THOSE problems, and then let's replace everything with Rosie the Robot.",

There's almost nothing to do. The school systems are abysmal. Decent shopping - whether it's for necessities or luxeries - is really hard to find. My guess is you could offer healthcare providers willing to work out there 20-30% more than they'd make in a major city (Huntsville, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, or even Auburn & Tuscaloosa) and they'd still turn it down because the quality of life sucks. Pretty much the only people who live there are people whose families have *always* been there. \n\nSo the \"real solution\" is more than just increasing enrollment in nursing & medical schools or offering better pay/incentives for the healthcare providers.

This is similar to how the robots work that are commonly used for surgeries (in most cases the surgeon is nearby, but the concept is roughly the same). \n\nThe technology itself isn't completely unproven; I don't know the technical specifics of these particular systems, but the surgical robots usually have a force-feedback mechanism so that the operator has real-time feedback similar to the physical feedback they would get if they were standing in the room. \n\nAnd of course, all medical technology has to undergo fairly rigorous certifications in terms of fail-safes etc. before you're allowed to use it at all. \n\nObviously it's your (or any other patient's) right to reject a procedure if you/they are uncomfortable with it, that's not dispute. But I don't think it's entirely fair to call the technology unproven as if it's like a brand-new and dangerous technology; it's a new derivative of a technology that has existed for a long time and is already well-proven in even more technically challenging applications (laparoscopic surgery). \n\nWhat Sanders was actually criticizing, which is much more important than the specifics of the technology itself, is that the robots are a band-aid on the bullet wound of not having enough rural OBGYNs. Like the ultrasound robots are probably a good thing in and of themselves (compared to the status quo where patients would need to travel to get an ultrasound), but just being able to remotely do ultrasounds isn't a replacement for the full suite of care that an OBGYN provides. And it would be nice if Dr. Oz (don't we all wish that was a joke?) would be focused on fixing that instead of patting himself on the back over this, which is at best a half-baked nonsolution to the bigger problem.\n\nedit: I looked up how the system actually works, and there is still a nurse or assistant who actually sets up the robot and is in the room the whole time. The system basically just allows the doctor sitting somewhere else to move the probe around to image whatever they want to image. https://www.adechotech.com/en/melody-ultrasound-robot/",
