Flarum is forum software, so if you want a chat client, it might not be the best option. I like the idea of combining services, though, since Discord does something that's kind of unique.",

We're watching the infrastructure for a privatized digital ID system get built piece by piece, and it's happening through \"think of the children\" legislation that's politically impossible to oppose. Discord's implementation likely involves liveness detection, document scanning, and facial recognition, all of which create honeypots of sensitive data that are *incredibly* valuable to both state and corporate actors.\n\nWhat's particularly insidious is how these systems create a ratchet effect. Once the verification infrastructure exists, scope creep is inevitable. Today it's age verification for NSFW servers; tomorrow it's tying your government ID to every online interaction. Palantir's entire business model is building surveillance tools that integrate disparate data sources—connecting your Discord activity to your real identity is exactly the kind of graph analysis they specialize in. And unlike government surveillance, there's no FOIA requests, no oversight, and the terms of service you agreed to probably already waived most of your rights.\n\nThe tech industry has successfully convinced regulators that third-party verification is the \"privacy-preserving\" solution, but that's a false dichotomy. We had decades of pseudonymous internet that worked fine. The real agenda is eliminating anonymity entirely because anonymous users are harder to monetize, harder to control, and harder to build dossiers on. Every \"safety\" feature that requires unmasking is another brick in the wall of a corporate panopticon that would make Bentham blush.",

They re-strategize and re-release. This is a PR stunt meant to quiet the angry masses. If you are concerned with your privacy, you should definitely get rid of your cameras. The only reason we haven’t is because we cannot yet afford to replace them, so yanking them right now would create an even greater security risk. They have really screwed up with this though by leaving people like us in this situation. There is still going to be litigation on this regardless of what they say",

Reolink can handle this for you, and a lot of people are comfortable with that for the convenience. Their app is also better than the standalone IP camera viewer apps I've tried.",

I downloaded the app and tried to log in. Even though I had my password, it insisted on sending a code via email. But then the email said I was using a different device so I would have to “verify”\nMy account. Keep in mind I already have a password and the ability to receive a code through my verified email.\nTurns out the only ways I can get into the account now are to give them a copy of my government ID, or let them do a biometrical scan of my face.\nI’m considering just ripping the camera down.",

The pretense of \"F-f-for the children!\" is paper thin at best. \n\nThis is just one of many steps into digital surveillance and gross overreach that are going to be taken in the near future as the Technocrats and Governments around the world realize how much they can get from us. \n\nPrivacy is vanishing before our very eyes.\n\nGod, I hate to sound like a tinfoil-hatter but it's becoming impossible to ignore just how much we're being surveilled in our daily lives. \n\nThere is no space that they will not try to take.\n\nEven if I were to pretend they were sincere about PROTECT THE KIDS it still isn't the job of the Government or any Corporation to do so. That's what their parents are for. \n\nIt isn't anyone else's fault that Deborah threw an iPad at her 9 year old to shut them up. That's her failure and her responsibility.\n\nEDIT: This blew up and my notifications are a circus of bad faith morons making some Olympic leaps so here's a few little clarifiers for you.\n\n-Sit your asses down and have a thorough conversation (or several) with your kids/teens about online safety. My parents did this with my brother and I and they didn't even grow up in the internet age. You can do it. You know more than your parents did, and have access to more tools than they had, too. Teach your kids about boundaries and how to set them. When and how to walk away. How to identify and report inappropriate content, and how to Block people. Teach them about identifying information and stress the importance of never ever sharing it. Stranger danger. Let them ask questions and make sure they know that they can and should come to you if something feels off.\n\n-Just don't put them onto the unrestricted internet. Little Jacob doesn't need an iPad. If you must put a screen in front of him, make it something safe like a goddamn Nintendo. \n\n-I am not American but I see what's happening there and understand that the rise of Fascism and this increasing demand for surveillance are not coincidental. The role of Discord in Nepal's recent revolution should be something to consider in the conversation about Discord wanting your ID.\n\n-For the love of God, no, I am not a Pedo Defender. Just a gal who doesn't feel the need to fork over every last piece of identifying information she has to faceless corporations and whoever they want to forward it to. Or, you know, occurrences like the data breach Discord Dearest suffered in October. I can remember that far back and so can you! \n\n-If I refuse to submit my ID, my account gets labeled as a Teen Account. I'm 30something. That doesn't protect kids.\n\n-The Government and Corporations don't give a damn about you or your kids. \"Protect the Children!!\" And \"THIS IS TO FIGHT TERRORISM!!\" are smokescreens used to sneak other, more sinister agendas under your nose. God fucking dammit I sound like a Hatter again.\n\n-The Trojan Horse looked like a Pretty Pretty Horsie. It was more than that. Go read about it and then do some thinking, ok?",

Discord showed up and just said “instant messaging and voice chat for gamers that doesn’t suck and a bunch of cool features most people won’t use for free”. Everyone rejoiced.\n\nYears later Discord kinda became an internet cornerstone. For a ton of people it replaced their Xbox and PlayStation friends lists and party features, became the dominant communication platform for PC gamers and niche hobbyists, and it replaced traditional web forums. \n\nYears later the guys that invested in Discord wanted to start seeing ROIs. Then we got Nitro, features nobody asked for, updates pushed faster than the QA team could work, pressure from governments to regulate things and give their spies backdoors into the platform, and just gradual enshitification.\n\nThe only way we can move on from Discord is to go back to self hosting small web forums and wait for Discord to die and another platform to take its place.",

Requiring users to submit even more sensitive personal data under these circumstances is not only unreasonable, it demonstrates a serious lack of awareness of the trust you have already damaged.\n\nBefore demanding additional identification from users, your organization should first explain—clearly and transparently—how such a breach was allowed to occur, what accountability measures were taken, and why users should believe their data will be handled safely this time. At present, there is no credible justification for asking users to assume even greater risk.\n\nTrust is not restored by collecting more data. It is restored by demonstrating competence, accountability, and respect for user security. Until those standards are met, this policy change feels less like a security measure and more like a liability transfer from your organization onto your users.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this requirement or, at minimum, provide a secure alternative that does not involve submitting highly sensitive identification documents.\n\nThis policy, as it stands, is unacceptable.\"",

We do not use any age restricted features at all and will be fine with 'teen mode.' \n\nhonestly it is kind of pathetic from the global software industry.

          "text": "Let me tell you all a little Discord story. Back in 2017 I was attending Blizzcon as I had for many years. One thing about Blizzcon people don't realize is how many epic after parties there are in the area. Heat Ultra Lounge is one of the closest nightclubs and usually has a party hosted by one group or another. Usually a private party where the host is a Blizzcon regular or a PC vendor running promotions (for example in 2015 the party was sponsored by Predator). It's known for being one of the best after parties of the con.\n\nSo in 2017 when I was attending Blizzcon with a friend who had never been before, I wanted to make sure she got the chance to go to this party. But this particular year in typical corporate fashion, Discord rented out the entire venue so they could control who got in. Fortunately I have a friend who's married to a pro gamer and the pro gamers were all given VIP passes. Since they had the VIP passes they didn't need their regular tickets and offered to give them to me and my friend which we gladly accepted.\n\nBut when we got to the door, Discord (not Heat's own bouncers) turned us away. The reason? Our names weren't on the tickets. I asked why that mattered, I could have the ticket owners come vouch and the club would still check our IDs anyway. Still they argued and refused. So I reached out to Mallory Loar, the head of Discords events who I had previously been in contact with. But now when we had a problem, suddenly crickets. We never got in.\n\nNow at the end of the day, it's just a party, not a big deal. But it's more the principal of the thing - that a big company can come and just reserve a venue that usually hosts fan-run or sponsored parties, then decide themselves who has access to a Blizzcon tradition. And adding bureaucratic rules that make no sense with an unresponsive support team.\n\nIt showed me just how corporate Discord had become. I've long since been done with them.",

                  "text": "Yep. Freezing your credit is free BY LAW. And it is NOT the same thing as a “credit lock” which is a paid product that the bureaus named in an intentionally misleading way. \n\nETA:Actually as a SME in this space (financial crimes) who used to do identity theft investigations and restorations professionally, I’m gonna throw in a few other PSAs:\n\nGet an IRS Identity Protection PIN; make sure you have a SIM card PIN enabled (can do this on your phone or with your wireless carrier, do not make the PIN related your DOB, kid’s DOB, address, or SSN) and some carriers call this a “port-out PIN”; register for an account with your state’s unemployment division (1 SSN can be registered per state, and registering yours proactively allows you to “plant your flag” and avoid a frustrating, time consuming situation down the road). I believe you can also still place a fraud flag on your Everify account to reduce your risk of employment related ID theft.\n\nLifelock is a scam. They’ve not only had data breaches, they have been fined millions by regulators for deceptive advertising practices. Identity theft insurance is unnecessary for 99.9% of cases, don’t fall for it. By federal law you are not responsible for debt incurred with your info without your consent; identity theft insurance (“$5M policy!” Ad copy) is pretty much irrelevant because the end result of successfully disputing the IDT accounts is them being removed from your credit files. \n\nSpeaking of deceptive advertising, these companies use insane fear mongering to make you think identity theft will ruin your life. It won’t, in 99% of cases is a headache that is resolved by phone calls and paperwork. Tedious and time consuming? Yeah. Life ruining. No.\n\nYes, all of our data is leaked, and it will continue to be leaked and show up on the dark web. Paid services that monitor for this don’t reduce your risk. They just let you know that your info, like everyone else’s, appeared on a darknet market or forum. Yeah, and? What value is that info to you? Everyone’s info is there, being posted, bought, sold. Companies are not incentivized to protect your data, this is just our reality now.\n\nThe single best effort you can make to reduce your risk is freezing your credit files. Fraud alerts are NOT the same thing and if you freeze your credit, you have no need for fraud alerts. Freezing is a much better protection. It’s easy to freeze via the bureaus sites —make an account, you can thaw them instantly via the account. If you insist on a paid product, there’s value in credit monitoring, get the most basic option; youve probably gotten a breach letter that offers you free monitoring, too.\n\nIf you want to view your credit reports, annualcreditreport(dot)com is site mandated by federal law to access them for FREE. Scores will always cost money, but you are entitled to access copies of your report for FREE. Beware of scam sites impersonating this site and the credit bureau sites.\n\nBe aware that these subscription products that will “fix your identity theft for you” function like insurance.  If you enroll after your identity theft has occurred, they’ll tell you they can’t handle it on your behalf. Theyll still do it, but they’ll charge you the retail rate (hundreds $). Read the terms of any identity theft product before you buy it. Scams abound, bc the general public doesn’t understand anything about identity theft.",

          "text": "The Palantir connection is worth being concerned about, but people are focused on the wrong layer of the problem. Even if Discord partners with the most ethical, privacy-respecting age verification company imaginable, the fundamental issue remains: you cannot verify someone's age without collecting identity data, and any database of identity data will eventually be breached.\n\nThis isn't theoretical. Last October, Discord's own previous age verification vendor (a company called 5CA) was hacked. Attackers stole roughly 70,000 government-issued ID images along with names, emails, IP addresses, and support transcripts. The group claimed access to 8.4 million support tickets and 520,000 age verification tickets total. That's just one case. In 2024, AU10TIX, which handles identity verification for TikTok, Uber, and X, had admin credentials sitting exposed on Telegram for over a year. Anyone could log in and download driver's licenses. When 404 Media contacted them, AU10TIX claimed the credentials were old and revoked. They still worked.\n\nSo Discord is now rolling out mandatory age verification globally starting in March, months after their own vendor proved that these databases are targets. And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. Other platforms have successfully challenged age verification mandates in court on First Amendment grounds. Discord chose to build this system unprompted, creating exactly the data honeypot that people are right to worry about.\n\nThe Persona/Thiel angle makes it worse because Palantir's entire business is aggregating data from multiple sources to build profiles on individuals. Thiel's Founders Fund invested in Persona. Palantir earned $1.8 billion in government contracts in 2025 building surveillance tools for ICE, including a system called ELITE that maps deportation targets using data pulled from health agencies. When people worry that age verification data could end up feeding surveillance infrastructure, that's not paranoia. It's looking at who's involved and what they've already built.",

There is no requirement that any photo or video ever be sent back to discord or their partners. So anyone verifying they are of age in such a way would not be sending any of their private info anywhere.\n\nBeyond that: the vendor partners verifying government IDs can delete the IDs from their systems once they are done with the verification. There is no technical need to save those anywhere. Clearly there was a breach in the past, but did Discord promise previously that their partners were only storing info transiently? If not, then I don't necessarily see an issue with their recent announcement. Before they were careless with information, now they seem to be much more mindful. Their system as they describe it would not create a hackable database of selfies or government IDs.\n\nIf you want to argue that discord or their partners are acting in bad faith and will do exactly what you describe, then go for it. But it is only if Discord or their vendor partners are explicitly lying that the issue you describe exists. **Technically**, you can absolutely verify age without collecting identity data and need not store identity data in a database.\n\nAlso, just a quick note:\n\n> And they're doing this voluntarily. No law requires it. \n\nThere are laws that require it in America. It varies by state. And there are also laws that require it outside of America, where any first amendment arguments obviously would not apply.",

The post was removed by the admins who mod the subreddit and they did not answer the question at all however the top comment by the OP which explains the situation is visible if you look at the removed post. \n\nFYI - the department of homeland security was caught profiling not only non-Americans but Americans on Reddit - even going so far to link Alt accounts to the main account. It’s detailed in this here. There may be a lot of concern from users about this. Mods have asked for Guidance because it seems that Reddit is complicit in this all. \n\nThe post —> https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/s/xrJvZj8ocb\n\nLink to the Ken Klipperstein Article —> https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/homeland-security-spies-on-reddit",

At that point you just have your account with \"the\" big central authority, except with way lesser functionality vs competitors.  You can do E2EE but I think more people care about functional screen sharing, which pretty much no Matrix client really has compared to Discord.\n\nJust to give you an idea, joining a room of 2k+ people can take well over a minute because of how the protocol works.

              "text": "They 100% are, and have been being used to track and search for people, there is zero doubt about that. While the government can't surveil directly without justification (that gets slimmer every year), *private companies* have much more relaxed restrictions with their own products. Then all of the data they collect, including video, facial recognition, audio, etc, just just winds up sold to anyone who can afford to buy it. The US government is just another customer, bypassing regulation (including the Constitution) by purchasing access to the surveillance data from private companies or brokers. \n\nThis is not a new thing or a future concern, it is already happening even if a big chunk of the public was only recently made aware of it.\n\nOne of the more egregious offenses in this field is with Flock Safety. They have close to 1 million AI cameras already set up around the US to identify and track *all* passing vehicles. They identify the license plate, make/model, color bumper stickers, dents/damage, etc. creating a digital profile of your vehicle that will be referenced every time you pass any of their cameras and cataloging the location and time data. This data is then sold to law enforcement who are able to use it for dragnet surveillance without a warrant. They can essentially search for whoever they want, whenever they want, for whatever reason they want or no reason at all. It has been for things like [a jealous police chief repeatedly spying on his ex-girlfriend](https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article291059560.html) \n\nor for [tracking down people who get abortions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down)\n\n or for [identifying and cataloging peaceful protesters and activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists).\n\n The \"customers\" then have the right to distribute and use this data as they see fit, with little to no privacy regulation applying yet. [Here is a map of reported cameras so far](https://deflock.org/map), though since they are individually reported only by a fraction of the population that sees the need to catalog them, there are likely more, and new ones being added every day. Flock makes a big PR stink about \"not working directly with the federal government\", but the way their data rights are structured they are easily able to get access through those they do work with. For instance, it is known that ICE and DHS have access to them, so likely every agency does if they want to. Not to mention they are [trivially easy to hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY).\n\nHere are a few resources to learn more, and have it explained better than I did:\n\nhttps://www.stopflock.com/\n\nhttps://eyesonflock.com/\n\n[ACLU on ICE usage](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-pushback), and [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup)\n\n[EFF investigation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis turned into a bot of a specific digression, but you get the point. It is already happening. Also consider how Palantir is fascillitating similar privacy violations. Amazon/Bezos has already been working closely with the federal government this administration, who have shown themselves to be particularly interested in bot AI and surveillance. There is basically no chance that these aren't already being used for tracking, or at least searching people. That is likely one of the primary objectives of setting it up this way to begin with. Lots of data to sell for the company, and civil rights workarounds for the government, a win-win.",

Connections, money, or utility to the ruling clique is irrelevant and ironically may even put you under more suspicions as the classic Stalin technique is to constantly churn the \"friends of the regime\" circle, because once the people are subjugated, the only place to direct paranoia to is whoever is left with any modicum of freedom.\n\nFascism is an ideology that turns life into a living hellscape for all, and even the one at the very top \"in control\" is in a gilded cage of paranoia they can never walk back out of, where every waking moment is operated under the assumption somebody near you (rightfully) hates you and would exploit an opportunity to hurt you in a moments notice.\n\nFascism is a gigantic waste of time to put it extremely lightly. Don't bother trying to survive it because each century it gets more and more capable of persistence when it's allowed to have \"another crack at things\" by foolish opportunists, it **must** be prevented.",

This is forcing everyone under a way of living for the select few who suffer.\n\n\nThe internet was made for adults. It has since been curated to children for profit.

Below are the steps that google provide when I searched how to set up voice channels in Steam. Hope this helps someone. \n\n\n1. Setting Up Voice Options\nBefore using voice chat, configure your microphone to ensure it works correctly: \nAccess Settings: Open the Steam client, click on Friends & Chat in the bottom right corner, and click the gear icon (Settings) at the top of your friends list.\nConfigure Microphone: Select the Voice tab.\nSelect Input/Output: Choose your microphone and headset/speakers from the dropdown menus.\nTest Microphone: Use the microphone test feature to ensure audio is detected.\nSet Transmission Type: Choose between Push-to-Talk (recommended to filter background noise) or Open Microphone.\nAdjust Threshold: Adjust the voice transmission threshold to filter out background noise. \n\n2. Starting a Voice Chat (Desktop)\nWith a Friend: Right-click a friend's name in your friends list and select Start Voice Chat. Alternatively, open a chat window and click the microphone icon in the top right corner.\nGroup Chat: Open a group chat window, then click the + icon or select the arrow next to the group name to create a voice channel.\nAnswering: When someone calls, a notification with a sound will appear, allowing you to answer or ignore the call. \n\n3. Using Voice Chat in Big Picture Mode\nGo to your friends list and select the friend you want to chat with.\nSelect the Start Voice Chat option. \n\n4. Troubleshooting\nIf the voice chat is not working:\nCheck Windows Settings: Ensure your microphone is enabled and set as the default device in Windows Sound settings.\nCheck Privacy Settings: Ensure Microphone access is allowed for apps like Steam in Windows Privacy settings.\nFirewall: Ensure your firewall is not blocking UDP traffic on ports 27014 through 27020.\nRestart Steam: Sometimes restarting the Steam client can resolve connection issues. \n\n5. Steam Deck\nUse the quick access menu (the \"...\" button).\nSelect the Friends icon (second from the top).\nSelect a friend and click the microphone/chat icon to start a call.",

Grok suggests 3 eggs for breakfast, a 4th egg as a snack and more protein from lunch and dinner. The protein servings are lower for everyone else. It does suggest like 8 teaspoons of butter or olive oil per day to get your health fats in which is weird, but overall not egregious because it also notes that healthy fats exist within some foods already like avocados for example.",

I can create a meal plan based off of it.\n\nThe new one is literally not a single defined category or recommended servings per day.\n\nThere isn't even an indication of more or less.\n\nThe bottom could be what needs to be eaten the most. Or the top right, or the top left.\n\nIf I was FORCED to pick how to interpret it in best faith. I would say the overall size of each item represents the percentage of your diet they should entail. So that \"Protein Dairy and Healthy fats\" entail about 40% of your diet, \"Vegetables and Fruits\" entail about 40% of your diet, and \"Whole grains\" represent the remaining 20%\n\nThe problem being that if \"Dairy\" was problematic for being a bit broad. \"Protein, Dairy and healthy fats\" is insanely broad.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing our piece. More here:\n\nAt Sunday’s Super Bowl, Ring advertised “Search Party,” a cute, horrifyingly dystopian feature nominally designed to turn all of the Ring cameras in a neighborhood into a dragnet that uses AI to look for a lost dog: “One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in the Super Bowl commercial. “Search Party from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs.” Onscreen, an AI-powered box forms around a missing dog: “Milo Match,” it says. “Since launch, more than a dog a day has been reunited with their family. Be a hero in your neighborhood with Search Party. Available to everyone for free right now.”\n\nIt does not take an imagination of any sort to envision this being tweaked to work against suspected criminals, undocumented immigrants, or others deemed ‘suspicious’ by people in the neighborhood. Many of these use cases are how Ring has been used by people on its [dystopian “Neighbors” app for years](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs/?ref=404media.co). Ring rose to prominence as a piece of package theft prevention tech owned by Amazon and by forming partnerships with local police around the country, [asking them to shill their doorbell cameras](https://www.vice.com/en/article/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement/?ref=404media.co) to people in their neighborhoods in return for a system that allowed police to request footage from individual users without a warrant. \n\nChris Gilliard, [a privacy expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBgnjn5cC0&ref=404media.co) and author of the upcoming book [*Luxury Surveillance*](https://www.techpolicy.press/through-to-thriving-protecting-our-privacy-with-chris-gilliard/?ref=404media.co), told 404 Media these features and its Super Bowl ad are “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\nRing’s poorly defined partnership with Flock in particular has been the subject of various viral posts and public backlash. Many people have suggested that this partnership is evidence that Ring camera footage will be shared with ICE. At the moment there’s not enough evidence to explicitly say that that’s the case. \n\nThe supposed vector goes something like this: Ring says it will partner with Flock, which is used by thousands of local police departments. As we have reported, some of those police [departments have performed Flock license plate lookups for ICE](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/). It’s too early to say whether Ring footage will eventually end up with ICE, but the fact that people immediately drew that conclusion and understood the possible method of information sharing shows that surveillance companies can no longer hide behind viral videos of delivery drivers dancing. It’s a mask off moment, and people know it: “In Amazon’s alliance with this administration, it’s become more clear than ever that Ring is an extension of the carceral state,” Gilliard said. “An emotionally charged Super Bowl ad won’t change that.”\n\nRead more: [https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)",

Though, I will say that I'm still using some of their products 20+ years later and they work just like they did when I purchased them.\n\nThe bigger value of Monster stuff was always their lifetime guarantee.  Back in the days when I was a musician who was regularly playing shows, I used Monster cable almost exclusively.  Speaker / guitar cables take a lot of abuse when going from gig to gig, so it was nice to have a little assurance that I would never be stuck with damaged lines.\n\nAt one point in time, you could bring your beat up Monster cables to any Guitar Center (no receipt needed) and trade them in for brand new ones. I was even told on more than one occasion that you could bring the cables in, cut them in half in front of the employees, and they would still hand you replacements, no questions asked.\n\nI watched a youtube documentary about the company a while back.  Unfortunately, among the many reasons that they aren't really around in any real capacity anymore is the profits lost from making stuff that lasts too long and the whole lifetime replacement policy (which no longer exists AFAIK). Edit - also to blame are the numerous terrible business partnerships and decisions, as well as the company becoming aggressively litigious towards anyone that dared to use the word \"monster\" in the name of their company or products, even if completely unrelated to audio.",

They treat audio like magic and not like the exact mathematically measurable science it is. We can, in fact, measure almost every aspect of sound to absurdly high degrees of precision that far outperform the threshold of human perception, but most audiophile \"science\" relies on making buyers truly believe that *they* can go beyond the human threshold, that there's a component *beyond* what's measurable.

It is *much, much* harder to hear the differences between quality amp models than it is to hear the differences between speakers. \n\nAll speakers sound different. They have different frequency response, different biases, different sound signatures, etc. \n\nTo me Audiophile means “I can hear the differences between different speakers and have a strong preference for a certain sound signature. I also like accuracy in my sound such that everything is balanced so that what I’m listening to is as it was recorded. Not base heavy. Not treble heavy. “Flat” such that what I hear is as the artiest intended”. \n\nThis won’t be the definition of Audiophile for everyone, but it is why I considering myself an audiophile. \n\nFor example: I know I love Hertz Mille Pro speakers for car audio. Their sound profile is fantastic *to me*. I love my DSP because when I feel something is off I can (and do) connect my laptop and make adjustments to either bring up something that is too quiet, or bring down something too loud. I spent several hours with a measurement microphone and my ears getting everything exactly how I like it. That’s audiophile behavior. \n\nBut… I’m not going to tell you that full analog is better than digital. I’m not going to claim I can hear the difference between cable A and cable B. I’m not going to tell you that only certain speaker cone materials are acceptable. I just have a fairly finely tuned ear and that I notice things like time alignment being off, frequency bias, constructive and destructive reflections, the tiniest bits of input clipping, the tiniest bits of distortion from over driving the speakers, etc.",

The power cable affects nothing, yet audiophiles will spend 150x more for a power cable claiming to prevent audio interruptions that don’t exist. In this instance they are talking about the cables used to transfer audio. \n\nIf you own an amplified instrument and aren’t rich this is something you will know. The cable used to plug your guitar or bass into the amp doesn’t matter. The sound will always be the same. The guitar may matter and the amp may matter but the cable doesn’t. When you buy a cheap one the only thing that determines the price is 1.) is it durable and 2.) is it long. Thats it.

All the effort went into ensuring good connections, wire was sufficient gauge, and amps had enough continuous and peak power.   Most of the money was spent on the microphones used (a phased array) for testing.\n\n\nAll that said, audio \"quality\" is a subjective measure, just like food flavor, IMHO.  Our perception is modified by so much. \n\n\nMy favorite \"personal\" experiment was blind testing CD vs 320kbps mp3s where I had my son randomly choose one version and then the other version of songs while I listened.  I went 9 for 10 in identifying them.\n\n\nNext, I did the same but didn't A/B the same songs and instead did it fully random.   I guessed right on 11 of 20.\n\n\nNone of that is scientifically valid, but it highlights advice I give when people ask me, which is that if it sounds good to you,  it is good!",

It seems like they **recorded** audio through different mediums, but the audio circuit was **not** run through different mediums. \n\n\n\nThey're basically just adding a resistors while **recording** the complete audio circuit to a recording device. That's just going to make the signal slightly weaker when recorded, but big whoop because you can just balance it. If that's correct... This is just a \"gotcha\" experiment. Go ahead and run the actual audio circuit through different mediums without touching volume or gain and see what happens. ",

          "text": "I thought the argument for certain types of expensive wire core is built on regular electrical principles related to sensitivity to corrosion from wear and tear of using the product over time. Also wire insulation is a real factor as well for picking up feedback/noise from other electrical equipment which is a measurable and observable issue. The tests describe here don't seem to account for those aspects.\n\nMost informed audiophiles, who are not rich snobs looking to flex their expenses, or sound engineers are not gonna tell you the reason for buying equipment with premium components like more expensive cables is about fidelity (except if it's the device reproducing/constructing/capturing the sound itself like the speakers, amps, mics, sound cards etc) it is more so about durability via build quality and concepts like noise isolation from electrical interference in surrounding equipment or the environment. For example there are genuinely different ways to build speakers that last longer and produce sound more accurately and/or clearly. Planned obsolescence is a real engineering paradigm across all manufactured foods. So in regards to the transmission cables it is more about the stuff mentioned at the start of this not so much about fidelity of sound,. Think about it you don't even have to be an audiophile to know the difference between muffled narrow sound quality from dollar store earbuds/headphones vs something nicer but the main difference in the fidelity of those things isn't about the transmission wire (or medium in the context of that experiment) but the actual device reproducing the sound lol. so IMO the headline is a bit of a clickbaity reframing of the research like so many headlines are",

My examples are what I use and have setup for friends and family for years. You can get remote access many ways that exclude anyone but you from accessing.\n\nI chose Reolink because I did not want to be forced to use an app to connect or have to use a products app to view. I used both Foscams and Amcrest cams until they made it nearly impossible to view or setup without using a proprietary app. Now most of the cams will \"phone home\" many times, hence the reason for a separate IoT vlan. If your router does not have that ability, look into setting up pi-hole, a fantastic full house ad/popup blocker, of course open source. I know it can be overwhelming if you're not into the tech, but to make it easier there are plenty of good sites that will walk you through setting this up and chatgpt or claude can be invaluable.

As time goes on it is the Database it builds that becomes increasingly a threat to personal rights. I feel bad for those people that don’t maturely make their own inquiries to see that this is very real. Abuses & violations of individual rights are happening almost daily. You just have to be brave and research it or continue living with your head in the sand. It wont be long til someone comes along and smacks you in your ass.\n\nI’ll give you a head start:\n\nhttps://www.wjfw.com/news/flock-safety-faces-privacy-concerns-cancelled-contracts-across-u-s/article_a9671d6e-014d-4c4c-b726-cd5be21a037e.html\n\nSummary Flock Safety, a company operating tens of thousands of surveillance cameras across the U.S., faces privacy concerns and contract cancellations. Critics argue the company’s AI-powered cameras infringe on privacy rights and lack public consent, while security flaws and unauthorized use have raised further concerns. Despite these issues, some law enforcement agencies continue to support their contracts with Flock Safety.\n\nhttps://www.blackrosefed.org/benn-jordan-interview/\n\nSummary Benn Jordan, a musician and audio engineer, discusses his interest in surveillance technologies, sparked by the prevalence of Flock Safety cameras in Atlanta. He highlights vulnerabilities in Flock’s systems, including unprotected Android devices and potential for misuse. Jordan advocates for privacy practices like lying online and resisting data collection, and emphasizes the importance of DIY projects to empower individuals and foster innovation.\n\nExcerpt: There are a lot of vulnerabilities. I believe over 70 at this point. In my opinion, the most concerning one is that the cameras and compute boxes are unprotected Android devices. I could push a button 3 times on a Falcon and it’ll give me a WiFi access point to connect to. From there, it takes a matter of seconds to infiltrate the device to access the video footage, data, and even some of the server credentials. What’s much worse is that I can “root” the device, which means that I can have control of it outside of the operating system.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/video/2026/01/06/staunton-resident-files-petition-ordinance-banning-license-plate-readers/\n\nSTAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - After the City of Staunton announced its’s canceling its contract with Flock Safety, the company behind the license-plate–reading software that popped up over the last year, some residents rejoiced, but others in the Queen City said more still needs to be done.\n\nLastly, Here’s an Ai internet scrape of examples:\n\nInvestigations by privacy advocacy groups and news organizations in 2025 and early 2026 have exposed multiple instances of law enforcement misusing the Flock Safety camera system, which operates a vast network of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) across the United States. Here are examples of articles and reports exposing these abuses, categorized by type of misuse:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Surveillance Related to Reproductive Rights and Abortion \"A Texas Cop Searched License Plate Cameras Nationwide for a...\" (Truthout/404 Media): This report detailed how a Johnson County, Texas, deputy used the Flock system to conduct a nationwide search, logging the reason as \"had an abortion, search for female\". The investigation highlighted how cross-state data sharing puts abortion seekers at risk. \"Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose...\" (University of Washington Human Rights Center): This analysis discussed how Texas law enforcement tracked a woman who had self-administered an abortion, with data generated by Flock networks in Washington state.\n2.\t⁠⁠Personal Stalking and Harassment by Officers \"Georgia police chief, arrested for using Flock cameras for stalking...\" (Lookout): This article reports on the arrest of a Braselton, Georgia, police chief for allegedly using the city's Flock cameras to stalk and harass private citizens.\n\n\"Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says\" (NBC News): This article highlights a lawsuit regarding a Virginia police department using the system to track a specific driver hundreds of times.\n\n\"Wisconsin Case Exposes Misuse of Flock Traffic Cameras by Police Officers\" (Yahoo News/Wisconsin Examiner): A Menasha police officer was charged with misconduct in office for using the department's Flock system to search for vehicles belonging to a private individual.\n\n\"Police Surveillance is Ripe for Abuse\" (ACLU of Wisconsin): Reports on a former Kansas police chief who used cameras to track his ex-girlfriend 228 times and a North Charleston officer who used them to track his estranged wife.\n\n3. Biased Policing and Profiling \"EFF's Investigations Expose Flock Safety's Surveillance Abuses: 2025 in Review\" (Electronic Frontier Foundation): An analysis found that over 80 law enforcement agencies used the Flock network to conduct searches using racial slurs and biased language, targeting the Romani community without evidence of specific crimes.\n\n\"Flock Enables Surveillance of Protesters\" (EFF): The same report documents how law enforcement used the system to track participants in various political demonstrations.\n\n4. Unauthorized Data Sharing and Immigration \"Flock's Aggressive Expansions Go Far Beyond Simple Driver Surveillance\" (ACLU): This article exposes how local law enforcement has used Flock data to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in immigration enforcement, violating sanctuary policies in some regions.\n\n\"Mountain View, California, pulled the plug on its entire license plate reader camera network\" (Malwarebytes): Following investigations, this report details how Flock cameras were sharing data with federal agencies without the city's permission.\n\n5. Inaccurate Investigations and Privacy Risks \"Public Interest Law Firm Responds to Flock Safety Pausing Federal...\" (Institute for Justice): This article discusses a federal lawsuit against Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the use of Flock cameras, noting that the system captured, \"photos of an innocent family's driveway and part of their front yard every time a vehicle drove by\".\n\nThese reports have led to nearly 30 jurisdictions cancelling or refusing to renew their Flock Safety contracts in 2025–2026, citing privacy violations, surveillance overreach, and illegal data sharing.",

And that's probably dependent on competitors (Apple, Tidal) being unable to cut their costs.  Most likely those guys are also saving money, and so all three would end up cutting costs equally, leading to no net gains for anyone.\n\nSo we are basically in a situation where the cost is limited by the consumers' willingness to pay.

It’s not necessarily the fastest solution, and it won’t be able to transfer platform-specific songs… but everything else is genuinely safe and it does a good/accurate job.",

Now I wouldn't be surprised if most do not even remember they exist.\n\nAnd for most part those who would make either just end up making a mobile app now, which is kind of extreme overkill for simpler stuff and often killed by monetization of what once would have been free.\n___\n\nIt feels like game modding has somewhat died too, so few newer games support it and they are to complex and/or locked down for people to mod without that support.\n\nAnd considering how many devs, and even entire successful studios and some of the most profitable games to exist, got their start with game modding that is a bad thing for the industry. You would think they would want to support such a great headhunting tool and one that GUARANTEES long term sales producing infinite content for free but nope.\n\nHopefully Slay The Spire 2 has half the modding community of 1 when it comes out next month, IIRC the devs plan to make it easier to mod than the first.",

It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”\n\nIn a team meeting yesterday manager said that even though we did feature planning with AI in mind, meeting our targets won't be good enough for upper management. They can see that it _is_ making things faster, but that's making expectations rise even faster.\n\nAnd contention on resources for properly testing things is becoming a major bottleneck to the point we're going to start having corners cut.\n\nLots more chatter about early retirement and lower intensity careers around the office lately.",

They really push any sort of AI tooling that Devs think are useful, most had cursor as their IDE but these tickets were bug heavy,  light on AC so it was difficult for me to tell (and get answers) if features were working as intended.\n\n\n11pm finishes/7am starts were commonplace and apparently had been for a while. Sales were basically telling prospective customers \"we don't have the ability to do this now, but we will in a week!\" which led to so much short notice shit my brain was pickled trying to get myself up to speed properly as well as deliver all this crap 'at pace' I just threw in the towel and I'm going back to my old job next week. They then gained those customers so of course why wouldn't they continue making those kinds of statements and have those kinds of expectations? \n\n\nQA there were ignored for the most part, I had a hell of a time getting anything out of product owners/developers, not because they didn't like me (I don't think) but because they were so damn busy all the time. I'd be midway through testing something to be told it was getting merged and released to prod and any issues could be picked up post release.\n\n\nIt was my first experience of a company that leveraged AI tooling across all aspects of the business, it was horrendous. \n\n\nWith the increases in productivity coming I'm a bit worried the old 1:4 QA to dev ratio is just going to get blown out the water ",

The study this article is based on only looked at 200 people at a single tech firm, hardly a representative sample of the global workforce.\n\nIf you read between the lines, the “burnout” isn't coming from the AI itself it’s coming from people voluntarily overworking because the barrier to entry for tasks has dropped. Just because an AI makes it possible for a PM to start doing engineering work during their lunch break doesn't mean they should. We're seeing the typical early adopter frenzy where everyone thinks they need to be doing 10x the work just because it's technically possible.\n\n\nBurnout happens when management expects 10x output for the same pay, or when workers don't have the discipline to log off. Blaming the software for “intensifying” work is like blaming a faster car for a driver’s speeding ticket. We need better boundaries not fewer tools but people will only read the headline and think this is yet another “AI bad” situation.",

It should only be used for large dataset analysis and maybe meeting minutes. Otherwise whatever content it makes is pure slop, no matter what platform it is.

There's a natural rhythm of intensity and relaxation in the professional coding cycle. One gets \"in the zone\", and codes like a maniac, and then into a phase of consolidation and thougthful review.\n\nCoding with AI is like working with the worlds most knowledgeable and fast working amateur, junior dev. My job is to know what we're trying to do, to express it in a way the AI can successfully operate with, Understanding how the current results differ from the desired ones (which includes testing and code review), and the time to iterate. And as we all know, LLMs are \"sticky\", and particularly by asking leading questions at the end of any task: \"Do you want me to <various suggestions about what it could do next>\". \n\nThis tends to keep one in active mode. There is no downtime to think, unless you are disciplined enough. The constant prompting tends to erode that.\n\nAnd FWIW, despite being specifically for coding, Claude falls into the same problematic ruts that every AI I've tried using for real work  does - once it gets something wrong, it then will \"loop\", when you point it out. It'll undo the change, resulting in the return of the prior problem, which it will \"solve\" in exactly the same failed way. I've let it go through three complete iterations of this to verify it won't break out on its own. I have to point out it already tried something, which is very strange, since it's own output becomes a part of the context it keeps so there *can* be a \"conversation\". You'd think looping would be something the AI would notice, but none do, and that's across 5 major LLM offerings.\n\nAll this adds up to non-stop work. This type of work has been extensively studied and written about, and anybody who thinks they are a resource manager should know about things like \"critical chain\", in which slack time refers to the amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the project's overall timeline, which is managed through buffers to ensure timely project completion. Slack time is consideered absolutely necessary, as they've shown throughput (the actual amount produced) *decreases* without slack time, sometimes catastrophically.\n\nUnfortunately, some managers will think \"non-stop work\" sounds like a dream for their stats. They're going to be very confused, disappointed, even angry when the opposite occurs.",

Faster output → higher expectations → less recovery time. Rinse, repeat.\n\nA few patterns I keep seeing with early adopters:\n\n* **Cognitive overload**: juggling prompts, tools, workflows, and constant context-switching\n* **Identity pressure**: “If I’m not using this well, I’m falling behind”\n* **Invisible labor**: experimenting, refining, validating AI output—work that doesn’t always count on paper\n* **Acceleration guilt**: when you *can* do more, resting starts to feel unjustified\n\nIronically, the people most resistant to burnout are often the ones using AI *selectively*—as a boundary, not a badge. They automate the boring stuff, then stop. No constant optimization spiral.\n\nThere’s a weird lesson hiding here:  \nBurnout isn’t about tools. It’s about **who feels obligated to extract maximum value from them**.\n\nIf you want, we can unpack what “healthy AI usage” actually looks like in practice—because it’s way less impressive than Twitter makes it sound, and way more sustainable.",

It’s fundamental: employees are *tools* “employed” for some task; the dehumanization is *built-in*. AI is appealing to capitalism simply because $30k of computation is necessarily cheaper than $50k or whatever of Bob.\n\nCapitalism is a fucking paperclip maximizer, and we’re hitting the point where it stops working well as an engine for economic growth because there *is* no more growth to wring out of the system much of the time. We’re spinning our wheels with a “once-in-a-lifetime” market busts every damn decade because the system is repeatedly crashing up against bounds that should be common sense.\n\nSociety needs a priority shift, and the priority should be to improve the plight of the least among us. We have the resources to give everyone the option of a free basic home, free nutritious, basic food, free basic clothing and such fit for the climate, and free healthcare (among other things). We just allocate these resources awfully because some people are very, very good at playing social games that give them power and money. We should be investing in society. We should be *teams* working to mutual benefit, but we’re still falling for dumb fucking tribal-warfare games to drag each other down while the rich enjoy unlimited crabs in their solid-gold bucket.",

Working on a ppt for example right now, for at least two hours I have fucked around with this thing - refinining the content over and over before even putting it into my actual slides. This then leads to me being overwhelmed with options, spending more time reading back through the answers. It's great for some things, however, I do think in some aspects I am less productive because I am just burning time expecting perfection or attempting to have it do the work for me whereas I am likely better off building it then having it review and refine it. \n\nI am glad I read this article.

This process disproportionately impacted conservative news sources, to the point that they were complaining about the 'obvious bias' at facebook. \n\nBut of course the reason that the stories were being removed was because they were overwhelmingly more likely to post fake news, stories without any sources cited and obvious bullshit that even a child could tell was fishy. \n\nSo, naturally, because of the conservative backlash (which ironically, deliberately distorted the facts), facebook hired some prominent right wing figures to leadership positions, who immediately set about 'fixing' the problem. Which basically amounted to issuing a blanket notice that stories from some preferred news sources could no longer be flagged. \n\nIssue solved. ",

Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.\n\nConservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order.** That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.\n\nThey like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market  produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

          "text": "This is a fascinating collision between tech platform curation and political pressure. The FTC's push here raises some serious questions about whether government agencies should be dictating content algorithms at all. Apple News uses a combination of human curation and algorithmic recommendations - if we're forcing them to boost specific outlets regardless of engagement metrics or editorial standards, aren't we just replacing one form of bias with government-mandated bias? The irony is that conservatives have spent years arguing that government shouldn't interfere with private business decisions.\n\nThe algorithm transparency debate is legitimate, but this feels like the wrong solution. If Apple is artificially suppressing sources based purely on political lean rather than factors like fact-checking records, misinformation rates, or user engagement, that's worth investigating. But mandating promotion of specific outlets - especially ones with documented credibility issues - sets a dangerous precedent. What's next, forcing Spotify to promote specific podcasts? YouTube to boost certain channels? The slippery slope here is real.\n\nThe bigger issue is that we still haven't figured out the right regulatory framework for platform curation in 2024. These companies have enormous power over information flow, but ham-fisted government intervention isn't the answer. We need transparency requirements and clear anti-discrimination standards, not bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the media landscape. The FTC should focus on whether Apple is being transparent about its curation criteria, not micromanaging which outlets get promoted. This whole situation just demonstrates how unprepared our regulatory agencies are for nuanced tech policy.",

          "text": "Hey, thanks for sharing our story!\n\n**Here's some context from the article:**\n\n>In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called [QuitGPT](https://quitgpt.org/). \n\n>The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January. \n\n>For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.\n\n>QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions.",

Having Custom Instructions (and having them be much bigger than ChatGPTs) is really useful to me.\n\nCustom Gems are good, too. I know ChatGPT can do something similar, but being able to easily make a \"VentBot\", a \"WorkBot\", a \"OrganiserBot\" etc, and have them all on the screen, at the ready whenever I need, just generally makes my work much easier to accomplish.\n\nI've also found that the current free version of ChatGPT is incredibly poor... I did a comparison for the free versions of Gemini and ChatGPT and gave them both a PDF to read. GPT hallucinated like half of it. Was ridiculous. Gemini was MUCH better in this regard.\n\nLastly, the ChatGPT desktop app is horrendous... it crashes regularly, stops getting proper responses, and is terribly organised.\n\nSo yeah, Gemini isn't perfect, but it's suiting me better than ChatGPT, and I'm happier than I was paying for it than GPT.

The infrastructure for home charging is way WAY too expensive to install and maintain.\n5.) Fixing major issues is 50% more expensive, but maintenance is 30% less expensive; says \"studies\".\n6.) For some unknown reason, EV interior design with full electronics is far worse than analog buttons. They lag, they need software updates that wipe all custom settings, and heating/cooling functions cannot be accessed when the screen is slightly dirty.\n\nAnd of course:\n7 ) they look really, really dumb in comparison to other vehicles, which is polarizing to a population that is historically opposed to major changes.\n8.) Did i mention that they look really stupid? Because most do. And yes, aesthetics matter. A lot....\n\nIt's not a mystery as to why they are losing money. They want to hide every detail of their new vehciles until they come out. Which is hilarious because they fired all of their QA departments; the only people who would have told them that these features are terrible. \nThey need to hire honest/normal people to critique new product ideas, not echo chambers of yes-men pandering to their bosses whims. \n\nAlmost feels like all of the car company CEOs got together 10 years ago and hatched a plan to screw over EVs so they can keep reaping oil benefits. \n\nDon't u dare talk about my tin foil hat... it's shiney.",

If the author of this article were actually paying attention, it's been clear for several days now (so before the February 13th publication of this article) that Canada was going to be purchasing the F-35. Canada has been quietly purchasing spare parts and lower profile items for the F-35 which wouldn't make sense if they were going to cut the contract at 16. \n\n2. Given that Canada has already committed to 16 F-35s, it would cost more for less capability to backfill the rest of the Canadian Air Force equipment with Swedish Gripens. The Gripen and the F-35 are reasonably comparable in purchase price, and while the Gripen maintenance costs are lower, having to maintain two full separate maintenance supply chains and training systems would negate any of that cost advantage. \n\n3. The F-35 is just better. And while it is true that the Gripen is a mature platform, that's also another way of saying that there's not a lot of room for improvement. And the current Gripen is several steps down from the current F-35, while the F-35 has a lot more ceiling to it. \n\nAny technology subreddit, regardless of the politics, would have to understand that the current technology, the future technological ceiling, not to mention the economics regarding ongoing costs and maintenance makes the F-35 the obviously better choice. \n\nSo, of course, Reddit being Reddit, this sub is going to completely ignore that. \n\nAll Canada is doing right now is Kabuki theater to tell everyone that they're angry with the US, while they rack up contractual delay costs just end up buying the planes that they would have bought in the first place. They're just going to spend more money at it, to pay Lockheed Martin some extra delay fees. \n\nYay. Nice to see the Canadian politicians are competent at handling this kind of thing. 🙄",

          "text": "What's interesting about this proposal is that it targets the *mechanism* of addiction rather than the content, which is a fundamentally different regulatory approach than what we've seen before.\n\nMost tech regulation focuses on what platforms show you--misinformation, harmful content, ads. The EU is instead going after *how* platforms keep you engaged regardless of what's on screen. Infinite scrolling, autoplay, and pull-to-refresh are all variable-ratio reinforcement schedules, the same psychological mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. You keep scrolling because the next piece of content *might* be interesting, and the absence of a natural stopping point (a page bottom, a \"next\" button) removes the cognitive pause where you'd normally decide \"I've seen enough.\"\n\nThe research on this is actually quite robust. Aza Raskin, who invented infinite scroll at Humanized in 2006, has spent years publicly regretting it. Internal documents from multiple platforms show they A/B tested engagement metrics specifically around removing pagination--and infinite scroll consistently increased time-on-site by 30-50% without increasing user satisfaction. That gap between engagement and satisfaction is basically the definition of an addictive design pattern.\n\nThe enforcement challenge is real, though. Where do you draw the line? Reddit's \"load more comments\" button is a form of pagination. So is YouTube's \"Up Next\" sidebar vs. autoplay. The EU will need to define what constitutes a \"structural addictive feature\" with enough precision that companies can't just relabel infinite scroll as \"extended content preview\" or similar. The GDPR showed that vague requirements lead to years of compliance theater before meaningful change happens. The specificity of the rules will determine whether this actually changes behavior or just generates cookie-banner-style annoyances.",

Those shocks happened because one location held so much of the global production capacity. Even if the price shocks were nothing compared to the one cause by the AI bubble today it's still a lesson that seems to have taught us nothing. \n\nIf Taiwan goes, so much specialty silicon disappears for good that it's not even funny. Good luck getting spare industrial controllers for the tofu factory or a new gaming GPU after that.\n\nTaiwan of course wants to keep the production in their country. It's both a financial and an existential national security issue for them. If the western countries cared less about Taiwan China could take them over more easily.

          "text": "The headline is WD-specific, but the supply picture is broader and stranger than most people realize.\n\nThree companies make essentially all hard drives on earth: Western Digital (42% market share), Seagate (40%), and Toshiba (18%). When WD CEO Irving Tan says they're \"pretty much sold out for calendar 2026\" with \"firm purchase orders from top seven customers\" and long-term agreements extending to 2028, he's describing nearly half the global supply being locked up.\n\nLead times for enterprise nearline drives have gone from a few weeks to over 52 weeks. HDD average selling prices are at their highest point since 1998. And this is happening despite total exabyte shipments hitting records: WD alone shipped 215 EB in the most recent quarter, up 22% year over year. The drives are moving faster than ever and still can't keep up.\n\nWhy now? Hyperscaler capital expenditure for 2026 is approaching $700 billion. Amazon announced $200 billion in capex, the largest single-company infrastructure spend in history. Google guided $175-185B (up 140% from 2025). Meta guided $115-135B. About 75% of all of this goes to AI infrastructure: GPUs, servers, and the storage to feed them.\n\nSSDs can't absorb the overflow. Enterprise SSD prices (30TB TLC drives) surged 257% in nine months, from about $3,000 to nearly $11,000. HDDs went up only 35% in the same period. The cost ratio between SSDs and HDDs per terabyte widened from 6.2x to 16.4x. Micron's 2026 enterprise NAND supply is already \"fully committed.\" So even companies that would prefer SSDs are buying hard drives because that's what's available at a price that doesn't break the budget.\n\nThe technology bottleneck compounds this. Seagate is the only company shipping HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) drives right now, their Mozaic 3+ platform at 30TB per drive. The next step, 40TB drives using Mozaic 4+, starts volume production in the first half of 2026. Western Digital delayed its HAMR entry to the second half of 2026, citing prohibitive per-unit costs at low volume. HAMR requires a fundamentally different manufacturing process: iron-platinum media, glass substrates instead of aluminum, and a near-field transducer laser integrated into every read/write head. You can't just flip a switch and double capacity.\n\nThe comparison that keeps coming up is Chia coin in 2021, when cryptocurrency miners panic-bought hard drives and the network storage grew from 600 petabytes to 10 exabytes in a single month. Prices spiked and crashed when the speculation ended. The difference here is that the buyers are Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle, with purchase orders running through 2028, building physical data centers (Meta's Hyperion project in Louisiana: 5 GW capacity, $27 billion; the Stargate project in Texas: 7 GW planned, $400 billion+). This isn't speculative hoarding. The demand is structural, funded by $121 billion in new debt issuance in 2025 alone.\n\nWD saw this coming. They spun off their flash/SSD business into SanDisk Corporation in February 2025, making Western Digital a pure-play hard drive company for the first time. Seagate's FY2025 revenue hit $9.1 billion (up 30%), with net profit jumping from $335 million to $1.47 billion. WD's most recent quarter was $3.02 billion in revenue, with gross margins at 43.9%. These companies are printing money right now.\n\nThe overcapacity question is real though. Morgan Stanley and others have warned about an AI infrastructure bubble. Grid interconnection delays average 7 years. The enterprise software sector has lost about $2 trillion in market cap since late January 2026 on fears AI will cannibalize existing products. The Magnificent Six lost over $1.35 trillion in a single week in early February. Everyone agrees AI is transformative. The question is whether $700 billion a year in spending will generate returns before the debt comes due.",

Last year, I did a full custom build for the first time in 12 years (I went with a pre-built during the GPU shortage in 2021), and it was costly given the maxed-out specs I chose. I was advised by local forums and FB groups to \"wait it out\" so prices could stabilize and because the upcoming 50-series Super.\n\nLuckily... I didn't. I saw the opportunity and took it. My point is, had I waited (even though the moment felt “okay” not exactly affordable), I'd now be facing an indefinite wait thanks to this AI enterprise demand. And after that, who knows what's next.",
