      "text": "I need some honest industry perspective.\n\nIt’s been a year since my partner and I started our freelance studio. We niched down into supporting market research and healthcare insight teams with presentations, reports, newsletters, data visuals, the whole storytelling side of research.\n\nBefore this, I worked in the same space full-time(for Lumanity through my comapny), so it felt like the natural niche to build around.\n\nAnd it’s not that we haven’t got work.  \nWe have.\n\nWe’ve had decks presented at ESOMAR 25.  \nWork shown at a conference in Singapore recently.  \nWe’ve worked with insight consultancies and independent researchers.\n\nBut it’s been inconsistent.\n\nMost of the time, we’re brought in when in-house designers are overloaded or when something needs a quick turnaround before a big presentation. We haven’t really cracked retainers. And the people promoting us most are independent researchers(semiotics, ethnography; basically not our targeted field), not the companies we originally thought would need us.\n\nSo now I’m honestly in a dilemma.\n\nIs this actually a real ongoing need inside research and healthcare teams?  \nOr is it mostly overflow work and \"nice to have\" support?\n\nI’m starting to wonder if niching into healthcare specifically is becoming a barrier, and whether we should broaden out instead of sticking so tightly to one space.\n\nAny perspective from people inside agencies or insight teams would genuinely help. I’d really appreciate honest input while we’re figuring out our next move :)",

I used to try to tell them, and we’d go back and forth and back and forth, and they’d never get better. So, now, I take the deck, and ask for EVERYTHING as well.

Most insight teams fail to budget for this expense because they consider it as additional work instead of essential resources.   \n  \nYour agency receives more referrals from independent professionals than from agencies which indicates success. Smaller consultancies often feel the storytelling pain more acutely and don’t have internal design support.   \n  \nI want to test a new position for our existing work before we start expanding. The current description as \"design support\" needs to change into \"helping insights drive decisions and stakeholder buy-in\" because I want to show its value. The shift transforms it from \"nice to have\" into \"revenue-impacting.\"",

But at the same time, we don’t mind supporting or helping teams brush up their own storytelling either.

Based on everything we knew about phones before Apple released the iPhone, would digital twins have responded positively to it? Because everything at that time had a keyboard and everyone was happy with the keyboard and there were almost no examples of touchscreens on phones, there's a high chance the digital twin would have reacted poorly because all prior behavior would have inferred a keyboard less phone wouldn't be popular.\n\nIf you'd done a survey of people at that time, there's a high chance you could have discovered the latent demand for a keyboardless phone by measuring trade-offs they would be willing to make. Which is one of the key differences between a digital twin and a human. A human has conscious beliefs and unconscious motivations that can be in conflict. It would be very hard to simulate this in a digital twin. Product opportunities often reside at the edge of human dissonance, not logical inference.",

          "text": "The fundamental issue with the idea of digital twins 'replacing' human respondents is that the LLMs that power these tools are more like libraries than people. This means that they are not that bad in predicting outcomes they have close matches for, but they often fall over when they have to predict beyond their training set. In tests I've run, the models are pretty good at reflecting values (e.g. if you tell them to roleplay as a Malaysian consumer, they are likely to cite their religious faith) but are poor at applying these values to actual decisions.\n\nDigital twins also struggle with scarcity economics. The profiles they have the most data for and find it easiest to simulate (i.e. the public) are the cheapest to reach out to. When a human respondent costs $2 and you can get 1000 of them in a day, any alternative will need to be very slick indeed.\n\nThis makes me think that digital twins will probably swallow up the most repetitive use cases (e.g. early stage ad testing, ideation) but will be mostly additive for other use cases (e.g. brand strategy).\n\nMy main concern is corporate power / C-suite capture: I currently have a brief from a very respectable brand who are asking for a \"full synthetic\" brand tracker because the CEO is excited about AI. The Insight Manager thinks it's a terrible use case but needs to show that they are not being obstructive, so we're designing a very complex trial that allows all parties to back out without embarrassment if it doesn't work.
