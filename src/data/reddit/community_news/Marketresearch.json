      "text": "Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been talking with both market researchers and academic researchers about how they’re maintaining data integrity and reducing fraud in online surveys.\n\nAlmost everyone describes some version of a layered approach. Automated bot detection, device fingerprinting, manual review, time based flags, open ended response checks, cross validation of demographics, panel level monitoring, and so on. It’s rarely just one tool anymore.\n\nWhat I’ve found especially interesting is how different teams define the tipping point. At what stage does a case move from “suspicious” to “remove”? How many flags are enough? Are some indicators automatic disqualifiers, while others are just soft signals?\n\nFor those working in market or survey research:\n\nWhat does your current fraud detection stack actually look like in practice, and how do you decide when a case crosses the line from suspicious to removable?\n\nI’d love to hear what’s working well, what feels overly aggressive, and where you’re still experimenting.",

That PM job is on the line, passed up to the client service, and if the stamp of approval is done to say ‘the data passed all the checks’, then the client most likely will buy it, the onus is off the team, they get paid, and live to deal with another project. So many times I have dealt with clients asking for stupid intangible targets and washing data like their lives depends on it, because it does, at least their livelihood.

During soft launch, though, the responses were clearly fake.\n\nTo fix it, I embedded multiple attention checks and trap questions. As fieldwork continued, respondents repeatedly failed them. The incidence rate collapsed, the panel provider kept going for me though, though I agreed to a higher cost. \n\nWe eventually closed slightly under target but I was secretly quite proud because I believed we had filtered out the worst of it and got robust data.\n\nWhen analysis began, it became clear we hadn’t. The output was generic, risk-averse, and strategically useless. Despite all the controls, the data lacked depth and differentiation. It was junk.\n\nSo, what did I learn from this? People taking surveys are nearly all liars. They certainly can’t remember what they had said seconds earlier. They don’t engage their true opinions ever.",

I wonder how much of the fraud-detection criteria are actually driven by the client.\n\nIn your experience, do clients typically specify clear standards for what counts as a removable fraudulent response, or is that mostly left to the research team?\n\nI’ve spoken with several market researchers who use very different approaches. Some say that they rely on just 1-2 checks, while others use 5+ tools directly into their surveys.

I guess I had reprogram it in Survey Money pretty quickly (it was just a 2 minute survey). \n\n  \nThe other vendor I found in my research is Prolific, which would also meet my budget requirements. IDK if you or anybody else has heard of them. I'm targeting 18-40 women and want to get decent representation of current college students. \n\n",
