The fact that SQL returns \"error\" but doesn't tell you WHERE or WHAT the error is drives me up the wall with frustration. I'm liable to lose track of the dialect and make a syntax error that screws up the entire line of code. I'm not great at link testing because after the second or third time it all looks the same and I start missing things. I can do short bursts of very intensive attention to detail, and I'm great for a first round, but I burn out fast.\n\nMy strengths are in storytelling and seeing the big picture; my degree is actually in English and  originally wanted to work in publishing. I'm good at looking at a spreadsheet and saying \"these are the 3 things that matter.\" The people I know in data analytics spend a lot, even most, of their workday writing queries and fixing broken code.",

Now I am supporting a senior researcher on a qualitative project and they want me to start conducting some IDIs on my own next week.\n\nThe problem is I am struggling to figure out how to moderate and take notes at the same time. I kept getting stuck between listening for emotional cues and trying to uncover the why behind the answers while also capturing what the participant said. I either miss the moment to probe deeper or my notes end up being fragmented. I got mixed advice from my colleagues. Some say just record everything and take minimal notes. Others say you need to capture key quotes live because you will never have time to go back through all the audio. One colleague mentioned using meeting transcription tools like Fireflies, Beyz, Granola and focus yourself on the interview itself. I am curious what actually works for newbies? Do you take detailed notes live or rely on recordings and transcripts? Is there a learning curve I just need to push through or are there specific techniques that helped you get better at this? ",

Most people find it works best to focus primarily on moderating and listening for emotion and follow-ups, while taking only light notes in the moment; key themes, strong reactions, or quick timestamps rather than full quotes. Recording and using transcripts lets you go back for detail later, which frees you up to probe properly during the interview. Missing a good follow-up is harder to fix than missing a sentence, and after a handful of interviews, you’ll naturally get better at balancing the two.",

If you’re not familiar with the interview guide and don’t take notes, you’ll ask them again mid-way what solutions they use, and the client as well as the interviewee will say, “You weren’t listening to me, were you? I already told you I used X, Y, and Z.”\n\nIf that happens more than a few times, you won’t be offered a full time job after your internship.

Research Agency - still Quant (hands on research)\n2. Research Agency - less hands on research, more Commercial (think Chief Client Officer types)\n3. Online panel - migrate into Sales or Project Management\n4. Re-explore the Ipsos arms - Ipsos IS / Strategy3?\n5. Client side - Insights / MR in-house roles, explore some of the clients that you used to deal with\n6.

      "text": "Hi everyone - I’m new to the market research industry, I graduated with my bs in cogsci in 2025 and started an internship this week at a boutique MR consultancy. I haven’t been able to land a full time job post grad and I’m hoping to do well enough to get a return offer from this place. For context I’ve done two internships in the past: one in UXR and another one in legal survey research. \n\n**Here’s my current issue** \\- I’m struggling to ask meaningful questions when I’ve been given kind of menial tasks this week? I’ve been mainly checking for bad cases in the large datasets the company receives in my first week here, and I don’t really have an issue with asking Qs for the task at hand but I feel like I’m not asking meaningful questions if that makes sense. \n\nI met with the ceo of the company and he told me he plans to check in with me weekly so I can ask him plenty of questions about MR. But I feel like I’m scrambling to even think of any! Especially given I’m mainly supporting the analysts and PMs in simple work if that makes sense? I just don’t want to come off as not curious but I’m hoping some senior MRs in this community can give me some insight in to what kind of meaningful questions I should be asking for my career development. \n\nTLDR first week as an MR intern at a boutique consultancy but with the simple (but high priority)tasks I’ve been given, I’m struggling to ask meaningful Qs for my career/skill development",

Normally when we think of bad survey data, we think of bias or bad design - but that's not the whole story anymore.\n\n1. Surface-Level Cleanness ≠ True Validity\n\nSurvey reports can look statistically sound but still be based on data that do not reflect real human sentiment or behavior - especially when participants game incentives or machines mimic human responses.\n\n2. AI-Assisted Responses Complicate Detection\n\nGenerative AI can answer open-ended questions with plausible language and internal consistency, which historically were seen as safeguards against dishonest or inattentive respondents (source: [Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-global-digital-health-innovation/january-2025-guarding-data-integrity-tackling-challenges-in-online-surveys)).\n\nThis mirrors broader research showing that the use of AI in surveys is a real issue: a published study found significant portions of crowdsourced survey responses involved AI use and that such answers are less varied and less authentic than human responses.\n\n3. Traditional Biases Are Now Systematic\n\nStandard survey challenges - sampling bias, straight-lining, inattentive respondents - aren't new, but they become more systematic at scale when combined with incentive gaming or AI.\n\nRather than rejecting surveys entirely, the [Bell & Holmes article](https://www.bellandholmes.com/blog/when-surveys-lie-data-integrity-crisis) suggests pairing surveys with:\n\n* Human validation (e.g., expert interviews, live checks);\n* Hybrid research designs where surveys map broad sentiment and deeper qualitative information fills in context;\n* Contextual sense-checking and triangulation with other data sources;\n\nThese approaches help guard against overconfidence in survey results, especially for decision-grade research - where wrong numbers can lead to bad strategic choices.\n\nIndustry concerns about survey integrity:\n\n* Fraud and Incentive Gaming: Studies estimate non-negligible portions of survey responses are fraudulent or low-quality - depending on platform and incentives - reflecting similar concerns raised in market research discussions.\n* AI and Data Integrity: Academic research finds that crowdsourced surveys increasingly include AI-generated responses, which can distort results if not properly detected and filtered.\n* Need for Better QA: Market research professionals emphasize that superficial QA checks aren’t enough - more robust design and fraud-detection approaches are needed (see [Kantar study](https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/research-services/how-to-combat-survey-fraud-pf))\n\nTLDR: Surveys aren't dead, but relying on them alone without *smarter integrity checks* (like identity verification, behavioral QA, or live validation) is becoming risky. Real human feedback matters *more* than ever - even if it’s slower and harder to get.\n\nHas anyone in the subreddit seen this in real research work? Like AI-generated open-ends, panel farms, etc.? What do you do to catch or prevent it?",

In every other domain you want to collect as much information as you can: all the good stuff that people think about your product and all the bad stuff, to make it better.\n\nIn pharma you will get in big trouble if someone says shit about your drug. Orgs like FDA are gonna cut you down. It restricts what you can do: you need to be very specific when you talk about pain points, you should avoid open-ended questions, etc.",
