Would brands trust simulated outputs?\n2. How accurate could behavioral models realistically be?\n3. Where does this break down — edge cases, bias, drift?\n4. Would this complement research or attempt to replace it?\n\nCurious what people in market research or product think.\n\nIs this direction inevitable, flawed, or somewhere in between?",

Based on everything we knew about phones before Apple released the iPhone, would digital twins have responded positively to it? Because everything at that time had a keyboard and everyone was happy with the keyboard and there were almost no examples of touchscreens on phones, there's a high chance the digital twin would have reacted poorly because all prior behavior would have inferred a keyboard less phone wouldn't be popular.\n\nIf you'd done a survey of people at that time, there's a high chance you could have discovered the latent demand for a keyboardless phone by measuring trade-offs they would be willing to make. Which is one of the key differences between a digital twin and a human. A human has conscious beliefs and unconscious motivations that can be in conflict. It would be very hard to simulate this in a digital twin. Product opportunities often reside at the edge of human dissonance, not logical inference.",

          "text": "The fundamental issue with the idea of digital twins 'replacing' human respondents is that the LLMs that power these tools are more like libraries than people. This means that they are not that bad in predicting outcomes they have close matches for, but they often fall over when they have to predict beyond their training set. In tests I've run, the models are pretty good at reflecting values (e.g. if you tell them to roleplay as a Malaysian consumer, they are likely to cite their religious faith) but are poor at applying these values to actual decisions.\n\nDigital twins also struggle with scarcity economics. The profiles they have the most data for and find it easiest to simulate (i.e. the public) are the cheapest to reach out to. When a human respondent costs $2 and you can get 1000 of them in a day, any alternative will need to be very slick indeed.\n\nThis makes me think that digital twins will probably swallow up the most repetitive use cases (e.g. early stage ad testing, ideation) but will be mostly additive for other use cases (e.g. brand strategy).\n\nMy main concern is corporate power / C-suite capture: I currently have a brief from a very respectable brand who are asking for a \"full synthetic\" brand tracker because the CEO is excited about AI. The Insight Manager thinks it's a terrible use case but needs to show that they are not being obstructive, so we're designing a very complex trial that allows all parties to back out without embarrassment if it doesn't work.

          "text": "i'm in a similar boat. freelance researcher, mostly b2b startups. recruiting is always the hardest part. few things that have worked for me:\n\n1. user interviews is decent for some b2b segments but you're right that sourcing 30 from there alone is unlikely depending on the target. i usually get maybe 10-15 from there and fill the rest through other channels.  \n\n2. linkedin sales navigator works but it's a grind. the inmail limits are real. what i do instead is connect first with a short personal note, then message them after they accept. slower but better response rate than cold inmails.\n\n3. ask the client to share their own customer list or prospect list. even if they've never done research before they probably have contacts. warm outreach from their side converts way better than cold recruiting. sometimes i draft the outreach email and they send it from their account.\n\n4. industry slack groups and communities. depending on the software/tech niche there are usually active communities where you can post a recruiting ask. doesn't scale but the quality is usually good. on the cost question. $490-590 per participant is pretty standard for specialized b2b. i've found it's usually better to help the client understand why that cost exists rather than trying to cut corners on recruiting. bad participants waste way more money than expensive good ones. i frame it as \"you can pay $500 for a real conversation with your target buyer or waste 45 minutes talking to someone who isn't actually in your ICP.\"   \n  \nthat said for 30 participants i'd probably do a mix. professional recruiting for the hardest to reach segments and diy for the ones you can find yourself. keeps the total cost down without sacrificing quality on the important interviews.",

If you’d like to send me a message I’d be happy to look at specs and provide a ballpark idea! \n\nFor B2B to ensure authenticity you’ll need vetting, I’d recommend staying away from sites like User Interview it’s not a guarantee you’d find the right people. \n\nLinkedIn In mail marketing could work but it’s tough since so many people see those messages (yours truly) and ignore them 99% of the time.
