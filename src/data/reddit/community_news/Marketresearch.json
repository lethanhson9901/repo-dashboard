      "text": "Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been talking with both market researchers and academic researchers about how they’re maintaining data integrity and reducing fraud in online surveys.\n\nAlmost everyone describes some version of a layered approach. Automated bot detection, device fingerprinting, manual review, time based flags, open ended response checks, cross validation of demographics, panel level monitoring, and so on. It’s rarely just one tool anymore.\n\nWhat I’ve found especially interesting is how different teams define the tipping point. At what stage does a case move from “suspicious” to “remove”? How many flags are enough? Are some indicators automatic disqualifiers, while others are just soft signals?\n\nFor those working in market or survey research:\n\nWhat does your current fraud detection stack actually look like in practice, and how do you decide when a case crosses the line from suspicious to removable?\n\nI’d love to hear what’s working well, what feels overly aggressive, and where you’re still experimenting.",

          "text": "You want my honest perspective? It’s all a show. There’s only so much that can be done to prevent or scrub bad data. But at the end of the day, it’s all you can do. That PM job is on the line, passed up to the client service, and if the stamp of approval is done to say ‘the data passed all the checks’, then the client most likely will buy it, the onus is off the team, they get paid, and live to deal with another project. So many times I have dealt with clients asking for stupid intangible targets and washing data like their lives depends on it, because it does, at least their livelihood. If you think you’re honestly getting b2b ctos for 10 cpi to from a 200+ org you are delusional",

For lower incidence groups, I have to find the balance between data quality and sample size, and it can be a frustrating trade off.",

          "text": "The general idea is to consider how often you, as a senior employee in a company, would fill out a survey, especially one that asks for all those demographic details before getting to the main questions??? If you think you’d do it once a month or maybe once a quarter, then you’re being pretty fair and thoughtful. Now, picture yourself in a lower ranks, swamped with work and other responsibilities—how many surveys would you actually fill out if there was a chance to get a gift card with a decent amount? The same logic applies to the other side of things. It’s just not realistic to expect the same group of people to keep responding to surveys from all these different survey companies. So, it’s clear that the data is pretty much manipulated, altered, and dressed up in various ways!!!",
