So far we’ve managed internally, but I’ve noticed that on the B2B side the response rate is very low.  \n  \nOn top of that, the data we collect is noisy and, to be honest, we can’t draw clear conclusions for next year’s strategy. I initially feared that a full-service agency would be far beyond our budget, but I’ve come to the conclusion that we can no longer rely on intuition and quickly made forms.  \n  \nAt the moment I’m in advanced discussions with [Vision One Research](https://visionone.co.uk) and I’m thinking about starting a collaboration with them. I was attracted by the fact that they seem to have the necessary experience in the UK market and an entry-level financial threshold more accessible than I expected from an agency of that caliber.  \n  \nIt would be a big relief to have them take care of all the logistics with respondent recruitment and data cleaning. Has anyone worked with them or do you have any other advice before I sign the contract and take this step?",

They basically run omnibus surveys and wrap them up in slick online dashboards, have very little rigour in what they do, but it appeals to a client with a low budget who wants self-service tracking. \n\nI don’t come up against them much these days because my clients want more consultancy but they’re great at marketing themselves. I’ve spent time using their platform, it’s not good, their samples are low and non-representative, and there’s very little insight.

          "text": "Tracksuit are very good at marketing themselves, as you would expect from any company holding tens of millions in VC funding, but they are not good at brand research. As a researcher you know when awareness numbers look suspect they usually are.\n\nTake a look at their TikTok report (The Awareness Advantage) for example. It is presented as major evidence that awareness drives performance, but the effective dataset is tiny. They start with a much larger pool of brands, then filter it down to 11 brands, leaving around 60 data points underpinning the headline claims. From that, they publish big, confident multipliers and thresholds that get repeated as fact.\n\nThat is not defensible brand research. They are effectively running simple regressions on messy, observational brand data and then making broad claims about behaviour. Awareness, spend, distribution, brand size, and category effects are all tangled together, but none of that is properly accounted for. What they mostly end up rediscovering is that big, well-funded brands perform better. Tracksuit position this back to marketers as insight.\n\nYou are right on data quality too. We never use Dynata for the same reasons you mention. Tracksuit appeals to teams that are time-poor, budget-constrained, and want something simple they can screenshot into a slide, even if it is not true. Sadly, that is not unique to our industry, but it does a lot of damage.",

It’s a slick system, it hits the notes a marketer wants, it’s self serve, and their Coach T emails are pretty awesome. \n\n\nBut - there’s limited customisation, limited support, limited sample. So anything which is a more nuanced audience, a client who wants interpretation and recommendation, or has specific things of interest - a boutique solution will win out.

Usually it’s because the market research agency didn’t say “we can’t research that, it’s impossible”, and instead went “sure, money, sure!”  \n\nWay too often senior agency leaders are promising the earth when they don’t understand if it can be delivered. And clients end up with a disappointing ride which results in them no longer believing in research.",

Sometimes that can be if the scope is too broad to give good clarity on next steps, or if the the research report is somewhat vague.\n\nAlso, respect that there is always questionable data and that it’s a gamble. If it’s a decision to be made that depends on data and your gut says it’s untrustworthy, it’s sensible to withhold action and maybe do another pass at the question.",
