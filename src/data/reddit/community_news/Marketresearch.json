With experiences, the value often only becomes clear after someone has actually lived through it.\n\nFor those who’ve worked with experience-based or service products, what truly helped people understand the value before buying?  \nWas it storytelling, reviews, how it was framed, some form of trial, or something else?\n\nI’d really appreciate real examples and lived experience, not theory.",

So I focus on showing concrete examples - like \"helped this company validate their pricing model, saved them from building the wrong features\" with specific outcomes.\n\nTrials don't really work for consulting because the value is in the full process, not a sample. What works better is being really specific about what problem you solve and showing proof you've solved it before.\n\nAlso most of my clients come from referrals because someone they trust vouched for the experience. That's way more powerful than any messaging or positioning I could do.",

Because if you start to see that recurring as a pattern that can be really valuable insights: hypothetically, “a recurring theme in the data is that gender and frequency of product usage  are strong predictors of satisfaction with product X”.

You get responses, you can export the data, you're good to go.\n\nThe gap I've seen (technical founder here, doing a lot of user research) is when you need *systematic* feedback - like recurring customer satisfaction measurement, post-purchase surveys, or continuous feedback loops. Free tools fall apart because:\n\n1. **No automation** - You're manually sending surveys each time\n2. **No integration** - Can't trigger surveys based on customer behavior or events\n3. **No workflow** - Feedback sits in a spreadsheet, doesn't route to the right people\n\nFor research, you're probably doing projects, so free tools work fine. For B2B companies trying to measure customer health continuously, that's where paid tools start making sense.\n\nWhat's your use case specifically?",
