Like I've used CleverX and Respondent to recruit executives and decision-makers for interviews. Full disclosure, I've used them as a consultant. They're expensive but people expect research conversations, not sales, so you get better insights.\n\nUsing sales outreach for research feedback feels like a byproduct rather than intentional research.

I initially feared that a full-service agency would be far beyond our budget, but I’ve come to the conclusion that we can no longer rely on intuition and quickly made forms.  \n  \nAt the moment I’m in advanced discussions with [Vision One Research](https://visionone.co.uk) and I’m thinking about starting a collaboration with them. I was attracted by the fact that they seem to have the necessary experience in the UK market and an entry-level financial threshold more accessible than I expected from an agency of that caliber.  \n  \nIt would be a big relief to have them take care of all the logistics with respondent recruitment and data cleaning.

As a researcher you know when awareness numbers look suspect they usually are.\n\nTake a look at their TikTok report (The Awareness Advantage) for example. It is presented as major evidence that awareness drives performance, but the effective dataset is tiny. They start with a much larger pool of brands, then filter it down to 11 brands, leaving around 60 data points underpinning the headline claims. From that, they publish big, confident multipliers and thresholds that get repeated as fact.\n\nThat is not defensible brand research. They are effectively running simple regressions on messy, observational brand data and then making broad claims about behaviour. Awareness, spend, distribution, brand size, and category effects are all tangled together, but none of that is properly accounted for. What they mostly end up rediscovering is that big, well-funded brands perform better. Tracksuit position this back to marketers as insight.\n\nYou are right on data quality too. We never use Dynata for the same reasons you mention. Tracksuit appeals to teams that are time-poor, budget-constrained, and want something simple they can screenshot into a slide, even if it is not true. Sadly, that is not unique to our industry, but it does a lot of damage.",

One effective approach is to design questions that are neutral and focused on real-world actions, then combine them with robust consumer segmentation and behavioural filters to ensure the responses reflect your target audience.

At best, you learn whether your existing hypotheses are right or wrong, but you rarely discover something truly new.\n\nOpen-ended responses are messier, but the “effort” argument matters less today though.   \nThere are AI tools that can analyze open-ended responses almost as fast as numeric data.   \n  \nFull disclosure: I’m one of the founders of Blix, which does this for survey open ends at scale, but there are several good tools out there now.\n\nSo in practice, I’d optimize for research quality first (open-ended for discovery, structured later for validation), and let modern analysis tools remove the old trade-off between insight depth and operational effort.",

Like if I need \"small business owners who use accounting software,\" I screen for company size, revenue, and what tools they actually use. Generic screening gets you generic people who don't match your target.\n\nAlso avoid convenience sampling if you can. Like don't just post a survey link on Twitter and call it research - you'll only get Twitter users who saw your tweet.\n\nFor B2B stuff, I've used panels like Respondent and UserInterviews. Also tried CleverX a couple times when I needed really specific business roles (like CISOs or finance directors). Full disclosure, I've used it as a consultant. Definitely more expensive than consumer panels but the targeting is better if you need senior people.\n\nThe main thing is know who you're actually reaching and be honest about the limitations. Every sampling method has bias, you just need to be aware of it.",

Because if you start to see that recurring as a pattern that can be really valuable insights: hypothetically, “a recurring theme in the data is that gender and frequency of product usage  are strong predictors of satisfaction with product X”.

Free tools fall apart because:\n\n1. **No automation** - You're manually sending surveys each time\n2. **No integration** - Can't trigger surveys based on customer behavior or events\n3. **No workflow** - Feedback sits in a spreadsheet, doesn't route to the right people\n\nFor research, you're probably doing projects, so free tools work fine.

You’re often dealing with mixed sources, variable recruitment standards, and limited visibility into how respondents are actually verified, which can hurt consistency and face validity. It can work for quick, broad reads, but I’d be cautious if the study needs precise targeting or high-confidence insights.",

Cint aggregates, but I doubt would reach all of those.\n\nHowever, OP, beware that CAWI as you know it doesn’t really exist in those markets. Mostly we’re talking smaller smartphones, and very rarely laptops etc. so, if you’re asking big complex likerts then stop right now. You have to design absolutely for usability and ease both for your quality and cost. \n\nAnd, also, that often when you’re targeting you think you’re speaking to the adult that travelled by plane, but in fact you’re talking to the uncle of the adult who travelled by plane, because they think that they’re all one and the same.\n\nEdit: oh, also, it’ll need to be in French. Sorry, you probably already knew that!",

In our experience, combining local panel providers with strong mobile penetration and supplementing with hybrid methods (CAWI + CATI) helps improve sample quality and response rates, especially outside Tier-1 urban centers. Panel performance also varies significantly across Nigeria, Ghana, and Francophone markets, so country level validation is essential. Happy to connect and share more practical insights based on similar studies, if helpful.",

I’ve been interviewing for sr. research manager positions and twice now I’ve been asked this question and didn’t feel like I was prepared to respond. Once I said “room for learning and growth”, the other time I said something in the lines of being trusted to independently do my job. Both times I was bullshiting  to be honest - as one does in job interviews. Neither felt right. \n\nFor context, I work mostly on quant ad-hoc studies as a sr research manager. Make $100K. Applying for similar positions with a bit of a pay bump, $110-$120K would be nice. \n\nThank you for advising! ",
