The fact that SQL returns \"error\" but doesn't tell you WHERE or WHAT the error is drives me up the wall with frustration. I'm liable to lose track of the dialect and make a syntax error that screws up the entire line of code. I'm not great at link testing because after the second or third time it all looks the same and I start missing things. I can do short bursts of very intensive attention to detail, and I'm great for a first round, but I burn out fast.\n\nMy strengths are in storytelling and seeing the big picture; my degree is actually in English and  originally wanted to work in publishing. I'm good at looking at a spreadsheet and saying \"these are the 3 things that matter.\" The people I know in data analytics spend a lot, even most, of their workday writing queries and fixing broken code.",

Now I am supporting a senior researcher on a qualitative project and they want me to start conducting some IDIs on my own next week.\n\nThe problem is I am struggling to figure out how to moderate and take notes at the same time. I kept getting stuck between listening for emotional cues and trying to uncover the why behind the answers while also capturing what the participant said. I either miss the moment to probe deeper or my notes end up being fragmented. I got mixed advice from my colleagues. Some say just record everything and take minimal notes. Others say you need to capture key quotes live because you will never have time to go back through all the audio. One colleague mentioned using meeting transcription tools like Fireflies, Beyz, Granola and focus yourself on the interview itself. I am curious what actually works for newbies? Do you take detailed notes live or rely on recordings and transcripts? Is there a learning curve I just need to push through or are there specific techniques that helped you get better at this? ",

Most people find it works best to focus primarily on moderating and listening for emotion and follow-ups, while taking only light notes in the moment; key themes, strong reactions, or quick timestamps rather than full quotes. Recording and using transcripts lets you go back for detail later, which frees you up to probe properly during the interview. Missing a good follow-up is harder to fix than missing a sentence, and after a handful of interviews, you’ll naturally get better at balancing the two.",

If you’re not familiar with the interview guide and don’t take notes, you’ll ask them again mid-way what solutions they use, and the client as well as the interviewee will say, “You weren’t listening to me, were you? I already told you I used X, Y, and Z.”\n\nIf that happens more than a few times, you won’t be offered a full time job after your internship. They might not fire you because why bother firing an intern, but it’s just as bad.\n\nSo to prevent that, you’ll need to take notes yourself. Don’t rely on AI or a note taker.",

In parallel proceed with cost-based approach, topping up fixed + variable costs and margin to understand what is a profitable price range. Once you combine the 2 info, you get at least an understanding of where you’ll land with your price. This won’t tell you how much consumers are willing to pay, but I would highly discourage against any qualitative approach when it is about pricing.",

      "text": "Hi all!  \nI think it’s something a lot of people in research, marketing, and analytics need to be talking about. Normally when we think of bad survey data, we think of bias or bad design - but that's not the whole story anymore.\n\n1. Surface-Level Cleanness ≠ True Validity\n\nSurvey reports can look statistically sound but still be based on data that do not reflect real human sentiment or behavior - especially when participants game incentives or machines mimic human responses.\n\n2. AI-Assisted Responses Complicate Detection\n\nGenerative AI can answer open-ended questions with plausible language and internal consistency, which historically were seen as safeguards against dishonest or inattentive respondents (source: [Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-global-digital-health-innovation/january-2025-guarding-data-integrity-tackling-challenges-in-online-surveys)).\n\nThis mirrors broader research showing that the use of AI in surveys is a real issue: a published study found significant portions of crowdsourced survey responses involved AI use and that such answers are less varied and less authentic than human responses.\n\n3. Traditional Biases Are Now Systematic\n\nStandard survey challenges - sampling bias, straight-lining, inattentive respondents - aren't new, but they become more systematic at scale when combined with incentive gaming or AI.\n\nRather than rejecting surveys entirely, the [Bell & Holmes article](https://www.bellandholmes.com/blog/when-surveys-lie-data-integrity-crisis) suggests pairing surveys with:\n\n* Human validation (e.g., expert interviews, live checks);\n* Hybrid research designs where surveys map broad sentiment and deeper qualitative information fills in context;\n* Contextual sense-checking and triangulation with other data sources;\n\nThese approaches help guard against overconfidence in survey results, especially for decision-grade research - where wrong numbers can lead to bad strategic choices.\n\nIndustry concerns about survey integrity:\n\n* Fraud and Incentive Gaming: Studies estimate non-negligible portions of survey responses are fraudulent or low-quality - depending on platform and incentives - reflecting similar concerns raised in market research discussions.\n* AI and Data Integrity: Academic research finds that crowdsourced surveys increasingly include AI-generated responses, which can distort results if not properly detected and filtered.\n* Need for Better QA: Market research professionals emphasize that superficial QA checks aren’t enough - more robust design and fraud-detection approaches are needed (see [Kantar study](https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/research-services/how-to-combat-survey-fraud-pf))\n\nTLDR: Surveys aren't dead, but relying on them alone without *smarter integrity checks* (like identity verification, behavioral QA, or live validation) is becoming risky. Real human feedback matters *more* than ever - even if it’s slower and harder to get.\n\nHas anyone in the subreddit seen this in real research work? Like AI-generated open-ends, panel farms, etc.? What do you do to catch or prevent it?",

If you aren't cleaning 25% or more of your dataset you probably aren't doing it right. Also need to be very rigorous about panel quality and hold their feet to the fire over substandard data. \n\nIf you are a user of MaR you need to have a laser focus on this stuff.",

It’s that way, having a background in consumer insights could make you effective because you’re able to quickly understand and dissect what is going right/wrong for competitors relative to the company you work for. Not to force fit the two roles - competitive intelligence is going to have plenty of strategy and financial analysis as well, but at the end of the day, consumer companies that win are those who serve and speak to their specific audience better than competitors. In that way, there’s a strong analogue between the two roles and you should be set up to be effective. You’re basically doing consumer insights work on competitors’ audiences",
