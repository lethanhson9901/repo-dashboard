As a researcher you know when awareness numbers look suspect they usually are.\n\nTake a look at their TikTok report (The Awareness Advantage) for example. It is presented as major evidence that awareness drives performance, but the effective dataset is tiny. They start with a much larger pool of brands, then filter it down to 11 brands, leaving around 60 data points underpinning the headline claims. From that, they publish big, confident multipliers and thresholds that get repeated as fact.\n\nThat is not defensible brand research. They are effectively running simple regressions on messy, observational brand data and then making broad claims about behaviour. Awareness, spend, distribution, brand size, and category effects are all tangled together, but none of that is properly accounted for. What they mostly end up rediscovering is that big, well-funded brands perform better. Tracksuit position this back to marketers as insight.\n\nYou are right on data quality too. We never use Dynata for the same reasons you mention. Tracksuit appeals to teams that are time-poor, budget-constrained, and want something simple they can screenshot into a slide, even if it is not true. Sadly, that is not unique to our industry, but it does a lot of damage.",

So anything which is a more nuanced audience, a client who wants interpretation and recommendation, or has specific things of interest - a boutique solution will win out.

      "text": "Been seeing a lot of posts lately about “AI market research tools” and rankings and all that, including the recent analysis here. I’ve been playing with a bunch of these tools over the past year, mostly because I do a lot of desk research and anything that saves time is hard to ignore.\n\nHonestly though, my experience has been pretty mixed.\n\nMost of these tools are decent at skimming large amounts of public info and giving you a quick sense of what’s going on in a market. That part actually helps, especially when you’re dropped into a new industry and need to get oriented fast. But after that first pass, you still hit the same old problems — shaky numbers, missing context, unclear sources.\n\nI think the hype makes it sound like AI is replacing research judgment, but in reality it’s just moving the grunt work around. You still have to decide what’s credible, what’s noise, and what actually matters for the question you’re trying to answer. Otherwise you end up with insights that sound confident but don’t really hold up.\n\nI’ve also noticed that chasing “all-in-one AI research platforms” hasn’t been worth it for me. The tools I actually keep using are the ones that help early on — quick scans, rough market framing, directional growth narratives — and then I go back to old-school secondary research to validate things properly.\n\nFor example, I’ve been using [statshub.ai](http://statshub.ai) occasionally just to get an initial market snapshot or sanity-check how a category is being framed. I don’t treat it as a source of truth, more like a starting point before digging deeper.\n\nNet takeaway for me so far: AI definitely makes desk research faster, but it doesn’t make it smarter. If anything, it forces you to be more careful because it’s very good at being confidently vague.\n\nCurious how others here are actually using these tools once the novelty wears off. Are you trusting them with numbers yet, or still keeping them at arm’s length?",

It takes a level of talent and awareness and creativity and methodological expertise that is rare to find in any one person or team. On top of that, the best researcher in the world can’t make a report or finding impactful to an org if they don’t engage their client-side stakeholders (and get good engagement back) to understand the organizational context and work with the end in mind throughout the whole project. As you mentioned in this comment, a world-class partner will ask you why you think the work would and would not be accepted and used by the org in the first one or two calls of the project. It takes ALL of those skills to consistently deliver projects that impact the org, plus being really checked-in and having the bandwidth to do great work.\n\nThe good news about our space is that this work is really needed by tons of organizations that need to understand their customer and audience. The bad news is the breadth and depth of skills it takes to do great work is very, very hard to train and develop. The result is tons of research that’s just okay. It technically answers the question but doesn’t inspire action or make a lasting impact.",

This is a little more complex but worthwhile if you’re finding that respondents in a study are very similar to each other in ways that don’t represent reality. \n\nEvery panel recruits and incentivizes respondents a certain way. Those methods have a strong selection effect on who is in the panel. This isn’t wrong, it’s just how it works. Using a panel aggregator allows you to access lots of different underlying panels (suppliers) which allows you to reach a more psychographically (and demographically) diverse respondent pool. In reality, the panel world is dominated by like 6 very large suppliers that account for a large portion of sample on any given aggregator, but that’s 5 more than letting it fill overnight with a single supplier.\n\nAs others have noted, this approach necessarily means more time to fill your sample. This makes a normal survey take at least a week to fill if you’re balancing across demographics and enforcing diversity of suppliers.\n\nAlso, if your respondents look VERY similar (and you’ve paid something to them), they’re probably just fraud from a survey farm. If the sample filled very quickly, this is almost certainly the case.",

          "text": "A common way to reduce bias is to control the sample *before* the survey launches rather than trying to fix it afterward. That usually means recruiting from a verified, managed panel with clear quotas across key demographics, plus ongoing quality checks to avoid duplicate, rushed, or low-intent responses.\n\nCompared to open links shared across a single channel, controlled communities tend to produce more representative data and higher-quality answers, especially when paired with engagement-focused formats instead of long, repetitive surveys.",

          "text": "Screening questions help but they're not foolproof. People lie to qualify for incentives.\n\nWhat actually works better is being really specific about where you distribute. Don't just blast it everywhere and hope. If you need B2B users, go to industry Slack groups or LinkedIn. If you need consumers, maybe Reddit or Facebook groups where your actual users hang out.\n\nAlso sample size matters less than sample quality. I'd rather have 100 responses from the right people than 1000 from randoms who clicked through from some survey panel.\n\nThe weighting thing only works if you know what \"right\" looks like upfront. Most people don't actually know their target distribution well enough to weight accurately.\n\nHonestly though, surveys have limitations. If your question needs that much precision about who's answering, you might need interviews instead of a survey. Slower but way less sampling noise.",

I’ve been interviewing for sr. research manager positions and twice now I’ve been asked this question and didn’t feel like I was prepared to respond. Once I said “room for learning and growth”, the other time I said something in the lines of being trusted to independently do my job. Both times I was bullshiting  to be honest - as one does in job interviews. Neither felt right. \n\nFor context, I work mostly on quant ad-hoc studies as a sr research manager. Make $100K. Applying for similar positions with a bit of a pay bump, $110-$120K would be nice. \n\nThank you for advising! ",

My answer is I’m looking for a change, I can’t stand the culture of my current company anymore, and it seems like a good time to job hop, as I’m approaching 4 years at my current job and I could use the type of pay increase that comes with getting a new job. I’m in my late 20s BTW if that makes a difference",

Talk about what about your current culture you want a change from and what you perceive about the culture of the company you are interviewing with that seems better.
