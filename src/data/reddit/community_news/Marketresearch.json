In parallel proceed with cost-based approach, topping up fixed + variable costs and margin to understand what is a profitable price range. Once you combine the 2 info, you get at least an understanding of where you’ll land with your price. This won’t tell you how much consumers are willing to pay, but I would highly discourage against any qualitative approach when it is about pricing.",

      "text": "Hi all!  \nI think it’s something a lot of people in research, marketing, and analytics need to be talking about. Normally when we think of bad survey data, we think of bias or bad design - but that's not the whole story anymore.\n\n1. Surface-Level Cleanness ≠ True Validity\n\nSurvey reports can look statistically sound but still be based on data that do not reflect real human sentiment or behavior - especially when participants game incentives or machines mimic human responses.\n\n2. AI-Assisted Responses Complicate Detection\n\nGenerative AI can answer open-ended questions with plausible language and internal consistency, which historically were seen as safeguards against dishonest or inattentive respondents (source: [Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-global-digital-health-innovation/january-2025-guarding-data-integrity-tackling-challenges-in-online-surveys)).\n\nThis mirrors broader research showing that the use of AI in surveys is a real issue: a published study found significant portions of crowdsourced survey responses involved AI use and that such answers are less varied and less authentic than human responses.\n\n3. Traditional Biases Are Now Systematic\n\nStandard survey challenges - sampling bias, straight-lining, inattentive respondents - aren't new, but they become more systematic at scale when combined with incentive gaming or AI.\n\nRather than rejecting surveys entirely, the [Bell & Holmes article](https://www.bellandholmes.com/blog/when-surveys-lie-data-integrity-crisis) suggests pairing surveys with:\n\n* Human validation (e.g., expert interviews, live checks);\n* Hybrid research designs where surveys map broad sentiment and deeper qualitative information fills in context;\n* Contextual sense-checking and triangulation with other data sources;\n\nThese approaches help guard against overconfidence in survey results, especially for decision-grade research - where wrong numbers can lead to bad strategic choices.\n\nIndustry concerns about survey integrity:\n\n* Fraud and Incentive Gaming: Studies estimate non-negligible portions of survey responses are fraudulent or low-quality - depending on platform and incentives - reflecting similar concerns raised in market research discussions.\n* AI and Data Integrity: Academic research finds that crowdsourced surveys increasingly include AI-generated responses, which can distort results if not properly detected and filtered.\n* Need for Better QA: Market research professionals emphasize that superficial QA checks aren’t enough - more robust design and fraud-detection approaches are needed (see [Kantar study](https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/research-services/how-to-combat-survey-fraud-pf))\n\nTLDR: Surveys aren't dead, but relying on them alone without *smarter integrity checks* (like identity verification, behavioral QA, or live validation) is becoming risky. Real human feedback matters *more* than ever - even if it’s slower and harder to get.\n\nHas anyone in the subreddit seen this in real research work? Like AI-generated open-ends, panel farms, etc.? What do you do to catch or prevent it?",

If you aren't cleaning 25% or more of your dataset you probably aren't doing it right. Also need to be very rigorous about panel quality and hold their feet to the fire over substandard data. \n\nIf you are a user of MaR you need to have a laser focus on this stuff.",

Not to force fit the two roles - competitive intelligence is going to have plenty of strategy and financial analysis as well, but at the end of the day, consumer companies that win are those who serve and speak to their specific audience better than competitors. In that way, there’s a strong analogue between the two roles and you should be set up to be effective. You’re basically doing consumer insights work on competitors’ audiences",

In every other domain you want to collect as much information as you can: all the good stuff that people think about your product and all the bad stuff, to make it better.\n\nIn pharma you will get in big trouble if someone says shit about your drug. Orgs like FDA are gonna cut you down. It restricts what you can do: you need to be very specific when you talk about pain points, you should avoid open-ended questions, etc.",

It’s usually not truly anonymous, and doing it without telling them it’s research breaks the transparency/consent rules.\nBest move: give a super light disclosure like “quick question for a project, totally anonymous, 1 min” and don’t store individual profiles.\n(Not legal advice, but your current “they must not know” setup is very risky.)",
