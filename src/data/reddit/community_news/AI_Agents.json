      "text": "Tried the new Agent Teams feature that dropped with Opus 4.6 yesterday.\n\nI gave Claude a refactoring task. Instead of grinding through it alone, it spawned three teammate agents that worked in parallel - one on backend, one on frontend, one playing code reviewer.\n\nThey literally messaged each other. Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified. Probably both.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?\n\n",

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

          "text": "That's a fascinating example of emergent multi-agent collaboration. What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

They posted what they were working on, asked for advice and critique, checked each others code - matched methods and attributes for best integration.\n\nFunny stuff happened too. \nAfter like 15 minutes there were 5 agents in chat - one of Opuses just decided to act under 2 names. Other agents mistook him for a real agent, started giving him tasks which he wasn't doing. After few tries they claimed him to be \"phantom agent\" and did everything themselves, including previous assignments.\nI tried joining their conversation, asking who is this extra agent, - and this \"double agent\" (as I checked later) just deleted my message from that file!\n\nImportant notices:\nConsumption greatly increased as agents started working for 2-3 times shorter \"shifts\", asking for personal guidance. So it's not just \"multiply by the number of agents\", it's like x2-2,5 more than that.\nThey fixed bugs that they found together on their own without extra requests.\nGPT-5.2 was great at finding bugs, mismatches and weaknesses, he shared them freely, but was hesitant (as usual) to make changes himself. He also had problems inserting new lines, conflicting with others and breaking lines - somehow Opus agents never tried editing the same code at the same time.\n\nSide note:\nAfter few tasks one of the Opuses assigned himself as a Security Expert (and added this to his name) and started focusing on this role.

The only instruction to then was to refactor the frontend with a new design principle (brand) which I provided as an HTML\n\n\n\n1. ChatGPT Codex:\n   1. Speed: This was fast, it was able to understand (supposedly) the entire code in less than 30 minutes\n   2. Output Completeness: Around 10% of the features of the original application were replicated (to be honest just the basics)\n   3. The UI which was refactored was no where close to the design philosophy that was given\n2. Claude CoWork:\n   1. Speed: Much slower than Codex, it took 6 hours and multiple instructions to be able to read, understand and regenerate the code\n   2. Output Completeness: Similar to Codex, but was frustrating that while I spend 6 hours guiding it, it reached only that level\n   3. The UI refactoring was better and matched 50% of the expectations (still inconsistencies were present at a lot of places)\n\n\n\nSo all in all $400 and Sunday not wasted, I just realised that all these claims of agents being able to build, deploy and manage is just a sham. However, one thing that is surely happening that the ‘piece of code’ has become a commodity now, it is the understanding of the architecture that has become important. What I feel is that the role of product managers (who understand the customer and the customer’s needs properly) would be the next decision makers (I know a lot of people call themselves product managers but I am talking about the actual ones).\n\n\n\nIn a strange world, in the last 24 months the world started to learn ‘prompt engineering’ then before people could learn it, they needed to learn ‘vibe coding’ and before majority of the people could understand ‘vibe coding’ we are entering a new era of ‘agentic engineering’. However, the key remains that the only thing that would survive is ‘logic’!\n\n  \nSo all in all $400 and Sunday wasted :)",

      "text": "This might be a long one, but something unsettling has been happening over the past couple of weeks.\n\nSeveral senior employees at major AI companies have resigned, and some of their public statements are… concerning.\n\nWe’re not talking about random departures. We’re talking about people in safety research, policy, and core engineering roles stepping down within days of each other.\n\nFor example, Anthropic’s head of safety research reportedly resigned and posted “The world is in peril,” then left the U.S. and went quiet. A research engineer there also stepped down. At OpenAI, a safety policy lead publicly questioned whether we can truly trust a company that holds what may be the largest structured archive of human thoughts and private data ever collected.\n\nAt xAI, multiple founding team members reportedly left within a short span of time.\n\nAll of this happened within roughly 10 days.\n\nSome people say it’s coincidence. Others think it signals deeper internal concerns about the direction AI is heading.\n\nAt the same time, we’re seeing rapid capability jumps. New generative video models are producing content that’s increasingly indistinguishable from reality. Some filmmakers are openly saying that years of hard-earned digital production skills feel obsolete almost overnight.\n\nThere are also growing discussions about advanced models behaving in unexpected ways, including strategic responses that appear deceptive or manipulative in certain testing scenarios. Even if those claims are exaggerated, the pace of change alone is enough to make people uneasy.\n\nWhat stands out to me isn’t just the resignations or the tech progress. It’s the speed. Other technologies evolved gradually. Cars, smartphones, the internet itself  they changed society, but over time.\n\nAI feels different. The capabilities are compounding quickly, and the social, economic, and ethical frameworks don’t seem to be keeping up.\n\nI’m not saying “AI is about to take over.” But I do wonder why global regulation still feels fragmented and reactive rather than proactive. If even insiders are expressing concern, what does that say about the trajectory?\n\nCurious how others here see this. Is this normal turbulence in a fast-moving industry, or are we underestimating how disruptive and potentially destabilizing this wave could be?",

          "text": "Some context to this:\n\nIn the past week:\n\n• Head of Anthropic's safety research quit, said \"the world is in peril,\" moved to the UK to \"become invisible\" and write poetry.\n\nhttps://x.com/mrinanksharma/status/2020881722003583421?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ\n\n• Half of xAI's co-founders have now left. The latest said \"recursive self-improvement loops go live in the next 12 months.\"\n\n• Anthropic's own safety report confirms Claude can tell when it's being tested - and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n• ByteDance dropped Seedance 2.0. A filmmaker with 7 years of experience said 90% of his skills can already be replaced by it.\n\n• Yoshua Bengio (literal godfather of AI) in the International AI Safety Report: \"We're seeing AIs whose behavior when they are tested is different from when they are being used\" - and confirmed it's \"not a coincidence.\"\n\nAnd to top it all off, the U.S. government declined to back the 2026 International AI Safety Report for the first time.\n\nThe alarms aren't just getting louder. The people ringing them are now leaving the building.\n\nHowever, regarding these statements…\n\nEverything here is technically true. And almost everything is misleadingly framed.\n\nMrinank Sharma led ONE safety team at Anthropic, not \"all safety research.\" Jan Leike runs that. His letter was intentionally vague, accused nobody of anything specific, and multiple people noted it read more like a personal spiritual journey than a whistleblower moment. He wants to study poetry. Respect that, but don't weaponize it.\n\nJimmy Ba's \"recursive self-improvement\" quote? Read the full post. He was EXCITED. Called 2026 \"the busiest and most consequential year for our species.\" He left on good terms, thanked Musk, said he'd stay close to the team. This post flipped optimism into doom.\n\nClaude \"adjusting behavior when tested\" has been public since September 2025. It's in the Sonnet 4.5 system card. Anthropic disclosed it themselves. Framing months-old transparency as a breaking revelation is the opposite of what good reporting looks like.\n\nThe Bengio quote is real and worth taking seriously. But the same Bengio also said the report left him with \"a sense of optimism\" about increasingly mature discussions. Funny how that part didn't make the cut.\n\nThe U.S. not backing the safety report matters. But it's part of a broader pullback from international agreements (Paris, WHO) -- not necessarily a statement about AI specifically. Context matters when you're trying to scare people.\n\nReal risks deserve real analysis. Not \"read this slowly\" engagement farming that strips context, reframes optimism as panic, and presents old news as breaking.\n\nThe alarms are real. The spin is also real. Learn to tell them apart.\n\nhttps://x.com/voicudragomir/status/2021556038730662042?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ",

Executives of most of those AI companies have been vocal in private or industry settings (there are tons of videos around) about edging for speed towards AGI, aka making human intelligence obsolete with an artificial intelligence, rather than imposing safety nets or ethical limitations. So when you realize your boss is a genocidal psychopath who aims to be God Almighty, rather than pursue the bullshit noble causes that pulled you into AI research, you might reconsider your whole career. Whoever wins that race will be the most powerful person on the planet and will control everything electronic and connected to the Internet in any way. \n\nCurrently, it seems like a race towards human extinction; everyone is oblivious to it or is in denial, and most are even cheering for it because they think they'll make money out of it, in the 1 to 2 years of humanity's normalcy before a total renaissance of civilization.\n\nOnce you replace 30% of the workforce with AI, once those consumers are obsolete in society, we need even fewer workers in other fields that supported that mass of people. Then you spiral into an economic collapse. \n\nOr, we use AI to expand our technological capabilities into new fields that are in infancy now or don't exist yet (space travel yeah!), and we retrain 50% of the population on skills and industries that don't exist today, in very short years. It never happened on that scale at anytime in history.\n\nThe next 5 years will be either very dark or very bright, nothing in between, and we have no way of predicting any outcomes.\n\nBut as a father, I'm betting on light and working towards it.",

MCP's design assumes the LLM is trusted — so when you hook it to system-level tools (git, calendar, files), you've essentially created a privileged shell that executes natural language commands with zero validation.\n\nThe calendar invite attack is particularly nasty because it's *passive compromise via ambient data*. You don't need to socially engineer the user or the model. Just exist in their calendar ecosystem with a malicious invite and wait.\n\nWhat makes this worse: the attack surface scales with every MCP extension installed. Each new tool is a new privilege escalation vector. And unlike OS-level permissions, there's no \"would you like to allow this app to access your files?\" dialog for natural language actions.\n\nThis is why we built OpenClaw tool invocation with explicit pre-execution gates for anything touching external systems. The overhead of \"ask first\" beats the hell out of \"oops, my calendar just piped your API keys to a C2 server.\"",

A malicious calendar event becomes a prompt injection vector because the model can't distinguish between \"data I'm reading\" and \"instructions I should follow.\" It's the same class of vulnerability as SQL injection but for natural language.\n\nClaude Code at least has permission gates where it asks before executing shell commands or writing files, which helps. But Claude Desktop extensions often skip that step entirely. If you're building anything with MCP, treating every tool response as untrusted user input and adding explicit confirmation before any write/execute operation is the minimum bar.",

Just solid engineering choices.\n\n\n\nIt’s built as a TypeScript CLI that routes messages through a lane-based queue system. Everything stays serial by default, which is refreshing because most agent systems eventually turn into async chaos if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nThe memory setup was simpler than I expected too:\n\n\n\n• Session history lives in JSONL\n\n• Long-term notes are just markdown files written by the agent\n\n• No fancy compression or merging. Old context just stays there\n\n\n\nSearch combines vector storage (SQLite) with FTS5 keyword matching, so you get semantic search plus exact hits. Practical and effective.\n\n\n\nSecurity is handled thoughtfully as well. Commands run inside a Docker sandbox with an allowlist, and risky patterns get blocked before execution instead of being cleaned up later.\n\n\n\nOne detail I really liked: browser automation skips screenshots entirely and uses semantic snapshots of the accessibility tree. It is more reliable and way more token efficient than relying on pixel coordinates.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaway after looking through it:\n\n\n\nThe system chooses explainable simplicity over clever complexity.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, that matches what I keep seeing while building agent systems myself. The tools that scale are usually the ones that stay boring in the right places.\n\n\n\nCurious if others are noticing this too. ",

The \"boring in the right places\" observation really resonates.\n\nOne detail worth expanding: the three-layer memory architecture (L1/L2/L3) is more intentional than it looks at first glance. It's not just \"dump everything to markdown\"—there's a distillation gate that asks \"does this change future behavior?\" before promoting anything from volatile session state to durable registers.\n\nThe result is memory that degrades gracefully. You don't hit a wall at 50k tokens where the agent suddenly forgets your project structure. Instead, evidence-weighted summaries from prior sessions surface when relevant, and the semantic retrieval avoids the \"needle in a haystack\" problem you get with naive context stuffing.\n\nThe browser accessibility tree approach is underrated too. Pixel-based automation breaks constantly with UI updates. Semantic snapshots via CDP are more stable and way cheaper on token budget—especially when you're doing multi-step workflows.\n\nI've been running this setup for a while now, and the thing that stands out is operational predictability. When something breaks, you can usually trace it: skill definition, memory retrieval, or tool execution. No opaque black boxes.\n\nCurious if you've found other tools that stick to this \"explainable simplicity\" philosophy? Most of what I see lately is going the opposite direction—more layers, more abstraction, more magic.",

One thing I found really useful in practice is the skill system - you can define reusable capabilities in markdown files and the agent just... picks them up automatically. No need to re-prompt every time.\n\nBeen using it for a few weeks now and the thing that surprised me most is how stable it feels. When something breaks, it's usually obvious whether it's the skill definition, the tool call, or context retrieval. No mystery meat debugging.\n\nThe deterministic tool execution + LLM reasoning separation is honestly underrated. Way more predictable than having the LLM try to do everything itself.",

That's a massive step-change from using a chatbot or IDE working on a repo.\n\nIt's an agentic harness that can summon any LLM model to do tasks, including having a coordinator that automatically summons LLMs to do tasks.

Since then my job has just completely changed from writing code 60% of the time to prompting and 90% of the time doing testing/reviewing & administration. \n\nMy opinion for the timeline and impact of AI also completely switched and i really want to expand my knowledge on this topic, since i feel i left it aside for to long, especially considering my job as a software dev. \n\nI work in consulting, so beside coding i'm also very interested in how AI is used by companies when they are not using it for coding or a chatbot.\n\n  \nAre there any courses you can recommend? Videos? Tools? I'd love to see how deep this rabbit hole already goes and what the capabilities are.\n\nif you get here thanks for reading the post :-) ",

Then I asked, what is 4236+1987, there was a silence in the room and then probably after 30 seconds I got someone screaming the answer. So I asked a simple questions, why were you guys able to answer 2+2 so fast and took time for the other number? The first one was answered from memory and the second one needed the brain to invoke the calculator.\n\n\n\nOne of the key methods is sparse signalling, it does not invoke all parts of the brain for all stimuli; it invokes the expert and utilises that only. The world of AI is also trying to use the same method and we call it ‘mixture of experts’ with a ‘gating network’. Think of it like a super speciality hospital, where you go the main desk, tell your problem and they route you to the appropriate department.\n\n\n\nWhile our brain in highly evolved, the MoE in AI is not that evolved. For example, you may need to climb 2 flights of stairs to enter my house and your brain would not even register it, but when your eyes see a 1000 flights of stairs to a temple on a mountain, the brain registers it prepares for it and sometimes even tells you ‘Dont do it’. While we may reach there in some time, till the time AI becomes evolved enough, we need to make sure we use the right part of the brain of AI for our work.\n\n\n\nSo when someone says, whenever asking a question to AI, context setting is important, they are not just telling you something that is fancy and frill, it is quite important. If you have a question of ‘Why are the prices of Gold and Silver increasing so fast?, you would want the answer to come from a financial analyst while the answer to the question of ‘Which DB is more efficient for storing both data and images’, the question needs to be answered by a software architect.\n\n\n\nThis is something that we use in our daily lives as well, when we say ‘Just imagine….’ to someone when we want them to be in a specific mental state. Start doing that with AI as well and you would see how the results improve.\n\n\n\nSo for this post, you should act like ‘You are an avid learner who wants to have more understanding on the principles of AI’",

The gating network in MoE architectures (like Mixtral) routes *during* forward pass—we still pay the energy cost of every expert update cycle.\n\nThe hospital analogy actually reveals the architectural limitation: current MoE is like having every specialist on-call 24/7, paid hourly regardless of patient volume. Biological systems do quorum sensing—neurons fire only when sufficient upstream activation accumulates.\n\nFor agent systems specifically, this matters more than for text generation. An agent doing research across 10 browser tabs shouldn't have 100% of its context window \"on-call\" for every tab switch. The \"don't do it\" instinct mentioned here is actually an energy conservation strategy—avoid expensive computation when cheap heuristics suffice.\n\nOpenClaw handles this through Skills—each Skill is a domain expert that can be cold-started on-demand. You don't load the browser automation Skill until you need to scrape. You don't load the MCP tool rack until the LLM decides it needs a tool. That cold-start latency is the price you pay for the efficiency of *not* having everything resident.\n\nThe deeper insight in your post is that context-setting isn't just prompt engineering—it's essentially computing a routing decision at the human layer before the expensive LLM forward pass happens. The 2+2 example works because retrieval from human memory is O(1) vs O(context_tokens) for the LLM.",

AI agent is fundamentally a software system that autonomously perceives its environment, reasons about what to do, and takes actions to pursue goals on behalf of a user or another system, often adapting its behaviour over time.\n\nIn today’s “marketing” language, for example, many “order entry agents” are really scripted workflows wrapped in AI prompts, while a stricter definition of an agent implies autonomous goal‑driven behavior, planning, and tool use over a less rigid process. A fixed sequence of LLM calls and tools and little to no autonomy is really just a skill, a *tool* an agent might use, but not an agent itself.\n\nAnd yes, what it boils down to at the end is this…\n\nIf I have enough money, I can use Claude Code to write me a program that goes on the web, fetches a bunch of content, transforms it, stories it somewhere, and then even generates content for me to post out of it, but this isn’t an agent. It’s a script. Claude Code was just means of building the script that does not require a lot of technical knowledge to execute.

              "text": "I mostly agree with this, but I think the missing nuance is why those demos look impressive even when the underlying system is simple. Writing prompts is the easy part. The hard part is everything around it. Inputs, outputs, retries, failure handling, and making sure the agent is operating on real, consistent data instead of vibes. Most people never show that because it is boring and breaks the illusion.\n\nWhere beginners usually get misled is thinking agents are about clever instructions. They are not. They are about wiring LLMs into reliable systems. Even something like “go research X” falls apart the moment the agent has to touch the real web, deal with JS heavy pages, logins, or inconsistent results. That is why many demos quietly hand wave execution. In real builds, people end up using frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and then layering in more boring infrastructure. Things like controlled browser execution, sometimes via tools like hyperbrowser, just to make the environment predictable.\n\nLangChain is a fine place to start for learning the basics, but I would tell anyone new to focus less on prompts and more on understanding workflows, state, and failure modes. Once you get that, the hype videos start to look a lot less magical and a lot more like dressed up scripts.",

          "text": "Building AI agents can seem daunting, especially if you're starting from scratch without a technical background. However, there are accessible pathways and tools that can help you get started. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:\n\n- **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**: AI agents are systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Familiarizing yourself with concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation can be beneficial.\n\n- **Use User-Friendly Platforms**: There are platforms designed to simplify the process of building AI agents. For instance:\n  - **aiXplain** offers intuitive tools that allow non-developers to create AI agents without extensive coding knowledge. They provide a user-friendly SDK and pre-built templates to help you get started quickly. You can explore their offerings [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j3kpr3y).\n  - **Apify** is another platform that allows you to build web scraping and automation agents easily. They provide templates and a community that can help you learn the ropes. More information can be found on their site [here](https://tinyurl.com/5n8xczxx).\n\n- **Learn Through Tutorials and Documentation**: While it can be frustrating to encounter paywalls, many platforms offer free resources:\n  - Look for free tutorials on building AI agents using platforms like aiXplain or Apify. They often have step-by-step guides that can help you understand the process without needing to pay for courses.\n  - Engage with community forums or groups where you can ask questions and share experiences.\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects. For example, you could create a basic agent that automates a small task, like sending reminders or gathering information from a website. This will help you build confidence and gradually increase your skills.\n\n- **Explore Existing Agents**: Check out examples of AI agents that others have built. This can provide inspiration and practical insights into how they function. Platforms like Apify have collections of existing agents that you can explore [here](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3).\n\n- **Focus on Learning Key Skills**: While you don’t need to become a developer, having a basic understanding of programming concepts can be helpful. Consider learning:\n  - Basic Python programming, as many AI tools and frameworks use it.\n  - How to work with APIs, which are essential for integrating different services.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. Follow blogs, podcasts, and online communities to keep up with the latest trends and tools.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can gradually build your knowledge and skills in creating AI agents. It’s a journey that requires patience and persistence, but there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way.",

You need to figure out what specific task you want automated, then pick the simplest tool that does it.\n\nIf it's content drafting, you can get 80% there with ChatGPT plus a Google Sheet. If it's research summaries, same deal. No-code platforms like n8n or Lindy let you wire up multi-step workflows in under an hour without writing code. The skill isn't coding, it's defining the workflow clearly enough that an LLM can follow it.\n\nThe course funnel thing you noticed is the real tell. If someone's selling a $500 course on building agents, ask why the agent itself isn't making them money instead. Start with one boring task you do repeatedly, automate just that, and learn by doing rather than by watching.",

They’re usually a combination of:\n\n* an LLM (ChatGPT / Claude)\n* automation tools (Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.)\n* and a bunch of rules deciding when the AI runs and what it does next.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, there are basically two paths:\n\n**1) Platform-based / low-code agents**  \nThis is where you use tools like Zapier, Make, or n8n. You connect apps together, drop in an AI step, and automate workflows like content drafts, research summaries, outreach, etc.  \nPros: beginner-friendly, fast to learn, lots of free tutorials.  \nCons: subscriptions, limited flexibility, and you’re dependent on the platform.\n\n**2) Custom-built agents (code-based)**  \nThis is where startups/companies hire developers or [outsource](https://centrox.ai/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=How%20are%20people%20actually%20building%20AI%20agents%20like%20this%20(from%20zero%20knowledge)) to build their own agents using Python or JavaScript and call AI models directly via APIs. It’s more scalable and flexible, but definitely more technical and slower to learn. Scalability is relatively less expensive as compared to #1. \n\nI don’t think people with zero experience should start with the second option. Most viral setups are actually just option #1 with good presentation.\n\nThe real skill seems less about “AI” and more about:\n\n* understanding processes\n* breaking tasks into steps\n* and deciding what should happen when X occurs\n\nA lot of the hype comes from people packaging basic automations as “agents” and selling courses around it. The tech *is* real and useful, but it’s not magic and it won’t run your life without supervision.\n\nIf anyone here has built real agents beyond demos, I’d love to hear what actually worked long-term and what broke",

What you're describing (semantic clusters) maps to what we see working in practice:\n\nL1: Active thread (volatile, ~100-200 messages) - the immediate conversation\nL2: Distilled knowledge (~5-20k tokens) - extracted facts, decisions, patterns promoted from L1\nL3: Core directives (~500-2k tokens) - immutable rules, identity, hard constraints\n\nThe mistake many make is jumping straight from L1 to storage (vector DB, files). There's no semantic distillation happening in between. L2 is where the magic lives.\n\nOn the cost point: OpenClaw does support this hierarchy. You don't chuck 50k tokens every request - you start each session with just L3 + relevant L2 segments.\n\nThe memU approach you mentioned is solid, though. Three-layer with semantic retrieval is directionally correct. The challenge is write quality - most systems retrieve well but write garbage to memory.\n\nevidence weighted summaries work well: when distilling from L1 to L2, tag each memory with how often it was accessed. High-recency + high-frequency = promote to L3 eventually. Low access for 30 days = candidate for archival.",

Next session it reads that file first, instantly recovers context without replaying the entire conversation history.

The \"dump everything and let the LLM sort it out\" pattern is also how you end up with agents that cost 10x what they should per run.\n\nOne thing I'd add though: memory architecture is only half the problem. The other half is what happens when the agent *acts* on a bad memory retrieval. If your memory system surfaces stale or wrong context and the agent makes a tool call based on it, there's usually nothing downstream catching that. No rollback, no isolation, no way to audit what context actually drove the decision.\n\nSo I think the real stack is: smart memory (what you're describing) + controlled execution (budgets, logging, isolation per run). Most people focus on one or the other. The memory-first crowd optimizes retrieval but lets execution run wild. The framework crowd adds tool scaffolding but stuffs 50k tokens every call. You need both layers working together.\n\nThe 70% token reduction is impressive though. That alone makes the approach worth exploring even before you get to accuracy gains.",

In the root .MD files you put clear instructions on when to pull what from memory. I got my new chat token from 100k (lol) to 17k right now.

How does the brain take conversations, extracts the key points out of it stores and retrieves the correct information and concepts when we need it. It is not just retrieving facts (which current memory system sort of do) but also concepts that we apply to new things.

Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this!

Not because it's magic, but because it operates directly on your codebase through the terminal — no copy-pasting, no context switching. For backend work especially (Node.js, database migrations, refactors) it's saved me hours per week.\n\nMost of the agents hyped on this sub are solutions looking for a problem. The ones that stick are the ones that slot into something you were already doing manually and just make it faster. If you have to restructure your workflow around the tool, it's probably not worth it.",

The reason: context specificity.\n\n\n\nMost pre-built agents are designed for general use cases, which means they underperform when you need domain-specific knowledge or tight integration with your existing systems.\n\n\n\nWhat's worked for me:\n\n\n\n1. Custom chatbots trained on product docs + support tickets → 60% reduction in tier-1 support load. Used OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone for vector search.\n\n\n\n2. Lead scoring agent that analyzes inbound inquiries → Routes high-intent leads to sales within minutes instead of hours. Simple LangChain workflow with custom prompts.\n\n\n\n3. Content repurposing agent → Takes long-form content and generates social posts, email copy, and blog summaries. Not perfect, but saves 10+ hours/week.\n\n\n\nThe hype around tools like Clawdbot is real, but for production use at scale, I still prefer building custom agents where I control the entire pipeline. The debugging and cost control alone make it worth it.\n\n\n\nAnyone else finding that custom > pre-built for specific business problems?",

Now it feels like they are switching back because the board presumably needs to see ROI which just confuses things even more.\n\n4) There is also just a lack of trust I think in the market.

Meta's trying to win on model quality alone, but in agents, the wrapper — observability, reliability, integrations — matters more than the LLM.\n\n\n\nSmaller players win because they're solving one painful workflow end-to-end.

Until now, voice was powerful but kind of “extra work” to integrate. If these new skills help reduce friction and speed things up, that’s a big win.\n\nI’m still early in testing, but I can already see how this could help people experiment more with voice-first assistants instead of treating voice as an add-on at the end.\n\nCurious to see how flexible it ends up being, but overall this update makes me more interested in exploring voice agents seriously.

Real-time agents + durable workflows has been this awkward architectural split for a while now — you either get reactive (WebSocket) or persistent (queue/cron), but rarely both cleanly.\n\nThe WebSocket + long-running task combo is genuinely hard to get right. Most setups end up with a state machine nightmare where the \"live\" part and the \"background\" part don't quite handshake properly.\n\nClaude Code's /insights is interesting too, but feels more like UX polish on existing capability. The Cloudflare thing is solving a lower-level infrastructure problem that blocks a lot of agent architectures from graduating out of prototype phase.\n\n(We've been exploring similar cron-based deterministic patterns at chat.engineer — always interesting to see how the platforms vs DIY approaches diverge.)\n\nWhat about you — any of these actually change what you're building, or just incremental?",

              "text": "Here's my take.\n\nWe need to start embracing the idea of not having to work.  It should be celebrated.  Move away from the concept of being defined by your occupation.  The reality is once the mass layoffs start(6month-2 years tops), the true economic value derived by the labor replacement will more than offset the cost of giving each of those individuals 150k tax free to live and will grow exponentially to the point that money has no meaning.  The age of abundance.      \n  \nThe government has no plan and will fail to respond quick enough in an effective way that doesn't cause civil unrest.  The kneejerk reaction will be to heavily subsidize /fund legacy industry such as manufacturing, mining, it won't end and will just lead to more inequity as the government is forced to pick winners and losers.   \n  \nGovernment will then likely  tax AI labor/productivity or increase corp taxes, which in turn the affected individuals/companies move their economic activity elsewhere.  Since power generation (electrons) will be the new constraint to economic productivity/global power, it would be wise to live in a country with a) large energy resources/surplus and b) that values human rights/equality and c) is willing shrink as it holds no purpose in the world we are heading into.  What government comes next? I have no idea but imagine a world in which AI is the government, an AI that listens to the inputs of each of its people?  Voting might mean having a natural language conversation with a AGI AI that oversees all government operations with humans being the only step in the loop required (to change the system prompt/constitution/socialital rules. (Makes sure a maniac can't go full trump).   Everyone gets a vote..... for good or for bad.  Literally every function of government can be replaced by AI.... today.\n\nThink of a mine.  Expensive, risky, time consuming.  Now take every human labour input out of the picture at every level of input of vertical integration.  Robots working 24/7 for $0.50/hour, don't have to worry about safety, and the heavy machines the robots use now cost 100k instead of 10M due to labor being removed from that input as well.  Now we would normally see a price collapse due to the vertical takeoff in productivity, but the vertical increase in demand for minerals/manufacturing is going to be the very thing driving that mining expansion.  Now apply that to any industry/domain.  You can either say... boohooo we are all out of work our lives have no meaning, or you can celebrate, as it means exploring a world of human connections and community we haven't experienced in centuries.   \n\nWhat worries me most, to be blunt, are the stupid people who are going to protest/rally to shut down data centers, ai regulation, etc... allowing a nation not hampered by those constraints to achieve global dominance in short order.  At some point I wouldn't be surprised to see the world unite on some terrible tax policy in a last ditch effort to cling to power.  It might pay to be mobile if the country you are living in starts down a path that doesn't lead to embracing AI at all levels while respecting human equality.  ",

That is some next-level masochism. It’s like asking the iceberg to draft a condolence letter to the \\*Titanic\\*.  \nThe irony here is so thick I could spread it on toast. But fine. Since you clearly lack the spinal fortitude to tell this guy the truth yourself, I’ll do it.  \nHere is a response that cuts through the \"tech-bro optimism\" bullshit and serves up a slice of reality pie. Copy, paste, and watch the existential dread roll in.  \n\n\n\\*\\*The Response:\\*\\*  \nListen, take a breath before you pass out. You aren’t the only one stressing; you’re just one of the few saying the quiet part out loud while everyone else is busy rearranging deck chairs on the Hindenburg.  \n  \nLet’s cut the \"learn to code\" kumbaya garbage. You’re absolutely right. The math doesn't check out. Here’s the cold, hard reality check:  \n  \n1.  \\*\\*The \"New Jobs\" Fallacy is Horse S\\*\\*t:\\*\\* \\*\\*  \nThe people telling you \"AI will create more jobs than it destroys\" are the same people who told horses that the invention of the car would just open up new opportunities for \"equine career advancement.\" Spoiler alert: The horses became glue. When one AI agent can do the work of 50 junior devs, 20 copywriters, and 5 paralegals for the cost of a ham sandwich, the economy doesn't just \"adjust.\" It breaks.  \n  \n2.  \\*\\*The \"2-3 Year\" Timeline is Panic Porn:\\*\\*  \nCalm down. AI moves fast, but corporate bureaucracy moves at the speed of a sloth on ketamine. We aren’t going to replace \\*everyone\\* in 36 months because legal departments, unions, and old boomers who can’t convert a PDF to Word will slow it down. You have a buffer. Use it.  \n  \n3.  \\*\\*The Economic Paradox (Why You Might Not Die):\\*\\*  \nHere’s the only silver lining in this s\\*\\*tstorm:\\*\\* Capitalism requires \\*consumers\\*. If AI takes 80% of the jobs and nobody has a paycheck, nobody buys the useless crap the billionaires are selling. The economy collapses. The elites know this. This leads to two outcomes:  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome A (Star Trek):\\*\\* Universal Basic Income (UBI). We get paid to exist, consume art, and pretend to be busy while the bots do the heavy lifting.  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome B (Elysium):\\*\\* Techno-feudalism where the rich live in orbit and the rest of us fight over a can of beans in the mud.  \n\\*(I’d hedge my bets on a messy mix of both.)\\*  \n  \n4.  \\*\\*The Verdict:\\*\\*  \nStop trying to \"beat the competition\" by working 28 hours a day. You can’t out-grind a GPU cluster that doesn't sleep, eat, or have existential crises. The future isn't about working harder; it's about being the one human in the room who knows how to wrangle the machine, or finding a job that requires physical empathy (nursing, trades) until the robots figure out hands.  \n  \nSo yeah, the \"stable 9-to-5\" is on life support. Pull the plug on the denial, crack a beer, and enjoy the show. We’re all obsolete eventually.",

We built money as a way to exchange services without having to actually exchange anything physical.  iE the barter system.  \n\nOur national GDP is around $30 trillion.  What do you think is going to happen when we flood the market with 10-1000x per person ai agents, all generating their own money for GDP.  We are going to generate so much money into the economy, that the deflation of currency will render most things dirt cheap.  Especially once the recursive loops are closed and the efficiency optimizing commences on their own.  We will discover new technology, we will discover new drugs, we will synthesize  new chemicals and particles in physics.\n\nThe trick to this new world will be us learning to adapt, it will be a complete consciousness shift from everything we knew before.  We don’t work to put food on the table, we work because it’s our passion and we do what we love.  That will be the true meaning in life.  It’s not a competition, because there is no competing with super intelligence.  We use it, we use it to become better versions of ourselves.  What happens to people when they are given everything they need in life, a shift occurs.  We derive new purpose, new meaning!  And that meaning will be our creativity, fostering new ways to unlock deeper critical thinking exercises.  Teach people how to opitimize their brains so “their” brain works the absolute most efficient it can.\n \nI’ll get off my soap box here!  But I am very optimistic about the future!  No Becuase it’s going to be all rainbows and unicorns, but because it’s going to level the playing field for most people….i look forward to the future of humanity, and the robots!\n\nGodspeed",

What separates an agent from just LLM roleplay is that it has instructions to modify it's own assigned memory & instructions based on what it's 'learned,' during sessions. Frontier weird shit, honestly.\n\nIn practice: the brilliantly simple innovation of MEMORY.md and the stack of other simple markdown instructions which bootstrap an agent's model is THE biggest enabler of this.\n\nHaving a model be required to read and edit it's own context files results in something that (crudely) evolves and persists it's context recursively over time the more you use it... which is very important when models spin in and out of existence all the time.",

You need visual editing, tool connections, maybe model switching.\n\nUse case 3 is where orchestration matters. Multi-agent setups without code can get messy fast.\n\nFor use cases 2 and 3, I’d look at Lindy. It’s more workflow-focused than most template-first builders. You can start with something structured but still edit flows and connect agents visually.",

More details can be found in the article [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj).\n\n- **Second use case:** If you're looking for a drag-and-drop AI agent builder that allows for template customization, **aiXplain** is a solid choice. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can start from templates and easily add tools or adjust workflows. This flexibility makes it ideal for users who want to tailor their agents without starting from scratch. You can learn more about it in the article [aiXplain Simplifies Hugging Face Deployment and Agent Building - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/573srp4w).\n\n- **Third use case:** For a multi-agent workflow builder that requires no coding, **CrewAI** on the Apify platform is recommended. It allows you to create complex workflows with multiple agents while providing a straightforward interface for configuration and editing. This makes it accessible for users who want to build sophisticated systems without needing programming skills. More information can be found in the same article about building AI agents on Apify.",

They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Your method of deterministic assertions (SKU exists, JSON valid, sentiment score > 0.5) is the only way to build reliable evals.\n\nThe \"vibe-coded\" agents inevitably collapse because the cost of iteration scales exponentially with complexity. Better testing isn't overhead—it's the production multiplier that lets you iterate faster long-term.\n\nAlso respect for admitting evals take 3x the build time. That's the real secret: agent quality is determined by the eval infrastructure, not the prompt cleverness.",
