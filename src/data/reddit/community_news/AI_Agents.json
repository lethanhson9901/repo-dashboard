      "text": "Hey peps,\n\nI was a 10 year backend and when gpt came out I switched to learning ML and Gen AI and for the last three years I\\`ve been working as a AI Engineer, and compared to traditional backend development this role is the worst. I wanna know are there more people out there with the same gig and hows the experience so far.\n\nMy main problem is that team leads, directors and VP\\`s usually don't have basic ml or ai knowledge, they watch a hyped up video or presentation and assume that everything can be done by the all-mighty LLM and it just work with putting in minimal effort in the code. Unfortunately technical interviews are the same.\n\nHere are some of my best takes in the last year\n\nMy VP wants me to make anomaly detection for network traffic on a network device and network interface, but he wants me to do it with an LLM. - I\\`ve explained that this is done via anomaly detection models, but no his stance is that it should just work by saying to llm \"Please detect network anomaly in the following data\" and then dump raw RRD graph data on the LLM.\n\nOn one of my latest interviews is subcontractor working on a startup project and  they  are doing text sentiment analysis via LLM and Langchain. After discussing that sentiment analysis is done via specialized models not LLM\\`s and certainly not using Langchain their feedback is that I don't know shit\n\nAlso recent technical interview I\\`ve been discussing questions like\n\nHow do you filter out PII Info from the prompts, my answer with a NER model then the interviews starts talking about LLM Guardrails as if thats something special and precise. I personally would not even dream on relying on guardrails or prompt instructions to filter out PII data.\n\nAnd this is a pinnacle of my interviews, a scenario made by the interviewer in which he says we have an agent thats 91% accuracy and whats the technique to make id 100% accurate. I first told him that this being ML and AI 91% is a very good result and that 100% accuracy is unachievable but I list him techniques and strategies that can be applied to improve accuracy. He said no there is a technique called \"human in the loop\" that will boost the accuracy to 100%\n\nand a Honorable mention is AWS Day.\n\nAWS holds their AI day at our company all the VP\\`s are there, pre sales people from AWS and two AI engineer. They present fairytales and all the VP\\`s are buying, it. I ask AWS AI engineers how much tool calls can you stack in a single prompt they respond 150 - which is total nonsense around 15 tool calls is ok everything more LLM performance degrades. They start presenting Amazon Q coding agent, they present a feature of an agent to start docker, one of the engineers instead going to terminal and typing docker-compose up goes to the agent and types \"Can you please start docker compose for me\", it does its job, all the VP\\`s go into state of trance as if they seen something unbelievable and then they start discussing how with this thing they can replace some of the devops people.\n\nAfter all this nonsense I\\`m thinking about switching back to regular backend dev roles, but the market is brutal for both traditional backend and frontend positions, maybe doing a post on reddit and getting replies from people that have same experiences could give me more strenght to hold down to this types of roles",

          "text": "You will eventually prevail - and they will eventually lose their jobs, especially those who think that 100% accuracy can be achieved with human in the loop. What load of crap.\n\nBrining reason in the discussion is super important right now. Thinking through first-principles is also super important. My only advice would be that you should exhaust the LLM route only because you can apply all the leverage in one place. For example, we've been able to create small LLMs (1.5B, 4B) that are exceptional at routing, orchestration and jailbreak detection especially for long-context windows. Some of the new workloads are just different and because of these nuances older techniques wouldn't be sufficient especially if the traffic patterns are agentic (which doesn't seem to be in your case). Our models are on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/katanemo), and some of our work is [open source ](https://github.com/katanemo/plano)if you'd want to take a deeper look",

When they respond I have a set of points and static rules and based on that rules I route the whole thing to proper business logic (prompt and tools). \n\nHaving a small model for routing like yours, to replace frontier LLM in my classification model could make things much more faster and cheaper.

So its a pretty penny, but that investment pays itself back if you have a few at-scale folks like HuggingFace pay you some share of their traffic volume to handle routing/orchestration.

Many leaders treat LLMs as a universal solution instead of one tool with clear limits, so anything that can’t be solved with a prompt sounds “old-school” to them.\n\nInterviews reflect the same problem. Saying “this isn’t the right approach” often gets read as a lack of knowledge, while overusing LLMs for things like anomaly detection, PII filtering, or sentiment analysis is treated as best practice. Guardrails and human-in-the-loop are good ideas, but they’re not magic fixes, and they don’t replace proper models, data pipelines, or evaluation.\n\nDemos and AI days make this worse. Simple automation wrapped in an agent UI looks impressive, and leadership jumps straight to conclusions about full autonomy or replacing roles without thinking about reliability, cost, or failure modes in real systems.\n\nSwitching back to the backend is understandable, but it’s not an easy escape either. The market is tough, and most roles now expect some AI exposure anyway. Probably the safest path is finding teams that use AI as a component, not the entire product story, where trade-offs and limits are still respected.",

Take an anomaly detection algorithm, slap chatgpt bot for it, say its \"RAG\" (Retrieves results of anomaly models stuff from db) - you got LLM based detection. Fight ignorance with ignorance.\n\n\"After discussing that sentiment analysis is done via specialized models not LLM\\`s and certainly not using Langchain their feedback is that I don't know shit\" - Sentiment analysis is a valid use case for LLMs, that being said, if they pay, give them what they want. Its their specs, hopefully you have inputs for requirements (Run away if you dont). \n\n\"How do you filter out PII Info from the prompts, my answer with a NER model then the interviews starts talking about LLM Guardrails as if thats something special and precise.\" - Ask them if they want LLM to check results of PI removal from the LLMs. If yes - as long as you have that in writing, they are getting what they are asking (Assuming of course not a reasonable client)\n\n\"He said no there is a technique called \"human in the loop\" that will boost the accuracy to 100%\" - I mean technically true - not about technique, but that even HITL won't boost your accuracy to 100%, due to our error-prone brains :D\n\n\"all the VP\\`s go into state of trance as if they seen something unbelievable and then they start discussing how with this thing they can replace some of the devops people.\" - See, thats the real problem - different metrics. VPs are the ones that handle money/promotions, so if they are impressed, who cares, right?\n\nThat's just how it is. This is a very complex field, and LLMs opened eyes to people to how powerful ML can be - even though most problems have already been solved long ago - they just dont have domain expertise/knowledge of that - but they do see shiny LLMs doing \"cool stuff\".",

Anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, PII filtering. These are all areas where specialized models or pipelines make way more sense, but people hear 'LLM' and assume it’s a magic hammer for every nail.\n\nMy approach has been to keep pushing back with clear explanations, show small proofs of concept that highlight the limits, and document trade-offs. Sometimes it lands, sometimes it doesn’t, but at least it sets a baseline of reality.\n\nIf you’re thinking about switching back to backend, I’d say don’t discount the value of your AI experience.

One of them was a personal assistant agent that I call MARVIN (yes, that Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). MARVIN runs on Claude Code as the harness.\n\nAt first I just wanted him to help me keep up with my emails, both personal and work. Then I added calendars. Then Jira. Then Confluence, Attio, Granola, and more. Before I realized it, I'd built 15+ integrations and MCP servers into a system that actually knows how I work.\n\nBut it was just a pet project. I didn't expect it to leave my laptop.\n\nA few weeks ago, I showed a colleague on our marketing team what MARVIN could do. She asked if she could use him too. I onboarded her, and 30  minutes later she messaged me: \"I just got something done in 30 minutes that normally would've taken me 4+ hours. He's my new bestie.\"\n\nShe started telling other colleagues. Yesterday I onboarded two more. Last night, another. One of them messaged me almost immediately: \"Holy shit. I forgot to paste a Confluence link I was referring to and MARVIN beat me to it.\" MARVIN had inferred from context what doc he needed, pulled it from Confluence, and updated his local files before he even asked.\n\nFour people in two weeks, all from word of mouth. That's when I realized this thing might actually be useful beyond my laptop.\n\n**Here's what I've learned about building agents:**\n\n**1. Real agents are** ***messy***\\*\\*. They have to be customizable.\\*\\*\n\nIt's not one size fits all. MARVIN knows my writing style, my goals, my family's schedule, my boss's name. He knows I hate sycophantic AI responses. He knows not to use em dashes in my writing. That context makes him useful. Without it, he'd just be another chatbot.\n\n**2. Personality matters more than I expected.**\n\nMARVIN is named after the Paranoid Android for a reason. He's sardonic. He sighs dramatically before checking my email. When something breaks, he says \"Well, that's exactly what I expected to happen.\" This sounds like a gimmick, but it actually makes the interaction feel less like using a tool and more like working with a (slightly pessimistic) colleague. I find myself actually wanting to work with him, which means I use him more, which means he gets better.\n\n**3. Persistent memory is hard. Context rot is real.**\n\nMARVIN uses a bookend approach to the day. `/marvin` starts the session by reading `state/current.md` to see what happened yesterday, including all tasks and context. `/end` closes the session by breaking everything into commits, generating an end-of-day report, and updating `current.md` for tomorrow. Throughout the day, `/update` checkpoints progress so context isn't lost when Claude compacts or I start another session.\n\n**4. Markdown is the new coding language for agents.**\n\nStructured formatting helps MARVIN stay organized. Skills live in markdown files. State lives in markdown. Session logs are markdown. Since there's no fancy UI, my marketing colleagues can open any .md file in Cursor and see exactly what's happening. Low overhead, high visibility.\n\n**5. You have to train your agent. You won't one-shot it.**\n\nIf I hired a human assistant, I'd give them 3 months before expecting them to be truly helpful. They'd need to learn processes, find information, understand context. Agents are the same. I didn't hand MARVIN my email and say \"go.\" I started with one email I needed to respond to. We drafted a response together. When it was good, I gave MARVIN feedback and had him update his skills. Then we did it again. After 30 minutes of iteration, I had confidence that MARVIN could respond in my voice to emails that needed attention.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nI've been training and using MARVIN for 3 weeks. I've done more in a week than I used to do in a month. In the last 3 weeks I've:\n\n* 3 CFPs submitted\n* 2 personal blogs published + 5 in draft\n* 2 work blogs published + 3 in draft\n* 6+ meetups created with full speaker lineups\n* 4 colleagues onboarded\n* 15+ integrations built or enhanced\n* 25 skills operational\n\nI went from \"I want to triage my email\" to \"I have a replicable AI chief of staff that non-technical marketers are setting up themselves\" in 3 weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'm stepping away from work earlier to spend time with my kids. I'm not checking slack or email during dinner. I turn them off. I know that MARVIN will help me stay on top of things tomorrow. I'm taking time for myself, which hasn't happened in a long time. I've always felt underwater with my job, but now I've got it in hand.",

It has cross-session context recall (recall history from earlier sessions), long-term memory (pattern memory learned from code), short-term memory with YaRN and automatic importance weighting, and you can even resume any session.  Since it's stateful, it doesn't really suffer the typical context rot problems that stateless agents have.",

What really stands out is that MARVIN isn’t “smart” because of the model… he’s useful because you treated him like a long-term system and a teammate, not a chatbot. The bookend workflow, explicit state, markdown-as-infrastructure, and gradual training loop are exactly the patterns people only discover after things break in production.\n\nA couple of things you surfaced that feel especially important (and under-talked-about):\n- Personalization beats general intelligence. Knowing your style, constraints, and annoyances is way more valuable than another benchmark point.\n- Personality isn’t fluff. It changes adoption. If people enjoy interacting with the agent, they’ll use it more, and usage is what actually makes agents better.\n- Memory is operational, not magical. The start/update/end pattern is a very pragmatic way to fight context rot without pretending vector search is “memory.”\n- Training agents looks like onboarding humans. That analogy is dead-on and something most people underestimate.\n\nAlso, the fact that non-technical colleagues are onboarding themselves is the strongest signal in the whole post. That’s usually where “cool demo” turns into “this might actually be a product.”\n\nIf you ever write a follow-up, I’d be really curious about:\n- What you refuse to let MARVIN do autonomously\n- Where he still fails in annoying ways\n- How much of this you think is transferable vs inherently personal\n\nThis feels like one of the clearest examples I’ve seen of what “agents that actually help” look like in practice, not theory.",

      "text": "I’ve built about a dozen custom AI agents for B2B clients this year. Real companies, real budgets, real workflows.\n\nDo you know how many of them are fully autonomous, loops that plan and execute everything themselves?\n\nZero. Not one.\n\nI see so many demos on Twitter of agents \"building a website from scratch\" or \"doing market research by browsing the web for 4 hours.\" It looks cool. It gets likes.\n\nBut if you try to sell that to a business, you are selling a ticking time bomb.\n\nIf you tell a client their agent can \"just figure it out,\" you are selling a lie. The minute that agent hallucinates a discount code, emails a competitor by accident, or deletes a database row because it \"thought\" it was a duplicate, you are liable.\n\nMy most successful (and highest paying) projects are basically just rigid state machines. They are boring.\n\n*   Step 1: Ingest email.\n*   Step 2 (AI): Extract data into JSON.\n*   Step 3 (Code): Validate JSON against hard-coded rules.\n*   Step 4 (Code): Insert into database.\n*   Step 5 (AI): Draft a reply.\n*   Step 6 (Human): Human clicks \"Approve.\"\n\nThat’s it. That’s the \"agent.\"\n\nThe LLM is only used for the fuzzy stuff parsing unstructured text or formatting output. The logic is code. Hard, deterministic code.\n\nI had a client beg me for an agent that could \"autonomously negotiate pricing with vendors.\" I told him no. I built him a tool that suggests email drafts for his procurement team instead.\n\nHe was annoyed at first. Then, during testing, the AI suggested offering a vendor a 200% price increase because it misunderstood the currency symbol.\n\nIf that had been autonomous, he would have lost thousands. Instead, the human saw it, laughed, fixed it, and sent the email.\n\nWe need to stop roleplaying that these things are digital employees. They are tools.\n\nThe money isn't in building \"magical\" agents that do everything. The money is in building boring, safe agents that do *one* thing 100% reliably.\n\nStop building science experiments. Start building guardrails.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. No junior devs, no outsourcing, just solid code that scales. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.",

Security: Even a short malicious prompt hidden in the input data can easily leak sensitive information.\n2. Success rate: For multi-step agents, errors stack up. This means as the number of steps increases, the overall success rate drops off a cliff. For example, a 95% success rate per step sounds decent, but after 10 steps, you’re down to about 60%.\n3. Hallucination: The rate of hallucination is still pretty high, especially with the current crop of reasoning models. Ironically, the more confident these models get, the more likely they are to hallucinate—which is a dealbreaker in business settings.\n4. Determinism: This is actually a core requirement for most enterprises, but agents just can’t guarantee that similar tasks will always be delivered in a similar timeframe, within a similar budget, and with the same results. That’s a massive problem.",

I see decks all the time promising \"autonomous employees\" that run your business while you sleep.\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nI build these things for a living. And there is a massive difference between an **Agent** and a **Workflow**.\n\nMost of you are building Workflows.\n*   **Step 1:** Get email.\n*   **Step 2:** Summarize with GPT-4.\n*   **Step 3:** Save to Notion.\n*   **Step 4:** Slack me.\n\nThat is not an agent. That is a linear script. It’s a recipe. If Step 2 fails, the whole thing dies. It’s rigid. It’s predictable. It’s safe.\n\nA real **Agent** is messy.\nAn agent doesn't have a list of steps. It has a **Goal** and a **Toolkit**.\n*   **Goal:** \"Find me a lead in the healthcare space.\"\n*   **Toolkit:** Google Search, LinkedIn scraper, Email verifier.\n\nThe agent decides *on its own* what to do first. Maybe it searches Google. If that fails, it tries LinkedIn. If the email bounces, it tries a different verification tool. It loops. It thinks. It hallucinates (sometimes).\n\nThe smartest agent I ever built wasn't the one with the best prompt; it was the one that knew when to stop and ask a human for help because it realized it was stuck.\n\nIf you want to build real agents, stop focusing on the \"AI\" part and start focusing on the \"guardrails\" part. Because unlike a workflow, an agent can and will go off the rails if you let it.\n\nThat’s the difference between a toy and a tool. And trust me, you want to be building tools.",

Here’s a quick overview of how AINIRO’s AI chatbot technology works.\n\nWhen you create a chatbot with us, we **scrape and crawl your website** to gather all your public content — pages, articles, FAQs, etc. That data is then transformed into a **VSS and RAG-based knowledge base**, which becomes the chatbot’s “context.”\n\nWhen a user asks a question, the chatbot uses **semantic AI search** to find the most relevant snippets from your data. These snippets are sent to **OpenAI’s GPT model** (like GPT‑4), which uses them to generate an accurate, context‑aware answer.\n\nIf the chatbot needs to perform a task — for example, search the web, scrape a site, or fetch a database record — it can trigger **AI functions** (Hyperlambda workflows). These functions are executed automatically, and the results are fed back into the conversation.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1. User asks a question.\n2. Chatbot finds relevant data from your knowledge base.\n3. If needed, it executes a function (like a web search or database query).\n4. GPT generates a natural, human‑like answer using your data.\n\nThis combination of **your data + AI reasoning + automation** is what makes our chatbots so powerful — they can answer questions, integrate with your systems, and even take actions automatically.\"\n\nIs this accurate? If so it doesn't sound like you spent exactly 12 years creating this. I don't remember GPT 4 being around 10+ years ago.\n\nAlso there's this thing called botpress. I think they do what you do better. They beat you to market lmao. \n\nI'm kind of sad I hated on your comment. i agreed with you in the first half until I realized this project is alot like most other start ups.",

Long story made short, I threw *\"everything\"* in at AI chatbot, and put Magic Cloud *\"on hold\"* for a while. Of course, building said chatbots **\\*inside\\*** of Magic Cloud, synergistically continuing progression of the platform.\n\nThis created a very comfortable *\"economic breathing room\"* for me, due to the stuff you find on the *\"/buy\"* link of the above website. But in 2025, I have (almost to the point of dangerously) spent all my resources and going *\"all in\"* on doing what I set out to do already arguably back in 2006 with *\"Gaia Ajax\"*, which is to simplify the art of creating software down to absurdity.\n\nNow in a weird way, some *\"Swedish company\"* beat me to the finish line, but that doesn't mean the party's over. They're a closed system, my shit is 100% open sauce (MIT license). In fact, the only *\"moat\"* I've been holding back on, is the training files for the Hyperlambda Generator (my LLM, 40,000+ training files, super high quality), and probably on pair with Gemini and Claude!\n\nHowever, for now, due to low bandwidth, I'm giving away free usage here too - Implying, at the moment, it's the only platform on earth you can use for free, as long as you're paying for your own OpenAI tokens (GPT5.2), and once I start charging for access to the Hyperlambda LLM, you can still fork my shit from GitHub, install it on your server, and have everything you built so far fully functioning ...\n\nQuality? On frontend it's probably miles behind Lovable and Bolt42. Backend it's easily way ahead, on everything you've literally seen. Don't believe me? Check out the *\"natural language API\"* thing ...!! ;)\n\nAnd the reasons I can do that, and give away *\"free tokens\"*, even though I'm literally a single person, with probably no more *\"means\"* than most of those reading this, is simply because my Hyperlambda Generator consumes 0.00000000001% of the resources that the crappy garbage code most people use LLMs for ...\n\nHint; Check out *\"Hyperlambda\"* ... ;)\n\nInterpret the last sentence from above as you wish ...",

          "text": "This is a solid roundup. What stands out to me isn’t any single update, but the pattern across all of them. Almost everything here points to agents becoming less of a novelty and more of an actual platform layer. Skills, subagents, browser modes, team access, health, spreadsheets, CLIs. It’s all moving from demos to daily workflows. The Vercel skills growth and Cursor’s parallel subagents feel especially telling. That’s less about smarter models and more about execution and scale, which is where things usually get real. Same with Notion quietly turning into an agent hub. It’s not flashy, but it’s exactly where agents make sense long term.\n\nAlso interesting how many of these updates lower the barrier. Pro tiers, open source templates, local models. Feels like the ecosystem is widening instead of just chasing enterprise budgets.\n\nOverall, this week makes it feel like agentic stuff is settling into its “boring but useful” phase, which is usually when things actually stick.",

      "text": "I built an AI agent that negotiates with my internet provider so I don't have to.\n\nI was paying $89/month for internet and every year I'd have to call and threaten to cancel to get them to lower it back down. Every. Single. Year. Spending 45 minutes on hold, getting transferred three times, doing the whole \"I'm sorry you feel that way sir\" dance.\n\nSo I built an agent that does it for me.\n\nIt's not complicated. It uses Claude API + a phone integration tool. Every 11 months it calls my ISP, goes through their phone tree, asks about \"promotional rates for loyal customers,\" and if they don't offer anything good, it says I'm considering switching and asks to speak to retention. Then it just... negotiates. Politely. Persistently.\n\nFirst time I ran it I genuinely didn't think it would work. I was sitting there listening to the call like a parent watching their kid's first soccer game. And it WORKED. Got my bill down to $54/month. Saved me $420/year and exactly zero minutes of my own time arguing with a script-reading rep.\n\nThe agent logs the whole conversation, emails me a summary, and updates a reminder for next year. That's it. I've since added my car insurance and phone bill to the loop.\n\nHonestly, I think we're all still sleeping on how much of this tedious life admin stuff can just... go away. Not talking about AGI or whatever. Just small agents that handle the boring conflicts we've all accepted as normal.\n\nAnyway, if you're still manually calling to cancel subscriptions or dispute charges, you're doing it wrong. Build the bot. Let it suffer through hold music instead of you.",

That statement was clearly about human readers, but what we are seeing now is that the same principles also benefit machine readers.\n\nClean Code was never just about aesthetics. It is about intent, structure, and reducing cognitive load. If code is understandable for humans, LLMs benefit almost automatically, because they rely on the same signals such as naming, cohesion, separation of concerns, and local reasoning.\n\nWhat has changed is the value of inline context. Not heavy Javadoc-style documentation everywhere, but short explanations of why something is done the way it is. Whether that is a method comment, a block comment, or a small inline note does not really matter.\n\nThe key point is simple. Code should be written to be read. First by humans, and now increasingly by AI as well. If your codebase is readable, structured, and explicit about intent, AI tooling does not feel bolted on. It just works better.\n\nSo I agree with the observation in this thread. The success is not accidental. It is the natural result of long established software engineering principles paying off in a new context.",

From my own experience studying how teams adopt tools in high-governance environments, this model seems like an excellent way to ensure knowledge isn't just stored, but actively accessible and useful across different roles.\n\nIn a lot of regulated environments, where workflows often cross over complex approval chains and require extensive documentation, this kind of living documentation system can help cut through a lot of friction. As teams handle handoffs between departments or roles, ensuring your codebase and your documentation are maintained with equal care is crucial for preventing miscommunication.\n\nAlso, I can see this having a huge impact on onboarding time, a self-service model powered by AI means new hires can get up to speed faster while also allowing existing team members to easily maintain and update knowledge.\n\nI’m curious if you’ve noticed any friction in how your team interacts with this system when it comes to more complex, cross-functional workflows.

          "text": "- It sounds like you've stumbled upon a really effective approach to documentation and onboarding. Treating documentation like code, where it lives alongside the codebase and is updated in the same pull requests, can significantly enhance clarity and accessibility.\n- This method not only benefits new hires but also ensures that the documentation remains relevant and accurate, as it is actively maintained and reviewed.\n- The integration of AI tools like Claude Code for onboarding is an interesting development. It highlights how AI can leverage well-structured documentation to facilitate learning and understanding of complex systems.\n- Many teams are recognizing the value of comprehensive documentation as a high-leverage activity, especially in small teams where resources are limited. It can serve as a single source of truth that aids in knowledge transfer and reduces the onboarding time for new team members.\n- If you're looking for more insights on how to structure your repositories for AI-assisted onboarding, consider exploring resources on best practices for documentation in software development. \n\nFor further reading on related topics, you might find this article useful: [The Power of Fine-Tuning on Your Data: Quick Fixing Bugs with LLMs via Never Ending Learning (NEL)](https://tinyurl.com/59pxrxxb).",

We have 5 people in our engineering team and according to metrics, our throughput has doubled over the last year without adding more members! Even if we said one free extra engineer, that's easily $100k in savings just by salary saved!\n\nSimilarly, we also moved from using a SEO agency to moving it in house since AI tools like Frizerly properly trained on our product data and case studies connected to Google search console was able to easily create the same quality strategy and content automatically for us! We have even connected it directly to Webflow that is auto publishes content around prioritized keywords every day! Currently its setup as drafts so that we quickly review it and click publish but you can directly publish them as well! We prefer reading it once though and making quick edits! That's like $5k savings per month!",

It ran quietly, failed rarely, and replaced a bunch of manual checking that no one enjoyed anyway.\n\nA big part of that was making the execution layer boring and predictable. Early versions lost hours because scraping and site interactions were flaky, so humans had to babysit runs. Once we moved to a more stable web interaction setup, including trying things like hyperbrowser for sites with JS and logins, the ROI became real.

JS heavy sites that load half the content late. Random layout changes. Logins expiring. Cloudflare or basic bot checks suddenly blocking requests that worked yesterday. Even when it works, it feels fragile. One small site update and the whole pipeline falls over.\n\nI have tried the usual stack. Requests + BeautifulSoup is fine until it isn’t. Playwright and Puppeteer work but feel heavy and sometimes unpredictable at scale. Headless browsers behave differently from real users. And once you add agents on top, debugging becomes painful because failures are not always reproducible.\n\nLately I have been experimenting with more “agent friendly” approaches where the browser layer is treated as infrastructure instead of glue code. I have seen tools like hyperbrowser mentioned in this context, basically giving agents a more stable way to interact with real websites instead of brittle scraping scripts. Still early for me, so not claiming it solves everything.\n\nI am genuinely curious what people here are using in production. Are you sticking with traditional scraping and just accepting breakage? Using full browser automation everywhere? Paying for third party APIs? Or building some custom hybrid setup?\n\nWould love to hear what has actually held up over time, not just what works in demos.",

For anything mission critical, we ended up mixing approaches. Static or semi static stuff stayed simple, and anything JS heavy or behind auth went through a full browser layer that we treated like infrastructure, with retries, health checks, and clear failure signals. That helped more than the specific library choice.\n\nPlaywright has been the least painful for us long term, but only once we accepted the overhead and built guardrails around it. Where it really falls down is when people expect agents to just handle breakage automatically. In practice, you still need someone owning selectors, login flows, and change detection. Paying for APIs made sense in a few narrow cases, mostly because the cost of babysitting scrapers was worse.

That is to use the internet search tools/agent via API.\n\nIt can get quite expensive if you need to do a lot of searches, but depending what you benefit from it, it might be worth it.\n\nScraping works better if you need to get contents of a lot of websites and it not mattering too much if some websites cant be scraped or if what you scraped is exactly up to date. But LLM agent searchig is better if you need precise information of some exact stuff that needs to be up to date and it not being blocked as much.\n\nFor example the tool i made with gemini, which gathers a lot of data and thus needs to make multiple searches to gather data from one company costs like 2€ per 100 companies searched. Also this is quite slow with 100 company informations taking like 1.5 hours to do (but wouod be possible to run multiple at the same time, but they might search duplicate information as one agent does not know what the other is doing at the same time). Which is definitely tons more than what scraping and searching from scraped stuff would cost, but easily justifiable cost for many use cases. But searching stuff you dont actually need with those prices would be bit stupid waste of money.",

That’s usually what kills pipelines, not the HTML changing.\n\nIn production we treat CAPTCHA handling as infrastructure, same as proxies or retries. Browser automation still does the heavy lifting, but when Cloudflare / Turnstile / reCAPTCHA kicks in, a solver keeps the flow moving instead of stalling or looping. Services like CapMonster Cloud are commonly used here, especially because most challenges are invisible and don’t fail loudly.\n\nIt doesn’t make scraping “unbreakable”, but it dramatically extends how long things stay stable. Once that layer is missing, everything feels fragile no matter which browser or agent you use.\n\nCurious what kind of volume you’re running.

When they do scrape, they treat it like an integration with monitoring, contract tests on key pages, alerting on extraction deltas, and a fast rollback path, not a script you set and forget. For JS sites, Playwright tends to be the least bad option, but the real win is designing your extractor around stable anchors, like IDs, data attributes, and page semantics, plus accepting you will need ongoing maintenance. The best setups I’ve seen are hybrid, API where possible, browser automation for a small subset, and a clear policy that “blocked by anti bot” is a product constraint, not a debugging challenge.",

I'm one of the founders.\n\nThe core insight was that runtime AI agents making decisions on every action are inherently unpredictable and token-expensive. So we flipped it: AI plans the workflow upfront and generates deterministic browser tasks, only falling back to AI when something actually breaks.\n\nFor the specific pain points you mentioned:\n\n- \\*\\*Bot detection\\*\\*: We forked Chromium to be recognized as human by default (verified by major bot protection providers). No more random blocks.\n- \\*\\*Auth/MFA\\*\\*: We handle SSO, token refresh, and MFA flows natively - sessions persist without constantly re-authenticating.\n- \\*\\*JS-heavy sites\\*\\*: Full browser, not requests+parsing. But since tasks are deterministic, it's 12x faster than typical browser agents.\n\nThe tradeoff is it's infrastructure, not a scraping library - you're spinning up cloud browsers. But if you're already dealing with Playwright at scale plus proxies plus captcha solving plus session management, the complexity is probably comparable.\n\nHappy to answer questions.

I just finished a deep dive into how **Small Language Models (SLMs)** are actually powering the next generation of **Autonomous Agents**.\n\nHere are a few things I found fascinating:\n\n* **Zero Latency:** Running AI locally on your NPU means no more waiting for cloud responses.\n* **Privacy:** Since the data stays on your phone, it’s finally safe to use AI for sensitive work.\n* **Specialization:** These tiny \"Specialists\" are now outperforming massive \"Generalist\" models in specific tasks like coding and medical diagnostics.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of how this tech is changing the game for autonomous agents this year and what we can expect next. If you're interested in the technical side or just want to know how to keep your AI data private, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.\n\n**I’ll leave the link to the full breakdown in the comments if anyone wants to dive deeper!** 🚀\n\nWhat do you think?

Once workflows get messy, tool calls branch, or time passes, everything degrades into repeated questions and lost context. We ended up realizing that trying to make LLM memory behave like human memory is the wrong frame.\n\nWhat helped a bit was accepting that memory needs structure and ownership outside the model. We stopped asking the agent to remember everything and instead gave it explicit state objects, rules for updating them, and clear boundaries for what gets overwritten vs appended. Also, a lot of what looked like “memory bugs” were actually execution bugs. When tool interactions are flaky, the agent’s logs lie to it. Stabilizing the environment, even something as boring as using a more deterministic browser layer like hyperbrowser for web actions, reduced false memories a lot.

          "text": "It sounds like you're grappling with some common frustrations in the realm of AI memory and state management. Here are a few points that might resonate with your experience:\n\n- **Memory Systems**: Many users find that existing memory systems for LLMs often feel inadequate. They can seem like temporary fixes rather than robust solutions. The challenge lies in maintaining continuity and context across interactions, which is crucial for effective AI applications.\n\n- **Embeddings and RAG**: While embeddings can enhance search capabilities, they often fall short in capturing complex relationships between entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can struggle with maintaining state, leading to repetitive queries and a lack of coherence in conversations.\n\n- **Scalability Issues**: Systems like Redis or JSON logs may work well in small-scale demos but can falter under real-world demands. The need for structured data management across tool calls is a significant hurdle, as many solutions do not effectively retain context or state.\n\n- **User Experiences**: It seems you're not alone in feeling that many solutions are more duct-taped together than seamlessly integrated. The inconsistency in performance and the tendency for agents to forget previous interactions can be frustrating.\n\n- **Exploring Alternatives**: If you're looking for more reliable methods, consider experimenting with different architectures or frameworks that prioritize state management and memory retention. Some users have found success with hybrid approaches that combine various techniques to better handle context and continuity.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about these challenges and potential solutions, you might find insights in discussions around memory management in LLM applications, such as those found in [Memory and State in LLM Applications](https://tinyurl.com/bdc8h9td).",

On paper, it sounds like AI 101. In practice, I was stuck in a nightmare.\n\nEvery time I ran my script, the model would start hallucinating keys that didn't exist or, worse, it would \"helpfully\" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything: I upped the temperature, I lowered the temperature, I wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be \"helpful.\"\n\nBy hour four, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with \"DO NOT DO THIS\" and \"NEVER DO THAT\" that I think I actually confused the poor thing into submission. It was outputting pure garbage.\n\nI walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.\n\nI went back, deleted the entire \"Rules\" section of my prompt, and tried something I saw on a random forum. I told the model:\n\n\"Imagine you are a strict compiler. If the input doesn't map perfectly to the schema, return a null value and explain why in a separate log object. Do not apologize. Do not explain the weather. Just be a machine.\"\n\nI also added a \"Step 0\": I had it generate a schema of the CSV before it processed it.\n\nI hit 'Run.' I held my breath.\n\nIt worked. Perfectly. 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations.\n\nIt’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, \"more instructions\" usually just equals \"more noise.\" Sometimes you have to strip away the \"human\" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.\n\nHas anyone else found that \"Negative Prompting\" (telling it what NOT to do) actually makes things worse for you?

Here are some insights that might resonate with your situation:\n\n- **Simplicity in Prompts**: Overloading prompts with \"do not\" instructions can lead to confusion for the model. Instead, focusing on clear, concise instructions often yields better results.\n  \n- **Defining Roles**: Assigning a specific persona to the model, like a \"strict compiler,\" can help it understand the expected behavior better. This approach can minimize ambiguity and guide the model towards the desired output.\n\n- **Iterative Testing**: It’s beneficial to test prompts iteratively. Sometimes, starting with a basic prompt and gradually adding complexity can help identify what works best without overwhelming the model.\n\n- **Understanding Context**: Knowing the purpose of your prompt and the expected outcome can significantly improve the interaction with the model. This aligns with the idea that understanding context is crucial in crafting effective prompts.\n\nYour experience highlights a common challenge in AI interactions, where less can indeed be more effective. If you're interested in exploring more about prompt engineering, you might find useful insights in resources like the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).",

In real production systems, most agent steps are boring, repetitive and rule-bound, yet people still pay frontier-model prices for them, which kills margins as usage grows. The insight from these papers is that intelligence comes from routing work correctly, not throwing a giant model at everything and that’s why orchestrating specialized SLMs and only escalating to heavyweight reasoning when uncertainty is high leads to systems that are both cheaper and more reliable. This approach turns AI from a flashy demo into something you can actually run in production without panic over costs and if anyone here wants to explore how to apply this setup to their own agents, I’m happy to guide.",

      "text": "Hi Reddit — I'm the creator of FastMCP and wanted to share a new project we've open-sourced called Colin.  \n  \nI obviously love MCP, but I also use skills extremely heavily in my day-to-day work. Being exposed to both has made me very aware of a tension:   \n  \n\\- Anything with dynamic information, I ship over MCP. This takes work to set up and requires conversational boilerplate to refresh in every conversation.   \n  \n\\- Anything behavioral, I put in skills. They're lightweight, used automatically, and feel great. But I would never put dynamic information in a skill because keeping it up to date is a pain. And yet the idea of having an agent skill that includes relevant and timely data is so appealing!  \n  \nSo: think of Colin as a skills-native templating engine. The goal is to compile context documents from dynamic sources (GitHub, Linear, Notion, MCP servers, etc.) in a way that makes them easy to automatically update. Colin traces dependencies to determine staleness and has intelligent caching to minimize the burden of recompiling. It's general purpose, but it turns out to be extremely useful for writing skills that contain dynamic knowledge and need to stay current.  \n  \nWe've just released it. It's experimental and early, but it's a direction I'm actively exploring and would love feedback.",

Thank you for releasing this (and whilst I'm here, also for FastMCP!) — I'm on board with the idea of skills for static behaviour and MCP for dynamic information so I'm looking forward to taking Colin for a spin.\n\nI'm currently building out an [MCP server for Apache Kafka](https://github.com/lensesio/lenses-mcp) and since it relies on familiarity with Kafka and its workflows, I'd been thinking a lot about how to organise skills to get quick behavioural wins for agents without having to build out a full blown knowledge base (I'm trying to respect the time it takes teams traversing the AI engineering maturity curve). It felt somewhat natural to put skills behind MCP resources so I like where you are going with the [Skills Provider](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/providers/skills) in the recent FastMCP 3 release.\n\nWhat do you think about [Cloudflare's recent approach](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc) for agent skills discovery via `.well-known` URIs and using RFC/standards?",

          "text": "Validating voice-collected data before triggering workflows is crucial to ensure accuracy and reliability. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n- **Data Verification**: Implement a verification step where the voice input is cross-checked against known data or patterns. This could involve confirming key details with the user before proceeding.\n\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: Set confidence thresholds for the voice recognition system. If the confidence level of the recognized intent or data falls below a certain percentage, hold off on triggering the workflow until further validation is done.\n\n- **Contextual Checks**: Use contextual information to assess the validity of the data. For example, if a lead's information is inconsistent with previous interactions, it may warrant a review.\n\n- **Human Oversight**: For critical actions, consider a human review process for the first few interactions or until a certain volume is reached. This can help identify common issues and refine the voice recognition system.\n\n- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism where users can report inaccuracies. This can help improve the system over time and build trust in the data collected.\n\n- **Pilot Testing**: Start with a pilot phase where you monitor the outcomes of automated actions triggered by voice data. Analyze the results to determine if adjustments are needed before scaling up.\n\nThese approaches can help mitigate risks associated with relying on voice-collected data while maintaining efficiency in your workflows.

For prototyping and early stage setups, it works well.\n\nBut once traffic increases, some issues start showing up, and I wanted to sanity check if others are seeing the same things or have better setups.\n\nOne issue we hit is logging becoming a bottleneck. There is a GitHub issue where users mention that once the database crosses 1M plus logs, API requests start slowing down because logging is on the request path. At around 100k requests per day, you hit that number very fast. The suggested workaround is pushing logs to DynamoDB or blob storage and disabling DB logging, but then you lose the UI dashboards for monitoring. That tradeoff feels rough in production.\n\nAnother pattern we saw is performance degrading over time. Requests start fast, then after a few hours latency creeps up. Restarting the service fixes it, but only temporarily. This seems to match what others reported, even after trying different worker configs.\n\nThere is also a strange case where cache hits still take 10 plus seconds end to end, even though logs show the cache lookup itself is fast. So something else is blocking the response path.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a hit piece. LiteLLM maintainers are responsive and docs acknowledge some of these limits. But at higher scale, Python plus DB on the hot path seems tricky.\n\nWe have started testing alternatives and tried building our own gateway. Early results look more stable, but still evaluating.

          "text": "This still reads like an architecture issue rather than something unique to LiteLLM, and the fact that it reproduces consistently at scale is actually useful. The pattern you describe suggests that more and more work is accumulating on the synchronous path over time: logging that becomes progressively more expensive as state grows, cache hits that are technically fast but wrapped in coordination or shared-state overhead, and tail latency that degrades until a restart flushes whatever pressure has built up. That usually means there’s a central owner somewhere (DB shard, writer, lock, or background worker) that all hot traffic eventually funnels through.\n\nIt would be interesting to understand a bit more about where that coupling lives. For example: are logs and request metadata written synchronously on every call, and to what store? Does the cache sit behind a single process or require coordination across workers? Are writes blocking reads in any way, or do they propagate asynchronously? And is there any notion of shard ownership for keys that could explain why hot keys get slower over time?\n\nIn general, systems that avoid this class of failure separate durability from reads entirely: logs and telemetry are pushed fully off the hot path, durable state goes to a cheap append-friendly store, reads are served from local or regional caches without a single shard owning a key, and writes propagate in the background. That’s the same architectural direction taken by things like BoulderKV, which are designed around bursty, read-heavy agent traffic and try to prevent exactly this kind of slow tail creep.",

After figuring out im not really the best one in that field, I started looking for people to sell them the whole formula - agents, scripts, 1v1 consultations included - everything they need to start their own thing. \n\nI ended up chatting with this guy from India, a little above my age, who was portraying himself as a total newbie in AI but \"good in internet and maybe marketing too\" (his exact words hahah). I sold him the whole thing in a real good price. \n\nFast forward month later he sends me screenshot of his first payments and I was like... mindblown because I couldn't achieve anything even close to this result after a month. It's been  2 months and he already got his investment back. \n\nsoo I guess what I observed is making tons of money on this AI gold rush is not only for IT technicians and \"nerds\" as people like to say, but for people good marketing.
