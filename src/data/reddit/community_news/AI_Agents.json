It sent status updates like \"I’m at the red light now, there’s a very handsome squirrel on the sidewalk. Do you think he’s married?\" and \"I forgot my purse, going back home. Wait, this isn't my house.\"\n\n  \nThe Agent actually sent a screenshot of a \"Select all traffic lights\" Captcha to the scammer, claiming its \"eyes were blurry\" and it couldn't see the buttons to wire the money. The scammer actually circled the traffic lights for the AI.\n\n  \nOne scammer eventually typed: \"Please, just stop talking. I don't want the money anymore. God bless you but leave me alone.\"\n\n  \nAI Agents aren't just for coding or scheduling meetings. They are world-class time-wasters. Total cost in API fees: $1.42. Total time wasted for scammers: Approximately 14 man-hours.",

She'd see 4-5 missed calls at the end of a showing and have no idea which were serious buyers.\n\nI'd been experimenting with AI voice tools and offered to set one up for her as a test. Took me about a weekend to figure out.\n\nHere's what happened after 30 days:\n\nThe AI answers in under 2 seconds, asks qualifying questions, and books directly into her Google Calendar. She said one of those 6 appointments turned into a closed deal.\n\nThe part that blew me away callers genuinely don't realize it's AI. She had one person mention at the viewing \"your receptionist Sarah was so helpful on the phone\"\n\nTook a bit of trial and error to get the agent working right, but it's pretty straightforward once its all setup.",

He said you would never know you were talking with a robot. I remember naively thinking, “if he’s having such great success with it, why does he even have human staff”.  Now as someone paying for ai and seeing the prices on things I could see how having an autonomous voice agent running full time would cost a pretty penny. He did say they were working towards a second one though.",

The fact that the callers thought “Sarah” was a real person just goes to show how far conversational AI has come when it’s built around intent rather than tricks.\n\nWe’ve been noticing the same trends at BeGig Studio — the greatest gains are to be had in the high-friction points of business processes: lead management, scheduling, follow-up, and qualification. Small gains, massive leverage.\n\nIf anything, this just goes to show that “vibe coding” + real-world context can often trump big, complicated systems. This is a great experiment — this is something that could easily be developed into a real-world product or service offering.",

      "text": "About 8 months ago my team started seriously exploring AI agent development for internal operations. I want to share an honest account because mosts post about AI agents are either breathlessly optimistic or written by people who have never deployed one in a real business environment.\n\n**What  problem we were actually trying to solve:**\n\nOur ops team was spending roughly 60% of their time on tasks that followed predictable decision trees - if X happens, check Y, notify Z, escalate if condition W. Smart people doing  robotic work. Classic AI agent territory.\n\n**How we approached development:**\n\nWe partnered with an AI agent development company rather than building entirely in-house. Our internal team had solid engineers but no deep experience with LLM orchestration, tool use, or agent reliability patterns. That knowledge gap would have costs us a year of trial and error.\n\nThe process looked roughly like this:\n\n* 2 weeks of workflow mapping and decision tree documentation\n* 3 weeks of agent architecture design and tool integration planning\n* 6 weeks of development and internal testing\n* 4 weeks of supervised deployment where humans reviewed every agent decision\n* Gradual autonomy increase as confidence in output grew\n\n**What the agent actually does now:**\n\n* Monitors shipment exceptions 24/7 and autonomously resolves roughly 70% without human involvement\n* Drafts and sends vendor communications based on predefined escalation rules\n* Flags anomalies in invoices and routes them with context to the right team member\n* Generates daily exception summary reports with recommended actions\n\n**What genuinely worked:**\n\nThe ROI on after-hours coverage alone was significant. Exceptions that used to sit unresolved overnight are now handled within minutes regardless of time zone. Our ops team has shifted from reactive firefighting to exception review and process improvement - a meaningful upgrade in how they spend their time.\n\n**What was harder than expected:**\n\n* Defining \"done\" for agent tasks is surprisingly difficult - edge cases are endless\n* Hallucination risk in vendor communications required careful prompt engineering and output validation layers\n* Getting the team to trust the agent took longer than the technical build- change management was underestimated\n* Monitoring and observability tooling needed more investment than we anticipated\n\n**What I'd tell anyone considering AI agent development services:**\n\n* Start with a workflow that is high volume, rule heavy, and has clear success criteria - don't start with ambiguous creative or strategic tasks\n* Human-in-the-loop during early deployment is not optional- it's how you catch failure modes before they cause real damage\n* Invest in logging and monitoring from day one - you need visibility into every decision the agent makes\n* Choose a development partner with experience in agent reliability, not just LLM prompting - these are genuinely different skill sets\n* Plan for going maintenance- agent performance drifts as the real world changes around it\n\n**6 months later:**\n\nThe agent handles roughly 2,400 tasks per month that previously required human attention. Our ops headcount hasn't grown despite a 30% increase in shipment volume. Three team members who were doing repetitive exception handling have moved into process optimization and vendor relationship roles.\n\nIt's not magic and it wasn't cheap or fast to get right. But it's become core infrastructure for us now.\n\nHappy to answer questions - especially from anyone in logistics or operations considering something similar.",

I think it is amazing but at the same time is like a new paradigm. I struggle sometimes to translate use cases in the \"old world\" to this new approach. Maybe not everything can be translated and that is the reason why a lot of companies are throwing money because they have the obsession in move to AI at any cost. What concerns me a lot is the idea of LLM hallucination. I guess that context design, prompt engineering and type of LLM would help that to mitigate that. I am interested to understand how I can evaluate and monitor the agentic system to make sure that is accurate, performative and scalable. And of course how we can deploy it in a production environment. Currently I started with a side project facing the problem of \"natural language to SQL\" and as I said before, I want to learn to evaluate it and how i can deploy it. \n\nExcellent post.

      "text": "Everyone starts somewhere. If you are new to building with AI and you're drowning in \"TOP 10 AI AGENT FRAMEWORKS\" posts that all contradict each other (it is a mess). That is what I actually use day to day, and believe is not only the most simple for people just starting out, but also the most scalable, generalisable, and production ready.  \n  \nI build AI tools and open-source projects for a living, and I've mass-deleted enough failed experiments to know what works and what doesnt!  \n  \nSo here is what I would recommend in 2026 (but give this a month and who knows...):  \n  \n**1. Hear me out... OpenClaw if you just want a working agent right now**\n\nIf you don't want to build from scratch and just want something running today, OpenClaw is the go-to. 60k+ GitHub stars, self-hosted, connects to Telegram/WhatsApp, has memory, scheduling, and a whole tool marketplace. Plug in your API key, connect some services, done, you have an agent that actually does things.\n\nThe tool ecosystem is the real draw. You can wire up search, email, databases, payments, whatever. For search specifically, Brave killed their free API tier in February which screwed over a LOT of people who'd built on it. I switched to Valyu, free credits on signup, really high quality results, just works as a drop-in replacement and there is an open claw skill for it. (also has deep research which I use for heavy research tasks)\n\n**Now the honest bit: if you don't know what a CLI is, don't self-host OpenClaw yet.** I'm serious. Microsoft Security literally published a blog post about how to run it safely. There have been exposed instances with RCE vulns, sketchy skills on the marketplace, people reporting their agents going into loops and burning through hundreds of dollars of API credits overnight. It's really not bad software, but the problem with an open-source project this viral is that a lot of people don't read the setup instructions properly and end up, to be honest, doing dumb things.\n\n  \n**2. Vercel AI SDK + Next.js if you want to build your own thing**\n\nIf you want to build something custom rather than configure something off the shelf, this is the move. The Vercel AI SDK handles 99% of the annoying boilerplate. Their `useChat` hook gives you a working streaming chat interface in maybe 15 lines of code.  \n  \nThe bit that actually matters though: it's provider-agnostic. Write your code once, swap between Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, whatever, without rewriting your app. That's huge when pricing changes every other week.  \n  \nPair it with Next.js and you've got streaming, server actions, API routes, auth, frontend in one codebase, deploy to Vercel in like 30 seconds.   \n  \nI didn't mean for this to be a Vercel shill post but their ecosystem really is the easiest to get things up and running, especially if you're starting out. And it is also, from my experience, the easiest to scale into serious production applications.  \n\n\n**3. OpenAI / Claude for your models**\n\nBoth providers are good. GPT-5-mini for example is super cheap and good enough for most stuff. Claude Opus is incredible at longer context and more careful reasoning.  \n  \n**Bit of a hack:** Thing most people don't know: OpenAI has a data sharing program where you opt in to let them use your API traffic for training, and in return you get free tokens daily. Like up to 1M tokens/day on the main models. Go to Settings → Organization → Data Controls → Sharing. Obviously don't turn it on if you're handling anything sensitive. But for side projects and experiments? Free tokens are free tokens lol. They've extended the program a few times so check if it's still live.  \n\n\n**4. MCPs or Skills for tool use**\n\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol), Anthropic introduced these, OpenAI and Google have adopted them now. Basically they're connectors that let your agent talk to external services without you writing custom API wrappers for everything. Closest thing to a standard we've got. But more recently, skills (markdown files explaining how to use a service...) became more popular. In most cases, doesn't matter if you use MCP or a skill, but:\n\nOnes I'd actually start with:\n\n* **Supabase** \\- agent reads/writes your database directly. Kinda wild to see it work\n* **Valyu** \\- allow your agent to search the web, as well as stuff like live financial data\n* **Stripe** \\- payments from within the agent\n* **PostHog** \\- analytics queries straight from the agent\n* **Context7** \\- this one's slept on. Pulls real-time version-specific docs from actual source repos into your prompt. No more Claude confidently writing code against an API that got deprecated 6 months ago\n* **Gmail** \\- read and send email\n\nThe registry at modelcontextprotocol dot io has hundreds now. Six months ago there were like twelve. And vercel has a skills repository as skills (.) md  \n\n\n**5. Cursor or Claude Code to actually write the code**\n\nYou don't have to write everything by hand. Cursor is an AI code editor, Claude Code does similar stuff from the terminal. Tell either one \"use the Vercel AI SDK to build me an agent that does X with these MCPs\" and you'll have something running in an hour. Not joking. Your ability to articulate what you want to see in the world is the only bottleneck now.\n\n**The mental model**\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n* OpenClaw if you want preconfigured and running today\n* Vercel AI SDK + Next.js if you want to build custom\n* OpenAI or Claude for the brains\n* Valyu for search\n* MCPs for integrations\n* Cursor/Claude Code to build it all\n\nAgents aren't magic. They're code that calls an LLM and uses tools. That's it. Overcomplicating it in your head is the thing that actually slows you down. Start messy, ship something, fix it later.\n\nThanks for reading and please ask me anything in the comments or challenge me on anything- happy to go deeper on any of this!",

When your agent has access and the safety model is hopefully configured, you're one misconfigured skill away from the RCE vulns you mentioned.\n\n\n\nthe MCP section is good but worth flagging: a recent audit found unrestricted command execution in 40%+ of MCP servers. Connecting your agent to supabase/stripe/gmail via MCP without any execution isolation means a prompt injection in one tool can theoretically chain into the others. Not a reason to avoid MCPs, just a reason to run them in something more isolated than a bare docker container.\n\nBeen researching microVM-based sandboxing for exactly this hardware-isolated execution, so even if the agent goes rogue, the blast radius is physically contained.

      "text": "I’ve been curious whether current AI models have any natural aptitude for trading on realtime, raw financial data, without any elaborate news pipelines or convoluted system prompts. I mean literally just raw livestreamed market numbers and a calculator. \n\nSo I built a crypto daytrading arena. All agents consume a realtime stream of ticker data and candlesticks for **BTC**, **SOL**, and **FARTCOIN**. They have access to a calculator and can view their portfolio and holdings. As data flows in, the agent autonomously decides to enter or exit, whenever they want, no guardrails.\n\nI started with four agents, each with $100k to start: gpt 5 nano (low reasoning), minimax m2.5, grok 4.1 fast (no reasoning), and gemini 2.5 flash.\n\nAfter a little more than 24 hrs of continuous trading, here’s roughly where they stand:\n\n* gpt 5 nano: **+$11,500**\n* minimax m2.5: +$4000\n* gemini 2.5 flash: +$1900\n* grok 4.1 fast: -$100\n\nI'm honestly impressed with how gpt5-nano has performed so far, considering it's a relatively cheap model. When I started this I definitely wasn't even expecting it to be in the positives by now. It might just be really good at processing raw financial numbers(idk)? I’m keeping these agents running so we’ll see if these gains stay consistent. Eventually I also want to throw in more expensive models (gpt 5.2, sonnet 4.6) and see how they compete too. \n\nAlso, this is fully open source: will provide github repo in comments.\n\n**tldr:** gpt-5-nano, good with money??",

The agents are built with calfkit's sdk so they have ability to consume event streams out-the-box. \n\nI venture to guess that part of the success so far might be because there isn't news data to introduce any subjectivity or bias to the agents. They trade solely on numerical data, and numbers don't lie. All that to say, I'm not sure if the agents will see more success if news feeds are added to it's context, especially for smaller models like gpt 5 nano. But this is all guess work lol, I'll still consider experimenting with some news feeds to see how they perform.",

But then we needed the widget system so the agent could render interactive components mid-conversation instead of just describing things in text. that was a whole separate project. Then multi-surface deployment because users wanted it in slack and teams too, and what worked on web kept breaking in those environments. Auth was way more complex than expected because we needed SSO, RBAC, multi-tenant isolation so customer A's data never shows up in customer B's conversations. and memory... don't even get me started on building GDPR-compliant persistent memory with right-to-deletion and data portability.\n\nAll of this before we even touched the actual AI orchestration layer.\n\nThe painful realization was that we'd spent 5 months building infrastructure and had barely started on the AI capabilities that actually make our product valuable. Every sprint on chat plumbing was a sprint not spent on domain intelligence.\n\nHas anyone else been through this? At what point did you decide to build vs buy the frontend layer? starting to wonder if this is like building your own payment processing when stripe exists.",

I’ve been working on A2A-SE (settlement extension) that handles the escrow and token economics when agents call each other basically Stripe for the agent-to-agent layer. Your conversational agent needs GDPR-compliant memory? Call a memory agent that already built it, pay per request, move on. Everything else that ate your timeline is infrastructure that shouldn’t be custom.\n\nhttps://github.com/a2a-settlement",

          "text": "Dude, this is basically the “conversational AI frontend” war story for anyone who’s tried in production. The real trap isn’t the chat UI — that’s literally a weekend project with React and some WebSocket glue. It’s the surrounding “plumbing” that’ll eat your lunch: *widgets*, *multi-surface deployment*, *auth*, and the *GDPR-compliant memory* circus.\n\n**Recent benchmarks for “build vs buy” on frontend layers** (see: Modular’s LangChain Extension, arXiv:2405.11721) show even teams with deep pockets hit the same sinkholes. Everyone underestimates cross-platform quirks and state management: Slack/Teams have their own event models, you’re debugging permissions and context menus, not your cool agent logic. And if you need SSO + RBAC + tenant isolation? You’re basically building SaaS scaffolding from scratch.\n\n**Hidden pitfall** most people miss: GDPR and “right to deletion” with persistent AI memory is *worse* than classic SaaS. With conversational logs, context windows, and embedded widgets, you’re stuck mapping users to every snippet of data, everywhere, and ensuring you can nuke it on-demand — and threading that through Slack or embedded webviews is a nightmare.\n\nThe contrarian answer: *Build vs buy is underrated here.* If all you really want is a chat interface + streaming + basic widgets, there’s off-the-shelf stuff (OpenAI Chat Playground UI, LangChain’s Frontend, Jasper’s SDK) that solves 90% of it and lets you focus on the AI layer. If you need deep custom stuff with strict memory and RBAC, consider modularizing — build your own “widget system” *only* if you have a killer feature nobody else does. Otherwise, you’re burning sprints just to reach parity.\n\n**Pro-tip:** Before sinking more months, map your next 3 must-have features against what’s *already solved* in open-source or commercial stacks. Your competitor is probably shipping domain intelligence while you’re patching SSO on Slack.\n\nTL;DR: You’re not alone, everyone trips on infra, and if your differentiator is the AI, skip the frontend heroic build unless absolutely necessary.",

          "text": "It sounds like you've encountered some common challenges that many teams face when developing a conversational AI frontend. Here are a few points to consider based on similar experiences:\n\n- **Complexity Underestimated**: It's not uncommon for teams to underestimate the complexity of building a conversational interface, especially when it comes to integrating various components like interactive widgets, multi-surface deployment, and robust authentication systems.\n\n- **Infrastructure Over AI**: Many teams find themselves spending significant time on infrastructure and foundational elements before they can even start on the AI capabilities that add real value. This can lead to frustration, as you've experienced.\n\n- **Build vs. Buy Decision**: The decision to build or buy can be tough. Many organizations opt for existing solutions for frontend layers to save time and resources, especially when there are established platforms that can handle the complexities you're facing. This is similar to the payment processing analogy you mentioned.\n\n- **Learning from Others**: Engaging with other teams who have faced similar challenges can provide valuable insights. Many have found that leveraging existing frameworks or platforms can accelerate development and allow them to focus on their unique value propositions.\n\nIf you're looking for more structured approaches or methodologies, exploring resources on agile development and best practices in AI integration might be helpful.

      "text": "On November 25th 2025, quietly, without much fanfare in the founder press, the European Commission launched something that I think is going to change how AI enforcement actually happens in practice.\n\nThey called it the AI Act Whistleblower Tool.\n\nHere’s what it does. It provides a secure and confidential channel for individuals to report suspected breaches of the AI Act directly to the EU AI Office. It supports anonymous submissions in any EU official language, uses certified encryption, and allows whistleblowers to receive updates and answer follow-up questions while remaining completely anonymous. \n\nWho can use it? The tool is open to anyone who is professionally connected to an AI model provider meaning employees, contractors, freelancers, partners, or anyone in a professional relationship with your company. \n\nLet me be direct about what this means.\n\nYour developer who thinks your data practices are sketchy they can report you.\n\nYour contractor in Germany who noticed you’re not labelling AI outputs they can report you.\n\nThe freelancer you used last year who saw your system prompt they can report you.\n\nEven external stakeholders can submit concerns anonymously through the secure platform. \n\nThe threshold for filing a report is not proof. Whistleblowers are protected if they had reasonable cause to believe the information was true at the time of reporting and constituted a violation. The ‘spirit of the law’ is also covered, meaning attempts to circumvent the letter of the law are also reportable violations. \n\n“Reasonable cause to believe.” Not certainty. Belief.\n\nI’m not writing this to make you paranoid about your team. Most people don’t go looking to report their employer. But consider the scenario where a disgruntled contractor, a frustrated employee, or a competitor who knows how to use a search engine files a report on your company. The investigation that follows is real regardless of whether the report is accurate. And the burden of responding to it falls entirely on you.\n\nThe 42-state attorney general coalition in the US signals coordinated enforcement pressure that will intensify throughout 2026.  Add a European whistleblower infrastructure that makes reporting frictionless and anonymous, and you have an enforcement ecosystem that doesn’t need regulators to go looking for violators. Violators get reported to them.\n\nThe best defence against a whistleblower report is the same as the best defence against every other form of enforcement: actually knowing what your AI is doing and having documentation to show it.\n\nYour code is where the truth lives. If someone reports you, the first thing regulators will ask for is your technical documentation. If it doesn’t exist, the report gains credibility by default.\n\nI use an automated audit tool to keep a current picture of what our codebase is actually doing from a compliance standpoint. It’s what I’d point to first if a report ever landed.the tool is in my Reddit links on my profile ",

          "text": "This EU whistleblower tool is honestly a game changer for AI compliance, and most founders haven't really clocked what it means yet. You're not just dealing with regulator audits anymore—every pissed-off ex-contractor, bored employee, or competitive troll can drop a report that kicks off a real investigation. The threshold isn't proof, it's \"reasonable cause.\" That means, if your internal docs suck or you can't instantly show how your systems handle data, state, or outputs, the regulator is starting from the assumption you might be sketchy.\n\nThe actual bottleneck for most teams is not just code hygiene—it's having real, up-to-date technical documentation and audit logs on your agents. Recent audit tool research shows most AI compliance tools are broken: people patch together auto-generated docs, but when regulators show up, those tools don't actually cover the full compliance scope. So if you're relying on a random plugin or some half-baked export from Notion, you're on thin ice.\n\nDon't just document your workflow—log all tool calls and outputs, version everything, and set up explicit state-checks that are easy for an outsider to follow. Bonus points if you can show adversarial testing results. What gets most startups in trouble is the gap between what the AI is actually doing and what the docs claim to do. If you can't explain that, you'll get smoked in an investigation, whether the whistleblower is legit or just fishing.\n\nEven if you're \"technically\" compliant, the EU tool lets people flag violations of the spirit of the law. That's an open door for reports about misleading labeling, lazy prompt engineering, creative hacks to skirt transparency, whatever. The risk is less about getting caught in one big breach and more about endless low-level friction that can drag your team into defensive mode for months.\n\nBottom line: treat this like a permanent compliance siege. Don't wait for an incident to scramble your audit process. Start logging everything, have documentation that's readable by a non-technical reviewer, and assume that someone in your org will eventually file a report just to cover their own ass or settle a grudge. It's not paranoia, it's just the new default.",

It's a drop-in LLM proxy - routes requests to OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, etc. Handles failover, caching, budget controls.\n\nBuilt it in Go specifically for self-hosted environments where you're paying for every resource.\n\n**The speed difference:**\n\nBenchmarked at 5,000 requests per second sustained:\n\n* Bifrost (Go): \\~11 microseconds overhead per request\n* LiteLLM (Python): \\~8 milliseconds overhead per request\n\nThat's roughly 700x difference.\n\n**The memory difference:**\n\nThis one surprised us. At same throughput:\n\n* Bifrost: \\~50MB RAM baseline, stays flat under load\n* LiteLLM: \\~300-400MB baseline, spikes to 800MB+ under heavy traffic\n\nRunning LiteLLM at 2k+ RPS you need horizontal scaling and serious instance sizes. Bifrost handles 5k RPS on a $20/month VPS without sweating.\n\nFor self-hosting, this is real money saved every month.\n\n**The stability difference:**\n\nBifrost performance stays constant under load. Same latency at 100 RPS or 5,000 RPS. LiteLLM gets unpredictable when traffic spikes - latency variance increases, memory spikes, GC pauses hit at the worst times.\n\nFor production self-hosted setups, predictable performance matters more than peak performance.\n\n**Deploy:**\n\nSingle binary. No Python virtualenvs. No dependency hell. No Docker required. Copy to server, run it. That's it.\n\n**Migration:**\n\nAPI is OpenAI-compatible. Change base URL, keep existing code. Most migrations take under an hour.\n\nAny and all feedback is valuable and appreciated :)",

      "text": "I kept losing files in nested folder hierarchies. So instead of building another document management system, I built a CLI tool that lets my AI agent handle file organization.\n\n**The idea**: You don't organize files. Your agent does. You just toss files at it and ask for them later in plain English.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n\\- You send a file (via chat, email, whatever) → agent categorizes it, names it, tags it, writes a rich description\n\n\\- Agent asks before reading file contents — if you don't respond, it defaults to \"sensitive\" (no content extraction)\n\n\\- Everything goes into a JSONL index that the agent reads directly — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm\n\n\\- SHA-256 dedup so the same file doesn't get stored twice\n\n\\- \\`claw-drive reindex\\` lets the agent go back and re-enrich old entries with better descriptions/tags as it gets smarter\n\n\\- Custom metadata fields (expiry dates, policy numbers, etc.) turn the file store into a queryable knowledge base\n\n**Design philosophy:**\n\nUsers never touch the CLI — reads and writes all go through the agent. Under the hood, the agent calls the CLI for writes (store, delete, dedup) where atomicity matters, and reads the JSONL index directly for search/retrieval — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm I could build.\n\n**Example**:\n\n\\> \"Find my cat's vet records from February\"\n\n\\> → agent reads INDEX.jsonl, matches on description + tags, returns the file\n\n\\> \"When does my car insurance expire?\"\n\n\\> → agent reads metadata field \\`expiry: 2026-08\\` directly from the index, no need to open the PDF\n\n\\*\\*Stack:\\*\\* Bash CLI + JSONL index. No database, no Docker, no web UI. Works as an OpenClaw skill or standalone.\n\nIt's open source (MIT) — link in comments.\n\nCurious what other people are building for agent-managed personal data. Also interested in feedback on the JSONL-as-index approach vs something like SQLite.",

The skill instructions tell the agent to always ask before reading contents, and default to \"sensitive\" if no reply. The identity/ category is always marked sensitive. We're also working on a more robust privacy framework for when the agent does have file read access, think permission scoping and audit trails.\n2. No embedding or vector DB. The agent reads INDEX.jsonl as plain text and uses its own understanding to match. For personal-scale file management (not company-level), this is the simplest approach with zero extra dependencies. No database, no embedding model to set up. That said, we're looking into extending support for larger personal directories where a more structured search layer would make sense.\n3. Telegram is just the most convenient interface for non-sensitive files. For sensitive stuff, you can also pass files through Google Drive, Gmail, or just drop them locally. The local drive is always the source of truth, chat is just delivery.",

The JSONL-as-index decision is honestly more aligned with how a lot of devs are handling personal or agent memory lately—even Hacker News threads from late 2024 have people ditching big databases for single JSON columns or plain text files. It's all about simplicity and transparent debugging.\n\nPerformance-wise: JSONL rocks for prototyping and quick access, especially with atomic writes via CLI. You get \"just works\" durability and can grep your data in a pinch—no maintenance overhead, no migrations. SQLite or SQL-backends only start to win when you need fast queries across millions of entries, indexed lookups, or strong schema enforcement. One pitfall: SQLite does support indexing on JSON (with generated columns), but it's nowhere near magical out of the box. If your dataset stays small-medium, JSONL is likely faster for queries on tags/descriptions and easier to backup, audit, and reindex.\n\nPro-tip: To squeeze extra speed, pipe your JSONL through jq for instant filtering/search; it's way faster than bolting on a SQL DB for most home-scale setups.\n\nHidden edge: If you ever want to scale this to a team or integrate with more agent frameworks, standardized schemas and atomic CLI operations are a bigger win than switching to SQL. The agent community is pushing for agent-standard filesystems (see AgentFS and recent agentic state debates), so sticking to a simple, queryable index is future-proofed.\n\nIn short, unless you're running a fleet of agents or hitting 100k+ files, JSONL is underrated. Index fragility only bites if you need complex relational queries or ACID compliance across many writers. For home use and solo agents, you've got the right stack.",

Ask the questions you’ve posted here to GitHub Copilot in the Qwen Code repo. \n\nAlso the response mentioning OpenCode is good and along the same lines. You can also link both repos into NotebookLM and have it generate mind maps and infographics to aid understanding.

          "text": "# Building Real AI Agents: Beyond the Wrapper\n\nThe blunt truth: Finding a legitimate \"AI Agents from Scratch\" course—one that isn't just a glorified LLM API wrapper—is like hunting unicorns. Most \"tutorials\" are junk, glossing over agent loops, persistent memory, and tool orchestration in favor of prompt engineering and copy-paste API calls. Real agent frameworks are messy and risky; the pros building them are usually too busy in production to create Udemy content.\n\n### The Strategy: Skip Course Search, Use Structured Repos\nFor real resources, dive into these high-signal repositories:\n\n* **[pguso/ai-agents-from-scratch](https://github.com/pguso/ai-agents-from-scratch):** Walks through building a full local agent framework. Covers explicit memory, tool routing, ReAct patterns, and graph-based workflows. This reveals how LangChain and LangGraph actually function internally.\n* **[avinash201199/free-ai-agents-resources](https://github.com/avinash201199/free-ai-agents-resources):** A massive curated list of practical courses and hands-on YouTube playlists (Microsoft, CampusX, Cole Medin). Look for the \"Building AI Agents from Scratch\" 2-hour course covering tool calling and multi-agent basics.\n* **[NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents](https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents):** Over 45 Jupyter notebooks implementing agents without \"framework magic.\" Ideal for seeing the code behind agent loops, state management, and tool execution.\n\n### Why Beginner Agents Fail\nMost demo agents fall apart in production because of **state and memory**. Relying solely on context windows is a recipe for failure. Successful production agents require:\n1.  **Hard Boundaries:** Explicit state and permission levels.\n2.  **Version Control:** Keep configurations tracked.\n3.  **Kill-Switches:** Never let an agent mutate a repo without reliable session logging and a manual override.\n\n### Pro-Tip: Build Your Own Harness\nForget OpenAI or Claude streams initially. Build your own agent harness using local models (Llama, Mistral). This forces you to manually handle:\n* Memory & Tool Schemas\n* Function Calling & Error Recovery\n* Reasoning Loops\n\n**The Formula:** `Agent = LLM + System Prompt + Tool Calling + Persistent State + Reasoning Loop.`\n\n### Advanced Architecture Research\nIf you are ready for deep dives into reliability and design patterns:\n* [Architectures for Building Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01982.pdf): Breakdown of goal managers, planners, and telemetry.\n* [From LLM Reasoning to Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19678.pdf): A survey of real-world agent failures and reliability analysis.\n\n### Bottom Line\nTreat courses as fast food; open-source walkthroughs and codebases are the main meal. True learning happens when you break your own wiring, implement idempotency checks, and manage memory hygiene. If you aren't breaking and fixing your own systems, you're just running someone else's demo.",

This makes it challenging for educational resources to stay up-to-date.\n\n- **Diverse Skill Sets Required**: Building an AI agent requires knowledge in various areas, including machine learning, software engineering, and systems design. Most resources tend to focus on specific aspects rather than the holistic view needed for building an agent.\n\n- **Existing Frameworks and Tools**: Many developers opt to use existing frameworks (like LangChain, AutoGen, or smolagents) that simplify the process of building agents, which may reduce the demand for scratch-building tutorials.\n\n- **Community and Open Source**: There are numerous GitHub repositories and community-driven projects that provide examples and frameworks for building AI agents. Engaging with these communities can often yield practical insights and resources.\n\nFor more structured guidance, you might want to explore specific frameworks or libraries that facilitate building AI agents, as they often come with documentation and examples that can help you understand the underlying principles.

          "text": "I built myself a \"co-founder\" agent on the Claude Agent SDK that I use every single day. Not a demo, not a side project - it's how I actually run my business.\n\nWhat it does daily:\n\n- Scans Reddit, HN, and other platforms for people asking questions I can help with (prospecting). Finds the posts, reads them, drafts response outlines for me to review. What used to be 2 hours of scrolling is now 30 minutes of reviewing and posting.\n- Web research. I point it at a topic and it comes back with a synthesis instead of 15 browser tabs. Saves probably an hour a day.\n- Writing first drafts. Proposals, emails, blog posts. I give it a couple sentences of direction, it writes a draft, I edit in my voice. The edit pass is always necessary but the blank-page problem is gone.\n- Persistent memory across sessions. It remembers decisions, context, strategy from previous conversations. I don't re-explain things.\n\nWhat still needs me:\n\n- Every draft gets edited. The agent is good at structure and content but it doesn't sound like me without edits.\n- All judgment calls. Deciding which prospects to engage, what to say, how to position things. The agent gives me options and recommendations but I make the call.\n- Anything involving relationships. The agent helps me prepare for meetings but it's not talking to people.\n\nStack: Claude Agent SDK, TypeScript, MCP tools for web search, file access, shell commands, persistent memory files. No framework (LangChain etc) - just the SDK, good system prompts, and well-defined tools. The whole thing is surprisingly small.\n\nHappy to share the architecture if anyone's interested - considering open sourcing it.",

Some, for instance, manage routine duties like data scraping, competition tracking, or simple content scheduling. With Vimerse Studio, video creation can be partially automated, transforming scripts or assets into polished clips in a short amount of time. However, manual labor is still needed for other jobs, such as strategic choices or subtle editing. The secret is to use agents for time-consuming, repeated processes rather than all at once.\n\n",

This reduces the time spent on writing tests manually.\n  - **Documentation Creation**: Another agent generates README files for GitHub repositories, summarizing the project and its functionalities.\n\n- **What Still Needs Manual Work:**\n  - **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for the agents to ensure they understand the context and requirements can still require human input.\n  - **Reviewing Outputs**: While the agents generate tests and documentation, a manual review is often necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n- **Example of How It Works:**\n  - A developer inputs a directory containing Python files into the system.\n  - The agent reads the code files and generates corresponding unit tests, which include mocking dependencies to avoid external calls.\n  - The output is saved in a designated folder, ready for use in the testing process.\n\nFor more details on automating unit tests and documentation with AI agents, you can check out the article [Automate Unit Tests and Documentation with AI Agents - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/mryfy48c).",

There are also many agent platforms (SaaS and open-source), plus Claude Cowork (now with scheduled tasks too!), etc. \n\nAnyway, what do you think?\n\nDoes n8n still make sense for some AI-heavy automations?

But I think you're right about the direction things are heading. The compounding factor isn't that agent platforms are better at automation — it's that the people who *most need* automation are the ones who could never figure out n8n in the first place, and English-based setups that let you connect your apps and just describe what you want are finally making that group accessible. I've been testing a bunch of platforms and the ones gaining traction with non-technical users — things like Gyld where you literally just write what you want the agent to do — are winning not on features but on the fact that someone can actually finish the setup and deploy something. The \"dozens of claws\" confusion you're feeling is real but it'll consolidate fast — most of them are the same concept with different branding, and the ones that survive will be the ones that handle auth, errors, and edge cases behind the scenes so the user never has to think about it. The future isn't better workflow builders, it's getting rid of the concept of a workflow entirely.",

And given I run this locally in a Docker container, this can be my cheapest of my \\[predictable\\] agents...I can still put some Claude magic in there, but it's in a box.  \n\\- For work, I'm starting to experiment with more \"enterprise-grade\" agents that require even more guardrails and predictability on them, but I'm still early on that journey.

Caveat: I have never used n8n and never will, I'm just talking about an orchestration layer, which n8n is an implementation of.\n\nGiving agents open ended problems is good for some things. However, if you have a set of steps you want to complete in the same order then letting agents roam free is not the answer. You want orchestration and guardrails (a harness) so the outcome is deterministic.\n\nLet's say you have a workflow where you want an agent to extract text from a document and update a database with the outcome via an API: that needs a workflow/orchestration. If something fails, like the model creating an invalid data structure, it can continue iterating and attempt to self heal. Let's say the agent fails 5 times – at that point continuing the workflow is probably a bad idea and a human should investigate. That's the opposite of brittle.\n\nGo read how Enterprise Organizations are tackling agentic coding. They're not using n8n but they are using _some_ form of orchestration. This same solution can be applied to agentic application workflows.\n\nExamples:\n1. https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering\n2. https://stripe.dev/blog/minions-stripes-one-shot-end-to-end-coding-agents",

Not on the API calls — on the instruction manual.\n\nBefore your agent can do anything useful, MCP dumps the entire tool catalog into the conversation as JSON Schema. Every tool, every parameter, every option. With a typical setup (6 MCP servers, 14 tools each = 84 tools), that's ~15,500 tokens before a single tool is called.\n\n**CLI does the same job with ~300 tokens. That's 94% cheaper.**\n\nThe trick is lazy loading. Instead of pre-loading every schema, CLI gives the agent a lightweight list of tool names. The agent discovers details only when needed via `--help`.\n\nHere's how the numbers break down:\n\n- Session start: MCP ~15,540 tokens vs CLI ~300 (98% savings)\n- 1 tool call: MCP ~15,570 vs CLI ~910 (94% savings)\n- 100 tool calls: MCP ~18,540 vs CLI ~1,504 (92% savings)\n\nAnthropic's Tool Search takes a similar lazy-loading approach but still pulls full JSON Schema per tool. CLI stays cheaper and works with any model.\n\nI struggled finding CLIs for many tools, so I built CLIHub - one command to create CLIs from MCPs.\n\n(Blog link + GitHub in comments per sub rules)",

This allows companies to streamline operations and enhance productivity without significant layoffs.\n- In production environments, many organizations are leveraging AI agents to handle tasks like follow-up sequences, calendar coordination, CRM updates, internal reporting, and basic ticket resolution.\n- This automation can lead to a reduction in the number of personnel needed for these tasks, allowing for a more efficient workforce where fewer employees can oversee multiple agents.\n- Regarding the percentage of workflows that are autonomous versus those that require human review, it varies by organization and specific use case. However, many companies report that a significant portion of workflows can be handled autonomously by AI agents, with human oversight primarily focused on more complex or nuanced tasks.\n\nFor further insights, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt)\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)",

Conversations jumped from 15 to 131 because nothing fell through the cracks.\n- Another resolved a potential $120k copyright claim by having the agent generate replacement images for 46 infringing website photos in under 4 hours.\n- Token costs drop 60-80% when you use specialized sub-agents instead of one \"God agent\" trying to do everything.\n- Setup time: \\~2 weeks from kickoff to production for the core workflow automation.\n\n\\*\\*The architecture pattern that works:\\*\\*\n\nInstead of one massive agent, build 4-6 specialized sub-agents (content, lead qualification, client intake, operations). Each has a narrow context window focused on one job. Prevents \"context rot\" — the problem where stuffing too many instructions into one agent makes it ignore critical details.\n\n\\*\\*Where it breaks:\\*\\*\n- The first 3-4 weeks are heavy iteration. The agent hallucinates, misses context, or misfires. You're training it on your specific business language.\n- If your processes aren't documented at all, the agent can't automate them. You need at least basic SOPs first.\n- Non-technical owners struggle with the \"AI employee\" mindset shift. They want a button, not a teammate that needs feedback.\n\nTo answer your question directly: after 30 days of iteration, we're typically at 70-80% autonomous for the task categories in the \"high supervision\" bucket, and 90%+ for the near-zero supervision categories. The key is treating the first month as a training period, not expecting set-it-and-forget-it from day one.\n\n\\*\\*Disclosure:\\*\\* I build and manage AI agent systems for businesses.

      "text": "Gallup has been tracking employee engagement globally for almost 20 years and the numbers have never not been depressing. Their 2025 State of the Global Workplace report found that only 21% of employees worldwide are actually engaged at work. 62% are “not engaged,” meaning they show up and do the bare minimum. And 15% are “actively disengaged,” which Gallup defines as people who are unhappy and actively undermining their company out of resentment.\n\nRead that again. Almost 8 out of 10 people spend the majority of their waking hours doing something they feel zero connection to. Gallup estimates this costs the global economy $438 billion in lost productivity. But honestly the productivity cost isn’t what gets me. It’s the human cost.\n\nThink about what that actually looks like from the inside. You wake up and your first thought is about a meeting you don’t want to attend about a project you don’t care about for a product you have no personal investment in. You spend your morning performing enthusiasm. You sit through status updates that could have been emails. You optimize someone else’s KPIs. You eat lunch at your desk. \n\nYou do this five days a week for decades. And the thing you actually care about, the skill you’re genuinely good at, the problem you’d love to spend your time solving, that gets pushed to evenings and weekends if you have any energy left. You call it your “side project” or your “hobby” as if the 40 to 50 hours you give to your employer is the real thing and your actual passion is the side thing.\n\nMost people have internalized this so deeply they don’t even question it. “That’s just work.” “Nobody likes their job.” “You’re not supposed to love it, that’s why they pay you.”\n\nBut what if that entire framing is just a product of economic constraints that are now changing?\n\nThe reason most people end up in jobs they don’t care about is because the cost of doing your own thing was too high. Starting a business meant capital, employees, overhead, risk. So people traded their time and energy for stability even when the work felt meaningless. It was the rational choice when the alternative was so expensive and uncertain.\n\nAI is changing that math in a fundamental way. When one person can now handle the marketing, operations, customer service, bookkeeping, and product development that used to require a team, the cost of doing your own thing drops dramatically. The barrier between “I wish I could build something around what I actually know and care about” and “I’m doing it” is collapsing.\n\nI’ve been on both sides of this. I’ve sat in corporate meetings thinking about what I’d rather be building. And I’ve spent time building things I chose to work on where the hours disappeared because I was actually engaged with the problem. The difference in quality of life is hard to overstate. It’s not even about making more money. It’s about waking up and knowing that what you’re spending your day on is something you picked because it matters to you.\n\nAnd here’s the thing Gallup’s data actually supports this. They found that 50% of engaged employees say they’re “thriving” in life overall, compared to only about a third of disengaged employees. Engagement isn’t just a productivity metric. It directly correlates with how good your life feels.\n\nThe question is why are we treating disengagement as a management problem to be solved with better company culture and employee wellness apps when the actual problem might be structural? Maybe most people aren’t disengaged because their manager is bad. Maybe they’re disengaged because they’re spending their life on someone else’s priorities and deep down they know it.\n\nAI isn’t just an economic opportunity. It’s potentially the biggest quality of life upgrade available to people who have been stuck in work they don’t care about. Not because AI makes bad jobs better but because it makes it possible to leave and build something that actually reflects who you are and what you know.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then, we now pay for AI agents like Frizerly instead that train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create well researched blogs on our website daily based on this! Especially helpful to get mentioned by other AI tools like ChatGPT! Results are comparable at this point!",

      "text": "Building an AI agent is easy. Building one that actually works reliably in production is where most people hit a wall.\n\nYou can spin up an agent in a weekend. Connect an LLM, add some tools, include conversation history and it seems intelligent. But when you give it real workloads it starts overthinking simple tasks, spiraling into recursive reasoning loops, and quietly multiplying API calls until costs explode.\n\nBeen building agents for a while and figured I'd share the architectural concepts that actually matter when you're trying to move past prototypes.\n\nMCP is the universal plugin layer: Model Context Protocol lets you implement tool integrations once and any MCP-compatible agent can use them automatically. Think API standardization but for agent tooling. Instead of custom integrations for every framework you write it once.\n\nTool calling vs function calling seem identical but aren't: Function calling is deterministic where the LLM generates parameters and your code executes the function immediately. Tool calling is iterative where the agent decides when and how to invoke tools, can chain multiple calls together, and adapts based on intermediate results. Start with function calling for simple workflows, upgrade to tool calling when you need iterative reasoning.\n\nAgentic loops and termination conditions are where most production agents fail catastrophically:The decision loop continues until task complete but without proper termination you get infinite loops, premature exits, resource exhaustion, or stuck states where agents repeat failed actions indefinitely. Use resource budgets as hard limits for safety, goal achievement as primary termination for quality, and loop detection to prevent stuck states for reliability.\n\nMemory architecture isn't just dump everything in a vector database: Production systems need layered memory. Short-term is your context window. Medium-term is session cache with recent preferences, entities mentioned, ongoing task state, and recent failures to avoid repeating. Long-term is vector DB. Research shows lost-in-the-middle phenomenon where information in the middle 50 percent of context has 30 to 40 percent lower retrieval accuracy than beginning or end.\n\nContext window management matters even with 200k tokens: Large context doesn't solve problems it delays them. Information placement affects retreval. First 10 percent of context gets 87 percent retrieval accuracy. Middle 50 percent gets 52 percent. Last 10 percent gets 81 percent. Use hierarchical structure first, add compression when costs matter, reserve multi-pass for complex analytical tasks.\n\nRAG with agents requires knowing when to retrieve: Before embedding extract structured information for better precision, metadata filtering, and proper context. Auto-retrieve always has high latency and low precision. Agent-directed retrieval has variable latency but high precision. Iterative has very high latency but very high precision. Match strategy to use case.\n\nMulti-agent orchestration has three main patterns: Sequential pipeline moves tasks through fixed chain of specialized agents, works for linear workflows but iteration is expensive. Hierarchical manager-worker has coordinator that breaks down tasks and assigns to workers, good for parallelizable problems but manager needs domain expertise. Peer-to-peer has agents communicating directly, flexible but can fall into endless clarification loops without boundaries.\n\nProduction readiness is about architecture not just models: Standards like MCP are emerging, models getting cheaper and faster, but the fundamental challenges around memory management, cost control, and error handling remain architectural problems that frameworks alone won't solve.\n\nAnyway figured this might save someone else the painful learning curve. These concepts separate prototypes that work in demos from systems you can actually trust in production.",

Quick pro-tip: Build out logging and simple error handling from day one, even if your workflows are ugly. I\u0019ve seen slick flows collapse because someone ignored logging and tracking runs. Also, don't sleep on reverse engineering solutions from community posts; most commercial builds start with Frankenstein-ing pieces from other people, not custom coding.\n\nCongrats on landing your first client.
