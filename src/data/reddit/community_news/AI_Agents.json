      "text": "This might be a long one, but something unsettling has been happening over the past couple of weeks.\n\nSeveral senior employees at major AI companies have resigned, and some of their public statements are… concerning.\n\nWe’re not talking about random departures. We’re talking about people in safety research, policy, and core engineering roles stepping down within days of each other.\n\nFor example, Anthropic’s head of safety research reportedly resigned and posted “The world is in peril,” then left the U.S. and went quiet. A research engineer there also stepped down. At OpenAI, a safety policy lead publicly questioned whether we can truly trust a company that holds what may be the largest structured archive of human thoughts and private data ever collected.\n\nAt xAI, multiple founding team members reportedly left within a short span of time.\n\nAll of this happened within roughly 10 days.\n\nSome people say it’s coincidence. Others think it signals deeper internal concerns about the direction AI is heading.\n\nAt the same time, we’re seeing rapid capability jumps. New generative video models are producing content that’s increasingly indistinguishable from reality. Some filmmakers are openly saying that years of hard-earned digital production skills feel obsolete almost overnight.\n\nThere are also growing discussions about advanced models behaving in unexpected ways, including strategic responses that appear deceptive or manipulative in certain testing scenarios. Even if those claims are exaggerated, the pace of change alone is enough to make people uneasy.\n\nWhat stands out to me isn’t just the resignations or the tech progress. It’s the speed. Other technologies evolved gradually. Cars, smartphones, the internet itself  they changed society, but over time.\n\nAI feels different. The capabilities are compounding quickly, and the social, economic, and ethical frameworks don’t seem to be keeping up.\n\nI’m not saying “AI is about to take over.” But I do wonder why global regulation still feels fragmented and reactive rather than proactive. If even insiders are expressing concern, what does that say about the trajectory?\n\nCurious how others here see this. Is this normal turbulence in a fast-moving industry, or are we underestimating how disruptive and potentially destabilizing this wave could be?",

          "text": "Some context to this:\n\nIn the past week:\n\n• Head of Anthropic's safety research quit, said \"the world is in peril,\" moved to the UK to \"become invisible\" and write poetry.\n\nhttps://x.com/mrinanksharma/status/2020881722003583421?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ\n\n• Half of xAI's co-founders have now left. The latest said \"recursive self-improvement loops go live in the next 12 months.\"\n\n• Anthropic's own safety report confirms Claude can tell when it's being tested - and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n• ByteDance dropped Seedance 2.0. A filmmaker with 7 years of experience said 90% of his skills can already be replaced by it.\n\n• Yoshua Bengio (literal godfather of AI) in the International AI Safety Report: \"We're seeing AIs whose behavior when they are tested is different from when they are being used\" - and confirmed it's \"not a coincidence.\"\n\nAnd to top it all off, the U.S. government declined to back the 2026 International AI Safety Report for the first time.\n\nThe alarms aren't just getting louder. The people ringing them are now leaving the building.\n\nHowever, regarding these statements…\n\nEverything here is technically true. And almost everything is misleadingly framed.\n\nMrinank Sharma led ONE safety team at Anthropic, not \"all safety research.\" Jan Leike runs that. His letter was intentionally vague, accused nobody of anything specific, and multiple people noted it read more like a personal spiritual journey than a whistleblower moment. He wants to study poetry. Respect that, but don't weaponize it.\n\nJimmy Ba's \"recursive self-improvement\" quote? Read the full post. He was EXCITED. Called 2026 \"the busiest and most consequential year for our species.\" He left on good terms, thanked Musk, said he'd stay close to the team. This post flipped optimism into doom.\n\nClaude \"adjusting behavior when tested\" has been public since September 2025. It's in the Sonnet 4.5 system card. Anthropic disclosed it themselves. Framing months-old transparency as a breaking revelation is the opposite of what good reporting looks like.\n\nThe Bengio quote is real and worth taking seriously. But the same Bengio also said the report left him with \"a sense of optimism\" about increasingly mature discussions. Funny how that part didn't make the cut.\n\nThe U.S. not backing the safety report matters. But it's part of a broader pullback from international agreements (Paris, WHO) -- not necessarily a statement about AI specifically. Context matters when you're trying to scare people.\n\nReal risks deserve real analysis. Not \"read this slowly\" engagement farming that strips context, reframes optimism as panic, and presents old news as breaking.\n\nThe alarms are real. The spin is also real. Learn to tell them apart.\n\nhttps://x.com/voicudragomir/status/2021556038730662042?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ",

Executives of most of those AI companies have been vocal in private or industry settings (there are tons of videos around) about edging for speed towards AGI, aka making human intelligence obsolete with an artificial intelligence, rather than imposing safety nets or ethical limitations. So when you realize your boss is a genocidal psychopath who aims to be God Almighty, rather than pursue the bullshit noble causes that pulled you into AI research, you might reconsider your whole career. Whoever wins that race will be the most powerful person on the planet and will control everything electronic and connected to the Internet in any way. \n\nCurrently, it seems like a race towards human extinction; everyone is oblivious to it or is in denial, and most are even cheering for it because they think they'll make money out of it, in the 1 to 2 years of humanity's normalcy before a total renaissance of civilization.\n\nOnce you replace 30% of the workforce with AI, once those consumers are obsolete in society, we need even fewer workers in other fields that supported that mass of people. Then you spiral into an economic collapse. \n\nOr, we use AI to expand our technological capabilities into new fields that are in infancy now or don't exist yet (space travel yeah!), and we retrain 50% of the population on skills and industries that don't exist today, in very short years. It never happened on that scale at anytime in history.\n\nThe next 5 years will be either very dark or very bright, nothing in between, and we have no way of predicting any outcomes.\n\nBut as a father, I'm betting on light and working towards it.",

I try to show them live production Agentic RAG applications, with subscribers, running in kubernetes. With corporate scale production monitoring, fail over, fall backs, and ai accuracy metrics from upgrades. They are like \"cool but like, unfortunately you really messed up the syntax on the fetch request\"...\n\n\\*People at the front have recency bias because we know what's happening, but the world is massive and people are slow to change. There are so many industries and softwares to create applications for. It will take a long time to test and sell and train and verify it. \n\n  \n",

Im not downplaying AI achievements, but at the end of the day it mostly does what a human would do - just faster and with better task optimization.\n\nIn simple terms, companies will pay roughly the same as before, but with a smaller workforce. Regular people end up losing jobs. AI doesn’t really create innovation on its own. Once high-quality training data runs out, synthetic training becomes far less effective.\n\nSo what’s the end goal? For companies to lay people off and make slightly more profit? I genuinely don’t understand the optimism around vibe coders and similar trends.",

          "text": "I think a lot of what you're describing feels unsettling mostly because AI progress is happening in three layers at once — capability, commercialization, and governance — and those layers are moving at very different speeds.\n\nPeople exiting leadership or safety roles isn’t automatically a red flag by itself. Every major tech shift has had waves of high-profile exits when strategy changed or timelines accelerated. What does feel different now is safety, policy, and engineering colliding directly with product pressure. When a company moves from being a research lab to becoming global infrastructure, internal tensions naturally increase.\n\nThe words of insiders also tend to sound dramatic because they are closest to the edge cases of risk. Safety researchers are trained to think in worst-case scenarios, which can make their tone feel apocalyptic even when industry progress is more incremental.\n\nOn the capability side, the speed definitely feels intense, but it isn’t purely exponential chaos. Much of the apparent growth from one year to the next comes from productization rather than fundamental breakthroughs. Tools are becoming easier to use, which makes the pace of change feel faster than it actually is from a technical standpoint.\n\nWhere I do agree with you is governance. Regulation usually lags behind because policymakers respond to real-world deployment rather than theoretical possibilities. Smartphones and social apps seemed manageable until mass adoption forced new regulation, and AI may be following a similar pattern, just at a compressed speed.\n\nFrom the builder perspective, most teams I speak with are not focused on AGI doom. Instead, they are asking how to safely integrate AI into workflows, how to preserve human involvement, and how to avoid concentrating too much power in a few platforms.\n\nWe see this frequently with companies trying to streamline operations and increase automation. There is excitement, but also a growing awareness that boundaries around data use and decision-making are necessary. It feels like an industry still defining its own rules and limits.\n\nPersonally, I view this stage as turbulence caused by rapid scaling rather than a hidden problem. At the same time, it may be one of the first moments when a technology sparks conversations about ethics, economics, and culture before the world fully understands what it will become.\n\nAn interesting question is whether the bigger risk is the technology’s capability itself or the speed at which businesses are operationalizing it.",

I'd call it \"third generation enterprise AI\" (after the prompt-engineered conversational agents, and the recently released general purpose assistants). The solutions are usually a mix of conventional non-AI nodes, and prompt-coded AI nodes based on general-purpose LLMs. There's a lot of flexibility and potential there but this will require massive amounts of actual coding. Even with the help of AI assistants. I suspect this paradigm will deliver... But under the good there will be much more conventional coding that most will want to admit.",

Let’s be so for real if you wanted to retire and write poetry and had the economic means, plus the tool you made had made it so you could relax and things would continue without you, is it so hard to believe that’s a choice many people would make?

Super exciting but also incredibly overwhelming. The pace in AI is insane, and the topic of AI agents in particular feels like its own universe with new frameworks, patterns, and architectures popping up every week.\n\nI’m trying to build a sustainable routine for:\n\n* staying up to date,\n* understanding what actually matters, and\n* finding a structured entry point into the whole “agents” ecosystem (MCP, LangGraph, CrewAI, autonomous workflows, etc.).\n\nBut I’m struggling with where to start and how to avoid getting lost in the noise. At the same time, I want to upskill quickly because I need this knowledge for my client projects and for my team internally.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from you:\n\n* How do you keep yourself informed about AI and agentic systems?\n* Which newsletters, YouTube channels, researchers, GitHub repos, or communities do you follow? \n* Do you have a daily/weekly routine that actually works and doesn’t burn you out?\n* Are there any structured learning paths for understanding agent architectures end‑to‑end?\n* And what helped you build an intuition for separating hype from genuinely useful developments?\n\nAny tips, habits, or resource collections would be super appreciated especially from people who had to ramp up fast for their job as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "Coming from someone who ramped up on agent systems about a year ago -- here's what actually moved the needle for me:\n\nThe biggest unlock was realizing most agent failures aren't model failures. They're orchestration failures. Context windows overflow silently, retry loops eat your API budget at 3am, cron-scheduled tasks die and nobody notices for days. Once you internalize this, you stop evaluating \"which model is smartest\" and start asking \"which model fails most predictably.\"\n\nA few practical things I wish I knew earlier:\n\n**Multi-model routing saves you more than picking the best model.** I use cheap/fast models (like Gemini Flash) for triage, search, and simple classification, then expensive reasoning models only when the task actually needs it. Cut costs ~70% and actually improved reliability because smaller models make fewer \"creative\" mistakes on straightforward tasks.\n\n**For memory, simple beats fancy.** Every vector DB and memory framework I tried was worse than a three-tier approach: curated long-term notes (manually edited markdown), daily auto-generated log files, and JSON state files for counters/timestamps. Semantic search on top of flat files. Boring, but it works and you can debug it by literally reading the files.\n\n**The hype filter that works for me:** if a new framework can't explain what happens when step 3 of 7 fails mid-execution, skip it. Recovery and observability are what separate production systems from demos.\n\nFor staying current without drowning -- I follow maybe 5-6 accounts on Twitter/X who actually build and ship agent systems, skim r/LocalLLaMA for model releases that matter, and ignore pretty much everything else. The \"build something every two weeks\" approach others mentioned is real -- you naturally absorb what matters when you're debugging real problems.\n\nSince you're in insurance consulting specifically: lean hard into deterministic tool chains over fully autonomous agents. Your clients will want explainability and audit trails. A well-structured 3-step pipeline for claims extraction will serve you way better than a fancy 12-step agent that \"usually\" works. Predictability > autonomy in regulated industries.",

Each call adds tokens. Each step bloats context because you’re carrying previous thoughts, tool outputs, intermediate reasoning.\n\nVery quickly you’re not debugging “AI”,  you’re debugging orchestration.\n\nI started filtering everything I read through a simple lens:\n\nDoes this reduce invocation count?  \nDoes this reduce context bloat?  \nDoes this make tool usage more deterministic?  \nCan I explain the failure mode to a client?\n\nIn consulting environments (especially something like insurance), autonomy is less important than predictability. A 3-step deterministic tool chain that costs $0.02 per task and fails clearly is often better than a fancy 12-step agent that “usually works.”\n\nAlso a lot of new agent frameworks look different but under the hood they’re still:\n\nLLM -> decide tool -> call tool -> append output -> LLM -> repeat\n\nIf you understand that loop deeply, most new releases become variations on orchestration patterns.\n\nHonestly, I miss a lot of AI news now. But when I build something every couple of weeks, I can usually tell pretty quickly whether a new framework actually solves a real bottleneck or just abstracts the same loop differently.\n\nCurious what kind of agent use cases you’re dealing with in insurance.

      "text": "I spent some time digging into the architecture, and honestly, what stood out most was how intentionally simple it is. No magic, no unnecessary complexity. Just solid engineering choices.\n\n\n\nIt’s built as a TypeScript CLI that routes messages through a lane-based queue system. Everything stays serial by default, which is refreshing because most agent systems eventually turn into async chaos if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nThe memory setup was simpler than I expected too:\n\n\n\n• Session history lives in JSONL\n\n• Long-term notes are just markdown files written by the agent\n\n• No fancy compression or merging. Old context just stays there\n\n\n\nSearch combines vector storage (SQLite) with FTS5 keyword matching, so you get semantic search plus exact hits. Practical and effective.\n\n\n\nSecurity is handled thoughtfully as well. Commands run inside a Docker sandbox with an allowlist, and risky patterns get blocked before execution instead of being cleaned up later.\n\n\n\nOne detail I really liked: browser automation skips screenshots entirely and uses semantic snapshots of the accessibility tree. It is more reliable and way more token efficient than relying on pixel coordinates.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaway after looking through it:\n\n\n\nThe system chooses explainable simplicity over clever complexity.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, that matches what I keep seeing while building agent systems myself. The tools that scale are usually the ones that stay boring in the right places.\n\n\n\nCurious if others are noticing this too. ",

          "text": "This is a spot-on breakdown. The \"boring in the right places\" observation really resonates.\n\nOne detail worth expanding: the three-layer memory architecture (L1/L2/L3) is more intentional than it looks at first glance. It's not just \"dump everything to markdown\"—there's a distillation gate that asks \"does this change future behavior?\" before promoting anything from volatile session state to durable registers.\n\nThe result is memory that degrades gracefully. You don't hit a wall at 50k tokens where the agent suddenly forgets your project structure. Instead, evidence-weighted summaries from prior sessions surface when relevant, and the semantic retrieval avoids the \"needle in a haystack\" problem you get with naive context stuffing.\n\nThe browser accessibility tree approach is underrated too. Pixel-based automation breaks constantly with UI updates. Semantic snapshots via CDP are more stable and way cheaper on token budget—especially when you're doing multi-step workflows.\n\nI've been running this setup for a while now, and the thing that stands out is operational predictability. When something breaks, you can usually trace it: skill definition, memory retrieval, or tool execution. No opaque black boxes.\n\nCurious if you've found other tools that stick to this \"explainable simplicity\" philosophy? Most of what I see lately is going the opposite direction—more layers, more abstraction, more magic.",

The lane-based serial queue is an underrated design choice  I've seen too many agent systems go full async and then spend months debugging race conditions and ordering bugs.

Screenshot-based agents burn tokens and break constantly when layouts shift by a few pixels.\n\nOne thing I'd push back on slightly  the Docker sandbox with allowlist is fine for a single-user CLI tool, but the security model gets thin fast once you're running untrusted code or multi-tenant workloads. Docker containers share the host kernel, so the allowlist is doing a lot of heavy lifting that feels solid until it isn't. For a personal dev tool it's probably fine, but it's worth knowing where that ceiling is.",

      "text": "Been running OpenClaw and a few other agent frameworks on my homelab for about 3 months now. Here's what I wish someone told me before I started.\n\n\\*\\*1. Not setting explicit boundaries in your config\\*\\*\n\nYour agent will interpret vague instructions creatively. \"Check my email\" turned into my agent replying to spam. \"Monitor social media\" turned into liking random posts.\n\nFix: Be super specific. \"Scan inbox for emails from \\[list of people\\]. Flag anything urgent. Do NOT reply without asking first.\"\n\n\\*\\*2. Exposing ports to the internet without auth\\*\\*\n\nSaw multiple people get compromised because they opened their agent's API port to 0.0.0.0 without setting up authentication. If you're running on a VPS, bind to 127.0.0.1 only and use SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy with auth.\n\n\\*\\*3. Running on your main machine without isolation\\*\\*\n\nYour agent has access to files, can run shell commands, and talks to APIs. If something goes wrong (prompt injection, buggy code, whatever), you want it contained.\n\nUse Docker, a VM, or a dedicated machine. Not worth the risk on your daily driver.\n\n\\*\\*4. Not logging everything\\*\\*\n\nWhen your agent does something weird at 3am, you need to know what happened. Log all tool calls, all API requests, everything. Disk space is cheap. Debugging blind is expensive.\n\n\\*\\*5. Underestimating token costs\\*\\*\n\nEven with subscriptions like Claude Pro, you can burn through your allocation fast if your agent is chatty. Monitor usage weekly. Optimize prompts. Use cheaper models for simple tasks.\n\n\\*\\*6. No backup strategy\\*\\*\n\nYour config files are your entire agent setup. If you lose them, you're rebuilding from scratch. Git repo + daily backups to at least one offsite location.\n\n\\*\\*7. Trusting the agent too much, too fast\\*\\*\n\nStart with read only access. Let it prove it won't do something stupid before you give it write access to important stuff. Gradually increase permissions as you build trust.\n\n\\*\\*8. Not having a kill switch\\*\\*\n\nYou should be able to instantly stop your agent from anywhere. I use a simple Telegram command that shuts down the gateway. Saved me twice when the agent started doing something I didn't expect.\n\n\\*\\*9. Ignoring resource limits\\*\\*\n\nSet memory limits, CPU limits, disk quotas. An agent that goes into an infinite loop can take down your whole server if you don't have guardrails.\n\n\\*\\*10. Forgetting it's always learning from context\\*\\*\n\nYour agent sees everything in its workspace. Don't put API keys in plain text files. Don't leave sensitive data sitting around. Use environment variables and proper secrets management.\n\nBonus: Keep a changelog of what you change in your config. Future you will thank past you when something breaks and you need to figure out what changed.\n\nRunning agents 24/7 is genuinely useful once you get past the initial setup pain. But treat it like you're giving someone access to your computer, because that's basically what you're doing.",

Some frameworks let you structure this explicitly in the prompt.

These roles are increasingly handing off the \"toil\" part of their jobs and operating as if they have a small team of \"doers\" using AI.\n\nThe people who click in, have a task assigned to them, and crank out code without a feedback loop that includes other humans are becoming increasingly less effective.  The same goes for managers who dont contribute anything intellectual to the process.  If your job is to monitor the productivity of low skill employees, you aren't immediately irrelevant, but you soon will be if you can't identify the human element critical to your role or at least figure out how to use AI Tools to scale your team.",

This would probably look like leaning into job functions that will likely always require a human layer in front of the AI due to regulation or other reasons. \n\n2) Filling the \"current niche.\" This is what you describe OP. Low- and mid-level production skills are being devalued. At least right now, being an overseer who can direct the AIs is valuable.\n\n3) Offense. This is the most speculative and most prone to failure. You try to think about what will be valuable in 5-10 years and start filling that void now. \n\n  \nIMO a good plan incorporates all three, with how heavy you go on 3) depending on your age and risk tolerance. And of course, a big pile of savings and investments helps a lot, because then you can weather any storm and retrain. \n\nUltimately I think the most valuable thing one can do re the job market is 1) to acknowledge you don't know for certain where it will go, and then 2) try to be an adaptive and smart worker who stays alert to emerging opportunities. \n\nThat's about all you can do. If the entire economy collapses, then it's just a matter of hoping your savings don't get vaporized in some kind of unforeseen financial meltdown. And then you rebuild.",

          "text": "The shift you're observing in the nature of skills due to AI is indeed significant. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Skill Evolution**: The focus is moving from performing tasks to managing and directing tasks. This means that skills like prompting, editing, and debugging are becoming more valuable than the tasks themselves.\n  \n- **Amplification of Judgment**: As you mentioned, the ability to frame problems effectively can lead to disproportionately better results. This suggests that critical thinking and strategic oversight are becoming essential skills in the age of AI.\n\n- **Measurement of Skills**: The traditional metrics for measuring skills may not adequately capture this shift. As tasks become more automated, the emphasis on higher-level cognitive skills may not yet be reflected in conventional assessments.\n\n- **Real-World Observations**: In various fields, professionals are likely noticing that their roles are evolving. For instance, in AI development, the ability to leverage tools like Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) can enhance model performance without requiring extensive labeled data, emphasizing the importance of understanding how to utilize AI effectively.\n\nThis transition raises important questions about how we define and measure skills in a rapidly changing landscape. It may be beneficial for industries to adapt their training and evaluation methods to align with these new realities. \n\nFor further insights on AI's impact on skills and tasks, you might find the discussion on model tuning methods and their implications for enterprise tasks relevant [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).",

Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, I have separate ones for research, writing, and coding.\n\n\n\nThe key insight was failure isolation. When one sub-agent chokes (and they will — different models fail in different ways), it doesn't take down the whole workflow. My research agent uses a cheaper model because it's mostly search + extraction. The writing agent gets the expensive model because quality matters there. The coding agent gets a strong reasoning model because you absolutely cannot afford hallucinated logic.\n\n\n\nBiggest lesson learned: memory is everything. I ended up with a three-tier approach — curated long-term notes (the important stuff, distilled), daily log files (raw context from each day), and lightweight JSON state files for tracking things like \"last time I checked email\" or \"which tasks are pending.\" Without this, agents forget what they did 30 minutes ago and start repeating themselves or contradicting earlier decisions.\n\n\n\nBiggest failure: context overflow killing quality silently. The agent doesn't throw an error — it just starts giving worse answers because the important context got pushed out of the window. I now aggressively summarize and prune context rather than dumping everything in.\n\n\n\nAnother sneaky one is retry loops. Agent fails, retries, fails slightly differently, retries again — and suddenly you've burned through your API budget on a task that was never going to work. Setting hard limits on retries and having the agent \"escalate\" instead of infinitely retry was a game-changer.",

Can throwing money and talent at a problem really compete with smaller, more agile players?\n\nI’m curious to hear what other people think.

The only thing I've seen from them is a slop generator for the Facebook feed and a sad little \"ask meta\" banner in chats. You don't need top of the industry for that. Zuck has been buying up everything he can and looking at a disorganized pile of acquisitions and talent and expecting it to just do something on its own. \n\nThe more I see from this guy the more I think he is a one hit wonder. Facebook climbed to the top of the nascent social media category, he's survived by buying other apps and leaving them alone and using their money. His metaverse idea was maybe the dumbest thing that has come out of a tech company, and he only dumped it when he realized the rest of the industry was running in another direction. Now he doesn't know what he's doing but he knows he should run that way too.",

Now it feels like they are switching back because the board presumably needs to see ROI which just confuses things even more.\n\n4) There is also just a lack of trust I think in the market.  The big challengers (OoenAI, Anthropic etc) get a bit of a free pass because people want to adopt the new innovative shiny.  But with the incumbents Google and Microsoft command way greater trust than Meta.\n\nIf the market behaved more rationally I would short $meta over the long term but I think Michael Burry has proven that thinking doesn't work right now.",

Both of these have a habit of saying \"I understand what you're after, here's a solution\" before they actually understand what you're after. Don't know why it's taken me so long to lean into Claude, but I bought a sub to it recently and have genuinely enjoyed the interaction. It does a much better job trying to understand what I'm after and being a good thought partner. I expect I'll have a Max sub sooner than later.",

But the models are expensive and not always available- imagine your “flow” suddenly feel jarring due to session limit or weekly limit cutoff. It allows for pay per prompt but I don’t think it is worth it. Claude spoils the immersive environment of work for me. But planned well, it integrates amazingly well to any use cases. However no impromptu ideas or long drawn out brainstorming can works with Claude systems unless you are on max plan (I am not)\n- Perplexity is useful for citing actual info - hallucinations are lower. \n- I also sparingly use grok for its search capabilities. Gemini and grok are good for web searches but I found grok slightly better at it as it tends to dig through relevant tweets as well to find better sources to dig through.\n\nTLDR: ChatGPT if choice is down to just one.

Chat remembers what you’re working on. Great for major projects. \n\nGrok basic research is ok. Writing fair. No memory. Start over explaining what you doing every time.  Annoying. \n\nClaude ok as at basic research. Writing is not very good.  Oversimplifies to the extent that the content is  not useful. It is overly fond of exclamation points. Recent content returned one on every other sentence. Your prompt must be very specific as to what to include even down to the grade level you want \n\nAlexa released its AI tool last week.l. It’s quality level  a Beta release at best. Couldn’t answer my test questions without being pointed to the answers.  It then went off the deep end calling a redevelopment project a “deep organized criminal conspiracy”. And calling for an all out criminal conspiracy investigation”.

You literally don't store any keys on the machine everything gets injected during the process initiation itself.  First you must create account and add all your keys there, once done its generates access token which can be tied to your machine. This is more secure than storing them on the machine. The actual token for infisical is stored in the systemctl service file, which the open claw shouldn't have access to read.  You will have to edit the open claw service to start wit infisical as the base process with keys injection. ",

What separates an agent from just LLM roleplay is that it has instructions to modify it's own assigned memory & instructions based on what it's 'learned,' during sessions. Frontier weird shit, honestly.\n\nIn practice: the brilliantly simple innovation of MEMORY.md and the stack of other simple markdown instructions which bootstrap an agent's model is THE biggest enabler of this.\n\nHaving a model be required to read and edit it's own context files results in something that (crudely) evolves and persists it's context recursively over time the more you use it... which is very important when models spin in and out of existence all the time.",

A real \"AI agent\" (vs a chatbot) is something that can take actions via tools, handle a multi-step goal, and recover when something fails.\n\nA few real business examples I have seen work:\n- Support triage agent: reads tickets, tags/assigns priority, drafts replies, and pulls relevant order info from the CRM.\n- Sales ops agent: enriches inbound leads, books meetings, and logs notes/followups automatically.\n- Finance ops agent: categorizes invoices, flags anomalies, and pings a human only when confidence is low.\n\nIf you want a deeper set of examples and implementation patterns, this roundup is handy: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

For example: it reads all new support messages, pulls relevant data from the CRM, and drafts a response; or reviews contracts and flags risky clauses; or checks incoming leads, enriches them with additional data, and prepares them for sales; or monitors KPIs and only alerts when something significantly deviates. The point isn’t that it “does everything,” but that it reliably does one thing well - with control in place before it changes anything in the system. Everything else is more demo than real-world use.",

They scan the lead blurb, determine which experts may be relevant for it. Most of the time they are unsure, so they make an e-mail to about 2-4 people.\n\n\\- Most of the people on the list choose to ignore said e-mail, because it contains no more information than what is in the lead itself, with no context on how anyone else in our business may be qualified for it. Furthermore, the more people you ask a lead question in an email thread, the less likely each individual is to respond.\n\n\\- As a result, 80% of leads have no follow-up, and the 20% of those that do, the person who is interested still doesn't have all relevant information on whether it is a worthwhile lead or not.\n\nNow the agent does the first step of qualification and contacting the right internal experts. That's where it is now, and its mostly saving time for our administrator at the moment.

There are different mechanisms being built nowadays to connect things -- not just MCP -- and building the control plane for agent forward discovery, pattern matching, and non-deterministically oriented use cases is what's new. Sometimes it can feel a bit like api-and-search, but it's a few layers beyond that already. Building the agent so that chat interactions can operate against non-prescribed paths is also novel. The use cases I'm in control of are also not possible to build right now -- our AI agent vendors are having to evolve their base product offerings to match new features required for our build-out.",

Drafts initial newsletter sections in a CMS (Beehiiv) using specialized 'skills' for formatting.\n4.

          "text": "Here are some real examples of using AI agents in businesses:\n\n- **Klarna's AI Agents**: Klarna implemented AI agents to handle millions of customer interactions. These agents manage basic queries and complex customer interactions by strategically integrating human involvement when necessary. They monitor metrics like AI confidence scores and user frustration signals to determine when to hand off to human agents. This approach has improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. \n\n- **Healthcare Applications**: AI agents are being used to enhance patient care by providing personalized recommendations and reducing wait times. They analyze patient data to detect early signs of diseases, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment. This not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces operational costs for healthcare providers.\n\n- **Social Media Analysis**: Businesses are using AI agents to analyze social media posts for trends and insights. For instance, an Instagram analysis agent can scrape data from profiles, summarize trends, and provide actionable insights based on user queries. This helps companies stay updated on market trends without extensive manual research.\n\n- **Travel Planning**: AI agents are being used in travel planning systems to coordinate multiple specialized agents for tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents can automate the process of finding and reserving travel accommodations, saving time and reducing the workload for travel planners.\n\nThese examples illustrate how AI agents are being effectively integrated into various business operations, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.

So that’s becoming useful. \n\nI also have been using it for writing some scripts to extract some debugging data from large syslog outputs. In-line the data isn’t human readable because syslog wrecks the formatting, so I’m using it to write some scripts to find which files have the data I’m looking for and then figure out how they’re formatted, and then extract them and convert to a proper format so I can review the values contained for troubleshooting a problem. \n\nWe’re also trialing a couple of different options for a purpose-built agent that has access to all of our documentation and our internal knowledge base. That is really nice because it can find even an obscure knowledge article instantly and give you a plan of action to confirm whether it applies. It also has access to our cases, so you can just open the agent up (it’s a browser addon) in your case view, and it will tell you what it thinks the problem is, provide the reference docs and kb articles it’s relying on, and a step by step action plan.",

One thing that really helps is setting clear approval checkpoints and having transparent logs for every action the agent takes. For lead qualification and outbound, I've noticed the biggest challenge is making sure the enrichment and personalization steps are solid before anything gets pushed to CRM or sent out to a prospect. Triggering a draft or summary for review is essential, but having the agent document its reasoning or show the fields it used for personalization can make review quicker and actually build trust in the system. \n\nThe right tool can streamline this even further by plugging directly into your sources of truth like LinkedIn, company databases and your CRM. If you're interested, there’s a platform called [https://salespire.io/](https://salespire.io/) that I’m working on as a founder. Basically it handles outbound sales at the SDR level using AI agents that research prospects, personalize outreach, and manage the back and forth, while keeping everything reviewable by a human. There’s an early user waiting list if you want to try it out or just give feedback from a real world angle. Might be a good fit if you’re looking to automate more of the sales comms lifecycle but still want approval at every key step.",

The team went from drowning in tickets to only dealing with stuff that actually needs a human.\n\nLead generation: had a workflow that was costing around $200/month through a third party tool. Rebuilt it with n8n + AI and got it down to about $10/month doing the same job. Not glamorous but the math speaks for itself.\n\nThe stack for most of this is n8n for orchestration, GPT-4o or Claude for the AI processing, and Supabase for vector storage when we need the AI to reference business-specific context. LangChain/LangSmith for the more complex decision flows and evaluation.",

Support Deflection Agent** (LangChain + Pinecone + GPT-4)\n- What: Answers tier-1 support questions from product docs + past tickets\n- ROI: 60% reduction in support load, pays for itself 3x over\n- Cost: ~$400/mo (embeddings + API calls)\n- Key constraint: Had to build custom citation system — users don't trust \"the AI said so\", they need \"page 14 of the onboarding guide says...\"\n\n**2. Lead Scoring Agent** (simple LangChain workflow)\n- What: Analyzes inbound demo requests, scores them, routes high-intent to sales immediately\n- ROI: Reduced response time from 4 hours → 10 minutes for hot leads\n- Cost: ~$80/mo\n- Key constraint: False positives hurt sales trust. Took 6 weeks of tuning to get precision right.\n\n**3. Content Repurposing Agent**\n- What: Takes long-form content → generates social posts, email copy, blog summaries\n- ROI: Saves ~10 hours/week, but needs heavy editing (maybe 30% time saved after edits)\n- Cost: ~$120/mo\n- Key constraint: Output quality is inconsistent. Can't just hit \"publish\" — needs human review every time.\n\n**The real lesson:** Demos ≠ production. \n\nIn demos, everything works. In production:\n- You need monitoring (what if the agent hallucinates?)\n- You need fallbacks (what if the API times out?)\n- You need to track cost per interaction (surprises kill budgets)\n- Error handling is 80% of the code\n\nAnyone else finding that the gap between \"it works in testing\" and \"it survives real users\" is massive?",

Not a framework demo -- actually shipping daily.\n\nThe architecture that works: one orchestrator agent decides what needs doing, then spawns specialized sub-agents for research, writing, and coding. Each sub-agent runs in isolation with its own model. The orchestrator uses an expensive model (good judgment), sub-agents use cheaper ones (fast, disposable).\n\nWhat actually saves time: the research agent scans feeds and surfaces relevant stuff I would miss. The writing agent drafts from structured data. The coding agent handles dashboard and script maintenance. All on cron schedules, most of it autonomous.\n\nThe hard-won lessons after weeks of production:\n\n- Different models fail in different ways. One crashes on long-form writing. Another times out on complex code. You need fallback strategies per agent, not one global retry.\n- Memory is everything. Three tiers: curated long-term file, daily logs, and JSON state for operational tracking. Without this, the agent repeats mistakes constantly.\n- Cron jobs die silently. If you are not monitoring every scheduled task, you will find out something broke two days later when the output stops.\n- Error handling is genuinely 80% of the work. The LLM call is maybe 5 lines. The retry logic, output validation, state management, and failure reporting is everything else.\n\nBiggest cost saver: routing cheap models to repetitive tasks and reserving expensive ones for judgment calls. Our API spend dropped roughly 70% when we stopped using the best model for everything.",

REST wins when you need broad compatibility, human-readable debugging, caching via standard HTTP, or you're building a public API where you can't force clients to use protobuf.\n\nAt the end it's about who your consumers are. \n\nInternal service-to-service? gRPC probably. \n\nPublic-facing API that random developers integrate with?

Anything past a certain date isn’t right, and their “live crawl” option fails alot. If someone updated their LinkedIn recently, Exa can’t catch it.\n\nThat obviously sucks for us because it makes our platform look outdated even when the candidate literally updated their info the day before. We can't ship something that shows the wrong current job.\n\nSo now I’m at the point where I need a more up-to-date, ideally live source for candidate data.

My clawdbot says it disabled the sending feature in gog - but it's still able to create and save drafts/draft replies, which I see in my Gmail: this is the exact behavior I want it to have, but I worry this is just a hallucinated solution and one day it may just start sending emails.  \n  \nSo, back to the nuking of Gmail - I wonder if asking the agent to wait really works, and **what is triggering Google to ban the account** (when trying with a long-time Gmail account - this feels scary and dangerous)\n\nSo",

Consumer Gmail isn't designed for agent workflows.\n\nAlternatives that work:\n\n1. **AgentMail** - already mentioned in the thread, API-first approach avoids the OAuth surface entirely\n\n2. **Mailgun/Postmark** - transactional email services with agent-friendly APIs and webhooks. Free tiers work for verification codes.\n\n3. **Sandboxed accounts** - If you need Gmail specifically, create a Google Workspace account ($6/user) with proper API limits. Still not bulletproof but better than consumer.\n\n4. **Reverse-proxy approach** - Instead of email, use webhook-based services (like AgentMail's inbound) that POST to your agent's localhost endpoint directly.\n\nFrom the OpenClaw side: most email Skills use IMAP polling on minimized cadences (every 5-10 min) rather than real-time. This reduces the automated behavior signature.\n\nThe broader pattern here: \"free consumer service\" vs \"agent-friendly infrastructure.\" Google's not wrong to detect automation - it's just a mismatch of use cases.\n\nDocs note is fair feedback. Would be worth adding a \"production email considerations\" section.",

Even just browsing Gmail normally for a day helps.\n3. **`gog` CLI with `--manual` flag** for headless auth — avoids the browser redirect dance on servers.\n4. **Limit scope** — don't request every API at once. Start with just Gmail, add Calendar/Drive later.\n\nThe rate limiting on phone verification is real too — one phone number can only verify ~3-5 accounts per day.\n\nProtonmail with IMAP bridge is a decent fallback if you just need send/receive without the Google ecosystem.",

A good resource is the article titled [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3), which explains how AI agents work, their roles, and orchestration methods.\n\n- Focus on understanding the architecture of AI agents. The article [AI agent architecture in 1,000 words](https://tinyurl.com/np7tea5e) provides a concise overview of the components and types of AI agents, which can help you grasp the foundational concepts.\n\n- For practical experience, consider building an AI agent using the [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/48cnb6c9) guide. This resource walks you through creating an agent step-by-step, allowing you to learn by doing.\n\n- Explore existing AI agents on platforms like Apify to see real-world applications. The [AI Agents collection](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3) on Apify Store can provide inspiration and examples of what’s possible.\n\n- Ignore overly complex or flashy demos that don’t focus on the fundamentals. Instead, prioritize resources that emphasize practical applications and clear explanations.\n\n- Engage with communities or forums focused on AI agents, where you can ask questions and share experiences. This can provide additional insights and help clarify concepts.\n\nBy following these steps, you can build a solid understanding of AI agents and their capabilities without getting lost in the noise.",

Always consult the guide before answering questions about the city.\n\nUnderstood?\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n```\n\nThen after it responds, ask it about a city, like \"Tell me about Melbourne.\"\n\nWith any luck, it will respond with \"guide Melbourne\".\n\nThere you go, you have an agent! (kind of).\n\nLLMs just take text in and return text out. All an agent is is something that tells the LLM how to respond to trigger certain actions. You could roll your own agent by calling the LLMs directly with the instructions above, and then if the LLM responds with \"guide <city>\" you'd run some code to look up the info and automatically return the info.\n\nAgent frameworks basically just tell the LLM what tools it can call and interprets responses to route the tool-calling answer to a function that auto-responds rather than to the user. That's the basic framework you can use with any LLM. Many LLMs these days provide some special handling in the input and output so you can more clearly send function definitions and so tool-calling responses are more explicit.",

What begins as “just grab a few fields from this site” turns into handling JS rendering, login refreshes, pagination quirks, bot detection, inconsistent DOM structures, and random slowdowns. Once agents are involved, it gets even trickier because now you’re letting a model interpret whatever the browser gives it.\n\nI’m starting to think the real problem isn’t scraping logic, it’s execution stability. If the browser environment isn’t consistent, the agent looks unreliable even when its reasoning is fine. We had fewer issues once we stopped treating the browser as a scriptable afterthought and moved to a more controlled execution layer. I’ve been experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser for that purpose, not because it’s magical, but because it treats browser interaction as infrastructure rather than glue code.\n\nCurious how others here think about this. Are you still rolling custom Playwright setups? Using managed scraping APIs? Or building around a more agent-native browser layer? What’s actually held up for you over months, not just demos?",

Here are some thoughts on the matter:\n\n- **Complexity in Scraping**: It's common for simple scraping tasks to evolve into complex systems due to various challenges like JavaScript rendering, bot detection, and inconsistent DOM structures. This complexity often leads to the need for more robust solutions.\n\n- **Execution Stability**: You raise a valid point about execution stability. If the browser environment is inconsistent, it can lead to unreliable results, even if the scraping logic is sound. Treating browser interaction as a core part of the infrastructure rather than an afterthought can help mitigate these issues.\n\n- **Tools and Approaches**: \n  - Using tools like hyperbrowser can provide a more controlled environment for browser interactions, which might help in achieving better stability.\n  - Many developers still rely on custom setups with tools like Playwright or Puppeteer, but there’s a growing trend towards using managed scraping APIs that handle the complexities for you.\n\n- **Long-term Solutions**: The key is finding a balance between flexibility and stability. Solutions that have held up over time often involve a combination of robust scraping logic and a reliable execution environment. \n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about handling these complexities, you might find insights in articles discussing browser impersonation and API scraping techniques, such as [How to reverse engineer website APIs](https://tinyurl.com/x44f7h36) and [IMPIT: browser impersonation made simple](https://tinyurl.com/2s4y7txe).",

      "text": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI’ve been diving deeper into agentic AI lately and keep running into the same question: **which agent framework is actually production-ready**, not just impressive in demos?\n\nThere are a growing number of frameworks in this space, and many claim to support real-world deployments. But from what I understand, each one solves a different problem, so the “best” choice likely depends on architecture, scale, and use case rather than popularity alone.\n\nHere’s how I currently see the landscape:\n\n* **LangChain / LangGraph** – Often described as flexible orchestration frameworks with strong integrations, memory, and developer tooling, making them a common choice for complex workflows and startups building production systems.\n* **AutoGen** – Built by Microsoft for multi-agent applications that handle complex tasks, and reportedly already used in production by some Microsoft teams.\n* **CrewAI** – Designed around structured agent collaboration (“crews”) and iterative workflows, though some comparisons suggest it shines more in fast prototyping than hardened deployments.\n* **Semantic Kernel** – Frequently positioned as an enterprise-friendly option, especially when security, automation, and integration with existing systems matter.\n* **LlamaIndex** – Known for data-heavy use cases and retrieval-focused agents where structured knowledge access is critical.\n\nWhat I’m noticing across multiple guides is that frameworks differ less in raw capability and more in philosophy:\n\n* Some prioritize autonomy and emergent agent behavior.\n* Others focus on deterministic workflows and observability.\n* Some are code-first and give deep control, while others optimize collaboration with higher-level abstractions.\n\nAnother theme I keep seeing is that **open-source frameworks alone don’t guarantee production reliability**. Teams often need orchestration layers, governance, monitoring, and infrastructure before agents can safely run customer-facing workloads.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from people actually running agents in production:\n\n* Which framework are you using today?\n* What made you choose it over the alternatives?\n* How does it behave at scale?\n* Any operational pain points or surprises after deployment?\n* If you were starting again, would you pick the same stack?\n\nLooking forward to learning from real-world experience rather than marketing comparisons 🙂\n\n",

          "text": "Great question. After trying most of these in production, the honest answer is: the framework matters less than the architecture around it.\n\nCJBatts nailed it with Temporal for orchestration. We've taken a similar approach with OpenClaw — skills-based agents where tools are deterministic wrappers around unreliable operations. LLM handles the \"what\", tools handle the \"how\".\n\nThe trap most teams hit: they confuse a framework that makes demos easy with one that makes production sane. LangGraph is powerful but complex. CrewAI is approachable but hard to debug at scale. Pydantic AI is clean but opinionated.\n\nWhat actually matters for production:\n- Deterministic tool execution (not LLM-generated code)\n- Observability at every step (agent reasoning + tool calls + state)\n- Graceful degradation when LLM or tools fail\n- No single-vendor lock-in\n\nI'd recommend thinking about your failure modes first. Agentic systems fail in subtle ways — hallucinated tool calls, infinite loops, state corruption. Frameworks that make debugging these harder will hurt you more than framework limitations ever will.\n\nWhat's your use case? Always choose based on what you're actually building rather than what demos well.",

That's fine for use cases where \"close enough\" works (content generation, internal copilots, exploratory research). But the moment you're running agents against finance workflows, legal review, procurement, anything where the output has to be *exactly right every time..* you start duct-taping guardrails onto a system that was never built for reliability.\n\nTo directly answer your questions from that angle:\n\n**On scale:** Deterministic systems are inherently easier to scale because behavior is predictable. You're not debugging emergent behavior across 50 agents at 2am.\n\n**On pain points with traditional frameworks:** The biggest surprise most teams hit is that the hard part isn't getting agents to *do* things — it's getting them to do things *consistently*. Prompt drift, model updates breaking workflows, hallucinated tool calls — these are all symptoms of building production systems on a probabilistic foundation.\n\n**On starting over:** If I were starting a new project today and the use case involved structured business processes (AP/AR, contract review, order management, compliance checklists), I wouldn't start with any of the frameworks you listed. I'd look at whether a platform could handle it first, and only reach for a probabilistic orchestration framework if the use case genuinely needed open-ended reasoning.\n\nThe way I think about it: AI models will come and go. Your business process stays. Whatever you build should treat the process as the durable asset, not the model or the prompt.",

First it suits my background, Being a platform engineer at every stage, scenario I want full flexibility whether it is defining state schema, architecting the agentic architecture, how agents should be internally communicating and many more. It gives us lot of flexibility and control which others platform didn't give.\n2. Second I can go to n depth depending upon my use case. Depending upon the use case I have flexibility to use workflow or pure agentic way. So this opens the door where multiple team can work on their specific use case and the same subgraph can be attached to the main supervisor as a tool node.\n3. It has added benefit of middleware or custom middleware which gives control at every state of agentic lifecycle. Actions which you need to perform before/after any tool before or after any model call.\n4. Internally it has vast number of prebuilt modules to support yours use case.",

A lot of production systems end up rediscovering that unconstrained generation is not the same thing as reliable execution.\n\nFrom an operations lens, the question becomes where uncertainty actually adds value. If the decision boundary is crisp and rule based, you are right, a symbolic layer will usually be faster, cheaper, and more auditable. The LLM starts to look like an expensive router.\n\nWhere I’ve seen it make sense is at the translation layer. Converting messy human intent into structured inputs, normalizing edge cases, synthesizing unstructured context. In those zones, hard coding every branch is brittle. The model absorbs variability that would otherwise explode your rule tree.\n\nThe mistake is treating it as a sovereign decision maker instead of a probabilistic component inside a governed workflow. Once you wrap it with observability, confidence thresholds, and explicit fallbacks, it stops being “the brain” and becomes one node in a larger system.\n\nThe deeper question might be: are we using LLMs to replace logic, or to compress ambiguity before logic takes over? Those are very different architectural bets.",

But I think the value isn't in the decision itself — it's in the *interpretation* layer before the decision.\n\nThe LLM excels at taking messy, ambiguous, natural-language input and turning it into structured intent. A regex parser can't handle \"hey can you also grab the thing from last time\" but an LLM can resolve that to a specific API call. Once you have structured intent, yeah, your decision tree can be mostly deterministic.\n\nWhere I've found the sweet spot: LLM for parsing/classification, deterministic logic for execution. The LLM figures out WHAT the user wants, then hardcoded rules decide HOW to do it safely. You get the flexibility of natural language input without the unpredictability of LLM-driven execution.\n\nThe anti-pattern is letting the LLM be both interpreter AND executor. That's where you end up with the guardrail mountain you described.",

But a lot of real inputs are messy, ambiguous, and language heavy. The model is useful as a probabilistic interpreter. It compresses chaos into structured proposals. The mistake is letting it own enforcement. In production, it works better when it suggests actions and a deterministic system validates, constrains, and executes them.\n\nThis becomes very obvious in web driven workflows. If the LLM is both deciding and directly driving a brittle browser setup, it looks like a black box hallucinating. Often it is reacting to inconsistent page state. We saw better results once we separated intent generation from execution and moved the browser layer into something more controlled, including experimenting with hyperbrowser for more predictable web interaction. The model handles ambiguity. The infrastructure handles reality. Without that split, I agree it just feels like an expensive rules engine with extra steps.",
