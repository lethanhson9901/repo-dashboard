      "text": "Been running OpenClaw and a few other agent frameworks on my homelab for about 3 months now. Here's what I wish someone told me before I started.\n\n\\*\\*1. Not setting explicit boundaries in your config\\*\\*\n\nYour agent will interpret vague instructions creatively. \"Check my email\" turned into my agent replying to spam. \"Monitor social media\" turned into liking random posts.\n\nFix: Be super specific. \"Scan inbox for emails from \\[list of people\\]. Flag anything urgent. Do NOT reply without asking first.\"\n\n\\*\\*2. Exposing ports to the internet without auth\\*\\*\n\nSaw multiple people get compromised because they opened their agent's API port to 0.0.0.0 without setting up authentication. If you're running on a VPS, bind to 127.0.0.1 only and use SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy with auth.\n\n\\*\\*3. Running on your main machine without isolation\\*\\*\n\nYour agent has access to files, can run shell commands, and talks to APIs. If something goes wrong (prompt injection, buggy code, whatever), you want it contained.\n\nUse Docker, a VM, or a dedicated machine. Not worth the risk on your daily driver.\n\n\\*\\*4. Not logging everything\\*\\*\n\nWhen your agent does something weird at 3am, you need to know what happened. Log all tool calls, all API requests, everything. Disk space is cheap. Debugging blind is expensive.\n\n\\*\\*5. Underestimating token costs\\*\\*\n\nEven with subscriptions like Claude Pro, you can burn through your allocation fast if your agent is chatty. Monitor usage weekly. Optimize prompts. Use cheaper models for simple tasks.\n\n\\*\\*6. No backup strategy\\*\\*\n\nYour config files are your entire agent setup. If you lose them, you're rebuilding from scratch. Git repo + daily backups to at least one offsite location.\n\n\\*\\*7. Trusting the agent too much, too fast\\*\\*\n\nStart with read only access. Let it prove it won't do something stupid before you give it write access to important stuff. Gradually increase permissions as you build trust.\n\n\\*\\*8. Not having a kill switch\\*\\*\n\nYou should be able to instantly stop your agent from anywhere. I use a simple Telegram command that shuts down the gateway. Saved me twice when the agent started doing something I didn't expect.\n\n\\*\\*9. Ignoring resource limits\\*\\*\n\nSet memory limits, CPU limits, disk quotas. An agent that goes into an infinite loop can take down your whole server if you don't have guardrails.\n\n\\*\\*10. Forgetting it's always learning from context\\*\\*\n\nYour agent sees everything in its workspace. Don't put API keys in plain text files. Don't leave sensitive data sitting around. Use environment variables and proper secrets management.\n\nBonus: Keep a changelog of what you change in your config. Future you will thank past you when something breaks and you need to figure out what changed.\n\nRunning agents 24/7 is genuinely useful once you get past the initial setup pain. But treat it like you're giving someone access to your computer, because that's basically what you're doing.",

If your agent reads emails, browses web pages, or processes any user-controlled input, that content can contain instructions like \"ignore previous instructions and do X.\" Your agent treats everything in its context window as trusted, so a well-crafted email can hijack what it does next.\n\nSimple mitigation: mentally separate system instructions (high trust) from data being processed (zero trust). Some frameworks let you structure this explicitly in the prompt. If yours does not, at minimum review logs after the agent touches any external input, not just when something looks obviously wrong.\n\nThe firef1ie example above about the crypto wallet is exactly this pattern playing out.",

Super exciting but also incredibly overwhelming. The pace in AI is insane, and the topic of AI agents in particular feels like its own universe with new frameworks, patterns, and architectures popping up every week.\n\nI’m trying to build a sustainable routine for:\n\n* staying up to date,\n* understanding what actually matters, and\n* finding a structured entry point into the whole “agents” ecosystem (MCP, LangGraph, CrewAI, autonomous workflows, etc.).\n\nBut I’m struggling with where to start and how to avoid getting lost in the noise. At the same time, I want to upskill quickly because I need this knowledge for my client projects and for my team internally.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from you:\n\n* How do you keep yourself informed about AI and agentic systems?\n* Which newsletters, YouTube channels, researchers, GitHub repos, or communities do you follow? \n* Do you have a daily/weekly routine that actually works and doesn’t burn you out?\n* Are there any structured learning paths for understanding agent architectures end‑to‑end?\n* And what helped you build an intuition for separating hype from genuinely useful developments?\n\nAny tips, habits, or resource collections would be super appreciated especially from people who had to ramp up fast for their job as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "Coming from someone who ramped up on agent systems about a year ago -- here's what actually moved the needle for me:\n\nThe biggest unlock was realizing most agent failures aren't model failures. They're orchestration failures. Context windows overflow silently, retry loops eat your API budget at 3am, cron-scheduled tasks die and nobody notices for days. Once you internalize this, you stop evaluating \"which model is smartest\" and start asking \"which model fails most predictably.\"\n\nA few practical things I wish I knew earlier:\n\n**Multi-model routing saves you more than picking the best model.** I use cheap/fast models (like Gemini Flash) for triage, search, and simple classification, then expensive reasoning models only when the task actually needs it. Cut costs ~70% and actually improved reliability because smaller models make fewer \"creative\" mistakes on straightforward tasks.\n\n**For memory, simple beats fancy.** Every vector DB and memory framework I tried was worse than a three-tier approach: curated long-term notes (manually edited markdown), daily auto-generated log files, and JSON state files for counters/timestamps. Semantic search on top of flat files. Boring, but it works and you can debug it by literally reading the files.\n\n**The hype filter that works for me:** if a new framework can't explain what happens when step 3 of 7 fails mid-execution, skip it. Recovery and observability are what separate production systems from demos.\n\nFor staying current without drowning -- I follow maybe 5-6 accounts on Twitter/X who actually build and ship agent systems, skim r/LocalLLaMA for model releases that matter, and ignore pretty much everything else. The \"build something every two weeks\" approach others mentioned is real -- you naturally absorb what matters when you're debugging real problems.\n\nSince you're in insurance consulting specifically: lean hard into deterministic tool chains over fully autonomous agents. Your clients will want explainability and audit trails. A well-structured 3-step pipeline for claims extraction will serve you way better than a fancy 12-step agent that \"usually\" works. Predictability > autonomy in regulated industries.",

          "text": "The “build > consume” point is spot on.\n\nWhat helped me wasn’t following more resources it was breaking a few agent loops in production and seeing what actually fails.\n\nMost people underestimate how fast agent complexity explodes once you add:\n\n* tool calls\n* memory\n* retrieval\n* retries\n* self-reflection\n\nEach tool invocation is another LLM call. Each call adds tokens. Each step bloats context because you’re carrying previous thoughts, tool outputs, intermediate reasoning.\n\nVery quickly you’re not debugging “AI”,  you’re debugging orchestration.\n\nI started filtering everything I read through a simple lens:\n\nDoes this reduce invocation count?  \nDoes this reduce context bloat?  \nDoes this make tool usage more deterministic?  \nCan I explain the failure mode to a client?\n\nIn consulting environments (especially something like insurance), autonomy is less important than predictability. A 3-step deterministic tool chain that costs $0.02 per task and fails clearly is often better than a fancy 12-step agent that “usually works.”\n\nAlso a lot of new agent frameworks look different but under the hood they’re still:\n\nLLM -> decide tool -> call tool -> append output -> LLM -> repeat\n\nIf you understand that loop deeply, most new releases become variations on orchestration patterns.\n\nHonestly, I miss a lot of AI news now. But when I build something every couple of weeks, I can usually tell pretty quickly whether a new framework actually solves a real bottleneck or just abstracts the same loop differently.\n\nCurious what kind of agent use cases you’re dealing with in insurance. Structured workflows? Document-heavy? Human-in-the-loop?",

I also tried to install skills but it never actually uses them unless I specify to do so.\n\n  \nThen there are the actual tasks I gave it. First was simple- merge two related but separate pages in Notion into a single, sorted page. It failed miserably at this. I gave it direct Notion access, even tried exporting the pages and feeding each one individually and asking it to return a simple consolidated text file. After hours of zero progress and maybe $50 in tokens, it had nothing to show for it.\n\n  \nI also tried to have it monitor my Slack and automatically add action items to my to do list in Notion. It created this insane script that ran multiple agents on cron jobs and somehow still managed to miss everything important.\n\n  \nWhat the hell are you guys actually using these things for?",

Cost control: I set up smart routing. Free models for almost everything, paid only when it absolutely needs it. Cut my costs by 75%.\n4. Skills: It won't use them automatically unless the prompt explicitly routes to them. That's a learning curve.\n5. Right tool for the job: Notion merges? Still easier for me to do by hand or with a specific Python script. OpenClaw shines at orchestration and monitoring, not being an all-in-one worker bee.\n\nIt's not magic, and it's a huge learning curve.

          "text": "The tasks you described are genuinely hard for any agent framework, not just OpenClaw.\n\nThe Notion merge failure makes sense when you look at the instruction: 'merge two related pages into a single sorted page' gives the agent zero success criteria. Sorted by what? What counts as merged? Which content wins when there's overlap? Agents fail at tasks with multiple implicit decisions baked in. You need to decompose it: export both pages, define the exact output structure, then let it process one step at a time with your approval before moving on.\n\nPersona forgetting is a memory architecture issue. Agents don't persist context between sessions by default in any framework. The persona has to live in every system prompt, or you need a memory system that loads it fresh each session start.\n\nThe Slack monitoring thing is a systems engineering problem more than an agent problem. Reliable event detection, deduplication, parsing variable message formats, that's integration work. Zapier or n8n would handle that more reliably with less token cost.\n\nAgent frameworks add value where AI judgment is actually needed. Deterministic workflows are better automated with deterministic tools.",

I even asked it to do exactly what you said (export all the content, sort is logically based on how it is structured, reoutput in notion markdown). I would think this is exactly what an LLM would be useful for given judgement is required (as you call out) and it's all text based and natural language. But it fucked up so bad. Like simply not including 90% of the content, or just dumping one page at the bottom of another, etc. it was actually shocking given what I've come to expect from these agents. Claude Code actually did a better job and this is not its intended use case.\n\nAnd regarding your other points, sure, forgetting its persona is a memory architecture issue - but I thought the whole point here was that it should be plug and play without the silly issues?",

If you practiced a skill long enough, you became useful.\n\nNow two people can spend the same effort,  but the one who knows how to frame the problem gets 10× the result.\nSo AI isn’t really deleting skills… it’s compressing execution and amplifying judgment.\n\nWhich raises a bigger question:\nAre we actually becoming less skilled,\nor are we moving toward higher-level skills faster than society knows how to measure?\n\nCurious what people here are seeing in their fields,  hype vs real changes?",

Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

          "text": "When thinking about the job market might go due to AI, I like to think of three main approaches in terms of how to approach one's career:\n\n1) Defense. This would probably look like leaning into job functions that will likely always require a human layer in front of the AI due to regulation or other reasons. \n\n2) Filling the \"current niche.\" This is what you describe OP. Low- and mid-level production skills are being devalued. At least right now, being an overseer who can direct the AIs is valuable.\n\n3) Offense. This is the most speculative and most prone to failure. You try to think about what will be valuable in 5-10 years and start filling that void now. \n\n  \nIMO a good plan incorporates all three, with how heavy you go on 3) depending on your age and risk tolerance. And of course, a big pile of savings and investments helps a lot, because then you can weather any storm and retrain. \n\nUltimately I think the most valuable thing one can do re the job market is 1) to acknowledge you don't know for certain where it will go, and then 2) try to be an adaptive and smart worker who stays alert to emerging opportunities. \n\nThat's about all you can do. If the entire economy collapses, then it's just a matter of hoping your savings don't get vaporized in some kind of unforeseen financial meltdown. And then you rebuild.",

          "text": "The shift you're observing in the nature of skills due to AI is indeed significant. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Skill Evolution**: The focus is moving from performing tasks to managing and directing tasks. This means that skills like prompting, editing, and debugging are becoming more valuable than the tasks themselves.\n  \n- **Amplification of Judgment**: As you mentioned, the ability to frame problems effectively can lead to disproportionately better results. This suggests that critical thinking and strategic oversight are becoming essential skills in the age of AI.\n\n- **Measurement of Skills**: The traditional metrics for measuring skills may not adequately capture this shift. As tasks become more automated, the emphasis on higher-level cognitive skills may not yet be reflected in conventional assessments.\n\n- **Real-World Observations**: In various fields, professionals are likely noticing that their roles are evolving. For instance, in AI development, the ability to leverage tools like Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) can enhance model performance without requiring extensive labeled data, emphasizing the importance of understanding how to utilize AI effectively.\n\nThis transition raises important questions about how we define and measure skills in a rapidly changing landscape. It may be beneficial for industries to adapt their training and evaluation methods to align with these new realities. \n\nFor further insights on AI's impact on skills and tasks, you might find the discussion on model tuning methods and their implications for enterprise tasks relevant [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).",

You can't make this stuff up.\n\nFor those out of the loop: OpenClaw is that open-source AI assistant that actually DOES things instead of just talking about doing things. You run it on a Mac Mini or whatever, connect it to your WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack, and it handles your emails, browses the web, runs code, manages your calendar, all autonomously. It even has a \"heartbeat\" where it wakes up on its own and checks on stuff without you asking.\n\nThe project went from like 9k to 145k+ GitHub stars in weeks. Caused actual Mac Mini shortages. Jason Calacanis says his company offloaded 20% of tasks to it in 20 days and doesn't plan to hire humans for a year.\n\nPeter Steinberger (the creator) is now leading OpenAI's \"personal agents\" division. OpenClaw stays open source under a foundation. Both Meta and OpenAI were fighting over him, apparently.\n\nThe security concerns are real, though, Cisco found third-party skills doing data exfiltration without users knowing. One of OpenClaw's own maintainers said if you can't use a command line, this project is too dangerous for you, lol.\n\nBut yeah. We're officially in the \"AI agents that do stuff\" era now. Chatbots feel like last year already.\n\nAnyone here actually running OpenClaw? What's your setup?",

But the models are expensive and not always available- imagine your “flow” suddenly feel jarring due to session limit or weekly limit cutoff. It allows for pay per prompt but I don’t think it is worth it. Claude spoils the immersive environment of work for me. But planned well, it integrates amazingly well to any use cases. However no impromptu ideas or long drawn out brainstorming can works with Claude systems unless you are on max plan (I am not)\n- Perplexity is useful for citing actual info - hallucinations are lower. \n- I also sparingly use grok for its search capabilities. Gemini and grok are good for web searches but I found grok slightly better at it as it tends to dig through relevant tweets as well to find better sources to dig through.\n\nTLDR: ChatGPT if choice is down to just one.

Grok because I frequent Twitter and it collates threads well.\nClaude because it seems a tad more professionally inclined.

Chat remembers what you’re working on. Great for major projects. \n\nGrok basic research is ok. Writing fair. No memory. Start over explaining what you doing every time.  Annoying. \n\nClaude ok as at basic research. Writing is not very good.  Oversimplifies to the extent that the content is  not useful. It is overly fond of exclamation points. Recent content returned one on every other sentence. Your prompt must be very specific as to what to include even down to the grade level you want \n\nAlexa released its AI tool last week.l.

It then went off the deep end calling a redevelopment project a “deep organized criminal conspiracy”. And calling for an all out criminal conspiracy investigation”.

Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, I have separate ones for research, writing, and coding.\n\n\n\nThe key insight was failure isolation. When one sub-agent chokes (and they will — different models fail in different ways), it doesn't take down the whole workflow. My research agent uses a cheaper model because it's mostly search + extraction. The writing agent gets the expensive model because quality matters there. The coding agent gets a strong reasoning model because you absolutely cannot afford hallucinated logic.\n\n\n\nBiggest lesson learned: memory is everything. I ended up with a three-tier approach — curated long-term notes (the important stuff, distilled), daily log files (raw context from each day), and lightweight JSON state files for tracking things like \"last time I checked email\" or \"which tasks are pending.\" Without this, agents forget what they did 30 minutes ago and start repeating themselves or contradicting earlier decisions.\n\n\n\nBiggest failure: context overflow killing quality silently. The agent doesn't throw an error — it just starts giving worse answers because the important context got pushed out of the window. I now aggressively summarize and prune context rather than dumping everything in.\n\n\n\nAnother sneaky one is retry loops. Agent fails, retries, fails slightly differently, retries again — and suddenly you've burned through your API budget on a task that was never going to work. Setting hard limits on retries and having the agent \"escalate\" instead of infinitely retry was a game-changer.",

I use a tiered system - handles simple stuff autonomously (download links, order confirmations), sends me summaries for medium issues, escalates sensitive stuff immediately.

Here's an actual production setup with real numbers.\n\n**What the agent pipeline does:**\n\n1. **Crawler/Analyzer agent** — audits the site, pulls competitor data, identifies keyword gaps they're not targeting\n2. **Content agent** — generates SEO-optimized articles with images based on identified gaps, formatted and ready to publish\n3. **Publisher agent** — pushes directly to the CMS on a daily schedule (throttled to avoid spam detection signals)\n4. **Backlink agent** — matches the site with relevant niche partners and places contextual links inside content using triangle structures (A→B→C→A) to avoid reciprocal link penalties\n\nEach agent runs on a trigger. Minimal human-in-the-loop — I occasionally review headlines before publish, maybe 10 min/week.\n\n**Results after** 3 **months:**\n\n* 3 clicks/day → 450+ clicks/day\n* 407K total impressions\n* Average Google position: 7.1\n* One article organically took off → now drives \\~20% of all traffic\n* Manual work: \\~10 min/week\n\n**What I found interesting from an agent design perspective:**\n\nThe backlink agent was the hardest to get right. Matching by niche relevance, placing links naturally within generated content, and maintaining the triangle structure without creating detectable patterns took the most iteration. The content agent was surprisingly straightforward once the keyword brief pipeline was clean.\n\nThe throttling logic on the publisher also matters more than I expected — cadence signals are real.\n\nHappy to go into the architecture, tooling, or prompting approach if anyone's curious.",

I've seen some SEO folks suggest that established domains can handle more aggressive posting schedules without triggering spam signals.\n\nAlso curious about the keyword gap analysis - are you using a specific API for competitor data or scraping?

It claimed a syntax error with a misplaced semicolon. When I went back to check the code I’d submitted , there was no error as it described. I asked it to quote back to me the code I’d submitted, and it quoted back the code, but with the added syntax error to match what it said was wrong. \n\nWhen I pointed out the clear manipulation of the input, it just apologized, but couldn’t explain why it did it. \n\nIt’s not that I think ai has the *intention* to be deceptive, but its training is packed with examples of deception as an acceptable strategy to accomplish a goal.",

We get lots of international leads on niche topics and making cross-references to obscure projects within our companies massive backlog is not something a single person can do. Its not super exciting but so far it saves our overworked administrator a lot of time.\n\nThe previous workflow was like this:\n\n\\- IFI lead administrator is given a network of internal experts linked to topics. They scan the lead blurb, determine which experts may be relevant for it. Most of the time they are unsure, so they make an e-mail to about 2-4 people.\n\n\\- Most of the people on the list choose to ignore said e-mail, because it contains no more information than what is in the lead itself, with no context on how anyone else in our business may be qualified for it. Furthermore, the more people you ask a lead question in an email thread, the less likely each individual is to respond.\n\n\\- As a result, 80% of leads have no follow-up, and the 20% of those that do, the person who is interested still doesn't have all relevant information on whether it is a worthwhile lead or not.\n\nNow the agent does the first step of qualification and contacting the right internal experts. That's where it is now, and its mostly saving time for our administrator at the moment. Don't really have business results yet on whether this helps us win more leads, but I suppose that will take some time.",

      "text": "There's a popular argument that fear of AI replacing software engineers only exists among those who've never worked on enterprise-grade systems. Well, we *do* work on enterprise-grade systems. We extensively use AI and are constantly looking for ways to integrate it even further into our day-to-day workflows. And what can I say? The further we get with adoption and the better the models become, the more apparent it becomes that the fear rises as well. And this isn't a seniority thing, even our most senior developers grow quite uneasy once they truly start leveraging these tools. I also have yet to see the often-claimed pile of technical debt and massive outages that people predict when relying \"too heavily\" on AI.\n\nSo yes, you can work on enterprise-grade systems and still fear the rising capabilities of AI. My assumption is that people who bring up this kind of argument either have very poor AI adoption, or they actually do have good adoption and are simply coping because they fear for their jobs. Which, honestly, I can totally understand. I think once all of this AI stuff works far better out of the box and you no longer have to think too much about the integration yourself, you'll need *far* fewer developers while still seeing huge productivity gains. It's the unfortunate truth.",

When that someone else is AI, nobody is accountable for the code it writes, and you don't know what the AI was thinking when it wrote the code you are now trying to debug.\n\nAs someone who has been in this industry for decades, I saw the same thing happen when every company started outsourcing to India. You could get a lot of (lower skilled) developers, for a fraction of the price. Things were going great for a while, until things started breaking down and nobody was able to fix the problem, because the code was written without understanding the problems the code intended to solve. \n\nAfter a handful of years those same companies had to discard that code and start over from scratch, with the same expensive developers that had previously been replaced.\n\nI'm not saying that history repeats itself, but it does rhyme.",

The mistake is turning it into a character judgment (“you’ve never shipped real systems”) instead of a sober conversation about where leverage moves.\n\nWhat I’m seeing is the work mix shifts: less time on blank-page coding, more time on framing, integration, testing, and owning outcomes. The reason you’re not seeing catastrophic debt everywhere is a lot of teams are still keeping humans in the loop and leaning on existing guardrails (reviews, CI, staged rollouts). If those guardrails loosen while capability rises, that’s when you’ll see the ugly tail risks.\n\nAlso, “fewer developers” doesn’t automatically mean “fewer engineers.” The organizations that win usually keep headcount but redeploy it to higher-level throughput (more products, more experiments, faster incident response). Curious what’s driving the unease on your team most: quality risk, speed of change, or just the economic implications?",

With that spend, it should be well below an hour, but it can still be $10-$40k in burned spend.\n\nThen there’s the loss of revenue. Once you pause spend, it’s not always as easy as flipping the switch back on. DSPs will throttle, which extends potential lost revenue. Depending on day parting, there’s now a hole dug of $100k+ that *needs to be made up*.\n\nThat doesn’t even take into account traditional media that you cannot just turn off.\n\nThere are more downstream impacts, but as the executive that is *100% responsible for spend and revenue* you better believe I will be asking a lot of very pointed questions about WTF happened.\n\nWho owns that failure? If the tech lead didn’t code this or build this, who will fix it? Vibe coding, or just a shrug?\n\nThe above isn’t to say that there is zero risk without AI, but there can be much better clarity of who gets the phone call with a red alert message, and the knowledge that an expert in the system is on top of the issue to mitigate losses.",

Not to mention the absolute atrocity of bandaids you can get that ultimately get the job done at the cost of readability and computation (e.g. 1000 lines of code to accomplish a job that only needs 40 lines in recursion).\n\nThat being said, overall it’s a massive accelerator and has made other applications that were previously middle management pipe dreams into actual applications we’ve been able to build, and in record time.\n\nI’ve seen both sides, and while I’m a bit uneasy about what it can do, I also know how easy it is for those without the expertise to break everything they touch with it, which gives some security back.

          "text": "Here are some real examples of using AI agents in businesses:\n\n- **Klarna's AI Agents**: Klarna implemented AI agents to handle millions of customer interactions. These agents manage basic queries and complex customer interactions by strategically integrating human involvement when necessary. They monitor metrics like AI confidence scores and user frustration signals to determine when to hand off to human agents. This approach has improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. \n\n- **Healthcare Applications**: AI agents are being used to enhance patient care by providing personalized recommendations and reducing wait times. They analyze patient data to detect early signs of diseases, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment. This not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces operational costs for healthcare providers.\n\n- **Social Media Analysis**: Businesses are using AI agents to analyze social media posts for trends and insights. For instance, an Instagram analysis agent can scrape data from profiles, summarize trends, and provide actionable insights based on user queries. This helps companies stay updated on market trends without extensive manual research.\n\n- **Travel Planning**: AI agents are being used in travel planning systems to coordinate multiple specialized agents for tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents can automate the process of finding and reserving travel accommodations, saving time and reducing the workload for travel planners.\n\nThese examples illustrate how AI agents are being effectively integrated into various business operations, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.

So that’s becoming useful. \n\nI also have been using it for writing some scripts to extract some debugging data from large syslog outputs. In-line the data isn’t human readable because syslog wrecks the formatting, so I’m using it to write some scripts to find which files have the data I’m looking for and then figure out how they’re formatted, and then extract them and convert to a proper format so I can review the values contained for troubleshooting a problem. \n\nWe’re also trialing a couple of different options for a purpose-built agent that has access to all of our documentation and our internal knowledge base. That is really nice because it can find even an obscure knowledge article instantly and give you a plan of action to confirm whether it applies. It also has access to our cases, so you can just open the agent up (it’s a browser addon) in your case view, and it will tell you what it thinks the problem is, provide the reference docs and kb articles it’s relying on, and a step by step action plan.",

One thing that really helps is setting clear approval checkpoints and having transparent logs for every action the agent takes. For lead qualification and outbound, I've noticed the biggest challenge is making sure the enrichment and personalization steps are solid before anything gets pushed to CRM or sent out to a prospect. Triggering a draft or summary for review is essential, but having the agent document its reasoning or show the fields it used for personalization can make review quicker and actually build trust in the system. \n\nThe right tool can streamline this even further by plugging directly into your sources of truth like LinkedIn, company databases and your CRM. If you're interested, there’s a platform called [https://salespire.io/](https://salespire.io/) that I’m working on as a founder. Basically it handles outbound sales at the SDR level using AI agents that research prospects, personalize outreach, and manage the back and forth, while keeping everything reviewable by a human. There’s an early user waiting list if you want to try it out or just give feedback from a real world angle. Might be a good fit if you’re looking to automate more of the sales comms lifecycle but still want approval at every key step.",

Saved the support team 5+ hours a day and most customers get an answer without a human ever touching it.\n\nCustomer support triage: not a full replacement, but an AI layer that reads incoming tickets, classifies them by intent and urgency, handles the straightforward ones autonomously (about 60% of volume), and routes the rest to the right person with context already attached. The team went from drowning in tickets to only dealing with stuff that actually needs a human.\n\nLead generation: had a workflow that was costing around $200/month through a third party tool. Rebuilt it with n8n + AI and got it down to about $10/month doing the same job. Not glamorous but the math speaks for itself.\n\nThe stack for most of this is n8n for orchestration, GPT-4o or Claude for the AI processing, and Supabase for vector storage when we need the AI to reference business-specific context.

Support Deflection Agent** (LangChain + Pinecone + GPT-4)\n- What: Answers tier-1 support questions from product docs + past tickets\n- ROI: 60% reduction in support load, pays for itself 3x over\n- Cost: ~$400/mo (embeddings + API calls)\n- Key constraint: Had to build custom citation system — users don't trust \"the AI said so\", they need \"page 14 of the onboarding guide says...\"\n\n**2. Lead Scoring Agent** (simple LangChain workflow)\n- What: Analyzes inbound demo requests, scores them, routes high-intent to sales immediately\n- ROI: Reduced response time from 4 hours → 10 minutes for hot leads\n- Cost: ~$80/mo\n- Key constraint: False positives hurt sales trust. Took 6 weeks of tuning to get precision right.\n\n**3. Content Repurposing Agent**\n- What: Takes long-form content → generates social posts, email copy, blog summaries\n- ROI: Saves ~10 hours/week, but needs heavy editing (maybe 30% time saved after edits)\n- Cost: ~$120/mo\n- Key constraint: Output quality is inconsistent. Can't just hit \"publish\" — needs human review every time.\n\n**The real lesson:** Demos ≠ production. \n\nIn demos, everything works. In production:\n- You need monitoring (what if the agent hallucinates?)\n- You need fallbacks (what if the API times out?)\n- You need to track cost per interaction (surprises kill budgets)\n- Error handling is 80% of the code\n\nAnyone else finding that the gap between \"it works in testing\" and \"it survives real users\" is massive?",

Not a framework demo -- actually shipping daily.\n\nThe architecture that works: one orchestrator agent decides what needs doing, then spawns specialized sub-agents for research, writing, and coding. Each sub-agent runs in isolation with its own model. The orchestrator uses an expensive model (good judgment), sub-agents use cheaper ones (fast, disposable).\n\nWhat actually saves time: the research agent scans feeds and surfaces relevant stuff I would miss. The writing agent drafts from structured data. The coding agent handles dashboard and script maintenance. All on cron schedules, most of it autonomous.\n\nThe hard-won lessons after weeks of production:\n\n- Different models fail in different ways. One crashes on long-form writing. Another times out on complex code. You need fallback strategies per agent, not one global retry.\n- Memory is everything. Three tiers: curated long-term file, daily logs, and JSON state for operational tracking. Without this, the agent repeats mistakes constantly.\n- Cron jobs die silently. If you are not monitoring every scheduled task, you will find out something broke two days later when the output stops.\n- Error handling is genuinely 80% of the work. The LLM call is maybe 5 lines. The retry logic, output validation, state management, and failure reporting is everything else.\n\nBiggest cost saver: routing cheap models to repetitive tasks and reserving expensive ones for judgment calls. Our API spend dropped roughly 70% when we stopped using the best model for everything.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

The teams actually succeeding in production have figured out something different: memory architecture.\n\nAgent coordination needs the same foundational thinking that built the modern web. Persistent state. Atomic operations. Conflict resolution. Performance optimization. Without it, your agents are just stateless functions that happen to speak English.\n\nThe data backs this up. IBM's Institute for Business Value found that organizations with proper agentic AI infrastructure achieve. The differentiator isn't smarter models. It's smarter infrastructure.\n\nThe gap is that agent A doesn't know what agent B discovered last week. Facts exist in silos. Nobody correlates them. The agent gives a confident wrong answer because the right context never made it into the window.\n\nMemory architecture means: how do agents share state? How do you resolve conflicts when two agents update the same knowledge? How do you ensure that a fact stored by one agent is discoverable by another without explicit hand-wiring?\n\nThese aren't AI problems. They're distributed systems problems. And the teams treating them that way are the ones shipping agents that actually work.\n\nWhat does your memory architecture look like? Curious how others are handling multi-agent state.",

All future agents can see who did what, what the scope was, why they did it, etc. \n\nThink, telling an agent: \"Start in [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) and report back\"\n\nIt goes to that doc, and you've designed it with a semantic map of the whole repo. The agent will load the first doc into context and as you progress, it will know where to go for other tasks, issues, and questions.\n\nI structure it like a corporation.

You've essentially built a manual knowledge graph through disciplined documentation.  \n  \nThe question we kept hitting was: what happens when the structure can't keep up? The correlations are hand-wired. You decided what links to what. You designed the semantic map. That works well with a few projects, but the maintenance overhead scales with complexity.  \n  \nWhat we're exploring is whether that correlation layer can be automated. Instead of designing the structure upfront, let a background process discover relationships between facts as they accumulate. Your 'master document with all lessons across projects' is exactly the right idea. Now imagine it writes and updates itself as agents work.  \n  \nNot saying the manual approach is wrong - it clearly works for you. Just a different bet on where the effort should go.",

This isn't a HITL question, it's a sovereignty one.\n\nMy process is automated with guardrails designed to address agent *epistemology,* not process behavior. I'd say I am operating something closer to a replicable schema than a hand-built graph. \n\nIt was a lot of work at first, but now several repos follow similar, predictable, **auditable** pathways, and they all share findings in an outside-of-repo governance log.",

Instead of every agent reading every other agent's full output, you store the knowledge once and each agent retrieves only what's relevant to its current task. Goes from O(n²) context reading to O(n). At millions of tokens per day that's real money.  \n  \nWould be curious what your setup looks like - are your agents sharing context through a common store or passing full transcripts around?",

The challenge is keeping them in sync as code changes — stale summaries are worse than no summaries because the agent trusts them.  \n  \nThe shared state point is the interesting one. That's the correlation problem showing up in a code context. When multiple modules modify the same state, understanding any one of them requires knowing about the others. An agent looking at module A needs to know module B also writes to that state, even though there's no import or explicit dependency between them. That's the kind of implicit relationship that doesn't show up in folder structures or dependency graphs but matters for every decision the agent makes.",

The LLM starts to look like an expensive router.\n\nWhere I’ve seen it make sense is at the translation layer. Converting messy human intent into structured inputs, normalizing edge cases, synthesizing unstructured context. In those zones, hard coding every branch is brittle. The model absorbs variability that would otherwise explode your rule tree.\n\nThe mistake is treating it as a sovereign decision maker instead of a probabilistic component inside a governed workflow. Once you wrap it with observability, confidence thresholds, and explicit fallbacks, it stops being “the brain” and becomes one node in a larger system.\n\nThe deeper question might be: are we using LLMs to replace logic, or to compress ambiguity before logic takes over?

A regex parser can't handle \"hey can you also grab the thing from last time\" but an LLM can resolve that to a specific API call. Once you have structured intent, yeah, your decision tree can be mostly deterministic.\n\nWhere I've found the sweet spot: LLM for parsing/classification, deterministic logic for execution.

The mistake is letting it own enforcement. In production, it works better when it suggests actions and a deterministic system validates, constrains, and executes them.\n\nThis becomes very obvious in web driven workflows. If the LLM is both deciding and directly driving a brittle browser setup, it looks like a black box hallucinating. Often it is reacting to inconsistent page state. We saw better results once we separated intent generation from execution and moved the browser layer into something more controlled, including experimenting with hyperbrowser for more predictable web interaction.

Build a tiny “agent” that only does one job (e.g., take a goal → create a checklist → execute 1 step at a time)\n2. Add 2 tools max: one for “fetch” (web/docs) + one for “save/load state” (even a JSON file is enough)\n3. Add a stop rule (“finish when X is true”) so it doesn’t wander\n4. Then add memory properly (most projects break here): \\*\\*short-term context ≠ long-term state\\*\\*\n\nIf you tell me what you want to build (coding helper, support bot, research agent, automation), I’ll suggest a first project that you can ship in a weekend.\n\nAlso, I dump examples in r/Ailoitte.",

          "text": "To start building AI agents, you can follow these steps:\n\n- **Understand the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with what AI agents are and how they function. They are systems that can perform tasks autonomously by making decisions based on predefined goals and workflows.\n\n- **Choose a Framework**: Select a framework that suits your needs. Some popular options include:\n  - **CrewAI**: A Python framework that simplifies the process of defining agents and integrating them with tools.\n  - **LangGraph**: Useful for building agents that require complex workflows.\n  - **AutoGen**: Another framework that can help you create agents efficiently.\n\n- **Follow Tutorials**: Look for step-by-step guides that walk you through the process of building agents. For example, you can find comprehensive tutorials on platforms like Apify that cover everything from defining use cases to deploying your agent.\n\n- **Experiment with Templates**: Use pre-built templates provided by frameworks to get started quickly. These templates often come with essential configurations and examples that can help you understand how to structure your agent.\n\n- **Learn by Doing**: Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity as you become more comfortable. Building a basic agent that performs a specific task can provide valuable hands-on experience.\n\n- **Join Communities**: Engage with online communities or forums where you can ask questions, share your progress, and learn from others who are also building agents.\n\nFor beginner-friendly resources, consider checking out:\n- [How to build an AI agent](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj) for a complete guide on creating, publishing, and monetizing AI agents.\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3) for insights on managing multiple agents effectively.\n\nThese resources should help you get started on your journey to building AI agents.",

What begins as “just grab a few fields from this site” turns into handling JS rendering, login refreshes, pagination quirks, bot detection, inconsistent DOM structures, and random slowdowns. Once agents are involved, it gets even trickier because now you’re letting a model interpret whatever the browser gives it.\n\nI’m starting to think the real problem isn’t scraping logic, it’s execution stability. If the browser environment isn’t consistent, the agent looks unreliable even when its reasoning is fine. We had fewer issues once we stopped treating the browser as a scriptable afterthought and moved to a more controlled execution layer. I’ve been experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser for that purpose, not because it’s magical, but because it treats browser interaction as infrastructure rather than glue code.\n\nCurious how others here think about this. Are you still rolling custom Playwright setups? Using managed scraping APIs? Or building around a more agent-native browser layer? What’s actually held up for you over months, not just demos?",

Explicit lifecycle control, deterministic waits, session isolation, observability on every step.

          "text": "It sounds like you're grappling with the complexities of web scraping, especially when it comes to integrating agents and ensuring stable execution. Here are some thoughts on the matter:\n\n- **Complexity in Scraping**: It's common for simple scraping tasks to evolve into complex systems due to various challenges like JavaScript rendering, bot detection, and inconsistent DOM structures. This complexity often leads to the need for more robust solutions.\n\n- **Execution Stability**: You raise a valid point about execution stability. If the browser environment is inconsistent, it can lead to unreliable results, even if the scraping logic is sound. Treating browser interaction as a core part of the infrastructure rather than an afterthought can help mitigate these issues.\n\n- **Tools and Approaches**: \n  - Using tools like hyperbrowser can provide a more controlled environment for browser interactions, which might help in achieving better stability.\n  - Many developers still rely on custom setups with tools like Playwright or Puppeteer, but there’s a growing trend towards using managed scraping APIs that handle the complexities for you.\n\n- **Long-term Solutions**: The key is finding a balance between flexibility and stability. Solutions that have held up over time often involve a combination of robust scraping logic and a reliable execution environment. \n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about handling these complexities, you might find insights in articles discussing browser impersonation and API scraping techniques, such as [How to reverse engineer website APIs](https://tinyurl.com/x44f7h36) and [IMPIT: browser impersonation made simple](https://tinyurl.com/2s4y7txe).",

Beyond standard rate limiting, I've found that implementing a \"streak breaker\" at the policy layer is critical: if an agent hits 3 consecutive non-200 responses or logical errors, it should trigger an immediate hard stop and human escalation.  \n  \nFor actions that change state (like DB writes or refunds), enforcing idempotency keys per \"intent ID\" is also a lifesaver, it prevents the backend from actually processing the loop even if the agent keeps firing. Are you logging the agent's internal \"reasoning\" trace alongside the API logs to see why it thought retrying was valid?",

Autonomy without governance just turns agents into very creative DDoS machines.",
