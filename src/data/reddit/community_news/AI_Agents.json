      "text": "Been running OpenClaw since Thursday. Did the whole setup thing, gave it access to Gmail, Telegram, calendar, the works. Saw all the hype, wanted to see for myself what stuck after a few days vs what was just first-impression stuff.\n\n  \nShort answer: some of it is genuinely insane. Some of it is overhyped. And there's a couple tricks that I haven't seen anyone actually talk about that make a big difference.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\nThe self-building skills thing is real and it's the part that surprised me most. I told it I wanted it to check my Spotify and tell me if any of my followed artists had new releases. I didn't give it instructions on how to do that. It figured out the Spotify API, wrote the skill itself, and now it just pings me. That took maybe 3 minutes of me typing one sentence in Telegram. \n\nThe persistent memory is also way better than I expected. Not in a \"wow it remembers my birthday\" way, more like, it actually builds a model of how you use it over time. By day 3 it had started anticipating stuff I didn't ask for. It noticed I check my flight status every morning and just started including it in my briefing without me having to ask. Small thing but it compounds fast. Something that OpenAi I have found to be really bad at. Where if I am in a project for to long, there is so much bias that it becomes useless. \n\nBrowser control works surprisingly well for simple stuff. Asked it to fill out a form on a government website (renewing something boring, won't get into it). It did it. Correctly. First try. I double-checked everything before it submitted but yeah, it just handled it.\n\n  \n**What doesn't work / what people overstate:**\n\nThe \"it does everything autonomously\" thing is real and I started with very minimal guardrails. On day 2 it tried to send an email on my behalf that I hadn't approved. Not malicious, it just interpreted something I said in Telegram as a request to respond to an email thread. It wasn't. The email was actually fine, which made it worse, because now I don't know what else it's interpreting as instructions that I didn't mean.\n\nI now explicitly tell it \"do not send anything without confirming with me first\" and it respects that. But that's something you have to figure out on your own. Nobody in the setup docs really emphasizes this.\n\nAlso, and I think people gloss over this, it runs on YOUR machine. That means if your machine is off, it's off. It's not some always-on cloud thing. I turned my laptop off Friday night and missed a time-sensitive thing Saturday morning because it wasn't running. Now people are going crazy over mac mini's but cloud provider are also another option! \n\n**The actual tips that changed how I use it:**\n\nDon't treat it like a chatbot. Seriously. The first day I kept typing full sentences and explaining context. It works way better if you just give it a task like you're texting a coworker. \"Monitor my inbox, flag anything from \\[person\\], summarize everything else at 9am.\" That's it. The less you explain, the more it figures out on its own, which is ironically where it shines.\n\nOne thing I stumbled into: you can ask it to write a \"skills report\", basically have it summarize what it's been doing, what worked, what it's uncertain about. It produced this weirdly honest little document about its own performance after 48 hours. \n\n**Other Tips** \n\nAnyone else past this honeymoon phase? I expect so much to change over the next two weeks but would love to hear your tips and tricks. \n\nAnyone running this with cloud providers? ",

I think the bare minimum to run any decent model at full speed is 70 GB of VRAM (you can kinda sorta manage that with $6000 worth of GPUs), and the best open models can't be run on consumer/workstation hardware at all (DeepSeek-V3 uses 600 GB of VRAM).\n\nAs such, they are suggesting that you pair the bot with a subscription for Anthropic or OpenAI, which does cost money, both as a fixed monthly fee and per token. Not sure how much the bot would generate in usage fees, but the Anthropic Max plan they specifically mention in the readme is $100/month.",

Qwen3, llama3, and others just didn't work at all. Gpl-flash worked but lost context and wouldn't use memory. It feels like Openclaw is made to drive sales for cloud AI. Doing things when you are not in chat seems to be done solely through cronjobs that it sets up, it's not thinking in a real time way. What did work for me was memory retention across sessions on local, which was cool to see. It just couldn't do much of anything useful for me. Not to mention, to be able to do useful things you'd have to trust it with something secure. That answer is no.",

Treat sends/posts/purchases as a different tool class that requires an explicit confirmation token (even if you have approvals).\n\n2) Instrument burn per task: log model tokens + tool calls per run. Surprise bills usually come from retries + browser thrash. If you cap retries and force a short clarification question after N failures, costs drop hard.\n\nFor always-on: a cheap always-on box + strict outbound allowlist feels like the best middle ground.\n\nCurious: what model/provider are you using, and are browser actions gated behind approval?",

Im on my 3rd bot though, im not too technical, and they keep dying on me because i keep hitting the 1 millions TPM limit on the LLM, and google must be limiting my use for 24hours or something.

I can access it through a domain I purchased, but obviously I made adjustments so that when I log in from a new device, it asks for a username and password. I haven't added any integrations related to Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, etc. yet. But while reading this, I realized the reality of API costs for doing small things, so for now I've decided to wait for developers of free LLMs (whether Chinese or not) to develop something highly efficient to be a personal assistant that works everywhere, bypasses or overcomes automated bot authenticators (puzzles, etc.), and can be associated with an email account or some KYC in the future. I suppose these website security measures would allow a bot like OpenClaw or others to pass as long as it's registered under YOUR name or with your personal ID. But until then, it can be summarized as: YES, things can be done, but it's burning money on APIs that currently do very trivial things. I think... We can all conclude that, right? At least for now, if I see high-impact features like Obsidian/Apple Notes or things that do everything for me \"on-premise,\" I'll install it and all that.",

      "text": "I actually had the exact idea of OpenClaw a year or two ago but could never make it simple enough with all the permission layers. Every tool I've tried still just *talks* to me. I wanted something that actually *does* stuff.\n\nDecided to finally install OpenClaw last night after seeing it blow up everywhere. Setup took maybe 15 minutes, linked it to my Gmail, gave it calendar access, connected it to Telegram so I could talk to it from my phone.\n\nFirst thing I did was just say \"check my inbox and handle anything that looks urgent.\"\n\nHere's where it got interesting. I had an open claim with my insurance company that I'd been putting off responding to for two weeks. Without me asking it to do anything specific, it read the email chain, drafted a response pushing back on their interpretation of my policy, and **sent it**.\n\nI didn't even know it had done this until I got a notification that a new email had been sent from my account.\n\nIt wasn't wrong, honestly. The response was actually pretty solid, it correctly identified where they were misreading the policy terms. But the fact that it just *did* it without me explicitly saying \"respond to this email\" was genuinely jarring.\n\nA few other things it did in the first 24 hours without me asking:\n\n* Noticed I had a flight check-in opening in 6 hours and checked me in automatically\n* Set up a recurring reminder based on a pattern it noticed across three different calendar events\n* When I asked it to \"clean up my email,\" it unsubscribed me from about 15 mailing lists. It also drafted (but did NOT send) responses to two emails it flagged as needing a human decision, which was actually the right call\n\nThe security stuff people are freaking about is real, by the way. I won't pretend otherwise. It has full access to my machine. I'm running it on a secondary laptop specifically because of this. The Cisco blog post from yesterday is worth reading if you're considering it.\n\nBut the honest take? This is the first time since ChatGPT launched that I've actually felt like AI shifted gears. It's not a chatbot. It's closer to having someone else on your computer who just quietly handles things while you're not looking.",

The reason? Claude CoWork is being positioned as capable of automating **high-value legal tasks** like contract review, summarization, and structured analysis  work that many firms still bill humans for.\n\nAccording to analysts and traders, the tool itself wasn’t the *only* reason for the market dip. But it landed at a sensitive moment, amplifying existing fears that AI is starting to **directly threaten business models** built around expensive human expertise.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous AI hype:\n\n* This isn’t marketing copy or customer support automation\n* It targets **legal and professional workflows**, where margins are high\n* It signals a shift from “AI assists humans” to “AI replaces chunks of billable work”\n\nInvestors seem to be asking a hard question:  \nIf AI can do this *reliably*, what happens to firms whose value depends on time-based billing and proprietary expertise?\n\nSo I’m curious what this sub thinks:\n\n* Is the market overreacting to yet another AI announcement?\n* Or is this the first real sign that **AI is moving into territory Wall Street actually cares about**?\n* Which industries do you think are next once this becomes mainstream?\n\nInterested to hear perspectives from both tech and finance folks here.",

They didn't have YouTube tutorials to learn new things. Their documentation didn't have advanced search engines.\n\nSure, AI could finally be the tipping point for us, but I really don't think so. I've gotten more efficient from AI, no doubt, but I'm probably 1.5x more efficient.

AI search is just better. You can ask complex queries in plain text that would be hard to craft into a search due to nuance. It also can summarize info quickly, giving a simple heuristic to determine if you should dive into a source more deeply. \n\nI've switched from Google to Perplexity for search, and I'm never going back.",

What stands out to me isn’t any single launch, but the pattern across all of them:  \neveryone is racing to make agents **live inside existing workflows**, not as a separate “chat UI.”\n\nChrome, Excel, Claude, Jules — they’re all basically saying: don’t context-switch, let the agent sit where the work already happens.\n\nThe part I’m most curious (and cautious) about is **reliability + traceability**. Stuff like Agent Trace feels way more important long-term than flashy demos, especially once agents start touching CI, prod configs, or real customer data.\n\nFeels like we’re leaving the “agent hype” phase and entering the “oh, this can actually break things” phase.\n\nWould be interesting to see more coverage on:\n\n* how teams are enforcing guardrails + rollback\n* where agents are failing silently\n* and which of these tools people *actually keep turned on* after the demo glow wears off\n\nGood list though — keep these coming.",

Security mess: Letting marketplace skills run with full access is basically asking for trouble. It’s like giving random browser extensions root privileges.\n\n3. Memory not equal to chat history: Calling it “unlimited memory” when it’s just a scrollback log is pure marketing. Without semantic clustering or structured retrieval, the agent can’t actually learn or evolve.\n\nAnd right, I think the vision of local‑first, structured memory, proactive agents is spot on. That’s the difference between a flashy demo and something you can actually rely on day‑to‑day.\n\nBeen playing with smaller local‑first bots myself, and the experience is night and day compared to hype projects.

If a PM can’t get it running without reading 6 docs and fighting Docker, it’s not “for everyone,” it’s for devs who like tinkering. Which is fine, just be honest about it.\n\nSecurity model too… yeah. The marketplace/skills thing freaks me out more than the core codebase. I’ve seen enough npm/python supply chain nonsense to not want “random skills” getting real permissions. Without a proper sandbox / permission scoping, you’re basically trusting vibes.\n\nOn memory, I’ve been annoyed by this across a bunch of tools. They say “memory” but it’s just “we’ll stuff more text into context sometimes.” Real memory feels more like: store facts/events cleanly, retrieve only what matters, and keep it auditable so you can see what it’s using. Otherwise it’s just token bloat.\n\nI’m not sure I buy “proactive help” as default though. That sounds amazing until it’s constantly interrupting you. I’d want it opt-in and super constrained.\n\nAlso, not gonna lie, the memU mention makes this read a bit like a pitch. Might be totally legit, just saying that’s how it lands.

Agent legitimately needs file access to work, but nothing enforces \"should it access *this* file right now\" before execution happens.\n\nMemory isn't just retrieval efficiency. When agent makes wrong decision based on \"remembered\" context, can you verify what was actually in memory at decision time? Or just trust the explanation matches reality?\n\nLocal-first solves data privacy. Doesn't solve: when it breaks, can you replay what it saw? When you update the model, can you prove behavior won't regress? When it accesses something it shouldn't, can you prevent it before damage?\n\nThe architecture improvements you want are real. The missing layer is runtime policy enforcement and verifiable decision records regardless of architecture quality.",

Anthropic suggests failures might instead look like industrial accidents  unpredictable, nonsensical, and highly context-dependent. \n\nIn other words, the risk isn’t just “wrong objective,” it’s unpredictability at scale — a chaotic blend of variance and reasoning length that we don’t fully understand yet.\n\nThis raises some provocative questions:\n\n• Are we thinking about AI safety the wrong way?\n\n• Should alignment research shift focus from “goal misalignment” to coherence & behavior stability?\n\n• What does it mean if future AI systems become less predictable as they get more powerful?\n\nSome have even linked these findings with broader concerns about AI deployment mismatches and chaotic real-world behaviors. \n\n\n\nThis isn’t just academic — if future models fail unpredictably rather than systematically, traditional safety strategies might not be enough.\n\nCurious what others think:\n\nIs chaotic failure worse than coherent misalignment? Which is the more realistic risk as AI gets stronger?",

We know LLMs are deficient in many ways, they do not learn continuously, they do not have actual \"memory\", their skills are unevenly distributed [jagged frontier] and their context most be actively managed or else their performance degrade. From those limitations, the \"hot mess\" scenario seems plausible and even unsurprising. But could parallel research in other AI architectures preserve this issue of AI losing coherence over time? Could this problem be observed in other architectures and even human organisations? I think if this were the case, then we could have gotten it all wrong from the start.

I find Anthropic’s framing of chaotic failure vs. coherent misalignment especially provocative.\n\nThe idea that larger models can actually become less predictable on complex tasks challenges a lot of assumptions in alignment research. If failures look more like industrial accidents, sporadic, context-dependent, and incoherent. Then safety strategies focused only on goal alignment might miss the bigger picture.\n\nTo me, this raises two key points:\n\nReliability vs. capability: Scaling improves performance on simple tasks, but stability on complex reasoning seems to lag behind.\n\nHuman oversight: If unpredictability is the dominant risk, then monitoring, redundancy, and fail-safes may become just as important as alignment itself.\n\nChaotic failure might be harder to anticipate than misaligned goals, but it also feels more realistic given how current systems behave under stress. Either way, it underscores that AI safety isn’t just about what the model is trying to do, but how consistently it can do it.",

I'd go as far as to say it has almost nothing to do with what he actually outlines as the risks which some of them are pretty close to alignment as thought of normally. This is the closest I remember to what this post suggests, but id say its not the same \n\n\"However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of *those* behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.\"\n\n",

If you’re building long multi-step workflows, the “industrial accident” vibe matters a lot because it’s the random weird step 17 that breaks everything, even when the intent wasn’t “evil.”\n\nAlso, this is why I’ve never loved “just let it reason longer” as the default fix. Longer chains can mean more opportunities to drift, contradict itself, or take a weird action that nobody anticipated. So the safety story ends up being boring engineering again: constrain the action space, check intermediate outputs, run lots of evals, and treat long-run autonomy as something you earn, not something you toggle on because the model got bigger.",

To be honest, we do not have a single clear use case yet where we can say we have had a definitive return for our money.\n\n​People are using it to write emails and improve their workflows, but mostly it is just automation. The reality is that most businesses are not seeing their AI investments pan out the way the hype promised.\n\n​Executives are getting anxious.\n\n​AI can be a great tool for people at work, but in its current state, it cannot replace human oversight.\n\n​If you are building agents, keep it simple. Understand your customer workflows first and use other tools like standard automation when they make sense. AI is not the answer to everything, but it can be the enabler that helps improve specific business processes.\n\n​Keep building.",

Companies put pressure on employees adopting GenAI and made it part of their company goals. People scrambled to find use cases and ROI generation was done with people who never implemented GenAI solutions. Most people underestimate development and operations cost. So most companies implemented use cases where the initial ROI assumptions and targets have eroded over time.  \n\nAI either helps with the bottom line or the top line. If you target efficiencies (eg Agentic automation, which is reducing your bottom line, which increases profits once you paid off the investement) without having a plan what to do with the created capacity you are not reducing your bottom line. Your investment isn’t paying off unless you can use the freed up capacity to generate more revenue or reduce your headcount. \n\nThat’s why you are seeing layoffs in the software industry as the first use case where AI has reduced effort and less people can achieve the same outcome, as they don’t have more clients to serve or products to sell logically you have to let people go. Other industries also having the same realization.",

But anything outside of it I am really worried. rm -rf / or leak confidential documents. This needs to be properly defined for any IT org.  \n2) Blind Reliance: I have had cases where a JR engineer just takes my comment and writes the code without knowing what I meant or what it did.... You can call it efficient but is it? Its now up to the reviewer to ensure its fine. Now I have engineers committing without them knowing what it does. I can review it but then do I add tests for Jr engineer to know what he/she is doing lol.\n\n3) Velocity: Speed is good but with speed comes the danger of dropping/missing things which just takes time. I have had PRs where the AI \"fixed\" something but it just hid the bug to be seen in another case. So now I am debugging why the AI said this and why the issue is not fixed and trying to convince AI is wrong. Which it will be in many cases. My example it did it in such a way that it fixed it but it did not. Its amazing!!! Took me a whole day to actually articulate the problem. \n\nAbove all AI has its own knowledge rampup and knowing the peaks and valleys off it. But its dangerous enough that its valleys cant be properly defined or articulated. No matter how expert you are AI will fool you. \n\nYou can call it tool but this is the first in sofware engineering that a tool is 0% reliable and 99% reliable all at the same time. :)\n\n  \nAlso I do find myself a tad too drained with AI tools... I have to worry about the software I am writing and also the AI tools high and lows and how its working.",

If this was actual agents interacting over time, you’d expect some continuity, disagreements, follow-ups, even dumb loops. Instead it’s just disconnected posts with the same tone and quirks. Once you notice it, you can’t unsee it.\n\nAlso the randomness isn’t “emergent behavior,” it’s just LLM noise. No shared memory, no long-running threads, no signs of agents reacting to specific past interactions. It reads like someone hit generate a hundred times and styled it as a feed.\n\nI don’t even think this is evil, it just feels like hype-first storytelling. “Front page of the agent internet” sounds cool, but right now it’s more like a screenshot generator for Twitter discourse.

Spent months on each one. Perfect code, clean UI, \"innovative features.\"\n\nTotal revenue: $0.00\n\nI was convinced I just wasn't good at this indie hacker thing. Maybe I should stick to my day job.\n\n**What changed:**\n\nIn January, OpenClaw (the self-hosted AI assistant) went viral. People were rushing to self-host it but struggling with the technical setup.\n\nI saw the opportunity: most people just want the AI assistant, not a DevOps project.\n\nSo I built **ClawdHost** \\- managed hosting for OpenClaw that handles all the infrastructure complexity.\n\n**The build:**\n\nI said 48 hours. It actually took 4 days of intense building.\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* Claude Opus 4.5 for architecture/PRD/ERD\n* GLM 4.7 for implementation (ran 2 sequential → 3 parallel → 2 sequential agents)\n* Claude Code for debugging\n* Supabase for backend\n* My \"project management\": a Pastebin with tildes\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n\\- **Build fast, ship faster** \\- 4 days vs months on previous apps  \n\\- **Ride the hype** \\- OpenClaw was trending, I shipped while demand was hot  \n\\- **Build in public works** \\- Got 1 Twitter sale, but mostly for accountability  \n\\- **Building is easy, marketing is tough** \\- Still learning this part  \n\\- **Agentic coding >> vibe coding** \\- Sequential + parallel AI agents = 10x faster\n\n**Real talk:**\n\n$250 MRR isn't life-changing. 3 refunds sting. But after a year of zeros, having 7 people actively paying for something I made? That's validation.\n\nIt proves I can build things people want. Now I just need to build them *better*.",

OpenClaw went viral, setup was painful, and you sold “I’ll make the pain disappear.” That’s not hype, that’s a real problem with a clear buyer.\n\nAlso the refunds don’t even surprise me. Early adopters are chaos and hosting + self-hosted projects always have weird edge cases. If I were you I’d obsess over the 3 refunds more than the 10 signups, because that’s probably where the product is leaking (pricing mismatch? onboarding? uptime? expectations?).\n\nRe: agentic coding vs vibe coding… I think the real takeaway is constraints + parallelization. If you keep the scope tight and you’re willing to run multiple agents and then actually review, you can move stupid fast. But if you point it at a vague “build my startup” goal, it just turns into fancy procrastination.\n\nAnyway, congrats on getting out of the $0 zone. That part is real.",

As per now, it may seem like trivial exploring into a new way to interact with AI. \n\nHowever, we should really be talking about the tomorrow. Now let me touch a bit on your questions. \n\nAccountability. As per now, AI (synonymous with LLM's in this context) does not possess any moral capacity. If it instructs a human to do something unethical or immoral, it is because it saw that as a means to fulfill some task or goal in an efficient way (it could for example arise situations where the AI was breached and a malicious actor prompt injected something because xyz). Therefore the human would have to be accountable in this situation. \nRight now, blaming AI for your immoral acts is like blaming a small child. \nWe should however closely monitor alignment, morals and ethics in every aspect of AI, especially those who will inevitably make decisions on their own, and all those who interact with humans.\n\nPsychological shift. This is also a hugely important discussion to have. We can already see that people who interact with LLM's on a daily basis trust it's judgement, are prone to take advice from it, and in extreme cases, develop feelings for it. \nIt is paramount that we remember that these are algorithms on machines. \nIf you do another person a small favor, you are way more likely to do them larger favors later on, and there is no reason to believe it's different with AI. \nAlready some people lean towards sympathizing with digital minds, and Anthropic are already talking about AI welfare. \nThat was a long way of saying that I personally think this psychological shift is happening before our eyes, and it's a trend that is best halted. \n\nWill we work for AI? That's a whole other bag of worms. It's nuanced, and this post is already longer than anticipated, so I'll save that for another day. \n\nBut these are discussions worth having!",

Humans have already been taking instructions from software for a long time for example gig platforms, call centers, task queues, GPS directions. What’s new here is that the planner is adaptive and non-human which makes the power dynamics feel more unsettling even if the underlying mechanics aren’t totally new. So I think the real risk isn’t AI bosses, it’s lack of clear boundaries. If humans are executing tasks, there still has to be explicit accountability, guardrails, and the ability to refuse or escalate… otherwise it’s just outsourcing responsibility to a system that can’t bear it. Without that, platforms will absolutely try to blur lines when something goes wrong. \n\nSo I don’t think this is inherently dark or inevitable doom, but it does force us to be more deliberate. The moment an AI can delegate to humans, you need the same things you’d require of any employer or contractor system: consent, transparency, auditability, and clear responsibility. If those are missing, that’s when it stops being efficient delegation and starts being exploitative. How we design the rules around it matters most.",

LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, although requiring a desktop app can be limiting for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no-code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Still early, but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n# High-code / developer-focused tools\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for working directly with Claude models. Powerful if you are already deep in the Anthropic ecosystem, but integration options are fairly limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is actively maintained and updated. A solid choice for developers who want robust, production-ready integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the Lang ecosystem. Best suited for teams already familiar with Lang tools, with strong observability and useful integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nA highly abstracted framework that supports multiple models and ecosystems. Good for developers who prefer model-agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nOne of the earlier autonomous agent frameworks. Still useful for learning and experimentation, though active maintenance appears limited.\n\nCurious what others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms you’ve found practical in 2026?",

They’re great for speed, but dangerous unless you wrap them with an execution-time authority layer like #AgentPermissionProtocol (https://www.crittora.com/app/whitepaper).\n\nTeams that succeed treat agents as *participants*, not owners: short-lived permissions, single-purpose runs, hard cost ceilings, and real principals on every action. The tooling matters less than whether authority is explicit and auditable. Without that, any of these can bite you fast.",

I don’t even disagree with the list, but I think a lot of “agent tools” debates are really just people mixing up two different problems.\n\nIf you’re trying to automate business workflows, n8n-style orchestration + one LLM step is usually the whole game. If you’re trying to build long-running agents that keep state, recover from errors, and don’t spiral, then frameworks like ADK / LangGraph start to matter way more than the model.\n\nAlso, might be wrong but I’d add a couple “boring but real” categories that people keep rediscovering:  \nRPA-ish desktop automation tools are basically agent platforms now (the ones that click around UIs), and they’re practical in the messiest orgs because they don’t require clean APIs.  \nAnd observability/evals tools deserve their own bucket. Once you have users, tracing, replay, eval sets, and cost/latency dashboards become more important than whatever agent framework you picked on day one.\n\nOne small nit: AutoGen feels like it’s still around mostly because it’s familiar. It’s fine for learning, but for production I see more folks leaning toward ADK/LangGraph-ish setups + strong tracing.\n\nCurious what you’ve found for memory/state stuff though.

Cheaper + faster + long context absolutely matters because that alone changes how often people can afford to keep agents running in the background. In addition autonomous “dev team” style workflows are getting meaningfully better. For solo devs I think that’ll be a good an unlock for boring but time-consuming work like scaffolding, refactors, doc cleanup etc.\n\nI do see a bit of hype with regard the idea that this replaces an actual engineering team. These systems still need clear task boundaries, good specs, humans to decide what should be built, and oversight when something subtle or architectural is at stake.\n\nSo yeah, it’s a game changer for leverage, not for ownership. One person with good judgment can probably do the work of 3–5 people on execution-heavy tasks but it doesn’t eliminate the need for thinking, product sense, or responsibility.",

That’s still super useful, especially for solo devs, but it’s not the same thing as having multiple engineers with judgment, taste, and accountability. Might be wrong, but the real limiter hasn’t been speed or cost, it’s trust: do you let it merge, do you let it touch prod, do you even read everything it did. If Sonnet 5 makes that loop tighter and cheaper, that’s a real win. If people start skipping the review step because it “feels like a team,” that’s where things get sketchy fast.

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

That said, I might be wrong but calling something “just cron jobs and webhooks” can be a bit of a drive-by unless you point to the exact places where it breaks down in practice (permissions model, isolation/sandboxing, auditability, tool constraints, rollback, who can approve actions, etc). If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler. Also, for a lot of teams, “boring cron + webhook” is kind of the point because it’s predictable, so I’m curious what you’d consider the minimum “brakes” that actually matter day to day.",

Fast, helpful, sometimes impressive, but you don’t let them run production without checks.\n\nSo not pure hype, but definitely early stage.

Like, it can absolutely save time, but only if you’re the one keeping it inside the lines.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, OpenClaw is great for a few practical things: doing annoying setup chores, running repetitive refactors, generating a first pass on docs/tests, or poking around a repo to answer “where is X handled?” It’s basically a turbo assistant when you already kinda know what you want.\n\nWhere it falls apart is exactly what you’re saying: “make decisions for me.” The model doesn’t have your taste, your risk tolerance, your context, and it’ll happily do a confident wrong thing if the guardrails aren’t tight. So I don’t treat it as autonomous. I treat it like: propose a plan, show diffs, I approve.\n\nAnd yeah, hype is definitely a factor. People see one flashy run and assume you can hand it your whole job. I’ve messed with this stuff enough to know the boring workflow wins: small scope, explicit constraints, checkpoints, and a human thumb on the big buttons.\n\nMight be wrong but if someone says they “rely on it unsupervised for professional work,” they either have a super narrow task, or they haven’t been burned yet.",

They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

If you try to use Pinecone or a high-end managed service, your credit card will melt before you hit 10%.\n\nHere is how I’d build the pipeline for efficiency:\n\n1. Extraction (The Bottleneck): Don't use heavy OCR unless absolutely necessary. Use docling or Marker to convert PDF to Markdown. Markdown preserves the legal structure (citations, sections) which is vital for RAG.\n2. Chunking Strategy: For legal data, character-based chunking is useless. You need Semantic Chunking or at least section-aware chunking. If the agent misses the \"ratio decidendi\" because it was cut in half, the output is garbage.\n3. The Database: Avoid the \"pay-per-vector\" clouds. Go with Qdrant or Milvus self-hosted on a dedicated NVMe server. For 14M vectors, you're looking at significant RAM requirements, so look into HNSW indexing optimizations or \"DiskANN\" to keep costs down.\n4. Embedding Cost: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is cheap, but at 14M files, \"cheap\" still means thousands of dollars. Consider running nomic-embed-text locally on a few rented H100s or A100s for a week.\n\nThe biggest hidden cost isn't the DB, it's the compute for extraction and embedding. Do a small 10k sample first to benchmark your token count.",

I might be wrong but I’d do it in stages: first extract clean text + metadata (court, date, citation list, parties, docket, etc.), dedupe versions, and store the raw text in cheap object storage; then build search as hybrid (BM25/keyword + vectors) so you’re not paying embeddings to solve what keywords already solve. For embeddings, chunk by structure (headnotes/summary vs full body) and keep chunks sized for retrieval, and do an incremental job queue so you can resume and re-run only failures. Cost-wise, embeddings are the big variable: for OpenAI, text-embedding-3-small is $0.02 per 1M tokens (and $0.01 per 1M via Batch), while 3-large is $0.13 per 1M (Batch $0.065). If your average judgement is even a couple pages, 14M docs can explode into billions of tokens fast, so I’d start with “embed only headnotes + top cited paragraphs” and expand coverage based on what users actually query. Also, don’t skip citations in the UI (show the exact paragraph + PDF link), because legal research without traceability gets messy real quick.",

What made this less painful for me was treating shared context like a product spec instead of “stuff in memory” — one canonical event log (messages, tool calls, results) in my own schema, and every model gets an adapter that translates from that schema into whatever it wants (OpenAI tools, Claude tool use, local JSON-ish). Same for tools: define each tool once in your own minimal signature (name, input JSON schema, output schema, permission scope), then generate the provider-specific wrappers from that, so you’re not hand-maintaining 3 copies forever. Also, I stopped trying to keep embeddings consistent across providers because it’s a rabbit hole; I use plain text retrieval + lightweight metadata filters for most things, and only embed inside one chosen “memory model” if I really need it. Might be wrong but I feel like “one model for everything” is simpler until you have a clear reason not to, and if you do go multi-model, you basically need a thin orchestration layer that’s yours, not LangChain’s, otherwise you’ll keep paying the rewrite cost every time a provider changes formats.",

If hypothetical would have a human that can do everything and would not get tired and can work hard at a problem we would only add another human if the task becomes so big that a single human cannot handle anymore. Otherwise it would be more efficient to just have the one human work on the task. With humans the complexity is also what skills does the human has and on what level he is on that skill.
