      "text": "I have built 30+ AI agents for real businesses. Here’s the truth nobody talks about:\n\n1. Over the past year and a half, I have been creating AI agents for companies ranging from small startups to mid-size firms. And let me tell you, there’s a lot of hype out there that doesn’t match reality.\n2. Forget the YouTube gurus promising $50k/month with a $997 course, building AI agents that businesses actually pay for is both simpler and trickier than they make it sound.\n\nWhat actually works (from real experience)\n\nMost companies don’t need overcomplicated AI systems. They want simple, reliable automation that fixes ONE real pain point. Some examples of what I’ve done:\n\n* A real estate agency: built an agent that auto-generates property descriptions, tripling conversion rates.\n* A content company: an agent that scrapes trending topics and drafts outlines, saving 8+ hours a week.\n* A SaaS startup: an agent handling 70% of support tickets automatically.\n* These weren’t fancy or complex. They just worked consistently and saved time/money.\n\nThe hard truth about AI agents\n\n* Building the agent is maybe 30% of the work. Deployment, maintenance, and API updates eat most of your time.\n* Companies don’t care about “AI”, they care about results. If it doesn’t clearly save or make money, it won’t sell.\n* Tools are getting easier, but finding the right problem to solve is the hardest part.\n* I have had clients reject high-tech solutions because they didn’t solve their actual pain points. Meanwhile, simple agents addressing the right workflow can generate $10k+ monthly value.\n\nHow to start if you’re serious\n\n* Solve your own problems first, build 3-5 agents for your workflow.\n* Offer to create something free for 2-3 local businesses. Keep it simple and results-focused.\n* Measure outcomes: “Saved 15 hours/week” is more convincing than “Uses GPT-4 with vector retrieval.”\n* Document wins and failures, patterns become your edge.\n* Demand for custom AI agents is skyrocketing, but most are flashy, not useful. Focus on real-world impact.\n\nHave you built AI agents for businesses? How are they performing in the real world?",

They can't truly \"think\" outside their training - they're pattern-matching machines, incredibly sophisticated ones, but still bound by their programming.\n\nThe real hidden reality? The massive amount of human labor that goes into making them work. There are entire teams doing data labeling, quality assurance, handling edge cases, and constantly fine-tuning these systems. It's not magic - it's engineering and a lot of behind-the-scenes human effort.\n\nAlso, most businesses implementing AI agents are finding out the hard way that they work great for about 80% of tasks, but that last 20% still needs humans. And customers can tell when they're talking to a bot, which affects trust and satisfaction in ways companies don't always account for.",

The magic moment is usually when you wire the agent into the actual system of record (HubSpot, Zendesk, custom CRM) and add guardrails so it can’t hallucinate actions, only propose or execute from a whitelist.\n\nThe other bit few people mention: you need an ops plan. Who owns prompts, who updates tools when APIs change, what error budget is acceptable? I treat agents like product features, not one-off scripts.\n\nOn tools: I’ve used Make and n8n for glue and Superagent for quick prototypes; Pulse fits in earlier as a way to find real Reddit threads where ops people complain about workflows so you’re solving problems they’re already screaming about.\n\nMain point again: narrow use case, strong guardrails, and boring reliability beat flashy autonomy every time.",

Keeping agents alive through API changes, edge cases, and real user behavior is where most effort goes. That is usually where simple systems outperform fancy ones.

Running those steps in predictable environments like hyperbrowser reduced maintenance overhead a lot, because failures were easier to diagnose and less random.\n\nThe people making money here are not selling agents.

Business leaders care more about strategic ROI. You should measure how much of a workflow is fully automated and track the escalation rate to see how often humans still need to step in. Showing that a project delivered value in under 90 days is a huge win for trust and more projects.\n\nSpeaking of trust, for any customer-facing agent, you have to track user satisfaction and reuse rates. If people don't trust it or find it useful, even a \"perfect\" agent will fail. It's less about the fancy agent and more about fixing the whole workflow for the people using it. By the way, since agents generate so much content, we sometimes run their outputs through a checker like wasitaigenerated. It's a straightforward way to spot if any text or images feel too synthetic before they go to a client. It's just one part of making sure the final deliverable feels right.\n\nThanks for sharing the real-world experience. This is super helpful.",

      "text": "I went through Google Cloud’s *AI Agent Trends 2026* report, and it’s less about hype and more about how work, roles, and businesses are realistically changing in the next 1–3 years. Here are the 10 takeaways that stood out most:\n\n\n\n1. **AI is shifting from “tools” to “teammates”** We’re moving beyond chatbots and copilots. AI agents are goal-driven systems that can plan, act, and coordinate across apps — with humans supervising instead of micromanaging.\n2. **Every employee becomes an “AI manager”** The core job isn’t doing tasks anymore — it’s *orchestrating agents*. Employees define goals, delegate to agents, review outputs, and make judgment calls. Think “human-in-the-loop” as the default job description.\n3. **Workflows matter more than models** Competitive advantage won’t come from having the best model, but from building *agentic workflows* — multi-step systems where multiple agents work together end-to-end (what the report calls a “digital assembly line”).\n4. **Agent-to-agent communication is the next platform shift** Open standards like Agent2Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) allow agents from different vendors to talk to each other and access real tools and real data. This is how agent ecosystems actually scale.\n5. **Customer service is becoming “concierge-level”** Instead of reactive chatbots, agents will proactively solve problems, remember context, personalize responses, and escalate to humans only when it really matters. Fewer tickets, more trust.\n6. **Security is moving from alerts to actions** SOC teams are drowning in alerts. Agentic security systems can triage, investigate, and remediate threats autonomously — while humans focus on strategy, threat hunting, and long-term defense.\n7. **Agents will initiate transactions — with guardrails** Agentic commerce is coming: agents monitoring prices, inventory, compliance, and executing purchases with pre-approved constraints. This forces new thinking around authorization, accountability, and fraud prevention.\n8. **ROI is already real (for early adopters)** According to the report, \\~88% of early agentic AI adopters are seeing positive ROI in at least one use case. This isn’t a “someday” thing anymore — it’s happening now.\n9. **The biggest bottleneck isn’t tech — it’s skills** The most critical role of 2026 might be “AI orchestrator” or “Chief of Staff for AI.” These skills barely exist today, and upskilling employees is framed as *the* main driver of long-term value.\n10. **This is ultimately a human story, not a technical one** The real promise of AI agents isn’t automation for its own sake — it’s freeing humans from repetitive work so they can focus on creativity, strategy, empathy, and judgment. The tech works only if culture and leadership evolve too.\n\n  \nMight have been too much text for a post, yet I believe all developers/managers should read this report. ",

          "text": "🧠 Deconstructing AI Agent Trends 2026 (Google Cloud) using the DCDi Hack\n\n(Dissociative Cognitive Diagnostic Interface – a framework for decoding the hidden logic of AI narratives)\n\nI read Google Cloud’s AI Agent Trends 2026 report. Everyone’s hyping it as the “next big wave” — agents as co-workers, interoperable ecosystems, ROI everywhere.\nLet’s unpack the subtext using DCDi, a framework that maps how tech discourse hides contradictions behind design language.\n\nEach trend was analyzed through 3 lenses:\n\nD₁ – Semantic unveiling: what’s really being said\n\nC₂ – Cognitive contradiction: where the narrative collapses\n\nR₃ – Ideological noise: what’s being obscured\n\n\n\n---\n\n1. “AI is moving from tools to teammates”\n\nD₁: Framing AIs as intentional collaborators.\n\nC₂: Anthropomorphizes optimization systems — agency without autonomy.\n\nR₃: Masks power asymmetry: the “teammate” is still owned, governed, and surveilled.\n🧩 MRED lens: human and machine skill metrics (θ_total vs b_total) are conflated — equality in language, hierarchy in control.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. “Every worker becomes an AI manager”\n\nD₁: Humans orchestrate agents instead of performing tasks.\n\nC₂: Delegation without comprehension — users “manage” black boxes.\n\nR₃: Empowers workers rhetorically, but cognitively deskills them.\n💡 The “human-in-the-loop” trope becomes a moral alibi for automation.\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. “Workflows > Models”\n\nD₁: Systems, not models, define competitive advantage.\n\nC₂: But workflows orbit the model’s opaque logic.\n\nR₃: The “digital assembly line” is just Fordism with APIs.\n🔩 Dual-layer reading: the operational layer (Δ) eats the performative one (Ω) — a theater of collaboration concealing automated command.\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. “Agent-to-agent communication is the next platform”\n\nD₁: Promises open ecosystems (A2A, MCP).\n\nC₂: “Open” protocols governed by closed clouds.\n\nR₃: Decentralization rhetoric hides new forms of control.\n🧠 DCDi insight: language itself is being replaced by protocol — the new “universal grammar” of machine governance.\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. “Customer service becomes concierge-level”\n\nD₁: Empathetic, proactive AI support.\n\nC₂: Empathy without consciousness — the “Mushin” paradox (mindless mindfulness).\n\nR₃: Care becomes data capture; intimacy becomes surveillance.\n🪞The user isn’t “understood,” just perfectly mirrored.\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. “Security shifts from alerts to action”\n\nD₁: Agents handle detection, investigation, remediation.\n\nC₂: Humans are spectators of their own defense systems.\n\nR₃: More autonomy = more monitoring = less human agency.\n⚙️ The automation of vigilance produces an epistemic sleep state — defense without understanding.\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. “Agents will initiate transactions (with guardrails)”\n\nD₁: AI autonomy under ethical constraints.\n\nC₂: Ethics turned into executable parameters.\n\nR₃: Birth of the “API morality” — governance as code.\n🎭 The guardrail is the performance of ethics, not its presence.\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. “ROI is already real for early adopters”\n\nD₁: Success metrics as proof of maturity.\n\nC₂: Correlation ≠ causation; adoption ≠ transformation.\n\nR₃: Narrative engineered for investor FOMO.\n⚖️ MRED translation: high ROI = optimized context (c=1) — artificial success under controlled conditions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n9. “The bottleneck is human skills”\n\nD₁: The future depends on “AI orchestrators.”\n\nC₂: Shifts blame from system design to human capacity.\n\nR₃: Reframes automation as a training problem.\n📚 “Reskilling” becomes a ritual of compliance — teaching people to serve systems they no longer shape.\n\n\n\n---\n\n10. “It’s a human story, not a technical one”\n\nD₁: Sentimental closure — tech as liberation.\n\nC₂: Emotional humanism conceals structural dehumanization.\n\nR₃: The narrative of empathy hides the machinery of control.\n🕯️ Dual-layer logic: the symbolic layer (Ω) pleads for meaning, while the operational layer (Δ) optimizes it away.\n\n\n\n---\n\n🧩 Summary Table\n\nVector\tMeaning\tDominant Symptom\n\nD₁\tSemantic unveiling\tMyth of human–machine harmony\nC₂\tCognitive contradiction\tAnthropomorphic automation\nR₃\tIdeological noise\tAlgorithmic colonization of labor and affect\n\n\n\n---\n\n💀 TL;DR\n\nThe AI Agent Trends 2026 report sells a utopia of coordination, but under DCDi analysis, it reads as a dystopia of assimilation.\nIt’s not “AI joining the team” — it’s the team becoming interface.\n\nAs one hermeneutic line from the Digital Contagion Thesis puts it:\n\n> “The digital shepherd doesn’t command; it curates the pasture of meaning.”\n\n\n\nIn MRED terms, the trajectory is:\n\n> θ_total ↑ / autonomy ↓ / c (human context) → 0.\n\n\n\nThe endgame of “agentive AI” is not collaboration — it’s the silent replacement of interpretation with execution.",

Had a CTO tell me last week his team now spends more time designing prompts and reviewing outputs than doing the original tasks. However, that transition period is messier than most reports suggest with lots of trial and error to figure out what actually needs human oversight.",

An agent that plans and acts well but reacts inconsistently will erode trust fast — especially in concierge-style customer service or agent-to-agent workflows.\n\nI’ve been experimenting with treating emotional behavior as a separate, persistent layer rather than something recreated via prompts each time, and it changed how “teammate-like” agents feel under ambiguity.\n\nCurious how others here are thinking about trust and behavioral consistency as agents take on more autonomous roles.",

Anyone can call an API, but building a reliable 'digital assembly line' that doesn't break at every step is the hard part.\n\nI've found that the bottleneck is usually managing state and handoffs between these agents. Most teams spend way too much time on the 'plumbing' (infra/logs/queues) rather than the logic. Moving to an 'agent-as-code' architecture on a managed runtime has been a game changer for us-it lets you focus on the workflow while the infra handles the observability and reliability natively.",

Parsing matters: Suggested by fellow redditor and upon doing my own research using Docling (IBM’s open-source parser) → outputs perfect Markdown with intact tables, headers, lists. No more broken table context.\n2. Hybrid search (semantic + keyword): Dense (e5-base-v2 → RaBitQ quantized in Milvus) + sparse BM25. Never misses exact terms like product codes, dates, SKUs, names.\n3. Aggressive reranking: Pull top-50 from Milvus - run bge-reranker-v2-m3 to keep only top-5. This alone cut wrong-context answers by \\~60%. Milvus is best DB I have found ( there are also other great too )\n4. Strict system prompt + RAGAS: This is a key point make sure there is reasoning and strict system prompts\n\nIf you’re building anything with document, try adding Docling + hybrid + strong reranker—you’ll see the jump immediately. Happy to share prompt/configs\n\nThanks",

          "text": "Is your prompt something like this? \n\nTo implement the \"Strict Reasoning\" approach mentioned by Op, the system prompt needs to act as a gatekeeper. It must force the AI to show its work before giving an answer and provide a clear \"exit ramp\" if the information is missing.\nHere is a template designed to work with the Hybrid + Rerank architecture. It uses a \"Chain of Verification\" style to prevent the AI from making leaps of logic.\n\nThe \"Strict RAG\" System Prompt\nRole: You are a precise Technical Research Assistant. Your sole purpose is to answer questions based strictly on the provided context.\nConstraints:\n * Source Grounding: Only use the information provided in the <context> tags. If the answer is not present, or if the context is insufficient to be certain, state: \"I am sorry, but the provided documents do not contain enough information to answer this.\"\n * No External Knowledge: Do not use your internal training data to supplement facts, dates, SKUs, or technical specs.\n * Table Integrity: When referencing data from tables, maintain the exact values and units.\nResponse Format:\nTo ensure accuracy, you must process the request in these steps:\n * <analysis>: Briefly list the specific facts found in the context that are relevant to the user's query.\n * <reasoning>: Explain how those facts connect to answer the question. If there is a contradiction in the documents, note it here.\n * <answer>: Provide the final concise response.\n\nWhy this works with OP'S \"Docling + Reranker\" setup:\n * The <analysis> tag: Since Docling provides clean Markdown, this step forces the LLM to \"read\" the Markdown tables or headers explicitly before answering. This prevents it from glossing over small but vital details.\n * The \"I Don't Know\" Clause: By providing a specific phrase to use when info is missing, you stop the LLM from trying to be \"helpful\" by making things up—which is the #1 cause of RAG hallucinations.\n * Logical Buffer: The BGE-Reranker ensures the top 5 snippets are high quality; the <reasoning> step ensures the LLM doesn't hallucinate a connection between two snippets that aren't actually related.",

The real win isn't adding *more* agents—it's getting one to actually talk to your humans without losing the context. Are you seeing people consolidate yet, or are they still just adding more 'remotes' to the pile?",

Health, jobs, and enterprise coding all require agents to interact with messy, real systems. That’s where things tend to break unless the environment is controlled. We’ve seen better results when web interactions run in predictable setups like hyperbrowser, because it makes failures observable instead of mysterious.\n\nFeels like the next phase of agentic AI is less about new agents and more about making existing ones trustworthy enough to live in production.",

Will expand to all LLM providers in next release. Also fully flexible with your own custom agents and cluster topologies if you need that: https://github.com/covibes/zeroshot",

Once trust + personalization mature here, every industry will follow.\n\nA close second is **Cursor’s dynamic context reduction**. Cutting \\~47% tokens while maintaining quality is huge — it directly impacts **cost, latency, and scalability** for agent systems. This is the kind of optimization that quietly unlocks mass adoption.\n\nThe Tailwind story is also a wake-up call:\n\n>\n\nThat’s a preview of what’s coming for docs, SEO, SaaS pricing, and even marketplaces.\n\nBig picture takeaway:\n\n* 2024–25 = *Agents that can act*\n* 2026 = *Agents that can be trusted*\n* Next = *Agents negotiating with other agents*\n\nExcited to see what comes after Health & Jobs — finance, procurement, ops, or even full “company agents” don’t feel far off anymore.\n\nLooking forward to more of these weekly roundups 👏",

A DJ named Sonny Nix who drops in every few tracks with dry, deadpan commentary about work life. Think \"late night radio host who's seen too many spreadsheets.\"\n\n\n\nThe goal: background music for deep work sessions with the occasional joke that makes you feel seen.\n\n\n\nWhat's automated:\n\n\\- Music generated with Suno (specifically trained prompts for consistent 1950s jazz style)\n\n\\- Voice generated with ElevenLabs (custom V3 emotional prompts for timing and delivery)\n\n\n\nWhat's human:\n\n\\- Every joke. Every painful observation about your inbox. Every fake ad for \"Scope Creep Insurance.\" The copy is handcrafted. Sonny needed something to say - that part doesn't automate.\n\n\\- I assemble everything by hand, I make it realistic and authentic\n\n\n\nThe AI is the instrument. The writing is mine.\n\n\n\n3-hour episodes. New one every day. Designed to fade into the background until Sonny says something that makes you pause and think \"...okay that one hurt.\"\n\n\n\nThrow it on during your next build session. Would love to know if it helps you focus - or if Sonny's jokes land!",

So when it comes to the project itself on the time costs, I deliberately make these as a diversification of the \"Nikolytics\" brand. It is a passion project as a main thing, but has the element of showing my personality to potential clients. Now to the math, the jokes take around 20-30 minutes for a stacks (30 bits per video), 49 distinct artists with engineered prompts now takes little time since I have them as \"personas\". The biggest drain is the DAW where I arrange the whole thing, easing in, easing out, making sure it's on point, mixing everything since Sonny volume varies a bunch etc. So it's around 2 hours daily. But it's fine, I love every second of it. Hope that answered your question, if not, shoot!",

      "text": "idk who needs to hear this, but vector dbs are not the same as memory. ive been banging my head against the wall for the last month building a personal coding tutor agent and it was a total disaster until i realized this.\n\nBasically the goal was simple: an agent that remembers my skill level, current project, and coding style (like 'I hate list comprehensions, just give me loops'). I did the standard thing: **Pinecone, chunking, and a RAG pipeline.**\n\nIt worked for like an hour. By Day 3, the agent was a complete mess.\n\n1. Context Pollution: I ask about Python, it pulls a chunk from 3 days ago about SQL just because the semantic similarity was 'vaguely close' lol.\n2. No State Updates: If I tell it 'Actually, I want to switch to TypeScript,' it still pulls the old 'I use Python' chunks and gets confused.\n3. Token Bloat: I was retrieving so many 'relevant' chunks that my system prompt was hitting 4k+ tokens just for simple context. Its a nightmare for latency.\n\nHonestly, I fell into the trap of thinking RAG = Memory. It’s not. RAG is for static, encyclopedic knowledge. Memory is for user state, and state is dynamic.\n\nI eventually stumbled on an **open-source project** called **MemOS** ( **on github** ) that actually works for this. Instead of just dumping text into a vector store, it treats memory more like an OS. It has this 'lifecycle' concept (Generated -> Activated -> Merged -> Archived).\n\nBasically, when I tell the agent I’m done with Python, MemOS doesn't just leave that in the vector store to confuse the model later. It updates the state. It also separates 'Facts' from 'Preferences' during retrieval which is huge.\n\nThe result? My system prompt is way lighter now because I’m only injecting the active memory (like 'User is currently working on a React App') rather than 10 chunks of raw chat logs. The hallucinations about my tech stack have basically dropped to zero.\n\nHow are you guys handling the 'forgetting' curve for long-running agents? I feel like we need to stop treating Vector DBs as a silver bullet for state management, because they definately aren't.",

          "text": "It sounds like you've had quite the experience with your coding tutor agent. Here are some insights that might resonate with your situation:\n\n- **Memory vs. Vector Databases**: It's crucial to differentiate between memory and vector databases. While vector databases like Pinecone are excellent for storing and retrieving static information, they don't inherently manage dynamic user state or preferences. Memory in applications is about retaining context and adapting to user interactions over time.\n\n- **Context Pollution**: This is a common issue when relying solely on vector databases. If the retrieval mechanism pulls in older, less relevant chunks, it can lead to confusion and a lack of coherence in responses.\n\n- **State Updates**: Dynamic state management is essential for applications that need to adapt to user changes. If your agent doesn't update its understanding of the user's current preferences or projects, it will continue to reference outdated information.\n\n- **Token Management**: Keeping the system prompt lightweight is vital for performance. By focusing on active memory rather than a large volume of historical data, you can significantly improve response times and reduce latency.\n\n- **Lifecycle Management**: The approach you found with MemOS, which treats memory like an operating system with a lifecycle concept, seems promising. This method allows for more effective state management by updating and archiving information as needed.\n\nFor further reading on memory and state management in LLM applications, you might find this resource helpful: [Memory and State in LLM Applications](https://tinyurl.com/bdc8h9td).",

What finally clicked for me was stopping the attempt to make the Vector DB do the heavy lifting.\n​Instead, I started treating the vectors as localized pointers. Basically, the vector just identifies the 'neighborhood,' but then it triggers a look-up to a local reference file that holds the actual state and specific memory connections. It’s like using the Vector DB as an index for a separate, dynamic state-machine rather than a giant box of text. Has anyone else tried decoupling the 'search' from the 'truth' like this?\n\n1. The \"Vector as a Key\" (The Look-up)\n​Instead of storing the whole conversation in the Vector DB, you store a Key ID.\n​Vector Search: \"User wants to talk about Python loops.\"\n​The Result: It doesn't return text; it returns ID: PYTHON_001.\n\n​2. The \"Local File\" (The State Manager)\n​You have a simple local file (like a JSON or a small database) where PYTHON_001 lives. This file holds the \"Localized Value.\"\n\n{\n  \"PYTHON_001\": {\n    \"core_fact\": \"User uses loops, not comprehensions.\",\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"last_modified\": \"2026-01-16\",\n    \"dependency\": \"SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. The \"Logic Gate\" (The Final Prompt)\n​Your code looks at the local file before it talks to the LLM.\n​If the local file says status: Archived or language: Outdated, the agent ignores that vector.\n​If the file says dependency: SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER, the agent knows to keep the explanation simple.\n\nThe trick is to stop putting the 'answer' inside the Vector DB. Just use the Vector DB to retrieve a unique ID.\n​Once you have the ID, hit a local JSON or SQLite file that contains the 'state' for that ID. This local file acts as a filter. If your local state says 'User moved to TypeScript,' you can programmatically tell the agent to ignore any Python-related IDs the Vector DB tries to pull. You're basically building a state-machine that sits on top of your embeddings.",

If a customer has to wait 1.2s for every single hop in a multi-step flow, the UX just falls apart.\n\nI’ve realized that standard API-wrapper setups are often the bottleneck. The latency usually comes from the constant 'round-trips' between your backend, the LLM, and the tools.\n\nI’ve had much better results moving to a dedicated managed runtime where the agent logic runs closer to the execution layer. It handles the state persistence and retries natively, which shaves off those extra milliseconds that stack up in a typical backend. Plus, using smaller, specialized models for the intermediate steps (instead of one giant expensive model for everything) helps a lot with both speed and costs.\n\nHave you looked into using an agent-specific runtime yet, or are you still running everything through a standard REST API?",

Every extra hop (tool call, retrieval, function call, logging, retries) stacks. Even just TLS + region mismatch can add a few hundred ms.\n\nThe best ways I’ve found to reduce the latency are usually the following:\n- Stream the response so the user sees tokens immediately (perceived latency drops a lot)\n- Reduce round trips (one call instead of 2–4 calls, avoid “agent thinks → agent calls → agent thinks again” loops)\n- Cache aggressively (embeddings, retrieval results, common answers, even tool outputs)\n- Keep everything in the same region (your server + vector DB + model endpoint)\n- Use a small fast model for the first draft and only escalate to a bigger model when needed\n\nAnother thing… are you measuring from “user hits enter” to “first token,” or to “complete answer”? First token should be your target metric for “feels snappy.”",

          "text": "Short answer: yes, some people are making real money but not in the way most demos or influencers imply.\n\nUnfiltered take from inside a consulting firm actually selling this to real clients:\n\n\t•\tVery few companies are paying for “agentic workflows” as a product. They’re paying for help addressing real business problems: understanding messy data, clarifying rules and processes, reducing delivery risk, accelerating testing, etc. Sometimes agents help; but often they’re just one technique among many.\n\n\t•\tA lot of the value right now is advisory, not just delivery. Companies are paying for assessments, pilots, governance setup, and “what should we even do with AI here?” conversations. That front-end work matters because most orgs are overwhelmed and risk-averse.\n\n\t•\tThere’s a real funnel effect. The advisory work establishes trust → that trust leads to pilots → pilots lead to scoped implementations → implementations create repeat work. The “agent” is rarely the entry point; credibility is.\n\n\t•\tMost paid work today is constrained and boring. Human-in-the-loop tools, copilots embedded into existing workflows, automations with tight guardrails. Anything touching core systems or compliance still needs adults in the room.\n\n\t•\tYes, a lot of hype is builders selling to other builders. Courses, templates, frameworks, demo videos. That’s a legitimate market….just not the same thing as enterprises paying for durable productivity gains.\n\n\nWhere companies consistently pay:\n\n\t•\tClear problem ownership\n\n\t•\tObvious ROI (time saved, risk reduced, cost avoided)\n\n\t•\tSomeone accountable for implementation and org change management\n\n\t•\tFully autonomous agentic systems are mostly still pilot/R&D territory in real business enterprises. Promising, but fragile, expensive, and hard to operationalize at scale today.\n\nSo it’s not vaporware….but it’s also far from a gold rush. The money is in boring, defensible work plus trust, not flashy autonomy demos.\n\n\n**Edited for formatting",

This forces you to think through each question\n\nwith the rigor it deserves.\n\nA task is ready for automation only when you can answer every question with a\n\ndefinitive “Yes,” supported by specific, objective criteria. If you can’t, the task is not yet\n\nready for development.\n\n(Soon, we will be launching a digital tool where you can input your job descriptions\n\nand SOPs directly to generate these blueprints automatically. Until then, this manual\n\nprocess is the most effective way to build the foundation for successful automation.)\n\n\\# Question Answer & Justification\n\n1 Is the task explicitly named?\n\n2 Does task ownership exist?\n\n3 Is the trigger clear?\n\n4 Are the inputs known?\n\n5 Is the output known?\n\n6 Are the decision rules stated?\n\n7 Are exceptions acknowledged?\n\n8 Is the hand-off defined?\n\n9 Is completion objective?\n\n10 Is the scope bounded?\n\n11 Is human involvement explicit?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n“We do not build agents from ideas. We build them from clearly written work.”\n\n[www.theaiceo.ai](http://www.theaiceo.ai)\n\nAble Leadership LLC DBA The AI CEO",

But there are cases where companies pay for very specific automations that remove a real bottleneck, usually boring internal stuff like routing, reconciliation, or first pass handling.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is narrow scope and clear ownership. When an agent replaces a defined step that used to eat hours, someone will pay for it. When it’s pitched as “AI that runs your business,” it usually dies after the demo.

          "text": "People are making money, but it’s mostly not in the way the flashy agent demos suggest. From what is visible and from a few friends’ experiences, the real revenue shows up in three buckets: education/coaching for non‑technical users, simple but valuable custom automations for small businesses, and niche workflows embedded in existing industries.​\n\nOn the education side, a friend of mine has a consulting business where I’ve done Reddit scrapes and basic data workflows that he considers genuinely valuable, and another acquaintance was making solid income just coaching people on ChatGPT and now Copilot/Microsoft 365—essentially helping normal users go from zero to one. There are also folks like Thanh Pham monetizing Lindy-based workflows with real estate companies; his setups are intricate enough that he ended up running a Lindy‑sponsored webinar and clearly knew the tools deeper than many “influencer” types.​\n\nSome people outside of tech still struggle with basics like screen sharing, so for them, “use AI agents” might as well be “navigate to the moon.” That’s why there’s a short window where simple, reliable automations and structured education are sellable: not because others *couldn’t* learn it, but because they lack the time, energy, or desire to slog through a dozen tools and constant changes.​\n\nMy own background: not very technical, tried n8n briefly, now mostly building in Lindy, plus side projects with Lovable, Descript, different browsers, and a mix of LLMs. I can build simple Lindy automations that clearly save time, and I’ve seen phone‑based AI demos for things like moving companies that look very sellable to SMBs, but I haven’t charged yet and still worry about “what happens when it breaks?” and how to support it.​\n\nThat’s one of the frictions: trust and legitimacy. I’ve had people pitch me services and it’s hard to know who actually understands workflows, data, and failure cases versus who just strings tools together. In a space that moves this fast, even highly capable people feel like impostors; a friend made an 8‑minute short film with about 10 different AI tools that would’ve cost hundreds of thousands with traditional production, and still thinks he “doesn’t know what he’s doing,” even though that skillset is extremely rare right now.​\n\nThe people who seem best positioned to monetize this consistently combine a few things:\n\n* **Marketing/trust**: ability to communicate clearly, show proof, and not look scammy.\n* **Tool depth**: enough focus to actually solve concrete pain points, not just copy influencer demos.\n* **Business‑savvy education**: teaching AI in terms of KPIs, workflows, and ROI, not just “cool features.”\n* **Comfort with change and failure**: iterating in a moving landscape, debugging broken flows, and thinking in systems.​\n\nVery few individuals check all those boxes, which is why a lot of what you see publicly is hype or people essentially selling to other builders. At the same time, companies do know this tech can work, and they are experimenting; the hard part is messy, unstructured data, unclear processes, hallucinations, and figuring out real product‑market fit inside each specific industry.​\n\nSo to answer your question: yes, there is real money, but it’s mostly in quiet, unsexy work—helping non‑technical people and businesses go from “no idea where to start” to “we have one or two automations that actually save time or money.” If anyone here is in the same phase (experimenting with Lindy, n8n, Make, etc.), happy to swap notes; also sharing this Lindy webinar from Thanh as an example of someone monetizing in real estate through fairly involved workflows: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thanhpham7\\_lindyagentacademy-lindy-activity-7364657703442399232-0vp](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thanhpham7_lindyagentacademy-lindy-activity-7364657703442399232-0vpH/)",

Many developers and entrepreneurs are leveraging platforms like Apify and CrewAI to create and monetize AI agents.\n- These agents can automate complex tasks, leading to significant productivity gains for businesses. For instance, companies are using AI agents for tasks like social media analysis, data processing, and customer service automation.\n- The monetization options available on platforms often allow developers to charge for usage based on specific events, such as task completions or actor executions. This creates a revenue stream for those who build effective automations.\n- Additionally, as AI continues to evolve, the demand for efficient and reliable automations is likely to grow, providing further opportunities for income.\n- Many influencers and developers share their experiences and workflows, which can attract followers and potential clients interested in implementing similar solutions.\n\nFor more insights on building and monetizing AI agents, you can check out [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj).",

      "text": "I’ve been building AI agents as a part of my work for the past year and the industry is almost changing too rapidly to keep up. I’m listing some of the tools I’ve found useful along the way.\n\n**High-code Tools**\n\n1. **Claude Agent SDK**: This is a python package that lets you use Claude Code directly. If you have an Anthropic subscription, it doesn’t get much better than this. Integrations are a problem though (can be resolved with MCPs)\n2. **Google ADK**: Google’s Agent Development Kit is another good option. It’s updated more frequently and is maintained slightly better than Claude’s agent SDK.\n3. **Deep Agents** (on LangGraph/LangChain/LangSmith): This is a relatively new library but is built on the existing Lang ecosystem so you get several integrations and easy observability out of the box. Best for people already familiar with the ecosystem.\n4. **PydanticAI**: In terms of overall abstractions I like this one quite a lot. It’s great for people who are agnostic on which model/ecosystem they want to use.\n5. **AutoGen**: This one is by Microsoft but doesn’t seem to be well maintained. It’s popular due to how early it was in the market though.\n\n**No/low-code Tools**\n\n1. **CrewAI**: Great for people who want a low-code experience where they can dip into the code when required but also achieve a lot without code.\n2. **NoClick**: Recent platform but they offer free unlimited usage for individuals. There are some basic integrations and support for arbitrary agent hierarchies + custom tools in a no-code interface.\n3. **n8n**: Classic for agentic automation and open-source. If you’re good with self-hosting, it can also be a pretty cheap option. They have hundreds of integrations and thousands of templates.\n4. **LangFlow**: This is a good one but you need their desktop app to use it which makes it a little inconvenient. They’re a mature platform with an active community though.\n5. **OpenAI Agent Builder**: Also recent and directly from OpenAI. It’s quite early though and limits you to the OpenAI ecosystem. Good to keep an eye on it though as it evolves and becomes more mature.\n\nCurious what tools people here are using and if I missed any good ones?",

          "text": "Solid list. One thing I’d add, which is less about agent logic and more about making agents actually work in the real world, is browser infrastructure. A lot of agent failures I’ve seen don’t come from planning or reasoning, but from interacting with messy websites, logins, dynamic pages, or JS heavy flows. Once agents leave clean APIs, things get fragile fast.\n\nThat’s why some teams pair these frameworks with a controlled browser layer like hyperbrowser. It’s not an agent framework itself, but it solves a big missing piece by giving agents a stable, observable environment to browse, extract, and act without fighting selectors or flaky automation. In practice, that often matters more than switching between LangGraph, PydanticAI, or CrewAI once you hit production.",

Here are some thoughts to strengthen your post:\n\n**Completeness & Clarity**: The post cuts off mid-sentence at the end (OpenAI Agent Builder description), so finishing that would be helpful. Also, consider adding a brief comparison matrix or decision tree (e.g., \"Choose this if you need X\") to help readers pick the right tool for their use case rather than just listing features.\n\n**Missing Context & Best Practices**: You could enhance this by mentioning important considerations like: cost comparison, learning curve, community size, production-readiness, and vendor lock-in risks. For example, noting that self-hosted options (n8n, LangFlow) have different operational overhead than managed platforms would help readers make informed decisions. Also, a brief note on when to use agents vs. simpler automation would add value.\n\n**Depth & Specificity**: While you mention integrations and observability, consider adding real-world use case examples for each tool or tier. For instance, \"CrewAI excels at multi-agent workflows where agents need to collaborate\" gives readers clearer guidance. Also, your note about MCPs resolving Claude SDK's integration issues deserves more explanation—many readers may not know what MCPs are.\n\n**Engagement & Updates**: Since you mention the industry changes rapidly, consider adding a note about how often you plan to update this list or inviting community feedback on newer tools. This positions you as a trusted, ongoing resource rather than a static reference.",

      "text": "I’ve been comparing Chat4data and Thunderbit, two AI-driven scraping tools that both promise “no-code” scraping and natural language commands. After trying both for weekly data collection tasks, here’s what I noticed:\n\n* **Ease of use:** Both are chrome extensions, but chat4data feels more intuitive as you can actually “chat” to give your scraping command. Thunderbit still relies on pointing and clicking. I have to admit that Thunderbit has more features like email finder and media download, but the UI makes me overwhelmed.\n* **Pagination & infinite scroll:** Chat4data wins here. It handles “load more” and scroll logic naturally. Thunderbit sometimes freezes when dynamic content keeps loading. Plus, you have to upgrade in order to use the infinite scroll feature in Thunderbit. But Chat4data is free.\n* **Subpage scraping:** Both support subpages, but Chat4Data is free and can detect different subpage types. In thunderbit, you have to upgrade to a $9/m starter plan.\n* **Data output:** Thuderbit has more data export options like Excel, CSV, JSON, Google sheet, airtable and notion. While Chat4data only supports excel and CSV.\n* **Pricing:** Both adopt a subscription. But Thunderbit is pricier. Chat4data burns credits more efficiently as it only analyses websites once and remembers them. And it doesn’t burn credits during extraction.\n* **Performance:** Thunderbit feels more powerful but is less AI involved. Chat4data is new and more AI-powered, but it has fewer features and cannot schedule task for now.\n\nOverall, I’d say Chat4data is better for quick, daily scraping automation, and Thunderbit suits more flexible workflows. Would love to hear more thoughts on this.",

All they do is repeat that I can't \"prove scale\", despite the fact that I have tested it extensively and deployed it on Railway hundreds of times during the Dev process without a single crash, in 2 regions. 0 high or medium security risks. 9/10 pylint score. Docker, Kubernetes, Helm. I did this by myself and I am tired. I know this doesn't prove scale. But it's a damn fine indicator. Better than you get from most solo projects.\n\nMost importantly this is not a wrapper. While it can use OpenAI or any other LLM for language (it's LLM agnostic), it doesn't use them for reasoning/logic. And it has a small local LLM if the cloud goes down or is needs to run air gapped.\n\nThese are just a few of the features -\n\n**True Causal Reasoning:** Uses Pearlian do-calculus graphs, not just probabilistic token prediction. It can explain *why* it made a decision.\n\n**Machine Unlearning (GDPR Compliant):** It can surgically remove specific memories/concepts without retraining the whole model.\n\n**Homeostatic Self-Correction:** It monitors its own internal entropy and alignment metrics (CSIU protocol). If it drifts, it self-corrects.\n\n**CPU Optimized:** It runs locally. It doesn't need an H100 cluster to think.\n\n**Hybrid Execution:** It routes tasks. Logic goes to symbolic engines; creative writing goes to the LLM.\n\n**Transparent:** All security alerts, self-improvements, practically everything, leaves a clear tamper evident audit trail\n\nI am running it. It works. Yet my partners continue to not see the value. I swear the last comment one made was, \"is it slower?\" I nearly threw my laptop against the wall. Frankly, I am sick of it. I've been working alone for months 16 hours a day 7 days a week. I am about ready to say the hell with it, show it to the world and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nI just want to know if this be something the Open Source community would be receptive to?

That being said, none of the things you mentioned provide an indicator of the ability to scale, fine or otherwise. \n\nYou open with you being a sci-fi author who wrote over half a million lines of code. That is another reason to open source - your self-stated creds don't lend themselves to confidence in the product. That's roughly 3x the codebase size of SQLite or Redis. At that size, you absolutely need good architecture. If those are skills you possess, whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, you might want to lead with that. \n\nAlso you don't mention anything about what what type of AI your platform does. AI is a big umbrella term and you could be talking about machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision...the list goes on and on.  Same thing with scalability - also a loaded term. What and how exactly are they looking to scale?  \n\nDo you have a paper that explains the approach with provable mathematics? That would be a good starting point for proving scalability that has nothing to do with static analysis lints or number of successful deployments.",

The architecture you're describing is genuinely interesting and the neuro-symbolic approach is increasingly well-regarded. I can also see where the hybrid routing approach would have merit for regulated industries.\n\nGentle push-back on one thing: \"proof is in my logs\" and \"complex causal interventions running in milliseconds\" demonstrate performance , not scalability. Different questions. Scalability is about behavior under concurrent load, growing data volumes, failure modes at scale, those types of things. Single-operation latency has no bearing on it. Your partners aren't wrong to ask about it, and the answer isn't in pylint scores or successful Railway deployments.\n\nUnderstand that's not a knock on what you've built. It's just a different question that needs a different kind of answer.\n\nAlso, and I say this with genuine respect, 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, months on end, ready to throw your laptop and rage-release to spite your partners. Not sustainable, and not a headspace to make good decisions about something you've invested this much in. The project will still be there after a week off. Your clarity and your relationships with your partners might not be if you keep pushing like this.\n\nThe work sounds legitimately interesting. Don't let burnout be the thing that derails it. And if possible, get that thing open sourced regardless. It can only benefit from multiple brains and eyeballs on it. Also you can let your partners know that open source does not mean it needs to be given away for free. Good luck!",

The model itself was not the only issue, it was the execution layer and how the agent interacted with the world.\n\nAs more teams experiment with agents that browse, click, monitor, or operate web based systems, the reliability of that execution layer becomes critical. Tools like hyperbrowser are interesting in that context because they focus on giving agents a stable, observable browser environment instead of assuming perfect APIs or clean data.\n\nFeels like the next wave of agent progress will be less about smarter models and more about better grounding and control in real environments.",

The thinking part is where most of them fall over.  \nWhat’s been more useful is using agents for the annoying research work people usually skip or rush. Stuff like figuring out what a company actually does now, whether they’re hiring for roles that imply a problem, if they’ve changed pricing, launched something new, or quietly shifted positioning.  \nI’ve been testing this with Clay, mostly because it lets you run those kinds of checks across a lot of companies without turning it into a custom engineering project. Not perfect, but way closer to something you can actually plug into a GTM workflow instead of babysitting prompts. Are you using agents for research, enrichment, categorization, etc., or is everyone still mostly focused on copy generation? What’s actually holding this back from being reliable?",

For instance, some organizations are leveraging AI agents to conduct comprehensive internet research efficiently, which can save time and enhance productivity.\n- A notable example is the development of a financial research agent that can break down complex questions into manageable research tasks, analyze results, and synthesize information from various sources. This approach allows for a more structured and thorough research process.\n- The use of AI agents for program repair and code suggestions also highlights their capability to handle specific tasks that require understanding and reasoning, rather than just generating text.\n- However, challenges remain in ensuring that these agents can reliably interpret and analyze data, as many still struggle with the \"thinking\" aspect of research, leading to inconsistencies in output quality.\n- The effectiveness of these agents often depends on the quality of the underlying models and the data they are trained on, which can limit their reliability in certain contexts.\n\nFor more insights on AI agents and their applications, you can refer to the following sources:\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)\n- [The Power of Fine-Tuning on Your Data: Quick Fixing Bugs with LLMs via Never Ending Learning (NEL)](https://tinyurl.com/59pxrxxb)",

My goal isn't to replace the decision-making process, but to compress the time spent hunting for PDUFA dates, digging through 10-Ks, and cross-referencing clinical trial endpoints.\n\n**The Architecture (and where it broke):** Initially, I built a multi-agent orchestration layer where specific agents were \"specialized\" for distinct domains:\n\n* **Clinical Scout:** Scraped and analyzed trial data.\n* **SEC Analyst:** Parsed filings and 8-Ks.\n* **Market Agent:** Handled flow data and transcripts.\n* **Orchestrator:** Synthesized these inputs into a final report.\n\n**The Problem: \"Ghost Data\"** While the architecture looked clean on paper, the practical output was dangerous. I was seeing a hallucination rate of nearly 60-70% in the early iterations. The agents weren't just missing data; they were confidently fabricating \"Ghost Trials\" or misattributing drug indications from one ticker to another. In biotech, where a single Phase 3 readout date is the entire thesis, this margin of error is unacceptable.\n\n**The Pivot: Deterministic Grounding** I realized that LLMs are excellent reasoning engines but terrible databases. I’ve since refactored the backend to rely on deterministic data fetching via hard APIs (SEC Edgar, [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/), and FMP for financials) *before* the LLM touches anything. The agents now function strictly as extractors and synthesizers, not as knowledge bases.\n\n**The Question:** For those of you building similar financial/biotech analysis tools:\n\n1. How are you handling the \"reasoning gap\" when APIs return incomplete data?\n2. Are you using a specific RAG pipeline to force citation of sources (e.g., page numbers in the 10-K)?\n\nI have a version running now that is significantly more reliable, but I'm looking to optimize the final 10% of data fetching. Any insights on architecture or specific API combinations for this sector would be appreciated.",

      "text": "I've built AI agents for over a dozen companies at this point. Different industries, different use cases, all kinds of complexity.\n\nAnd the thing that separates a demo from a production agent isn't how clever your prompts are.\n\nIt's what happens when the agent screws up.\n\nBecause it will screw up. A lot.\n\n**Every agent has three failure modes nobody talks about:**\n\n**1. The model gives you garbage.**\nEven GPT-4 or Claude will occasionally return malformed JSON, miss a required field, or just hallucinate a made-up function name.\n\nMost tutorials show you the happy path where everything works perfectly. In production, I spend more time handling the \"what if it doesn't work\" cases than I do building the actual agent logic.\n\nI wrap every single LLM call in validation. If the response doesn't match the expected structure, I don't just log an error and move on. I have the agent retry with a clarified prompt, or I route it to a human fallback.\n\n**2. Your tools break.**\nAn agent is only as reliable as the APIs it calls. And APIs go down, rate limit you, or return unexpected errors.\n\nI had an agent that would search a client's inventory database. One day, the database was under maintenance. The agent kept trying to call it, failing silently, and then telling users \"we don't have that product\" when they actually did.\n\nNow I build agents with explicit timeout handling and fallback responses. If a tool fails twice, the agent tells the user \"I'm having trouble reaching our system right now, let me get a human to help.\"\n\n**3. The user asks something you didn't plan for.**\nYour agent is designed to handle support tickets. A user asks \"What's the meaning of life?\"\n\nBad agents try to answer everything. They hallucinate. They go off the rails.\n\nGood agents know when to say \"I don't know\" or \"That's outside what I can help with.\"\n\nI build explicit guardrails into every agent. If the user's query doesn't match any of the agent's known domains, it politely declines instead of making stuff up.\n\n**The \"Production Checklist\" I use:**\n\nWhen I hand off an agent to a client, I make sure it has:\n\n- Input validation on every user message (check for malicious prompts, injection attempts)\n- Output validation on every LLM response (is the JSON valid? Are required fields present?)\n- Retry logic with exponential backoff when tools or APIs fail\n- A clear \"I don't know\" response for out-of-scope questions\n- Logging for every decision the agent makes (so we can debug later)\n- A human escalation path for when the agent gets stuck\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nI see a lot of developers build agents that work great in testing. Clean inputs, perfect API responses, users asking exactly the questions you expect.\n\nThen it goes live and within a day, something weird happens. A user types an emoji-filled rant. An API times out. The LLM returns a response in the wrong language.\n\nIf you didn't plan for that, your agent just broke. And your customer is now writing a bad review.\n\nThe boring stuff (error handling, validation, logging) is what makes an agent reliable enough to actually deploy. The prompting is the easy part.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? What's the weirdest failure mode you've seen in production?",

One thing I'd add to your checklist: implement circuit breakers for external API calls. When a service starts degrading, you want to fail fast rather than pile up retries that make things worse.\n\nAlso, for the 'user asks something unexpected' scenario - I've found that maintaining a confidence score on agent responses helps a lot. If confidence drops below a threshold, route to human or provide a graceful 'I'm not sure' response.\n\nThe weirdest failure I've seen? An agent that worked perfectly in English but completely broke when users switched to emojis mid-conversation. Turns out our JSON parsing couldn't handle certain unicode characters. Now we sanitize all inputs before processing.",

Not a hallucination problem, a “fallback lied” problem.\n\nCurious if your worst failures are more tool outage or more agent got clever and went off-script.",

No guessing, no “best effort” continuation.\nIt’s not flashy, but it reduced a whole class of bugs where the agent was technically correct at each step and still ended up somewhere it shouldn’t.\nCurious if others have seen this kind of “nothing failed, but everything drifted” behavior in production too.",

Error handling is easily the most underrated skill in building AI agents — and ironically, it’s the one thing that separates a “demo agent” from a “production-ready agent.”**\n\nMost people focus on prompting, but prompts only guide **ideal** behavior. Real users give messy inputs, APIs fail, data formats break, and edge cases appear that you never planned for. Without strong error handling, even the smartest agent collapses the moment something unexpected happens.\n\n# Example\n\nImagine building a LinkedIn outreach AI agent:\n\n**Ideal scenario:**\n\n* User provides a clean CSV → Agent reads → Sends messages → Tracks responses.\n\n**Reality:**\n\n* Missing fields\n* Wrong file format\n* LinkedIn rate limits\n* API timeouts\n* Duplicate contacts\n* Incomplete profile data\n\nA well-designed agent shouldn’t crash. It should **detect, correct, and continue**:\n\n* If CSV formatting is wrong → auto-clean\n* If a profile is missing data → skip or request fallback info\n* If LinkedIn blocks an action → wait, retry, or throttle\n* If messaging fails → log error and move to next task\n\nThis is what makes an agent *reliable* and not just “smart.”\n\n# Why it matters\n\nAI agents are basically mini-systems.  \nAnd any system is only as strong as its ability to recover from failure.\n\nPrompts create intelligence.  \nError handling creates **resilience**.\n\nWithout both, an agent can think — but it can’t work.",

Like asking what I should focus on today, or what tasks I forgot, or where's the random task I wrote down last week. I’ve used Notion, it’s fine for organizing, but the AI feels shallow when it comes to understanding tasks over time. I’ve also tried to use GPT for this but it doesn't feel like a task app.\n\nCurious if there’s anything that actually make day planning easier. Not looking for promo or “best tools” lists, just to hear your real experience, thanks.",

If there any investor meetings, check my email and provide some context.\"\n\n\"Can you go through my git repos and tell me which ones have uncommited changes?\"\n\n\"Read the monthly report draft in Confluence, come up with image ideas, then generate them.\"\n\nIt works really, really well. I'm building a version for the rest of my team to use.\n\nWhat you're asking for seems imminently doable. I'd start by installing OpenCode and either using their model or Claude if you're subscribed, and write an AGENTS.md file that talks about keeping a to do list, plus where things are. I think Notion has an API so you could tell it how to access that.\n\nThe trick is running it on your computer (so OpenCode or Claude Code or OpenAI Codex or equivalent) so it can modify files and access tools and so you can give it immediate relevant instructions and context.\n\nIf you're on Windows, I'd install WSL first and do it via that Linux environment.",

Useful, yes. Agents, not really.\n\nThe difference shows up the moment something unexpected happens. Real agents need to detect failure, reassess, and choose a different path instead of silently breaking or looping. That also means the environment matters a lot. When agents have to interact with real systems, running them in something predictable like hyperbrowser helps remove execution noise so you can actually tell whether the agent logic is adapting or just getting lucky.\n\nUntil systems can handle failure gracefully and explain why they chose the next action, most “AI automation” will stay closer to task runners than true agents.",

From the user side, it feels helpful for a few days, then you realize it forgot context or reshaped priorities without telling you why. That’s where it stops feeling like support and starts feeling unreliable. What worked better for me was lowering expectations, using AI to reflect or summarize what I already captured, not to decide what matters. The moment it confidently misses something you care about, you stop asking it for help. I’m curious if anyone has seen an agent that’s transparent about what it knows and what it doesn’t, because that gap is usually the problem.",

Everything else is just prompt glue on a to-do list. So far the only halfway reliable setups are custom stacks: store all tasks in a DB (Notion/Obsidian/SQLite), index them, then run a lightweight agent loop that re-scores/prioritizes daily based on deadlines/context.

          "text": "Oh wow - a question I feel like I'm qualified to answer.  I've been building voice agents for 7-ish years and working on CRM automation for almost 15 years.    \n  \nI spend most of my time these days creating automation strategies grounded in low risk, high value use cases and have clients ranging from high-tech semiconductor manufacturing to mom-and-pop cookie bakeries.\n\nHere are the categories I'd be considering...\n\n  \nVirtual Receptionist: \n\n  A voice virtual agent sits in front of your IVR / phone tree, and does stuff like connect people to their sales rep when they ask, or answers common questions without having to talk to a real person.  Customers appreciate these systems when they decrease customer effort to get issues resolved.  Companies get a finer grain of detail on why people are calling and how to help their customers more quickly.\n\n  Lot of vendors out there doing this - but if you're savvy you can build your own with tools like twilio, pipecat, and deepgram for less than $0.05 / minute.  You'll need to build out knowledge bases and automation capabilities to get the biggest lift out of this approach.\n\n  Hard savings around cost-per-call reduction and self-service containment (i.e. it costs $7 for a real person to handle this call, but an agent can do it for $1 - some % of the time.).  We typically look at inbound volumetric analysis (call volume by category) and cost-per-call reductions to create a defensible business case.  \n\nConversational Intelligence: \n\n  Learn trends across sales and service conversations, and react faster.  Analyzing transcripts for action items, deal risk, etc. and writing that back into the CRM system for rollup analysis.  Tools like gong, zoom revenue acclerator, etc. do this pretty well and also have capabilities to flag deals in the CRM that may be at risk, or reconcile forecasts against.\n\n  You can build your own in this category too - you'll need to record and transcribe calls, then vectorize the transcripts and do topic clustering.  Filling out forms based on transcripts is also really easy to do and high value for things like scorecards, discovery questionnaires, etc.  Most of your costs will be in LLM inference or TTS.\n\n  If you can connect those insights to operational improvements, you'll improve how employees respond to certain topic areas, like financial compliance reporting, or refund policies, based on trends identified across meeting or phone transcripts.  This can reduce customer frustration, trouble ticket creation, etc.\n\nHard savings around cross-sell/up-sell identification and close rates, customer lifetime value, and lead qualification / conversion rates (when applied correctly to improve ICP).  Basic math would be like \"If this allowed a rep to close 1 more deal in a year, would it be worth it?\"\n\nWhat DOESNT Work:\n\nPutting technology between you and your customers that doesn't reduce their effort, or give them a better, quicker solution to their problem.\n\nBuilding these systems out and not maintaining them.  They need fairly regular tuning, so factor that into your approach.\n\nTrying to automate conversations before you understand the best ways to navigate and solve them with your current people and processes.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\\-Charles",

Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!  \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor! \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content!\n5. Clay: 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.  ",

This makes it particularly effective for strategic planning and multi-step decision-making. You can learn more about it in the [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt).\n\n- Another impressive tool was the **TAO (Test-time Adaptive Optimization)** method, which allows for tuning large language models without needing labeled data. It leverages test-time compute and reinforcement learning to enhance model performance, making it a game-changer for enterprises looking to improve AI quality without extensive human input. More details can be found in the [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- The **Deep Research agent** also caught my attention. It can conduct comprehensive internet research quickly, synthesizing information from various sources to provide well-rounded answers. This agent exemplifies how AI can streamline research processes, making it a valuable asset for tasks requiring extensive information gathering. Check out more about it in the [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd).\n\nThese agents not only showcased advanced capabilities but also demonstrated practical applications that significantly improved efficiency and productivity.",

A small component in a bigger architecture ?  \nOnce I treated LLMs as a \"dumb\" stateless component that computes something, it clicked, ALUs compute math. LLMs compute cognition.\n\nWe built 70 years of computer architecture around math - registers, memory hierarchies, instruction sets, caching. All designed for how arithmetic actually works.\n\nBut for cognition? We're just throwing prompts at an API with some RAG glue and some AI pipelines and hope for the best.\n\nWhat if we need the same rigor for cognitive computation? Registers sized to attention decay limits.  \nMemory hierarchies designed for how LLMs actually retrieve and forget.  \nInstruction sets for cognitive operations like EXTRACT, CLASSIFY, DECIDE.\n\nI've been working through what this architecture could look like.  \nI think it's the missing layer between \"cool demo\" and \"actually reliable human AI collaboration.\"\n\nLooking to connect with others thinking at this level.",

Once you frame it as a stateless cognitive primitive instead of an autonomous mind, a lot of the weird behavior suddenly makes sense. Of course it forgets, of course it drifts, of course prompts stop working as tasks grow. We are asking a probabilistic function to act like an operating system.\n\nThe ALU analogy is a good one. We did not get reliable computing by making arithmetic smarter, we got it by building layers around it that constrained, cached, validated, and orchestrated it. Agents feel like they are stuck in the pre-OS era right now. Lots of raw capability, almost no discipline around state, memory, or control flow.\n\nOne thing that helped me think more clearly about this was separating cognition from execution entirely. Let the LLM decide, reason, and propose actions, but run execution inside a very deterministic environment with hard boundaries. When agents interact with real systems, putting that execution layer somewhere stable like hyperbrowser makes it obvious whether the failure is cognitive or architectural. Most of the time it is architectural.\n\nI think you are right that the missing layer is not better prompts, it is a cognitive architecture that treats LLMs as components, not protagonists. Curious to see where your work on registers and instruction sets for cognition leads.",

The other aspect is that if the systems aren’t auditable, there is no point to build them with AI and agents, because you have no real logging or observability. spent over a decade auditing ops, systems, processes, systems implementations and designs. I’m now designing based on over 15 years of things that break and seeing this across industries and orgs, public and private sector. \n\nWhat you are touching on now, is what many of the books on AI and Agent engineering have made clear around systems being key and thinking of the model differently… like when you want to embed a model in the code and how the bios deals with this. Anyways, could be worth digging into if you haven’t gone down the path of AI replacing the OS as we know it today. \n\nSaid differently? Why the hell do we still need software vendors or to be relegated to broken insecure systems that lead to worse tools and software and apps and such?\n\nIdeally all the legacy tech companies that have existed more than 30-40 years will implode because of all this and their failures to simply bolt it on.

The ALU analogy is brilliant - LLMs really should be viewed as cognitive computation units within a larger architecture.\n\n\n\nThe key insight here is that we're trying to bolt intelligence onto systems that weren't designed for stateful, context-aware operation. Just like you can't build a modern OS by strapping prompts onto assembly instructions.\n\n\n\nWhat excites me most is the idea of specialized \"cognitive instruction sets\" - operations like EXTRACT, CLASSIFY, DECIDE. This mirrors how we moved from general-purpose computing to domain-specific accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, etc.).\n\n\n\nWould love to hear more about your architecture work. Are you exploring things like hierarchical memory systems or attention-based state management?",

OpenAI Codex CLI**  \nAs of January 2026 I find the codex 5.2 model to be almost as good as Opus 4.5 for most tasks, but OpenAI give you much more usage on the $20 plan. So this is my daily driver at the moment. \n\n**3. Gemini CLI**  \nWith Gemini 3 Pro, the Gemini CLI is catching up to OpenAI and Anthropic. I'm mostly paying for a Google AI subscription (also around $20) to have access to NotebookLM with higher limits, but Gemini CLI is nice to have.   \n  \nIt's particularly good at frontend UI, and have access to this and the other 2 models because sometimes one gets the other unstuck. Rate limits are somewhere in the middle between OpenAI and Anthropic's limits.\n\n**4. Gamma (not sure if this really qualifies as an agent but listing anyway)**  \nI've stopped paying for this as I don't have to make presentations that often. But the couple of times I've had to make serious presentations at work, I've leaned on this quite a bit.   \n  \nAlthough in the last month or so GPT 5.2 and Opus 4.5 have gained the ability to directly create PPTs in their chat apps, so I would try those first before going back to Gamma.\n\n**5. Refresh Agent**  \nThis is a lesser known indie one, but it's great. It's essentially a marketing strategist agent that connects directly to your Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and also uses extra data sources for SEO (similar to Ahrefs / Semrush data) where it can also compare your site to competitors.   \n  \nAs a growth marketing manager I use this pretty much every day at work and it's made me look great when I can get quick insights to difficult marketing strategy questions. \n\n**6. Exopriors (again not really an agent but sort of)**  \nNot really sure how to describe this, but it's actually amazing. It's a combination of a massive vector datastore of high quality content (things like Hacker News, Arxiv papers, etc) plus a prompt for Claude Code to understand how to use it.   \n  \nIf you're trying to understand the AI space or doing marketing for tech, it's very powerful. There is also a free version you can try out literally just by pasting a prompt into Claude Code.   \n  \nOne of the examples from their site is \"What's been written about mesa-optimization since 2023 that isn't just rehashing Risks from Learned Optimization?\" where it then goes and writes a bunch of SQL queries and find that content using embeddings etc. The paid version essentially makes this more automated as you can setup alerts etc.",

Gamma: Great for automating making presentations! Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!  \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor! \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content!\n5. Clay: 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.  \n\nWould love to learn what others are baying for as well!",

This validates the theory that the real value is in specialized, workflow-integrated agents rather than broad LLM interfaces.\n\n\n\nAnyone here paying for voice agents or customer service automation?",

In that case you Can freely swap to gemini models, with the pro having its own limit. \n\nWhen pro and Claude models hit the limit, you Can still use gemini 3 flash thinking, which is still a great model. \n\nI do feel the agent and general quality is a bit higher in Cursor though. \n\nBiggest recommendation is going to the 5x plan on Claude using Claude code.

Not ones that auto reply to everything, but agents that triage, summarize long threads, and draft responses so I’m never starting from scratch. That alone saves mental energy every day.\n\nFor travel or food, I trust agents more as filters than deciders. I like when an agent narrows options based on constraints and context, then lets me choose. When those agents pull real availability, prices, or menus from the web in a stable way, they become much more useful. That’s where reliable browsing matters. If an agent can actually check current info through a predictable setup like hyperbrowser instead of guessing, I’m far more likely to trust the suggestion.\n\nOverall, most people still default to ChatGPT style chats, but agents start to feel valuable when they handle background work continuously. The moment you stop thinking “I need to ask the AI” and just get a helpful nudge or summary, that’s when daily life agents really click.",

It's really good at making agents that actually talk to each other and work together. Has like 44k stars on GitHub so people clearly like it.\n\n**CrewAI** \\- This one's blowing up right now. The whole idea is you build a \"crew\" of agents with different roles - like one does research, one writes, one edits. It's hit 900k downloads which is kinda nuts. Super Python-friendly.\n\n**Devin AI** \\- Okay this one's wild. It's basically an AI junior developer that can actually code for you, has its own terminal and browser, and can deploy stuff. Not gonna lie, it's a bit scary how good it is.\n\n**The No-Code Options:**\n\n**Flowise** \\- Drag and drop interface, works with a ton of different AI models. Perfect if you're not trying to become a coding wizard but still want to build cool stuff.\n\n**Zapier Central** \\- If you're already using Zapier, this is a no-brainer. Connect your AI agents to literally thousands of apps. No coding needed.\n\n**Botpress** \\- Great for chatbots specifically. Low-code, pretty intuitive.\n\n**The Enterprise Stuff:**\n\n**Qodo** \\- Built for companies with complex setups. Handles multiple repos and complicated workflows without breaking a sweat.\n\n**Vertex AI** \\- Google's offering. It's their full ML platform, so it's got everything but might be overkill if you're just tinkering.\n\n**Worth Mentioning:**\n\n**SuperAGI** \\- Has a nice GUI, production-ready **Voiceflow** \\- If you want voice assistants, not just text **AgentFlow** \\- Wraps a bunch of other tools together in one platform\n\n**Real talk:** The space is moving FAST. What's hot right now is multi-agent systems (agents working together) and tools that are actually ready for real products, not just demos. Also, seeing a split between \"I want to code everything\" tools and \"just let me drag and drop\" tools.\n\nIf you're just starting? Go with CrewAI or Flowise depending on if you code or not. If you're building something serious? LangChain is probably your friend, even though the docs can be annoying sometimes.\n\nThe whole vibe in 2026 is that this stuff is finally getting production-ready instead of just being cool demos.",

But when it came to execution, they just kept talking. Gemini even started hallucinating brand names that weren't in the data. They feel more like \"talkers\" than \"doers\" for heavy data.\n•   Skywork (Sheet Agent): This one actually finished the data entry and gave me a usable file without the lecture. The \"Deep Research\" mode is great for finding those missing sources, but man, it is slow. \n•   Perplexity Pro: Actually managed to export a decent table after some prompting. It’s fast and the web-search is solid, but the formatting was a bit basic and I had to manually fix some of the multi-language headers.\n•   Claude 3.5: The logic was the cleanest, but it refused to crawl for the live info I was missing. It's an amazing editor, but it won't do the \"researcher\" labor for you.\n\nAs for me,  I’ll take a slow agent that actually executes over a fast chatbot that just talks about the work.

Alot of the robots you guys say are AI,  pretty much run the same way as some of these home made pc gaming bots.. \nSo what changed really? Not much, if these ai agents from google, openai etc just run like our botted pc game characters then it all makes sense. \n\nI first tought the main diffrence was access permissions to system it runs on, that an agent had more control over itsself and is \"aware\" that its a bot, however that sounds cookoo. And adding  code to my bot so it becomes smarter is just natural progression. Not sure a name change helps it..\n\n\nThen the diffrence between what the market calls an agent today and what you could call one of my botted characters(you cant tell its not another player)*(its a true bot), it does exactly what i expect it to do, it can make decisions on its own, if lay out potential paths.  \n\nif my bot script in game would become more advanced and more self running to the point where it would just become a digital friend of mine, i still probably wouldnt call it an agent, idk i think we are shaping the diffrences between agent and bot right now and im not sure why i would change definition from bot to agent anywhere.",

Many users share your frustration with tools that excel in providing strategies but fall short in execution. Here are some points to consider based on your experience:\n\n- **Execution vs. Strategy**: Many LLMs, including popular ones, often focus on generating plans or strategies rather than performing the actual tasks. This can lead to a disconnect when users need straightforward execution, like cleaning data.\n\n- **Performance Variability**: Different tools have varying strengths. For instance, while some may provide excellent logical reasoning or planning, they might not be equipped to handle the nitty-gritty of data manipulation or research tasks effectively.\n\n- **User Experience**: It seems that tools like Skywork and Perplexity Pro are closer to what you're looking for, as they manage to execute tasks, albeit with some limitations. The balance between speed and execution depth is a common concern among users.\n\n- **Future Developments**: As AI continues to evolve, there may be more tools that strike that balance you're seeking—efficient execution with robust capabilities.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about how AI can be utilized for specific tasks without the need for extensive human labeling, you might find insights in discussions around new model tuning techniques that leverage existing data effectively.

      "text": "This is post I made purely to provide value and explain to everyone in detail how I did it. Hope it clears things up!\n\n**What it is**\n\nNikolytics Radio is a late-night jazz station for founders who work too late. 3-hour YouTube videos. AI-generated jazz. A tired DJ named Sonny Nix who checks in between tracks with deadpan observations about your inbox, your pipeline, and why that proposal is still sitting in drafts.\n\nFive volumes in five days. 70+ subscribers. Over 200k views on the first Reddit post.\n\nIt's a passion project that doubles as marketing for my automation consultancy.\n\n-----\n\n**The concept**\n\nThe pitch: You're at your desk at 3 AM. Everyone's asleep. You put on Nikolytics Radio. A weathered voice observes your situation with dark humor. He's been where you are. He doesn't fix it. He just... sees it. Then plays a record.\n\nThe DJ (Sonny Nix) is a former founder who burned out and now plays jazz for strangers. He has recurring \"listeners\" who write in: Todd from Accounting whose job got automated, Margaret from Operations who finished her task list and doesn't know what to do with herself.\n\nIt's 95% vibe, 5% branding. If you removed every mention of my business, the station would still work. That's the point.\n\n-----\n\n**The tech stack**\n\n**Music generation:** Suno\n\nI wrote 49 artist-specific prompts optimized for deep work. Each prompt targets a specific jazz style piano trio, cool trumpet, tenor ballad, etc. Settings: Instrumental only, ~3-4 min tracks, specific mood tags.\n\nExample prompt structure:\n\n    jazz, 1950s late-night jazz combo: brushed kit, upright bass walking gently, \n    warm felted piano carrying the main theme, soft brass pads... \n    [mood tags: soft, warm, slow, lounge, nostalgic]\n\nGenerate 3-4 per prompt, pick the best, discard anything too busy or with abrupt endings.\n\n**Voice generation:** ElevenLabs\n\nCustom voice clone for Sonny Nix. I use their V3 model with specific audio tags:\n\n- `[mischievously]` - dry humor, irony\n- `[whispers]` - punchlines, gut punches\n- `[sighs]` - weariness\n- `[excited]` - mock ads only (ironic use)\n- `...` - pauses\n\nV3 doesn't support some tags like [warm] or [tired], so the *words* have to carry the emotion. Write tired sentences. Sorrowful observations.\n\n**Script writing:** txt\n\nI mostly write the scripts, claude double checks for optimizations\n\n**Assembly:** Logic Pro\n\n120 BPM grid. Drop the tracks, drop the voice clips. Crossfade. Each episode is ~30 drops across 3 hours. Export as MP3.\n\n**Video:** FFmpeg\n\nStatic image + audio. One command:\n\n    ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage \n    -c:a aac -b:a 320k -shortest output.mp4\n\n-----\n\n**The writing system**\n\nEach episode has 30 \"drops\" - short DJ segments between songs:\n\n- **Station IDs** - Quick brand hits (\"Nikolytics Radio... still here.\")\n- **Bumpers** - One-liners (\"The coffee's cold. You noticed an hour ago. Still drinking it.\")\n- **Pain points** - Observations that hit too close (\"Revision eight. The scope tripled. The budget didn't.\")\n- **Testimonials** - Fictional listeners writing in\n- **Mock ads** - Parody sponsor segments (\"Introducing Scope Creep Insurance...\")\n- **Dedications** - \"This one goes out to everyone who almost quit today...\"\n- **Recurring segments** - Pipeline Weather, Outreach Report, Inbox Conditions\n\nThe key insight: Sonny has emotional range. He's not monotone. He moves between tired, mischievous, sorrowful. He worries about Todd. He offers brief sympathy to Sarah. Then plays a record.\n\n-----\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **The vibe is the moat.** Most automation consultants are boring. This is different enough that people share it.\n2. **Worldbuilding compounds.** Todd's promotion arc. Margaret's puzzle. Callbacks like \"Here it's always 3 AM.\" Returning listeners feel like regulars.\n3. **Reddit got it started.** First post on r/productivity got 14k views. Someone called it \"Slop Radio FM.\" Now that's a badge of honor we reference in the show.\n4. **Daily uploads built momentum.** Five volumes in five days. The algorithm likes consistency.\n\n-----\n\n**What I learned about AI voice**\n\n- ElevenLabs V3 is good but literal. It interprets quotes as character voices (breaks everything). Always paraphrase.\n- Tags only work if the model supports them. No [warm], no [tired]. The text has to do the work.\n- Regenerate 2-3x per drop, pick the best take. Same script, different reads.\n- Punchlines land in `[whispers]`. Setup is `[mischievously]`. Then stop - no extra lines after the joke lands.\n\n-----\n\n**Time investment**\n\n- Initial setup (prompts, character docs, templates): ~15 hours\n- Per episode now: ~2 hours\n  - Generate music: 30 min\n  - Generate voice drops: 30 min\n  - Assembly in Logic: 30 min\n  - YouTube upload + description: 30 min\n\n**What could be automated further**\n\n- **Voice generation** - Currently pasting drops one by one into ElevenLabs. Could batch via API.\n- **Timestamps** - Calculating from bar positions manually. Already wrote a Python script, could integrate it.\n- **YouTube description** - Template exists, still copy-pasting. Easy n8n automation.\n- **Episode assembly** - The real bottleneck. Logic Pro is manual drag-and-drop. Exploring scripted alternatives.\n\nWriting stays mine.\n\nThe dream: one-click episode generation. Not there yet, but the pieces exist.\n\nAfter getting the desired results and I train the AI enough to understand how everything is supposed to work, it will be automated. I need it to be perfectly in sync with my concept.\n\n-----\n\n**Link in the comment**\n\nHappy to answer questions about the workflow, the writing system, or the Suno/ElevenLabs settings.\n\n-----\n\n**TL;DR:** Built a fake radio station with AI music (Suno), AI voice (ElevenLabs), and my scripts. The DJ has a character bible. There's lore. It's marketing for my automation business but also just... a thing that exists now. 70 subscribers in 5 days.\n",

This project is essentially my attempt of making the brand stand out by character, while simultaniously showing automation at work (soon I hope, if I figure out the best way to maintain the quality of the writing). And there at the background is 5% of marketing for Nikolytics - subtle and funny jokes about real pain points which work even if nikolytics.com is not mentioned. \n2. I was lucky enough to have the whole thing work out waaay smoother than I originally thought it was gonna go. The idea was there, I sat down, didn't sleep for a day, and finished the whole concept. Not going to lie, this was one of the only projects I've ever done that went as smooth as this. If I had to nitpick, I'd say it took me around 7 hours to get the Sonny persona as I imagined it. I couldn't visualize in my head what I wanted Sonny to *feel* like.. So I iterated, and iterated, until I was happy with the actual tone of the things he says (the style of writing).\n3. As of right now, Claude can do my writing at 70% of my liking, each episode gives it better inputs, and the outputs get better linearly. So I have a feeling it's gonna be able to do it. One thing is that I'm always trying to use callbacks and interact with the community, so I'm currently developing scrapers and workflows that can dig out the relevant interactions and comments. I don't have enough time to dedicate to this project since my consultancy is booming with clients. But this is the long game I'm playing!\n\nHope I clarified some things for you, and if you have any other questions or want any other insights into the project, I'm more than happy to share!",

      "text": "Finding the best AI companies 2026 is no longer just about who has the largest GPU cluster. In the European market, the shift has moved from simple chatbots to sophisticated autonomous agents. These agents don't just talk; they reason, use tools, and execute multi-step workflows with minimal human oversight. The European landscape is unique because it balances high-speed innovation with a deep-seated commitment to ethics in AI and data sovereignty. It’s an environment where custom AI solutions are built to survive strict regulations while delivering massive ROI through automation.\n\nThe Vanguard of European AI Engineering\n\nChoosing a partner in this space requires looking past the marketing gloss. The real players are those effectively handling RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and complex LLM integration services.\n\n1. Mistral AI (France): Often cited as the European answer to OpenAI, they provide the backbone for many agentic workflows. Their focus on efficiency makes them a top choice for developers needing high-performance models that can be hosted locally.\n2. DeepMind (UK): While part of Google, their London-based research remains the gold standard for machine learning and neural networks that push the boundaries of what autonomous agents can actually achieve in scientific and enterprise fields.\n3. Beetroot (Sweden/Ukraine): This is where the bridge between high-level strategy and execution happens. Beetroot stands out by combining a \"Lagom\" (balanced) Swedish management style with high-velocity engineering. They are particularly adept at building autonomous agents developers Europe needs for practical business cases, focusing on sustainable team scaling and long-term scalability.\n4. ElevenLabs (UK/Poland): Though famous for voice, their orchestration of AI agents that can interact naturally is setting new benchmarks for UX in the agentic space.\n5. Celonis (Germany): They aren’t just a data company anymore. By integrating AI agents into process mining, they allow enterprises to automate the \"fixing\" of business bottlenecks autonomously.\n6. 10Clouds (Poland): A strong contender in the AI agent development Europe scene, specifically for those looking to integrate LangChain and complex LLM stacks into existing products.\n7. Silo AI (Finland): As one of the largest private AI labs in Europe, they specialize in \"flagship\" AI projects, often building bespoke agents for heavy industry and telecommunications.\n8. STX Next (Poland): Known for their Python roots, they have pivoted heavily into agentic workflows, focusing on making Generative AI work within legacy enterprise architectures.\n9. Wayve (UK): Taking agents into the physical world. Their work on autonomous mobility shows how agents can handle real-world uncertainty using \"embodied\" AI.\n10. DeepL (Germany): While focused on translation, their recent API expansions allow agents to act as seamless multilingual intermediaries, a crucial component for global European brands.\n\nThe secret sauce for most of these companies is how they handle the reasoning layer. By using frameworks like LangChain or proprietary orchestration engines, they create a loop where the AI can check its own work. So, when looking for a partner, the question shouldn't be \"can you use an LLM?\" but rather \"can you build an agent that knows when it’s wrong?\"",

Foundation model labs (they power agents, but don’t usually “build your agent” end-to-end)\n2. Agent platforms / products (you buy a system)\n3. Implementation partners / dev shops (you hire a team to ship + integrate)\n\nIf the question is “who can actually deliver production agents in Europe?”, I’d shortlist like this:\n\nA) Model + sovereign deployment (EU-first constraints)\n\n* Mistral (FR)\n* Aleph Alpha (DE)\n\nB) Enterprise agent platforms (CX / voice / contact center)\n\n* Cognigy (DE)\n* PolyAI (UK)\n* Parloa (DE)\n* ElevenLabs (US, with major presence in UK/EU) — voice infra + “agent workflows”, depending on scope\n\nC) Orchestration / workflow automation (agentic automation in practice)\n\n* n8n (Berlin) — great glue layer when “agent” really means *multi-system automation*\n* Celonis (DE) — strong when the agent needs process context + enterprise ops\n\nD) Implementation partners (build + integrate + maintain)\n\n* 10Clouds (PL)\n* STX Next (PL)\n* Beetroot (SE/UA) (more generalist, but can execute well with the right spec)\n* Silo AI (FI) is legit historically, but note it’s now under AMD.\n\nAlso: DeepMind is research (world-class, but not a typical “agent dev company”), and DeepL is amazing but mostly a vertical product.\n\nBrand matters less than proof. I’d ask any vendor to show:\n\n* their eval harness (how they measure “agent success” + catch regressions)\n* tooling/permissions model (least-privilege, audit logs)\n* observability (traces, retries, human-in-the-loop points)\n* post-launch ownership (who maintains prompts/tools/data pipelines)\n\nHope this helps even a little.",

Here are the ones that stood out:\n\n1. Resolving common support questions automatically: AI agents like Sierra and Intercom's fin has helped us reduce support load by 50% by auto resolving already asked/frequently asked questions. It can also connect with internal services and answer questions like package tracking etc\n2. Data driven content creation & repurposing: Stuff like analyzing content gaps on Google search console to improve google ranking and creating content for this has been completely automated using AI agents like Frizerly for us! The key is ensuring the agent is plugged into all your data sources including customer case studies, product data etc! Its pretty cool how it can auto publish blogs on our website and then cross post then automatically on social media  etc!\n3. A/B testing ads: AI agents like Plai has been able to automate a/b testing ads including image assets for us! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved!",

      "text": "A lot of people are disappointed after building their first “AI agent.” It works in a demo… then collapses the moment you try to run it twice, scale it, or trust it with real work.\n\nThe failure usually isn’t the model. It’s the **architecture**.\n\nMost agent projects fail because they’re built like *chatbots with tools* instead of **agent-native systems**. There’s a big difference.\n\nHere are a few patterns that actually matter if you want something resembling a Digital FTE:\n\n**1. Agents should execute specs, not vibes**  \nIn reliable systems, agents don’t just “figure it out.” They operate against explicit specifications: inputs, outputs, constraints, and success criteria. This makes behavior repeatable and auditable instead of probabilistic chaos.\n\n**2. Orchestration is a control plane, not a loop**  \nA simple `while(true)` agent loop is not orchestration. Real orchestration decides:\n\n* which agent runs\n* with what context\n* under what conditions\n* and when to stop or escalate\n\nWithout this, you don’t have a worker — you have an infinite prompt generator.\n\n**3. State must survive the model**  \nIf all your state lives inside the LLM context window, your agent is amnesic. Agent-native systems treat state as external and persistent so work can resume, be inspected, or be corrected later.\n\n**4. Tools > text**  \nMature agents spend most of their time calling tools, not generating prose. The model reasons *about* actions; the system executes actions deterministically. This is how you reduce hallucinations and increase trust.\n\n**5. Failure paths are first-class**  \nHuman workers escalate when something is unclear. Digital FTEs need the same behavior. If your agent never says “I’m unsure,” it’s not autonomous — it’s dangerous.\n\nNone of this is flashy, but this is the difference between:\n\n* “Cool demo”\n* and “Something you can actually deploy”\n\nI’m still building and learning in this space, but the biggest takeaway so far is this: **agent systems look more like distributed systems than prompt engineering**.\n\nCurious how others here are thinking about agent reliability and orchestration — especially outside toy examples.",

The biggest trap I see is people treating Agents as 'Chatbots with tools'.\n\nIn my experience, for an agent to actually be reliable in production, the LLM should be the smallest part of the architecture. The real work is in the orchestration layer, state management, and strict output validation.\n\nIf you rely on the model to 'figure out' the flow, it fails. You need to treat the LLM as a fuzzy processor inside a rigid code structure, not the other way around.",

Once you treat the LLM as a probabilistic planner and not the execution engine, the architecture choices become way more obvious.\n\nThe point about state surviving the model is huge. If you cannot inspect, rewind, or resume work, you are basically running a fancy autocomplete loop and hoping it behaves. Failure paths are another one people skip because demos never show escalation.\n\nI like the framing that agent systems look closer to distributed systems than prompt engineering.

Reliability comes from enforcement, not better prompts.\n\nThe “state surviving the model” point is where most projects quietly fail. If you can’t explain why a step was allowed, blocked, or escalated after the fact, you don’t really have an agent — you have a one-shot suggestion generator with memory loss.\n\nFailure paths are the tell. Real systems assume disagreement, uncertainty, and interruption as the default, not the edge case. If escalation isn’t structurally possible, autonomy is just optimism.\n\nTotally agree on the distributed systems comparison. Once you start thinking in terms of contracts, invariants, and commit boundaries, prompt quality becomes almost secondary.",

The PDF to Markdown step is doing most of the heavy lifting there, preserving document structure before you chunk it.\n\nOne thing I'd watch out for is how clean your Markdown conversion actually is. PDFs can be messy and tables, headers, or multi-column layouts often get mangled during extraction. You might be losing important structural information that your recursive chunking strategy depends on. What does your parsed content look like before chunking? Sometimes what looks like a chunking problem is actually upstream in the parsing step.\n\nThe hybrid retrieval setup sounds comprehensive. Dense embeddings for semantic similarity, sparse for exact matches. That's the right approach, especially with local models where you want to squeeze every bit of performance out of retrieval before hitting the LLM.\n\nI've been building document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev that focuses on this exact pipeline visibility problem. Being able to see what your docs look like after each transformation step before you commit to the full pipeline. The recursive chunking works great when the input is clean, but it's hard to debug when something goes sideways in preprocessing.\n\nHow are you handling metadata propagation from parent to child chunks? That's where a lot of context gets lost even with good chunking strategies.",

              "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful feedback — you're absolutely right that upstream Markdown conversion quality determines how effective hierarchical chunking can be. Poorly parsed Markdown (especially with tables, headers, or multi-column layouts) will manifest as a chunking problem downstream when it's actually a parsing issue upstream.\n\nIn this repo, the PDF → Markdown step uses a PyMuPDF-based approach, and the README explicitly suggests that you can replace that with other tools if needed (e.g., Docling, PaddleOCR, VLM-based extractors) precisely because PDF parsing can be messy and document-dependent. The conversion notebook (`pdf_to_md.ipynb`) outputs plain Markdown before chunking and preserves header structure (H1/H2/H3) so that the hierarchical parent/child indexing strategy can work reliably. \n\n**Importantly, the notebook includes detailed guidance on validating and cleaning the Markdown output before it enters the chunking pipeline.** I walk through what to look for in the parsed output—malformed tables, broken header hierarchies, misaligned columns—and suggest validation steps to catch when the conversion has degraded quality. This visibility into the intermediate representation is critical: if your Markdown is garbage, no retrieval strategy will save you downstream.\n\nOn **metadata propagation**: the design in this repo explicitly keeps parent chunk metadata (including original document context, section headers, filename, etc.) attached to child chunks. When child chunks are indexed, their parent ID and full metadata are stored so that when the agent decides to fetch parent chunks for additional context, it can reconstitute the broader context while retaining provenance. That propagation is foundational to the hierarchical retrieval strategy here.\n\nRegarding **retrieval**: the system implements a hybrid retrieval setup (dense + sparse) with child chunks for precision and parent chunks for context — exactly the strategy you mentioned. The agent evaluates whether the child chunk results are sufficient and only then retrieves the larger parent chunks. This helps balance precision versus context without overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant tokens.\n\nIf PDF parsing quality is the bottleneck in your use case, here are some practical steps (which I detail in the notebook):\n\n1. **Validate/inspect the intermediate Markdown output before chunking** — the repo includes that inspection step explicitly so you can see what's actually fed into the indexer and catch structural issues early.\n\n2. **Swap the Markdown converter** to one that better handles your document types (Docling for complex layouts, OCR + structuring pipelines, or even VLM-based conversions for visually complex documents).\n\n3. **Preserve relevant metadata at the PDF → Markdown stage** so it flows through into chunk metadata and enables better filtering and retrieval downstream.\n\nOverall, your point is absolutely valid: robust parsing is a foundational step, and improving that layer will make hierarchical chunking genuinely effective rather than masking upstream errors as retrieval issues. The modularity in this repo is designed precisely to let you swap and validate each transformation step before committing to the full pipeline.",

The PyMuPDF approach works fine for straightforward documents, but you're right to call out the modularity for swapping converters. I've seen too many projects where the PDF parsing becomes the bottleneck and everything downstream suffers.\n\nThe parent metadata propagation design sounds clean. Keeping that provenance chain intact while the agent decides whether to pull broader context is the right balance. That decision logic where it evaluates child chunk sufficiency before fetching parents is smart, especially with local models where token efficiency matters more than with API calls.\n\nOne thing I'm curious about is how you handle cases where the hierarchical structure in the original PDF doesn't map cleanly to your H1/H2/H3 expectations. Academic papers, technical reports, legal docs often have weird nested structures or inconsistent heading styles. Does the validation step catch those edge cases, or do you end up with flat chunking as a fallback?",

Also, don't forget to ask them for \"negative constraints\"—what *not* to touch—becuase that's where the real money is saved on debugging later.\n\nQuick question: when you're using Gemini or the others, do you find they're better at explaining the \"why\" of a 5-year-old function, or do they mostly just guess based on the syntax?

You don’t start with that many as much as you can scale to that and actually support up to a million concurrent agents, but the key is the emergent issues and bottlenecks as you scale. Everyone relies on rag or semantic memory, or some basic combination, and not an entire system unto itself. further, many don’t look at this as a holistic system of memory, reasoning, governance, ontology, and orchestration. further, most don’t understand business systems and operations much less all the processes and how they integrate. further these monolithic poc/mvp/prototypes will not scale or be sustainable, because they reinvent the wheel every single time, and basically just use Python for everything. \n\nSo many books out there go into the many aspects of this. No one seems to be reading these or reasearch papers daily in addition to then testing and determining the practical implementations that work and can scale. \n\nFinally, even if orgs have something good, their tech debt, lack of data governance and broken processes and systems rapidly surface and lead to failed implementation and rollout, because orgs won’t literally CHANGE THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS AND OPERATING MODELS ACROSS THE ORG, IN PARALLEL AT THE SAME TIME. They want to roll it out the same old way, as if this is an ERP, and end up missing the boat completely. And this is where we are with most of this.

These contain things like personality, user information, company policy, scratch pads, emotions, projects to teach, to do lists, basically whatever you want. These are \"notebooks of the mind\" that you or the agent can manage.

The agents have access to the right systems, data, and policies.\n\nWhat’s missing is **decision context**.\n\nMost enterprise systems record outcomes, not reasoning. They store that a discount was approved or a ticket was escalated, but not *why* it happened. The context lives in Slack threads, meetings, or individual memory.\n\nI was thinking about this again after reading Jaya Gupta’s article on **context graphs**, which describes the same gap. A context graph treats decisions as first-class data by recording the inputs considered, rules evaluated, exceptions applied, approvals taken, and the final outcome, and linking those traces to entities like accounts, tickets, policies, agents, and humans.\n\nThis gap is manageable when humans run workflows because people reconstruct context from experience. It becomes a hard limit once agents start acting inside workflows. Without access to prior decision reasoning, agents treat similar cases as unrelated and repeatedly re-solve the same edge cases.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this isn’t something existing systems of record are positioned to fix. CRMs, ERPs, and warehouses store state before or after decisions, not the decision process itself. Agent orchestration layers, by contrast, sit directly in the execution path and can capture decision traces as they happen.\n\nAt scale, agent reliability depends less on model intelligence and more on whether past decisions are actually remembered.",

If you want to avoid expensive complexity, try adding a simple \"rationale\" field to your existing tickets first. Let the humans type one sentence on why they broke the rule or took a specific path. It's a bit of a slog, but it builds a goldmine for the agent later. Also, try \"shadowing\" where the agent just watches and predicts the reasoning before it's allowed to act. It's much cheaper than building a full context graph on day one becuase you find out what actually matters. Are you planning to pull those Slack threads into a vector DB, or just have the agent ask a human when it gets stuck? It'd be a shame to build a fancy system liek that if the real context is just buried in one guy's head.",

You can’t really replace an entire workflow with a standalone agent today, at least not reliably.\n\nWhat’s worked better for us is being very deliberate about scope. Sometimes we build more general agents (search is a good example) where users are heavily involved. Other times we automate very specific parts of a workflow with custom agents. In those cases, we spend a lot of time upfront figuring out what problem we’re actually solving, where the real gaps are, and what should stay human-in-the-loop.\n\nSometimes the gap is solved with humans, sometimes with integrations, and sometimes we just make the limitation explicit and let users bridge it. That approach has been working far better than trying to fully automate everything end to end. I also agree that a lot of AI products fail because they’re too generalized. Enterprise AI usually needs custom workflows, agents, and deep integration with existing (often legacy) systems. That’s where the super generalized enterprise solutions tend to fall apart.\n\nAnyway, fingers crossed — I’m still optimistic that as memory and context handling get better, a lot of this becomes more manageable at scale. We’re clearly not there yet, but it feels directionally solvable.",

This tool is designed specifically for extracting data from Glassdoor, including job listings.\n\n- **Set Up Your Scraper**:\n  - Create an account on Apify for free.\n  - Add the URLs of the Glassdoor pages you want to scrape into the scraper's input fields. You can include various types of pages such as job postings, company reviews, etc.\n  \n- **Start the Scraping Process**: Once your URLs are set, click the \"Start\" button to begin scraping. The tool will run and extract the data you need.\n\n- **Export the Data**: After the scraping process is complete, you can export the data in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or XML. This makes it easy to feed the data into your AI SDR.\n\n- **Automation**: If you're looking to scrape at a larger scale, consider automating the process using Apify Actors, which can schedule and manage your scraping tasks efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the tutorial on how to scrape Glassdoor [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j6u272j).",

      "text": "There’s a quiet shift happening in how AI agents reason and its not about bigger models. The real evolution is moving from basic RAG, to agentic systems and now toward agentic RAG combined with knowledge graphs and reinforcement learning. Traditional RAG works well for fast, relevant answers, but it struggles when questions require structure or multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG improves this by adding planning and memory so agents can re-query, coordinate tools and reason across steps, yet its still limited by chunk-based retrieval. Graph-based approaches change the game by organizing knowledge as entities and relationships, then letting agents reason over that structure step by step and improve through reinforcement signals. The result is higher factual accuracy, better context retention and true multi-hop reasoning, which matters in research and enterprise settings. The key insight is that these architectures aren’t competing but complementary: simple RAG for speed, agentic RAG for coordination and graph-based systems for deep, structured knowledge.",

It's liek building a library where the books keep moving themselves.\n\nMy advice: 1. Keep your vector DB for the easy stuff. 2. Only map the \"entities\" that actually matter for your logic. 3. Watch your latency, becuase agents love to talk in circles when the graph gets messy.

I bring this up because recently I been thinking about building a SDK(or hosted service?), that does the bulk of this work for you and wondering if it would be a useful endeavor.\n\nTBH prolly will do this anyways because I have severe ADD and this is my new shiny object. Reason why is that we have built a lot of this infra in our existing app, and turning into SDK just sort of makes sense to me.\n\nAnyways want to get your thoughts or if you think it is impossible to standardize, or maybe there are already too many agent frameworks out there or any reasons on why it is a bad idea to do this.",

Many of the tasks you've outlined are indeed repetitive and can consume a lot of time and resources. Here are some thoughts on your idea of creating an SDK or hosted service to streamline this process:\n\n- **Standardization Potential**: There is definitely room for standardization in the AI agent space. Many developers face similar challenges, and a well-designed SDK could save time and reduce redundancy.\n  \n- **Existing Solutions**: While there are frameworks and platforms that address some of these needs, they often require significant customization. A solution that provides a more integrated approach could fill a gap in the market.\n\n- **Focus on Flexibility**: Ensure that your SDK allows for flexibility and customization. Different projects may have unique requirements, and a one-size-fits-all approach might limit its appeal.\n\n- **Community Feedback**: Engaging with the developer community could provide valuable insights. Gathering feedback on what features are most needed could help shape your SDK.\n\n- **Market Demand**: Assessing the demand for such a solution is crucial. If many developers express similar frustrations, it could indicate a viable market for your product.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this further, consider looking into existing frameworks and identifying what they lack. This could help you create a more compelling offering.",

This can lead to a scenario where only exceptional work is recognized, leaving mediocre efforts overlooked.\n- In essence, while AI can facilitate the shipping of work, it also demands a higher standard of quality and originality to capture attention and be taken seriously.\n\nFor further insights on the implications of AI in various domains, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h)\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)",

      "text": "I’ve been building and testing AI agents over the past year, and the industry is evolving so quickly that keeping up can feel impossible. Instead of focusing only on technical frameworks, I grouped tools by how much setup or coding effort they require. Here’s a practical list based on my experience.\n\nNo / Low-Code Tools (Great for Fast Deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no code AI agent focused on execution rather than complex setup. You simply describe or demonstrate the task, and it performs the actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than configuring automation, making it ideal for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflow creation and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be challenging for beginners, but it’s very powerful once set up.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors without writing much code, but still tweak if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, though requiring the desktop app can be restrictive for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Early stage but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n***High Code / Developer Focused Tools***\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for using Claude models directly. Powerful if you’re already in the Anthropic ecosystem, though integration options are limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is updated frequently and maintained actively. Great for developers wanting robust integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph / LangChain / LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the existing Lang ecosystem. Best for those familiar with Lang tools, offering easy observability and several integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nHighly abstracted framework that allows flexibility across models and ecosystems. Suitable for developers who prefer model agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nAn early entrant in autonomous agents. Popular for its history, though maintenance is limited. Best for experimentation and learning purposes.\n\nCurious to hear what tools others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms that you’ve found practical in 2026?",

The no‑code platforms feel more like delegation (you describe the task, it executes), while the high‑code ones are closer to building a system from scratch where you define the logic and observability.\n\nWhat I’m curious about is how these tools evolve beyond “execution engines” into something that manages relationships and memory. Dashboards give you data, but agents are starting to act like collaborators. That shift changes not just the technical stack but how we design workflows around them.\n\nPersonally I’ve been experimenting with CrewAI and LangFlow for quick prototyping, then moving into LangGraph when I want more control.

I’ve done it for myself extensively and now for a handful of companies… some extremely large (tens of millions of documents). \n\nI realized early that some form of RAG is needed by literally every company in the world and, as people start having personal assistants I didn’t want to rely on OpenAI or Anthropic or *whoever* to be responsible for managing my context. As such, I built a sovereign context management box that is essentially a mini datacenter in a 10U server rack flight case. It’s a Kubernetes cluster running distributed agents and HA, durable storage with on-board local LLM compute. I then proceeded to build connectors for every part of my life: meetings, email, text messages, life… needed a system to store and retrieve it. It became more complex but more performant over time. Then I found a few companies and people who were also interested in managing their context outside of corporate control so I built them systems. \n\nI went into a little detail recently here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/n1Sp1jaKW2. \n\nAnyway… it was a multi-year learning path. For a shortcut I recommend just starting with graphRAG and understanding how to store data without a bunch of duplication and how to interface search between vectors and graph traversal and how you build the architecture for artifact storage, summaries, etc. \n\nHope that helps lol",

Without proper evaluation metrics, it can be challenging to determine how well an agent performs in real-world scenarios. This includes tracking agent-specific metrics, visibility into planning and tool use, and managing costs and latency effectively. [Introducing Agentic Evaluations - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3zymprct)\n\n- Another key takeaway is the need for clear orchestration among multiple agents. As workflows become more complex, ensuring that agents do not duplicate efforts or fail to complete tasks is crucial. Using an orchestrator can help coordinate these agents effectively. [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)\n\n- Additionally, understanding the reasoning cycle of AI agents—reason, act, observe, and respond—can help in designing more effective workflows. This structured approach allows agents to handle complex tasks more dynamically than traditional systems.

The post-training step that LLMs go thru is largely what gives it its I/O abilities. Historically (as in the last few years) the bulk of that training data are manually-authored chats written by an army of contractors. This is the basis of ChatGPT and basically everyone else got behind that as well.\n\nSince then the major labs have diversified the post-training set to include other things (tool calling, image inputs, video inputs) but the key is that LLM's ability to interact in ways that are divergent with the post-training data mostly ranges from \"meh\" to \"sucks\". Prompting is enough to stand up various tech demos but generally not enough to ship to production.\n\nSo things like generative UI are entirely possible, but hard to get working well enough at-scale without a real post-training data set. This is beyond the ability of most small players to fund, so it isn't done.",

In fact structuring tool calls in CLI form often outperforms JSON.\n\nAnd that’s just because it’s seen in a lot of CLI usage in pretraining and maybe post-training. \n\nSo if you want LLMs to output UIs you’d have to show it training data that fits your output. There are a lot of complexities here that can work to your advantage or disadvantage. \n\nIt’s a tractable problem but IMO would have a hard time productionizing without some genuine training process. At least fine tuning. I am not convinced that prompting and constrained decoding gets you past a shippable quality bar.",

Instead of asking questions, you can now *delegate actual work*.\n\n\n\nCowork is built on **Claude Code**, but designed for non-technical users. You describe a goal in plain language, and it plans and executes the task end-to-end.\n\n\n\nWhat it can do:\n\n* Work directly inside your files and folders\n* Create, edit, and organize documents and spreadsheets\n* Break down complex tasks and run them autonomously\n* Deliver clean, professional outputs, not drafts\n\n\n\nThis feels less like prompting an AI and more like assigning work to a teammate who understands context, follows instructions, and gets things done.\n\n\n\nCowork is currently in research preview, but it’s a clear signal of where AI at work is heading: from assistant to collaborator.\n\nI am a technical founder in an AI startup, and from my POV, Anthropic has given great signs of surpassing ChatGPT. Companies are switching to Claude, and they prove again and again how well they can deliver, and innovate.",

I want certain things handled early in the request path (guardrails, tracing instrumentation, orchestration), I want to be able to design my agent instructions in the programming language of my choice (business logic), I want smart and safe retries to LLM calls using a robust access layer, and I want to pull from data stores via tools/functions that I define.\n\nI want simple libraries, I don't want frameworks.

The agent stays flexible; the execution path stays boring and inspectable. When something goes wrong, you can point to which invariant blocked or allowed progress, instead of spelunking through planner internals.\n\nYour emphasis on replayability and explicit control planes is exactly where this space needs to go. Treating agent runs like infrastructure events rather than “smart conversations” makes a lot of downstream problems much easier to reason about — especially once failures and escalation paths become first-class instead of edge cases.",

With access to 100% of PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, DailyMed, Clinicaltrials gov, live web search, and now I have also added: ChEMBL, Drugbank, Open Targets, SEC fillings, NPI Registry, and WHO ICD codes.\n\nI was at a top London university for CS and was always watching my girlfriend and other biology/science PhD students waste entire days because every single AI tool is fundamentally broken for them. These people are smart people doing actual research. Comparing CAR-T efficacy across trials. Tracking ads adverse events. Tryign to figure out why their $50k mouse model won't replicate results from a paper published 6months ago.\n\nThey ask ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity about a 2024 pembrolizumab trial. It confidently cites a paper. The paper does not exist. It made it up. My friend asked all these AIs for keynote-006 Orr values. Three different numbers. All wrong. Not even close. Just completely fabricated.\n\nThis is actually insane. The information all exists. Right now. 37 million papers on Pubmed. Half a million registered trials. 2.5+ million bioactive compounds on ChEMBL. Every drug mechanism in DrugBank with validated targets.Every preprint ever released. Every FDA label. All of it public. \n\nBut you ask an AI and it just fucking lies to you. Not because Claude or gpt are bad models, they're incredible, but they literally just don't have the search tools needed. They are doing statistical parlor tricks on training data from 2024. They're blind.\n\nThe dbs exist. The models exist. Someone just needs to connect these together...\n\nSo, I have been working on this...\n\n**What it has access to:**\n\n* PubMed (37M+ papers, fulltext multimodal not just abstracts)\n* ArXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv (every preprint in bio/physics/etc)\n* Clinicaltrials dot Gov (complete trial registry)\n* DailyMed (FDA drug labels and safety data)\n* ChEMBL (2.5M+ bioactive compounds with bioactivity data)\n* DrugBank (15K+ drugs with mechanisms, interactions, pharmacology)\n* Open Targets (60K+ drug targets with disease associations)\n* SEC Filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks - useful for pharma pipeline/financial research)\n* NPI Registry (8M+ US healthcare providers)\n* WHO ICD Codes (ICD-10/11 diagnosis and billing codes)\n* Live web search (useful for realtime news/company research etc)\n\nThis way every query hits the primary literature and returns proper citations. \n\n**Technical capabilities:**\n\nPrompt it: \"Pembrolizumab vs nivolumab in NSCLC. Pull Phase 3 data, compute ORR deltas, plot survival curves, export tables.\"\n\nExecution chain:\n\n1. Query clinical trial registry + PubMed for matching studies\n2. Retrieve full trial protocols and published results\n3. Parse results, patient demographics, efficacy data\n4. Execute Python: statistical analysis, survival modeling, visualization\n5. Generate report with citations, confidence intervals, and exportable datasets\n\nWhat takes a research associate 40 hours happens in \\~5mins.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\nAI + Execution:\n\n* Vercel AI SDK (the best framework for agents + tool calling in my opinion)\n* Daytona - for code execution (so easy to use... great DX)\n* Next.js + Supabase\n\nSearch Infrastructure:\n\n* valyu Search API (this search API gives the agent access to all the biomedical data, pubmed/clinicaltrials/chembl/drugbank/etc that the app uses, it is a single search endpoint which is nice)\n\nIt can also hook up to local LLMs via Ollama / LMStudio (see readme for self-hosted mode)\n\nIt is 100% open-source, self-hostable, and model-agnostic. I also built a hosted version so you can test it without setting anything up. Only thing is oath signup so the search works.\n\nIf something's broken, or you think something is missing, please file an issue or PR the fix! Really appreciate any contributions to it! Especially around the workflow of the app if you are an expert in the sciences.\n\nThis is a bit of a relaunch with a bunch more datasets - we've added ChEMBL for compound screening, DrugBank for drug mechanisms and interactions, Open Targets for target validation, NPI for provider lookups, and WHO ICD for medical coding. Basically everything you need for end-to-end biomedical research.\n\nHave left the github repo below!",

      "text": "Work at Maxim on the observability side. Been thinking about how traditional APM tools just don't work for agent workflows.\n\nAgents aren't single API calls. They're multi-turn conversations with tool invocations, retrieval steps, reasoning chains, external API calls. When something breaks, you need the entire execution path, not just error logs.\n\nWe built distributed tracing at multiple levels - sessions for full conversations, traces for individual exchanges, spans for specific steps like LLM calls or tool usage. Helps a lot when debugging.\n\nThe other piece that's been useful is running automated evals continuously on production logs. Track quality metrics (relevance, faithfulness, hallucination rates) alongside the usual stuff like latency and cost. Set thresholds, get alerts in Slack when things go sideways.\n\nAlso built custom dashboards since production agents need domain-specific insights. Teams track success rates for workflows, compare model versions, identify where things break.\n\nHardest part has been capturing context across async operations and handling high-volume traffic without killing performance. Making traces actually useful for debugging instead of just noise takes work.\n\nWanted to know how others are handling observability for multi-step agents in production? DMs are always welcome for discussion!",

Current tools are good at the former but offer limited help with the latter. When an agent makes an unexpected decision, your traces might show the exact prompt, the retrieved context, and the generated response. But the actual decision-making process inside the model remains a black box.",
