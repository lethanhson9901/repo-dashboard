      "text": "Tried the new Agent Teams feature that dropped with Opus 4.6 yesterday.\n\nI gave Claude a refactoring task. Instead of grinding through it alone, it spawned three teammate agents that worked in parallel - one on backend, one on frontend, one playing code reviewer.\n\nThey literally messaged each other. Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified. Probably both.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?\n\n",

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

The reason? Claude CoWork is being positioned as capable of automating **high-value legal tasks** like contract review, summarization, and structured analysis  work that many firms still bill humans for.\n\nAccording to analysts and traders, the tool itself wasn’t the *only* reason for the market dip. But it landed at a sensitive moment, amplifying existing fears that AI is starting to **directly threaten business models** built around expensive human expertise.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous AI hype:\n\n* This isn’t marketing copy or customer support automation\n* It targets **legal and professional workflows**, where margins are high\n* It signals a shift from “AI assists humans” to “AI replaces chunks of billable work”\n\nInvestors seem to be asking a hard question:  \nIf AI can do this *reliably*, what happens to firms whose value depends on time-based billing and proprietary expertise?\n\nSo I’m curious what this sub thinks:\n\n* Is the market overreacting to yet another AI announcement?\n* Or is this the first real sign that **AI is moving into territory Wall Street actually cares about**?\n* Which industries do you think are next once this becomes mainstream?\n\nInterested to hear perspectives from both tech and finance folks here.",

They didn't have YouTube tutorials to learn new things. Their documentation didn't have advanced search engines.\n\nSure, AI could finally be the tipping point for us, but I really don't think so.

It also can summarize info quickly, giving a simple heuristic to determine if you should dive into a source more deeply. \n\nI've switched from Google to Perplexity for search, and I'm never going back.",

Stuff like Agent Trace feels way more important long-term than flashy demos, especially once agents start touching CI, prod configs, or real customer data.\n\nFeels like we’re leaving the “agent hype” phase and entering the “oh, this can actually break things” phase.\n\nWould be interesting to see more coverage on:\n\n* how teams are enforcing guardrails + rollback\n* where agents are failing silently\n* and which of these tools people *actually keep turned on* after the demo glow wears off\n\nGood list though — keep these coming.",

Install pain: If you need Docker, dependency wrangling, and API key gymnastics just to get started, it’s not “for everyone.” Accessibility is part of the design.\n\n2. Security mess: Letting marketplace skills run with full access is basically asking for trouble. It’s like giving random browser extensions root privileges.\n\n3. Memory not equal to chat history: Calling it “unlimited memory” when it’s just a scrollback log is pure marketing. Without semantic clustering or structured retrieval, the agent can’t actually learn or evolve.\n\nAnd right, I think the vision of local‑first, structured memory, proactive agents is spot on. That’s the difference between a flashy demo and something you can actually rely on day‑to‑day.\n\nBeen playing with smaller local‑first bots myself, and the experience is night and day compared to hype projects.

Might be wrong but a lot of these agent projects feel like they optimized for demo velocity, not for “someone normal can live with this daily.”\n\nThe install barrier is real. If a PM can’t get it running without reading 6 docs and fighting Docker, it’s not “for everyone,” it’s for devs who like tinkering. Which is fine, just be honest about it.\n\nSecurity model too… yeah. The marketplace/skills thing freaks me out more than the core codebase. I’ve seen enough npm/python supply chain nonsense to not want “random skills” getting real permissions. Without a proper sandbox / permission scoping, you’re basically trusting vibes.\n\nOn memory, I’ve been annoyed by this across a bunch of tools. They say “memory” but it’s just “we’ll stuff more text into context sometimes.” Real memory feels more like: store facts/events cleanly, retrieve only what matters, and keep it auditable so you can see what it’s using. Otherwise it’s just token bloat.\n\nI’m not sure I buy “proactive help” as default though. That sounds amazing until it’s constantly interrupting you. I’d want it opt-in and super constrained.\n\nAlso, not gonna lie, the memU mention makes this read a bit like a pitch. Might be totally legit, just saying that’s how it lands.

At first i thought this would be a generic chatgpt browser session on \"vibe coding\" etc. But they showcased claude code, how they were using it and what it could do and i was truly stunned. Since then my job has just completely changed from writing code 60% of the time to prompting and 90% of the time doing testing/reviewing & administration. \n\nMy opinion for the timeline and impact of AI also completely switched and i really want to expand my knowledge on this topic, since i feel i left it aside for to long, especially considering my job as a software dev. \n\nI work in consulting, so beside coding i'm also very interested in how AI is used by companies when they are not using it for coding or a chatbot.\n\n  \nAre there any courses you can recommend? Videos? Tools? I'd love to see how deep this rabbit hole already goes and what the capabilities are.\n\nif you get here thanks for reading the post :-) ",

          "text": "- You might want to explore **Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO)**, which is a new model tuning method that allows for improving AI models using only unlabeled data. This could be particularly useful in your consulting work, as it enables enterprises to enhance AI quality without the need for extensive human labeling. More details can be found in the article [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- Consider diving into **prompt engineering**, which is crucial for effectively interacting with AI models. Understanding how to craft precise prompts can significantly enhance the outputs you receive from models like Claude. A good resource for this is the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).\n\n- If you're interested in building AI applications, look into orchestration tools that can help streamline the integration of AI features into existing systems. The [Mastering Agents](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) article discusses how to create and evaluate AI agents, which could be beneficial for your consulting projects.\n\n- Lastly, keep an eye on emerging AI models like **DeepSeek-R1**, which offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt AI without significant investment. More information can be found in the article [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here. Are You Ready?](https://tinyurl.com/5xhydkev).\n\nExploring these resources will give you a broader understanding of AI's capabilities and applications beyond coding.",

      "text": "Anthropic just published a fascinating (and unsettling) research paper on how advanced AI systems fail  and it doesn’t look like the classic “AI pursues the wrong goal” scenario we’re used to hearing about. \n\nInstead, their key finding is this:\n\nAs models get more capable and tackle harder tasks, they don’t fail by systematically chasing the wrong objective  they fail by becoming incoherent and unpredictable, especially during long reasoning or multi-step processes. \n\nHere’s what they found:\n\n🔹 Longer reasoning = more incoherence\n\nWhen models spend more time reasoning or acting, they’re more likely to produce inconsistent outcomes  not because they’re optimizing the wrong thing, but because their behavior becomes a “hot mess.” \n\n🔹 Bigger models help on easy tasks, not hard ones\n\nScaling increases accuracy on simple jobs, but on complex problems it doesn’t make models more coherent sometimes it even makes them more scattered. \n\n🔹 This challenges classic AI risk views\n\nMuch of alignment thinking assumes the danger is an AI that reliably pursues misaligned goals. Anthropic suggests failures might instead look like industrial accidents  unpredictable, nonsensical, and highly context-dependent. \n\nIn other words, the risk isn’t just “wrong objective,” it’s unpredictability at scale — a chaotic blend of variance and reasoning length that we don’t fully understand yet.\n\nThis raises some provocative questions:\n\n• Are we thinking about AI safety the wrong way?\n\n• Should alignment research shift focus from “goal misalignment” to coherence & behavior stability?\n\n• What does it mean if future AI systems become less predictable as they get more powerful?\n\nSome have even linked these findings with broader concerns about AI deployment mismatches and chaotic real-world behaviors. \n\n\n\nThis isn’t just academic — if future models fail unpredictably rather than systematically, traditional safety strategies might not be enough.\n\nCurious what others think:\n\nIs chaotic failure worse than coherent misalignment? Which is the more realistic risk as AI gets stronger?",

I find Anthropic’s framing of chaotic failure vs. coherent misalignment especially provocative.\n\nThe idea that larger models can actually become less predictable on complex tasks challenges a lot of assumptions in alignment research. If failures look more like industrial accidents, sporadic, context-dependent, and incoherent. Then safety strategies focused only on goal alignment might miss the bigger picture.\n\nTo me, this raises two key points:\n\nReliability vs. capability: Scaling improves performance on simple tasks, but stability on complex reasoning seems to lag behind.\n\nHuman oversight: If unpredictability is the dominant risk, then monitoring, redundancy, and fail-safes may become just as important as alignment itself.\n\nChaotic failure might be harder to anticipate than misaligned goals, but it also feels more realistic given how current systems behave under stress. Either way, it underscores that AI safety isn’t just about what the model is trying to do, but how consistently it can do it.",

This is the closest I remember to what this post suggests, but id say its not the same \n\n\"However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of *those* behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.\"\n\n",

If you’re building long multi-step workflows, the “industrial accident” vibe matters a lot because it’s the random weird step 17 that breaks everything, even when the intent wasn’t “evil.”\n\nAlso, this is why I’ve never loved “just let it reason longer” as the default fix.

Most of the time when i try to learn, i end up in funnels where people just want to sell their “method” or course. And it feels weird because… if this stuff is real and useful, why is everyone only selling tutorials instead of just explaining the basics?\n\nI’m not looking for a shortcut or a get rich quick thing lol i just genuinely want to understand, and what tools people are really using or what skills are actually needed or where someone with zero experience should start and how much of this is hype vs real?\n\nIf anyone here has built agents or is learning seriously, i'd really appreciate honest guidance. Explain it to me like I know nothing, because i don’t ahahah i’ll drop the video that made me curious in the comments thaaanks",

AI agent is fundamentally a software system that autonomously perceives its environment, reasons about what to do, and takes actions to pursue goals on behalf of a user or another system, often adapting its behaviour over time.\n\nIn today’s “marketing” language, for example, many “order entry agents” are really scripted workflows wrapped in AI prompts, while a stricter definition of an agent implies autonomous goal‑driven behavior, planning, and tool use over a less rigid process. A fixed sequence of LLM calls and tools and little to no autonomy is really just a skill, a *tool* an agent might use, but not an agent itself.\n\nAnd yes, what it boils down to at the end is this…\n\nIf I have enough money, I can use Claude Code to write me a program that goes on the web, fetches a bunch of content, transforms it, stories it somewhere, and then even generates content for me to post out of it, but this isn’t an agent. It’s a script. Claude Code was just means of building the script that does not require a lot of technical knowledge to execute. Then, when deployed, they call the script an agent, but it is far from it.",

The hard part is everything around it. Inputs, outputs, retries, failure handling, and making sure the agent is operating on real, consistent data instead of vibes. Most people never show that because it is boring and breaks the illusion.\n\nWhere beginners usually get misled is thinking agents are about clever instructions. They are not. They are about wiring LLMs into reliable systems. Even something like “go research X” falls apart the moment the agent has to touch the real web, deal with JS heavy pages, logins, or inconsistent results. That is why many demos quietly hand wave execution. In real builds, people end up using frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and then layering in more boring infrastructure. Things like controlled browser execution, sometimes via tools like hyperbrowser, just to make the environment predictable.\n\nLangChain is a fine place to start for learning the basics, but I would tell anyone new to focus less on prompts and more on understanding workflows, state, and failure modes. Once you get that, the hype videos start to look a lot less magical and a lot more like dressed up scripts.",

Both route through OpenRouter with Anthropic API as fallback, and I’ve been having them track costs per task with a usage log to keep spending optimized.

You don't need to invent problems or follow the trends, just look for ways that your life could be easier and let the LLM do the hard work. I'm fairly technical but AI can extend to surface areas that I have little experience in, and I honestly think the same is true for people that aren't technical whatsoever. Many of my non-engineering friends have built \"functional\" projects for their specific use cases. It's honestly more about patience and continuing through the frustration (to which you'll learn to prompt better) than it is about being an expert at this point. Sure, your project might not be top tier code quality or scale whatsoever, but it will be sufficient enough to help you at the very least, which is the whole point right?\n\nAnd most importantly, you absolutely do not need to pay for courses or low effort LLM wrappers (like you see advertised on this platform frequently). 2 hours with a chatbot and some headphones and you're just as capable. I hope this helps!",

Email triage, report generation, monitoring dashboards, social media scheduling.

          "text": "Building AI agents can seem daunting, especially if you're starting from scratch without a technical background. However, there are accessible pathways and tools that can help you get started. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:\n\n- **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**: AI agents are systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Familiarizing yourself with concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation can be beneficial.\n\n- **Use User-Friendly Platforms**: There are platforms designed to simplify the process of building AI agents. For instance:\n  - **aiXplain** offers intuitive tools that allow non-developers to create AI agents without extensive coding knowledge. They provide a user-friendly SDK and pre-built templates to help you get started quickly. You can explore their offerings [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j3kpr3y).\n  - **Apify** is another platform that allows you to build web scraping and automation agents easily. They provide templates and a community that can help you learn the ropes. More information can be found on their site [here](https://tinyurl.com/5n8xczxx).\n\n- **Learn Through Tutorials and Documentation**: While it can be frustrating to encounter paywalls, many platforms offer free resources:\n  - Look for free tutorials on building AI agents using platforms like aiXplain or Apify. They often have step-by-step guides that can help you understand the process without needing to pay for courses.\n  - Engage with community forums or groups where you can ask questions and share experiences.\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects. For example, you could create a basic agent that automates a small task, like sending reminders or gathering information from a website. This will help you build confidence and gradually increase your skills.\n\n- **Explore Existing Agents**: Check out examples of AI agents that others have built. This can provide inspiration and practical insights into how they function. Platforms like Apify have collections of existing agents that you can explore [here](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3).\n\n- **Focus on Learning Key Skills**: While you don’t need to become a developer, having a basic understanding of programming concepts can be helpful. Consider learning:\n  - Basic Python programming, as many AI tools and frameworks use it.\n  - How to work with APIs, which are essential for integrating different services.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. Follow blogs, podcasts, and online communities to keep up with the latest trends and tools.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can gradually build your knowledge and skills in creating AI agents. It’s a journey that requires patience and persistence, but there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way.",

If it's research summaries, same deal. No-code platforms like n8n or Lindy let you wire up multi-step workflows in under an hour without writing code. The skill isn't coding, it's defining the workflow clearly enough that an LLM can follow it.\n\nThe course funnel thing you noticed is the real tell.

Start with one boring task you do repeatedly, automate just that, and learn by doing rather than by watching.",

OpenClaw went viral, setup was painful, and you sold “I’ll make the pain disappear.” That’s not hype, that’s a real problem with a clear buyer.\n\nAlso the refunds don’t even surprise me. Early adopters are chaos and hosting + self-hosted projects always have weird edge cases. If I were you I’d obsess over the 3 refunds more than the 10 signups, because that’s probably where the product is leaking (pricing mismatch? onboarding? uptime? expectations?).\n\nRe: agentic coding vs vibe coding… I think the real takeaway is constraints + parallelization. If you keep the scope tight and you’re willing to run multiple agents and then actually review, you can move stupid fast. But if you point it at a vague “build my startup” goal, it just turns into fancy procrastination.\n\nAnyway, congrats on getting out of the $0 zone. That part is real.",

Instead of ranking tools purely by technical depth, I grouped them by how much setup or coding they require. This list is based on hands-on experience rather than theory.\n\n# No-code / low-code tools (great for fast deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no-code AI agent focused on execution rather than configuration. You describe or demonstrate a task, and it performs actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than building automation, which makes it great for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open-source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflows and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be rough for beginners, but it becomes very powerful once set up properly.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors with minimal code, then extend things if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, although requiring a desktop app can be limiting for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no-code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Still early, but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n# High-code / developer-focused tools\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for working directly with Claude models. Powerful if you are already deep in the Anthropic ecosystem, but integration options are fairly limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is actively maintained and updated. A solid choice for developers who want robust, production-ready integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the Lang ecosystem. Best suited for teams already familiar with Lang tools, with strong observability and useful integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nA highly abstracted framework that supports multiple models and ecosystems. Good for developers who prefer model-agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nOne of the earlier autonomous agent frameworks. Still useful for learning and experimentation, though active maintenance appears limited.\n\nCurious what others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms you’ve found practical in 2026?",

They’re great for speed, but dangerous unless you wrap them with an execution-time authority layer like #AgentPermissionProtocol (https://www.crittora.com/app/whitepaper).\n\nTeams that succeed treat agents as *participants*, not owners: short-lived permissions, single-purpose runs, hard cost ceilings, and real principals on every action. The tooling matters less than whether authority is explicit and auditable. Without that, any of these can bite you fast.",

I don’t even disagree with the list, but I think a lot of “agent tools” debates are really just people mixing up two different problems.\n\nIf you’re trying to automate business workflows, n8n-style orchestration + one LLM step is usually the whole game. If you’re trying to build long-running agents that keep state, recover from errors, and don’t spiral, then frameworks like ADK / LangGraph start to matter way more than the model.\n\nAlso, might be wrong but I’d add a couple “boring but real” categories that people keep rediscovering:  \nRPA-ish desktop automation tools are basically agent platforms now (the ones that click around UIs), and they’re practical in the messiest orgs because they don’t require clean APIs.  \nAnd observability/evals tools deserve their own bucket. Once you have users, tracing, replay, eval sets, and cost/latency dashboards become more important than whatever agent framework you picked on day one.\n\nOne small nit: AutoGen feels like it’s still around mostly because it’s familiar. It’s fine for learning, but for production I see more folks leaning toward ADK/LangGraph-ish setups + strong tracing.\n\nCurious what you’ve found for memory/state stuff though. Everyone claims “memory,” but half the time it’s just chat history with a nicer label.",

As per now, it may seem like trivial exploring into a new way to interact with AI. \n\nHowever, we should really be talking about the tomorrow. Now let me touch a bit on your questions. \n\nAccountability. As per now, AI (synonymous with LLM's in this context) does not possess any moral capacity. If it instructs a human to do something unethical or immoral, it is because it saw that as a means to fulfill some task or goal in an efficient way (it could for example arise situations where the AI was breached and a malicious actor prompt injected something because xyz). Therefore the human would have to be accountable in this situation. \nRight now, blaming AI for your immoral acts is like blaming a small child. \nWe should however closely monitor alignment, morals and ethics in every aspect of AI, especially those who will inevitably make decisions on their own, and all those who interact with humans.\n\nPsychological shift. This is also a hugely important discussion to have. We can already see that people who interact with LLM's on a daily basis trust it's judgement, are prone to take advice from it, and in extreme cases, develop feelings for it. \nIt is paramount that we remember that these are algorithms on machines. \nIf you do another person a small favor, you are way more likely to do them larger favors later on, and there is no reason to believe it's different with AI. \nAlready some people lean towards sympathizing with digital minds, and Anthropic are already talking about AI welfare. \nThat was a long way of saying that I personally think this psychological shift is happening before our eyes, and it's a trend that is best halted. \n\nWill we work for AI? That's a whole other bag of worms. It's nuanced, and this post is already longer than anticipated, so I'll save that for another day. \n\nBut these are discussions worth having!",

Humans have already been taking instructions from software for a long time for example gig platforms, call centers, task queues, GPS directions. What’s new here is that the planner is adaptive and non-human which makes the power dynamics feel more unsettling even if the underlying mechanics aren’t totally new. So I think the real risk isn’t AI bosses, it’s lack of clear boundaries. If humans are executing tasks, there still has to be explicit accountability, guardrails, and the ability to refuse or escalate… otherwise it’s just outsourcing responsibility to a system that can’t bear it. Without that, platforms will absolutely try to blur lines when something goes wrong. \n\nSo I don’t think this is inherently dark or inevitable doom, but it does force us to be more deliberate. The moment an AI can delegate to humans, you need the same things you’d require of any employer or contractor system: consent, transparency, auditability, and clear responsibility. If those are missing, that’s when it stops being efficient delegation and starts being exploitative. How we design the rules around it matters most.",

Cheaper + faster + long context absolutely matters because that alone changes how often people can afford to keep agents running in the background. In addition autonomous “dev team” style workflows are getting meaningfully better. For solo devs I think that’ll be a good an unlock for boring but time-consuming work like scaffolding, refactors, doc cleanup etc.\n\nI do see a bit of hype with regard the idea that this replaces an actual engineering team. These systems still need clear task boundaries, good specs, humans to decide what should be built, and oversight when something subtle or architectural is at stake.\n\nSo yeah, it’s a game changer for leverage, not for ownership. One person with good judgment can probably do the work of 3–5 people on execution-heavy tasks but it doesn’t eliminate the need for thinking, product sense, or responsibility.",

That’s still super useful, especially for solo devs, but it’s not the same thing as having multiple engineers with judgment, taste, and accountability. Might be wrong, but the real limiter hasn’t been speed or cost, it’s trust: do you let it merge, do you let it touch prod, do you even read everything it did. If Sonnet 5 makes that loop tighter and cheaper, that’s a real win. If people start skipping the review step because it “feels like a team,” that’s where things get sketchy fast. Feels less like a revolution and more like the next notch on the same ratchet.",

They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler. Also, for a lot of teams, “boring cron + webhook” is kind of the point because it’s predictable, so I’m curious what you’d consider the minimum “brakes” that actually matter day to day.",

Like, it can absolutely save time, but only if you’re the one keeping it inside the lines.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, OpenClaw is great for a few practical things: doing annoying setup chores, running repetitive refactors, generating a first pass on docs/tests, or poking around a repo to answer “where is X handled?” It’s basically a turbo assistant when you already kinda know what you want.\n\nWhere it falls apart is exactly what you’re saying: “make decisions for me.” The model doesn’t have your taste, your risk tolerance, your context, and it’ll happily do a confident wrong thing if the guardrails aren’t tight. So I don’t treat it as autonomous. I treat it like: propose a plan, show diffs, I approve.\n\nAnd yeah, hype is definitely a factor. People see one flashy run and assume you can hand it your whole job. I’ve messed with this stuff enough to know the boring workflow wins: small scope, explicit constraints, checkpoints, and a human thumb on the big buttons.\n\nMight be wrong but if someone says they “rely on it unsupervised for professional work,” they either have a super narrow task, or they haven’t been burned yet.",

If you try to use Pinecone or a high-end managed service, your credit card will melt before you hit 10%.\n\nHere is how I’d build the pipeline for efficiency:\n\n1. Extraction (The Bottleneck): Don't use heavy OCR unless absolutely necessary. Use docling or Marker to convert PDF to Markdown. Markdown preserves the legal structure (citations, sections) which is vital for RAG.\n2. Chunking Strategy: For legal data, character-based chunking is useless. You need Semantic Chunking or at least section-aware chunking. If the agent misses the \"ratio decidendi\" because it was cut in half, the output is garbage.\n3. The Database: Avoid the \"pay-per-vector\" clouds. Go with Qdrant or Milvus self-hosted on a dedicated NVMe server. For 14M vectors, you're looking at significant RAM requirements, so look into HNSW indexing optimizations or \"DiskANN\" to keep costs down.\n4. Embedding Cost: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is cheap, but at 14M files, \"cheap\" still means thousands of dollars. Consider running nomic-embed-text locally on a few rented H100s or A100s for a week.\n\nThe biggest hidden cost isn't the DB, it's the compute for extraction and embedding. Do a small 10k sample first to benchmark your token count.",

          "text": "2TB / 14M PDFs is “pipeline engineering” more than “vector DB choice”, and the cheapest path usually comes from not embedding everything blindly. I might be wrong but I’d do it in stages: first extract clean text + metadata (court, date, citation list, parties, docket, etc.), dedupe versions, and store the raw text in cheap object storage; then build search as hybrid (BM25/keyword + vectors) so you’re not paying embeddings to solve what keywords already solve. For embeddings, chunk by structure (headnotes/summary vs full body) and keep chunks sized for retrieval, and do an incremental job queue so you can resume and re-run only failures. Cost-wise, embeddings are the big variable: for OpenAI, text-embedding-3-small is $0.02 per 1M tokens (and $0.01 per 1M via Batch), while 3-large is $0.13 per 1M (Batch $0.065). If your average judgement is even a couple pages, 14M docs can explode into billions of tokens fast, so I’d start with “embed only headnotes + top cited paragraphs” and expand coverage based on what users actually query. Also, don’t skip citations in the UI (show the exact paragraph + PDF link), because legal research without traceability gets messy real quick.",

What made this less painful for me was treating shared context like a product spec instead of “stuff in memory” — one canonical event log (messages, tool calls, results) in my own schema, and every model gets an adapter that translates from that schema into whatever it wants (OpenAI tools, Claude tool use, local JSON-ish). Same for tools: define each tool once in your own minimal signature (name, input JSON schema, output schema, permission scope), then generate the provider-specific wrappers from that, so you’re not hand-maintaining 3 copies forever. Also, I stopped trying to keep embeddings consistent across providers because it’s a rabbit hole; I use plain text retrieval + lightweight metadata filters for most things, and only embed inside one chosen “memory model” if I really need it. Might be wrong but I feel like “one model for everything” is simpler until you have a clear reason not to, and if you do go multi-model, you basically need a thin orchestration layer that’s yours, not LangChain’s, otherwise you’ll keep paying the rewrite cost every time a provider changes formats.",

System reads incoming tickets, categorizes them, pulls relevant context from our docs and past resolutions, and either resolves directly or routes to the right person with a summary. Handles about 60% of volume autonomously. The other 40% still needs human judgment, but even those tickets arrive pre-triaged with all the context already pulled.\n\nOrder tracking is another. Customer asks \"where's my order,\" agent checks the system, identifies the status, drafts the response with tracking info, and sends it. Saves about 5 hours daily across our portfolio companies. Boring work, but it was eating up real capacity.\n\nLead qualification is partially there. Agent enriches the lead, scores against ICP criteria, drafts personalized outreach if the score is high enough. If confidence is low, it routes to a human with all the research already done. Not fully autonomous, but it eliminated the manual research step entirely.\n\nThe pattern we've seen is that full replacement works best for workflows that are high-volume, low-variability, and have clear decision logic. If the process requires genuine judgment calls or handling edge cases that don't fit a pattern, you still need humans in the loop. But for repetitive operational work where the logic is documentable, agents can own it completely.",

Anything that required judgment across shifting context usually still needed a person. The key was not intelligence, it was consistency. Once the task could be reduced to clear inputs, clear outputs, and well defined failure cases, the agent could actually take it over end to end.\n\nWhat made or broke it was execution reliability. Early versions technically replaced the workflow but still needed humans hovering because runs failed in weird ways. Especially when the agent had to touch the web. Once we stabilized that layer and treated it as infrastructure instead of ad hoc scripts, the human oversight dropped a lot. Using more controlled setups, including experimenting with things like hyperbrowser for web interactions, helped remove random breakage.

The failures always come from edge cases and flaky web steps, so the real unlock is guardrails plus good run logs so you can spot where it drifted or timed out and fix the step, not the prompt. If you’re trying to get to that 60% autonomous sweet spot without building a whole internal platform, Mindstudio is a decent option because it’s quick to wire the steps, add fallback paths, and actually see each run instead of guessing what happened.",

The key thing is you gotta pick workflows that are document-heavy but follow clear decision trees. Like our underwriting bot handles everything from initial document intake through credit memo generation - used to take 3 analysts a full week, now it's done in 48 hours with zero human touch unless something weird pops up.\n\n\n\nThe workflows that work best for full replacement are the ones where humans are basically following a checklist anyway. Financial spreading, covenant monitoring, document reconciliation - that stuff. We had one client who let go their entire back office team of 8 people because the agents just... handled it. They redeployed those folks to relationship management instead which was way better use of their time anyway. The trick is you need agents that can actually read unstructured docs and make judgment calls, not just follow if-then rules.\n\n\n\nWhat doesn't work yet is anything requiring real creativity or complex negotiation. We tried having agents handle restructuring discussions and that was a disaster - they'd propose technically correct but politically tone-deaf solutions. Also anything where you need to read between the lines or pick up on subtle cues. But for grunt work? Document processing, data entry, compliance checks, financial analysis - those workflows are gone. We're seeing 70% headcount reduction in operations teams across our client base, though most are redeploying people rather than firing them.",
