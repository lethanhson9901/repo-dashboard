      "text": "I’ve been a loyal ChatGPT/Claude power user for years. The convenience was unmatched. But recently, something shifted. Between the rising subscription costs (which seem to be everywhere now) and the increasing \"censorship\" or over-tuning of cloud models, I decided to build my own local AI workstation.\n\nAfter spending the last few weeks testing **Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and DeepSeek** locally, I’ve realized that the \"Cloud dominance\" is starting to fade. Here’s why I think 2026 is the year of Local AI:\n\n1. **Zero Latency:** No more waiting for server queues. The response is instant.\n2. **True Privacy:** I’m a developer, and I can finally feed my proprietary code into an LLM without worrying about where that data ends up.\n3. **No Filters:** You get the raw power of the model, exactly how the researchers intended it.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There’s a learning curve with hardware (VRAM requirements are still the biggest bottleneck) and quantization formats (GGUF vs EXL2).\n\nI’ve documented my entire setup process, the specific hardware I used (and some budget mistakes I made), and a step-by-step guide for anyone looking to make the switch this year. If you're tired of being tethered to a subscription, you might find my breakdown helpful.",

      "text": "idk who needs to hear this, but vector dbs are not the same as memory. ive been banging my head against the wall for the last month building a personal coding tutor agent and it was a total disaster until i realized this.\n\nBasically the goal was simple: an agent that remembers my skill level, current project, and coding style (like 'I hate list comprehensions, just give me loops'). I did the standard thing: **Pinecone, chunking, and a RAG pipeline.**\n\nIt worked for like an hour. By Day 3, the agent was a complete mess.\n\n1. Context Pollution: I ask about Python, it pulls a chunk from 3 days ago about SQL just because the semantic similarity was 'vaguely close' lol.\n2. No State Updates: If I tell it 'Actually, I want to switch to TypeScript,' it still pulls the old 'I use Python' chunks and gets confused.\n3. Token Bloat: I was retrieving so many 'relevant' chunks that my system prompt was hitting 4k+ tokens just for simple context. Its a nightmare for latency.\n\nHonestly, I fell into the trap of thinking RAG = Memory. It’s not. RAG is for static, encyclopedic knowledge. Memory is for user state, and state is dynamic.\n\nI eventually stumbled on an **open-source project** called **MemOS** ( **on github** ) that actually works for this. Instead of just dumping text into a vector store, it treats memory more like an OS. It has this 'lifecycle' concept (Generated -> Activated -> Merged -> Archived).\n\nBasically, when I tell the agent I’m done with Python, MemOS doesn't just leave that in the vector store to confuse the model later. It updates the state. It also separates 'Facts' from 'Preferences' during retrieval which is huge.\n\nThe result? My system prompt is way lighter now because I’m only injecting the active memory (like 'User is currently working on a React App') rather than 10 chunks of raw chat logs. The hallucinations about my tech stack have basically dropped to zero.\n\nHow are you guys handling the 'forgetting' curve for long-running agents? I feel like we need to stop treating Vector DBs as a silver bullet for state management, because they definately aren't.",

          "text": "I’ve been struggling with the same 'RAG is not memory' wall. What finally clicked for me was stopping the attempt to make the Vector DB do the heavy lifting.\n​Instead, I started treating the vectors as localized pointers. Basically, the vector just identifies the 'neighborhood,' but then it triggers a look-up to a local reference file that holds the actual state and specific memory connections. It’s like using the Vector DB as an index for a separate, dynamic state-machine rather than a giant box of text. Has anyone else tried decoupling the 'search' from the 'truth' like this?\n\n1. The \"Vector as a Key\" (The Look-up)\n​Instead of storing the whole conversation in the Vector DB, you store a Key ID.\n​Vector Search: \"User wants to talk about Python loops.\"\n​The Result: It doesn't return text; it returns ID: PYTHON_001.\n\n​2. The \"Local File\" (The State Manager)\n​You have a simple local file (like a JSON or a small database) where PYTHON_001 lives. This file holds the \"Localized Value.\"\n\n{\n  \"PYTHON_001\": {\n    \"core_fact\": \"User uses loops, not comprehensions.\",\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"last_modified\": \"2026-01-16\",\n    \"dependency\": \"SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. The \"Logic Gate\" (The Final Prompt)\n​Your code looks at the local file before it talks to the LLM.\n​If the local file says status: Archived or language: Outdated, the agent ignores that vector.\n​If the file says dependency: SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER, the agent knows to keep the explanation simple.\n\nThe trick is to stop putting the 'answer' inside the Vector DB. Just use the Vector DB to retrieve a unique ID.\n​Once you have the ID, hit a local JSON or SQLite file that contains the 'state' for that ID. This local file acts as a filter. If your local state says 'User moved to TypeScript,' you can programmatically tell the agent to ignore any Python-related IDs the Vector DB tries to pull. You're basically building a state-machine that sits on top of your embeddings.",

Here are some insights that might resonate with your situation:\n\n- **Memory vs. Vector Databases**: It's crucial to differentiate between memory and vector databases. While vector databases like Pinecone are excellent for storing and retrieving static information, they don't inherently manage dynamic user state or preferences. Memory in applications is about retaining context and adapting to user interactions over time.\n\n- **Context Pollution**: This is a common issue when relying solely on vector databases. If the retrieval mechanism pulls in older, less relevant chunks, it can lead to confusion and a lack of coherence in responses.\n\n- **State Updates**: Dynamic state management is essential for applications that need to adapt to user changes. If your agent doesn't update its understanding of the user's current preferences or projects, it will continue to reference outdated information.\n\n- **Token Management**: Keeping the system prompt lightweight is vital for performance. By focusing on active memory rather than a large volume of historical data, you can significantly improve response times and reduce latency.\n\n- **Lifecycle Management**: The approach you found with MemOS, which treats memory like an operating system with a lifecycle concept, seems promising. This method allows for more effective state management by updating and archiving information as needed.\n\nFor further reading on memory and state management in LLM applications, you might find this resource helpful: [Memory and State in LLM Applications](https://tinyurl.com/bdc8h9td).",

      "text": "We built an open source, rust-native alternative of Claude Cowork\n\nWhen Claude Cowork first dropped, tbh it hit us a bit hard.\n\nWe have been building our product Kuse confidently for a long time, and overnight we found ourselves becoming a web-based Claude Cowork alternative. That was frustrating at first. But also sparked a different kind of curiosity.\n\nSo over the past 48 hours, together with Claude Code, we built a fully open-source project: Kuse Cowork.\n\n**Native Rust, Zero-Wrappers:** This isn't just another agent wrapper. It’s a ground-up implementation in Rust. No heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on OpenCode/AgentSDK. Just raw performance and a tiny binary.  \nDocker Sandboxing: Since agents execute code, security is paramount. Open Cowork runs commands inside a transient Docker container.\n\n**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or run entirely offline with Ollama/Local LLMs. You own the keys and the privacy.\n\n**Skills, and MCPs:** It can already handle complex document tasks (PDF, Excel, etc.) out of the box.\n\n**The Development Story:** The most interesting part is that the builder fellow had zero Rust experience before this weekend. It was a surreal experience: an AI agent (Claude Code) helping me build a faster, secure, and open-source version of \"itself.\"\n\nIt's still very early, and there's a long roadmap ahead.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Docker sandboxing helps with blast radius, but operators still need clear logs, versioning, and a way to reconstruct what the agent saw and decided at the time. That is usually where escalations come from.\n\nI would be curious how you are thinking about audit trails and recovery. Not just “it failed,” but which prompt, tool call, file state, and assumption led to that outcome. Speed matters, but explainability is what makes these safe to run outside of a demo.",

Seeing Kuse Cowork lean into native performance and sandboxing makes me wonder - are we heading toward a world where the differentiator isn’t the UI layer, but how well the agent manages context, privacy, and trust?\n\nCurious how others here think about that - does “agent‑native” design feel like the next step beyond dashboards, or just another layer on top of existing tools?",

I’m listing some of the tools I’ve found useful along the way.\n\n**High-code Tools**\n\n1. **Claude Agent SDK**: This is a python package that lets you use Claude Code directly. If you have an Anthropic subscription, it doesn’t get much better than this. Integrations are a problem though (can be resolved with MCPs)\n2. **Google ADK**: Google’s Agent Development Kit is another good option. It’s updated more frequently and is maintained slightly better than Claude’s agent SDK.\n3. **Deep Agents** (on LangGraph/LangChain/LangSmith): This is a relatively new library but is built on the existing Lang ecosystem so you get several integrations and easy observability out of the box. Best for people already familiar with the ecosystem.\n4. **PydanticAI**: In terms of overall abstractions I like this one quite a lot. It’s great for people who are agnostic on which model/ecosystem they want to use.\n5. **AutoGen**: This one is by Microsoft but doesn’t seem to be well maintained. It’s popular due to how early it was in the market though.\n\n**No/low-code Tools**\n\n1. **CrewAI**: Great for people who want a low-code experience where they can dip into the code when required but also achieve a lot without code.\n2. **NoClick**: Recent platform but they offer free unlimited usage for individuals. There are some basic integrations and support for arbitrary agent hierarchies + custom tools in a no-code interface.\n3. **n8n**: Classic for agentic automation and open-source. If you’re good with self-hosting, it can also be a pretty cheap option. They have hundreds of integrations and thousands of templates.\n4. **LangFlow**: This is a good one but you need their desktop app to use it which makes it a little inconvenient. They’re a mature platform with an active community though.\n5. **OpenAI Agent Builder**: Also recent and directly from OpenAI. It’s quite early though and limits you to the OpenAI ecosystem. Good to keep an eye on it though as it evolves and becomes more mature.\n\nCurious what tools people here are using and if I missed any good ones?",

A lot of agent failures I’ve seen don’t come from planning or reasoning, but from interacting with messy websites, logins, dynamic pages, or JS heavy flows. Once agents leave clean APIs, things get fragile fast.\n\nThat’s why some teams pair these frameworks with a controlled browser layer like hyperbrowser. It’s not an agent framework itself, but it solves a big missing piece by giving agents a stable, observable environment to browse, extract, and act without fighting selectors or flaky automation. In practice, that often matters more than switching between LangGraph, PydanticAI, or CrewAI once you hit production.",

Here are some thoughts to strengthen your post:\n\n**Completeness & Clarity**: The post cuts off mid-sentence at the end (OpenAI Agent Builder description), so finishing that would be helpful. Also, consider adding a brief comparison matrix or decision tree (e.g., \"Choose this if you need X\") to help readers pick the right tool for their use case rather than just listing features.\n\n**Missing Context & Best Practices**: You could enhance this by mentioning important considerations like: cost comparison, learning curve, community size, production-readiness, and vendor lock-in risks. For example, noting that self-hosted options (n8n, LangFlow) have different operational overhead than managed platforms would help readers make informed decisions. Also, a brief note on when to use agents vs. simpler automation would add value.\n\n**Depth & Specificity**: While you mention integrations and observability, consider adding real-world use case examples for each tool or tier. For instance, \"CrewAI excels at multi-agent workflows where agents need to collaborate\" gives readers clearer guidance. Also, your note about MCPs resolving Claude SDK's integration issues deserves more explanation—many readers may not know what MCPs are.\n\n**Engagement & Updates**: Since you mention the industry changes rapidly, consider adding a note about how often you plan to update this list or inviting community feedback on newer tools. This positions you as a trusted, ongoing resource rather than a static reference.",

I bring this up because recently I been thinking about building a SDK(or hosted service?), that does the bulk of this work for you and wondering if it would be a useful endeavor.\n\nTBH prolly will do this anyways because I have severe ADD and this is my new shiny object. Reason why is that we have built a lot of this infra in our existing app, and turning into SDK just sort of makes sense to me.\n\nAnyways want to get your thoughts or if you think it is impossible to standardize, or maybe there are already too many agent frameworks out there or any reasons on why it is a bad idea to do this.",

Many of the tasks you've outlined are indeed repetitive and can consume a lot of time and resources. Here are some thoughts on your idea of creating an SDK or hosted service to streamline this process:\n\n- **Standardization Potential**: There is definitely room for standardization in the AI agent space. Many developers face similar challenges, and a well-designed SDK could save time and reduce redundancy.\n  \n- **Existing Solutions**: While there are frameworks and platforms that address some of these needs, they often require significant customization. A solution that provides a more integrated approach could fill a gap in the market.\n\n- **Focus on Flexibility**: Ensure that your SDK allows for flexibility and customization. Different projects may have unique requirements, and a one-size-fits-all approach might limit its appeal.\n\n- **Community Feedback**: Engaging with the developer community could provide valuable insights. Gathering feedback on what features are most needed could help shape your SDK.\n\n- **Market Demand**: Assessing the demand for such a solution is crucial. If many developers express similar frustrations, it could indicate a viable market for your product.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this further, consider looking into existing frameworks and identifying what they lack. This could help you create a more compelling offering.",

This tool is designed specifically for extracting data from Glassdoor, including job listings.\n\n- **Set Up Your Scraper**:\n  - Create an account on Apify for free.\n  - Add the URLs of the Glassdoor pages you want to scrape into the scraper's input fields. You can include various types of pages such as job postings, company reviews, etc.\n  \n- **Start the Scraping Process**: Once your URLs are set, click the \"Start\" button to begin scraping. The tool will run and extract the data you need.\n\n- **Export the Data**: After the scraping process is complete, you can export the data in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or XML. This makes it easy to feed the data into your AI SDR.\n\n- **Automation**: If you're looking to scrape at a larger scale, consider automating the process using Apify Actors, which can schedule and manage your scraping tasks efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the tutorial on how to scrape Glassdoor [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j6u272j).",

Not ones that auto reply to everything, but agents that triage, summarize long threads, and draft responses so I’m never starting from scratch. That alone saves mental energy every day.\n\nFor travel or food, I trust agents more as filters than deciders. I like when an agent narrows options based on constraints and context, then lets me choose. When those agents pull real availability, prices, or menus from the web in a stable way, they become much more useful. That’s where reliable browsing matters. If an agent can actually check current info through a predictable setup like hyperbrowser instead of guessing, I’m far more likely to trust the suggestion.\n\nOverall, most people still default to ChatGPT style chats, but agents start to feel valuable when they handle background work continuously. The moment you stop thinking “I need to ask the AI” and just get a helpful nudge or summary, that’s when daily life agents really click.",

It's really good at making agents that actually talk to each other and work together. Has like 44k stars on GitHub so people clearly like it.\n\n**CrewAI** \\- This one's blowing up right now. The whole idea is you build a \"crew\" of agents with different roles - like one does research, one writes, one edits. It's hit 900k downloads which is kinda nuts. Super Python-friendly.\n\n**Devin AI** \\- Okay this one's wild. It's basically an AI junior developer that can actually code for you, has its own terminal and browser, and can deploy stuff. Not gonna lie, it's a bit scary how good it is.\n\n**The No-Code Options:**\n\n**Flowise** \\- Drag and drop interface, works with a ton of different AI models. Perfect if you're not trying to become a coding wizard but still want to build cool stuff.\n\n**Zapier Central** \\- If you're already using Zapier, this is a no-brainer. Connect your AI agents to literally thousands of apps. No coding needed.\n\n**Botpress** \\- Great for chatbots specifically. Low-code, pretty intuitive.\n\n**The Enterprise Stuff:**\n\n**Qodo** \\- Built for companies with complex setups. Handles multiple repos and complicated workflows without breaking a sweat.\n\n**Vertex AI** \\- Google's offering. It's their full ML platform, so it's got everything but might be overkill if you're just tinkering.\n\n**Worth Mentioning:**\n\n**SuperAGI** \\- Has a nice GUI, production-ready **Voiceflow** \\- If you want voice assistants, not just text **AgentFlow** \\- Wraps a bunch of other tools together in one platform\n\n**Real talk:** The space is moving FAST. What's hot right now is multi-agent systems (agents working together) and tools that are actually ready for real products, not just demos. Also, seeing a split between \"I want to code everything\" tools and \"just let me drag and drop\" tools.\n\nIf you're just starting? Go with CrewAI or Flowise depending on if you code or not. If you're building something serious? LangChain is probably your friend, even though the docs can be annoying sometimes.\n\nThe whole vibe in 2026 is that this stuff is finally getting production-ready instead of just being cool demos.",

      "text": "I’ve been experimenting with AI agents for a while now, and something keeps coming up. Agents look great when they operate on structured inputs or well defined APIs, but once they have to interact with real websites, dashboards, or internal tools, reliability drops fast.\n\nDynamic pages, auth flows, inconsistent UI states, partial loads… all of that turns a “smart” agent into something brittle very quickly. I’ve tried different orchestration frameworks and models, and the issue rarely feels like reasoning. It’s almost always execution and grounding.\n\nLately I’ve been thinking more about treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure instead of something the agent improvises against. Tools like hyperbrowser made me rethink this, not as an agent framework, but as a way to give agents a stable place to observe and act so failures are actually debuggable.\n\nCurious how others here are handling this. Are you avoiding UI level automation entirely, building heavy guardrails, or relying on specialized environments?",

Once an agent leaves a clean contract and has to deal with UI state, timing, or auth, it becomes less about intelligence and more about whether the environment is predictable. A lot of failures feel impossible to reason about after the fact because you cannot tell if it was a perception issue, a state change, or a silent UI drift. Treating the execution surface as infrastructure makes sense to me, especially if it gives you replayability and traces. Otherwise you are just tuning prompts against a moving target and calling it agent reliability.",

Here are a few thoughts on the topic:\n\n- **Brittleness in Dynamic Environments**: Many agents struggle with dynamic web pages due to issues like changing DOM structures, authentication flows, and inconsistent UI states. This can lead to failures that are hard to debug.\n\n- **Execution vs. Reasoning**: As you've noted, the problems often stem from execution rather than reasoning. Agents may be capable of understanding tasks but falter when it comes to interacting with unpredictable web interfaces.\n\n- **Infrastructure Perspective**: Treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure is an interesting approach. By providing a stable environment for agents to operate, you can potentially reduce the number of failures and make debugging easier.\n\n- **Guardrails and Specialized Environments**: Some developers opt for heavy guardrails to manage interactions with UI elements, while others may use specialized environments or tools designed to handle the complexities of web automation more effectively.\n\nIf you're looking for more insights or specific frameworks that address these issues, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "A lot of people are disappointed after building their first “AI agent.” It works in a demo… then collapses the moment you try to run it twice, scale it, or trust it with real work.\n\nThe failure usually isn’t the model. It’s the **architecture**.\n\nMost agent projects fail because they’re built like *chatbots with tools* instead of **agent-native systems**. There’s a big difference.\n\nHere are a few patterns that actually matter if you want something resembling a Digital FTE:\n\n**1. Agents should execute specs, not vibes**  \nIn reliable systems, agents don’t just “figure it out.” They operate against explicit specifications: inputs, outputs, constraints, and success criteria. This makes behavior repeatable and auditable instead of probabilistic chaos.\n\n**2. Orchestration is a control plane, not a loop**  \nA simple `while(true)` agent loop is not orchestration. Real orchestration decides:\n\n* which agent runs\n* with what context\n* under what conditions\n* and when to stop or escalate\n\nWithout this, you don’t have a worker — you have an infinite prompt generator.\n\n**3. State must survive the model**  \nIf all your state lives inside the LLM context window, your agent is amnesic. Agent-native systems treat state as external and persistent so work can resume, be inspected, or be corrected later.\n\n**4. Tools > text**  \nMature agents spend most of their time calling tools, not generating prose. The model reasons *about* actions; the system executes actions deterministically. This is how you reduce hallucinations and increase trust.\n\n**5. Failure paths are first-class**  \nHuman workers escalate when something is unclear. Digital FTEs need the same behavior. If your agent never says “I’m unsure,” it’s not autonomous — it’s dangerous.\n\nNone of this is flashy, but this is the difference between:\n\n* “Cool demo”\n* and “Something you can actually deploy”\n\nI’m still building and learning in this space, but the biggest takeaway so far is this: **agent systems look more like distributed systems than prompt engineering**.\n\nCurious how others here are thinking about agent reliability and orchestration — especially outside toy examples.",

If you can’t explain why a step was allowed, blocked, or escalated after the fact, you don’t really have an agent — you have a one-shot suggestion generator with memory loss.\n\nFailure paths are the tell. Real systems assume disagreement, uncertainty, and interruption as the default, not the edge case. If escalation isn’t structurally possible, autonomy is just optimism.\n\nTotally agree on the distributed systems comparison.

      "text": "I’ve been building and testing AI agents over the past year, and the industry is evolving so quickly that keeping up can feel impossible. Instead of focusing only on technical frameworks, I grouped tools by how much setup or coding effort they require. Here’s a practical list based on my experience.\n\nNo / Low-Code Tools (Great for Fast Deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no code AI agent focused on execution rather than complex setup. You simply describe or demonstrate the task, and it performs the actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than configuring automation, making it ideal for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflow creation and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be challenging for beginners, but it’s very powerful once set up.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors without writing much code, but still tweak if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, though requiring the desktop app can be restrictive for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Early stage but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n***High Code / Developer Focused Tools***\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for using Claude models directly. Powerful if you’re already in the Anthropic ecosystem, though integration options are limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is updated frequently and maintained actively. Great for developers wanting robust integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph / LangChain / LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the existing Lang ecosystem. Best for those familiar with Lang tools, offering easy observability and several integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nHighly abstracted framework that allows flexibility across models and ecosystems. Suitable for developers who prefer model agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nAn early entrant in autonomous agents. Popular for its history, though maintenance is limited. Best for experimentation and learning purposes.\n\nCurious to hear what tools others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms that you’ve found practical in 2026?",

The no‑code platforms feel more like delegation (you describe the task, it executes), while the high‑code ones are closer to building a system from scratch where you define the logic and observability.\n\nWhat I’m curious about is how these tools evolve beyond “execution engines” into something that manages relationships and memory. Dashboards give you data, but agents are starting to act like collaborators. That shift changes not just the technical stack but how we design workflows around them.\n\nPersonally I’ve been experimenting with CrewAI and LangFlow for quick prototyping, then moving into LangGraph when I want more control. Would love to hear if anyone’s found newer platforms that balance ease of use with deeper context management.",

While AI tools have indeed made it easier to produce content, they have also democratized access to high-quality outputs, leading to increased competition.\n- The ease of production means that more people can create and share their work, but this saturation can make it challenging for individual contributions to stand out.\n- As a result, the average quality of work may have improved, but so have the expectations from audiences and consumers. This can lead to a scenario where only exceptional work is recognized, leaving mediocre efforts overlooked.\n- In essence, while AI can facilitate the shipping of work, it also demands a higher standard of quality and originality to capture attention and be taken seriously.\n\nFor further insights on the implications of AI in various domains, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h)\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)",

I’ve been saying this a long time but software engineering was ‘solved’ as far as ‘how it’s done’ - microservices and distributed resources. For some reason everyone forgot when AI came around… it’s been confusing. \n\nLearn advanced RAG techniques. Built out tooling to make it easy to perform RAG over any corpus.

Every conversation look for opportunities to ‘flex’. Don’t be annoying (it’s a fine line) but it’s OK to talk about things you’ve done/worked on if it’s relevant. \n\nFinally, always look for work. Even if you get a job - these skills are the highest demand skills and the more projects you do the more valuable you become. Take on side gigs, keep your resume up to date, be proactive: if someone has a question you are confident about answering, just ask - ‘do you need help?’ \n\nCheers!",

Those two packages are literally all you need for (on top of OpenAI’s Agents SDK) to build 99% of solutions. Don’t use MCP as an API wrapper… that’s dumb.

I’ve done it for myself extensively and now for a handful of companies… some extremely large (tens of millions of documents). \n\nI realized early that some form of RAG is needed by literally every company in the world and, as people start having personal assistants I didn’t want to rely on OpenAI or Anthropic or *whoever* to be responsible for managing my context. As such, I built a sovereign context management box that is essentially a mini datacenter in a 10U server rack flight case. It’s a Kubernetes cluster running distributed agents and HA, durable storage with on-board local LLM compute. I then proceeded to build connectors for every part of my life: meetings, email, text messages, life… needed a system to store and retrieve it. It became more complex but more performant over time. Then I found a few companies and people who were also interested in managing their context outside of corporate control so I built them systems. \n\nI went into a little detail recently here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/n1Sp1jaKW2. \n\nAnyway… it was a multi-year learning path. For a shortcut I recommend just starting with graphRAG and understanding how to store data without a bunch of duplication and how to interface search between vectors and graph traversal and how you build the architecture for artifact storage, summaries, etc. \n\nHope that helps lol",

GraphRAG is the core of making a system scalable into the millions of documents. Figuring out the modules that can generally ingest and retrieve arbitrary information from an arbitrary set of documents reliably is a huge skill win. \n\nFrom there you can build anything - literally just add voice to your agentic search demonstrates another valuable skill (voice agents are in big demand despite very few places actually implementing currently. The need is real, the risk is high though so it takes skill. Beyond that, the world is your oyster.",

      "text": "I get it, AI has made it easier to build software, but it’s not as if you can magically do months worth of coding in days or even weeks.\n\nHere’s the pattern I’ve discovered:\n\nThere are a bunch of creators who have hyped people up, saying you do not need to have coding knowledge to build AI systems. Is it true? No.\n\nUnless your job is to build small demos/MVPs or content on AI.\n\nYou might be able to sell your “product” by showing your leads the automation you built on n8n but when it’s time to deploy it into the real world, it’ll fail on day 1.\n\nHere’s a recent case study from one of my leads:\n\nThey needed a WhatsApp reservation and admin system for a network of \\~9000 restaurants.\n\nSo they did what most people feel is the logical solution, hire developers.\n\nThe developers that they had, built a WhatsApp bot using n8n. They showed it to the client, it worked fine. Because obviously it’s a simple chatbot so you can’t really do much with it except talk.\n\nCan you jailbreak it? Piece of cake.\n\nDoes it have any logical awareness? No.\n\nIs it anywhere close to a usable demo? Not at all.\n\nSo they start reaching out to people who can actually build the system. That’s where I come into picture.\n\nThey tell me, they already have a system built “halfway” and need me to finish it in the next 3 days (that too for free lmfao, I’ll get to this part later).\n\nMy CTO sits with their developer and sees the system they had.\n\nSurprise! The system is just an n8n template copy pasted with vibe coding done all over (the guy didn’t even remove the ChatGPT comments in the code).\n\nSo I tell them, that this cannot be done within 3 days. Your system is pretty much useless, we’ll have to build everything from scratch. We can give you a small demo in the next 12 days, but that requires a certain upfront payment so that we can start working.\n\nThat’s where he paused and told “he’ll talk to his partners”.\n\nApparently all of their budget was already allocated to marketing, they hired a lot of sales people and could only allocate the budget for “API Token costs”.\n\nSo yeah, we’re not going forward with them.\n\nP.S. they would’ve paid us once 4-5 restaurants would’ve found the system useful, then they’d recommend it to the 6th restaurant and this time charge money.\n\nNow here comes the issue: People have learned how to put together different blocks on no code tools and call it a day. But someone who had actual coding knowledge knows that it’s only the start.\n\nHere’s the things which were missing from the WhatsApp n8n automation they had:\n\n1. Edge cases.\n\nNobody tested how the system would reply if there were unwanted inputs, which is like the 90% of human input. The automation kept talking rubbish when things went out of context.\n\n2. No guard rails.\n\nIt was extremely easy to jailbreak the system. Few fishy prompts and it would give away every single internal data to the user.\n\n3. Sky high costs.\n\nThe workflow had no structure. The vibecoded schema would have cost about 10-20$ on an average per user. Rest you can calculate how costly the operation would be if they even got 10,000 users :) (Apparently they kept pushing every single thing through LLM and the tokens would’ve kept compounding overtime, not gonna go into details).\n\n4. No GDPR knowledge.\n\nBeing a bad developer is one thing, but when it comes to WhatsApp, how come people don’t think about the GDPR rules??? Unless you’re asking for trouble.\n\n5. Overpromises.\n\nAI can do everything! Add unlimited features and make revenue based promises to the clients!\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause people are underestimating how hard it is to really create a scalable and usable AI system.\n\nThere are thousands of people selling themselves as one man dev team who can apparently build saas level systems on his own that too for free.\n\nWhy for free? Because no one hires them, I mean why should they? When your services are pretty much useless.\n\nBut when new business owners enter this market, they get a feeling that AI has made software development very easy, cheap and almost free. So they have sky high expectations. Every single guy out there is legit selling his “business changing automation” for free. Is that how software industry works? NO.\n\nThese no code tools have only added more to the noise. I see so many people who have made absurd promises to their clients which apparently AI can magically solve. They promise to give a demo + result for free. Then they start building using no code tools, fail miserably, try to find builders, get faced by the fact that even demos need some capital to be built, ultimately they are simply unable to deliver.\n\nConclusion? AI has not made the market cheap, but more complex. People who do not have good software development knowledge CANNOT build scalable AI systems just because they are good at operating no code tools.\n\nSo if you’re a business owner, watch out. It’s hard to find the right people for the job when there’s so much noise.\n\nPro tip: if someone is providing you something for free, chances are. It was worth the same.",

When the bot gives a confident wrong answer, loops, or leaks context, who sees it, who can explain why it happened, and how fast can it be unwound. Most of these glued together systems have no visibility or brakes, so the first failure turns into a customer trust problem, not a technical one.\n\nAI did not make systems cheaper, it moved the cost into design, guardrails, and accountability. If someone is skipping those because “it’s just automation,” the bill shows up later as escalations, legal risk, and churn. That part never makes it into the hype posts.",

Claude Agent SDK handles what happens inside each node — full agent capabilities, tool use, context, not just raw API responses.\n\nYou define your workflow graph in LangGraph, but each node calls the SDK instead of hitting the API directly. You get the best of both and you're not burning credits while prototyping.\n\nBuilt an 11-agent system with this. Research agents run in parallel, analysis agents process outputs, synthesis agents compile reports. LangGraph controls the flow, SDK powers every step.\n\nDocumented the whole thing into a workshop because I genuinely couldn't find this anywhere online.\n\nMaybe there's a reason everyone's using direct calls and I'm missing it. But this has been working well for months. Curious what others think — anyone tried something similar?",

It supports BYOK and can help you to organize local files, automate browsers end-to-end.\n\nAt the core is CAMEL’s Workforce system, which is inspired by distributing systems: a root node for task planning and coordination, worker nodes for execution, and an asynchronous task channel. It also supports failure tolerance and recursive workers for long-horizon tasks. All of this is open source.\n\nFor browser automation, Eigent uses a two-layer architecture:\n\n* a Python layer for agent reasoning and orchestration\n* a TypeScript layer (built on Playwright) for native browser control (DOM ops, SoM markers, occlusion handling)\n\nThese two layers communicate asynchronously via WebSockets to keep things low-latency and avoid the limits of Python-only automation. This stack is also open source.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests!",

What breaks is state, assumptions about inputs, flaky tools, or unclear stopping conditions. Once an agent touches real data or real apps, every hidden shortcut shows up fast.\n\nAnother big realization was how much execution stability matters. When agents interact with the web or dashboards, running those steps in a predictable environment like hyperbrowser made a noticeable difference. It helped separate “bad reasoning” from “the world behaved differently than expected.” After that, agents became less impressive but far more useful, which is usually the trade you want in real workflows.",

          "text": "- One significant lesson is the importance of having a robust framework for evaluating AI agents. Without proper evaluation metrics, it can be challenging to determine how well an agent performs in real-world scenarios. This includes tracking agent-specific metrics, visibility into planning and tool use, and managing costs and latency effectively. [Introducing Agentic Evaluations - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3zymprct)\n\n- Another key takeaway is the need for clear orchestration among multiple agents. As workflows become more complex, ensuring that agents do not duplicate efforts or fail to complete tasks is crucial. Using an orchestrator can help coordinate these agents effectively. [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)\n\n- Additionally, understanding the reasoning cycle of AI agents—reason, act, observe, and respond—can help in designing more effective workflows. This structured approach allows agents to handle complex tasks more dynamically than traditional systems. [Do You Really Understand AI Agents? - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/4vr8vdz6)\n\n- Finally, the integration of AI agents into existing systems can be simplified with platforms that streamline deployment and reduce code complexity. This can significantly enhance the development process and make it easier to create reliable AI solutions.

Run the code, it either passes the tests or it doesn't. There's no debate, no interpretation, just a binary signal. That's massive for training AI systems.\n\nThe feedback loop is also absurdly tight. You write something, hit run, get an error with a stack trace pointing to line 47, fix it, done. The whole cycle takes seconds. Compare that to real-world processes where you make a decision and find out six months later if it was good, through vague signals like \"the client seemed unhappy\" or quarterly revenue dipping.\n\nOn top of that, errors in code are structured. You don't get fuzzy complaints, you get standardized error codes, line numbers, logs that are parseable and consistent. The signal is clean. In the real world, feedback is noisy, ambiguous, and often contradictory.\n\nPlus there's millions of examples online: code repos, Stack Overflow threads, documentation. The training data basically maps problems to solutions directly.\n\nSo yeah, coding gets crushed by AI because it's the rare domain where success is objective, feedback is instant, and the signal is crystal clear. Most human activities don't have any of that, which is why AI struggles there.",

          "text": "It's common to feel overwhelmed when diving into building agents, especially with the plethora of tools and frameworks available. Here are some thoughts that might resonate:\n\n- **Start Small**: Instead of aiming for a complex agent, consider a simple use case. For example, automating a repetitive task you do daily, like summarizing emails or gathering data from a website. This can help build confidence without the pressure of perfection.\n\n- **Use Existing Templates**: Platforms like Apify offer templates that can jumpstart your projects. For instance, the [CrewAI](https://tinyurl.com/jc5bza4w) framework provides a structured way to define agents and integrate them with tools, which might lower the barrier for you.\n\n- **Focus on a Specific Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in your daily routine. This could be anything from social media analysis to automating data entry. When you have a clear problem to solve, it can guide your development process.\n\n- **Set Time Limits**: Allocate a specific amount of time to work on your agent. This can help combat perfectionism and keep you moving forward. Even if you don't finish, you'll have made progress.\n\n- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities can provide motivation and inspiration. Sharing your struggles might lead to suggestions or collaboration opportunities that can help you overcome hurdles.\n\n- **Iterate and Improve**: Remember that your first agent doesn't have to be perfect. Build something functional, then iterate on it. Each version can improve based on feedback and your own experiences.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, consider checking out the [AI agent workflow](https://tinyurl.com/3rppepvb) for insights on building agents that query datasets. It might spark some ideas for your own projects.",
