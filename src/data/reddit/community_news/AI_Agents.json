Parsing matters: Suggested by fellow redditor and upon doing my own research using Docling (IBM’s open-source parser) → outputs perfect Markdown with intact tables, headers, lists. No more broken table context.\n2. Hybrid search (semantic + keyword): Dense (e5-base-v2 → RaBitQ quantized in Milvus) + sparse BM25. Never misses exact terms like product codes, dates, SKUs, names.\n3. Aggressive reranking: Pull top-50 from Milvus - run bge-reranker-v2-m3 to keep only top-5. This alone cut wrong-context answers by \\~60%. Milvus is best DB I have found ( there are also other great too )\n4. Strict system prompt + RAGAS: This is a key point make sure there is reasoning and strict system prompts\n\nIf you’re building anything with document, try adding Docling + hybrid + strong reranker—you’ll see the jump immediately. Happy to share prompt/configs\n\nThanks",

          "text": "Is your prompt something like this? \n\nTo implement the \"Strict Reasoning\" approach mentioned by Op, the system prompt needs to act as a gatekeeper. It must force the AI to show its work before giving an answer and provide a clear \"exit ramp\" if the information is missing.\nHere is a template designed to work with the Hybrid + Rerank architecture. It uses a \"Chain of Verification\" style to prevent the AI from making leaps of logic.\n\nThe \"Strict RAG\" System Prompt\nRole: You are a precise Technical Research Assistant. Your sole purpose is to answer questions based strictly on the provided context.\nConstraints:\n * Source Grounding: Only use the information provided in the <context> tags. If the answer is not present, or if the context is insufficient to be certain, state: \"I am sorry, but the provided documents do not contain enough information to answer this.\"\n * No External Knowledge: Do not use your internal training data to supplement facts, dates, SKUs, or technical specs.\n * Table Integrity: When referencing data from tables, maintain the exact values and units.\nResponse Format:\nTo ensure accuracy, you must process the request in these steps:\n * <analysis>: Briefly list the specific facts found in the context that are relevant to the user's query.\n * <reasoning>: Explain how those facts connect to answer the question. If there is a contradiction in the documents, note it here.\n * <answer>: Provide the final concise response.\n\nWhy this works with OP'S \"Docling + Reranker\" setup:\n * The <analysis> tag: Since Docling provides clean Markdown, this step forces the LLM to \"read\" the Markdown tables or headers explicitly before answering. This prevents it from glossing over small but vital details.\n * The \"I Don't Know\" Clause: By providing a specific phrase to use when info is missing, you stop the LLM from trying to be \"helpful\" by making things up—which is the #1 cause of RAG hallucinations.\n * Logical Buffer: The BGE-Reranker ensures the top 5 snippets are high quality; the <reasoning> step ensures the LLM doesn't hallucinate a connection between two snippets that aren't actually related.",

A DJ named Sonny Nix who drops in every few tracks with dry, deadpan commentary about work life. Think \"late night radio host who's seen too many spreadsheets.\"\n\n\n\nThe goal: background music for deep work sessions with the occasional joke that makes you feel seen.\n\n\n\nWhat's automated:\n\n\\- Music generated with Suno (specifically trained prompts for consistent 1950s jazz style)\n\n\\- Voice generated with ElevenLabs (custom V3 emotional prompts for timing and delivery)\n\n\n\nWhat's human:\n\n\\- Every joke. Every painful observation about your inbox. Every fake ad for \"Scope Creep Insurance.\" The copy is handcrafted. Sonny needed something to say - that part doesn't automate.\n\n\\- I assemble everything by hand, I make it realistic and authentic\n\n\n\nThe AI is the instrument. The writing is mine.\n\n\n\n3-hour episodes. New one every day. Designed to fade into the background until Sonny says something that makes you pause and think \"...okay that one hurt.\"\n\n\n\nThrow it on during your next build session. Would love to know if it helps you focus - or if Sonny's jokes land!",

I think when the base content is human made but AI helps to express it, this is a powerful tool.

From an ops lens, the consistency of a daily 3 hour output is the impressive part.

So when it comes to the project itself on the time costs, I deliberately make these as a diversification of the \"Nikolytics\" brand. It is a passion project as a main thing, but has the element of showing my personality to potential clients. Now to the math, the jokes take around 20-30 minutes for a stacks (30 bits per video), 49 distinct artists with engineered prompts now takes little time since I have them as \"personas\". The biggest drain is the DAW where I arrange the whole thing, easing in, easing out, making sure it's on point, mixing everything since Sonny volume varies a bunch etc. So it's around 2 hours daily. But it's fine, I love every second of it. Hope that answered your question, if not, shoot!",

Why let the agent decide the planning every time a user asks about something which would lead to different workflows for the same requests, rather then decide on tasks and workflow upfront. The later leads to more predicable and accurate behavior. Downside would be less flexible, we would need more agent to satisfy different workflows.

Dashboards would always have a static view with a few filters showing just a few charts and numbers.. it rarely allowed us to go really deeper (for which we had to move to notebooks etc). Agents can not only be on the surface but can also go deeper and across sources and do a pretty reasonably job at synthesising information. \n\nAm I thinking right?\n\nIm going to write about this topic on my blog and if someone has really replaced dashboards with agents successfully, I love to know how.

Then I attach ClickHouse MCP and it works beyond any expectation I originally had.\n\nWhere I earlier had to dig around logs and create complicated static dashboards to get sufficient operational context out of our network logs , it is now more and more shifting over to prompting the agent and it is able to quickly drill down through layers upon layers of data.\n\nSome simple dashboards are kept but for key metrics but for any advanced insights agents is where it is at, at least for me.",

          "text": "It sounds like you're on the right track with your observations about the shift from dashboards to agents for analytics. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Dynamic Analysis**: Agents can perform deeper exploratory analysis by synthesizing information from multiple sources, which is a significant advantage over static dashboards that typically present limited views.\n  \n- **Cross-Functional Insights**: Agents can facilitate cross-functional analysis more effectively than dashboards, which often require manual adjustments and may not provide the necessary depth for complex inquiries.\n\n- **Iterative Research**: The ability of agents to iterate on research questions and refine their outputs based on new information allows for a more comprehensive understanding of data compared to the fixed nature of dashboards.\n\n- **Customization**: Agents can be tailored to specific needs, allowing for more personalized insights that dashboards may not accommodate.\n\nWhile dashboards will likely remain useful for certain applications, the trend towards using agents for more complex analytical tasks seems to be gaining traction. If you're looking for examples of successful implementations, exploring case studies or discussions in the AI and analytics communities might yield some insights. \n\nFor further reading on the capabilities of agents in research and analysis, you might find this article helpful: [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd).",

Some turned out to be hype, but a few genuinely surprised me with how autonomous, reliable, or impactful they were.\n\nFor example, we used Intercom's Fin agent to build an order tracking system that automatically handles \"where's my order\" inquiries by pulling data from our fulfillment system, checking carrier status, and responding with accurate ETAs. That alone saved our CS team about 5 hours daily. \n\nSo curious, as we enter 2026, what were your favorite AI agents you discovered this past year?",

Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!  \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor! \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content!\n5. Clay: 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.  ",

      "text": "**RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Agents in 2026: the thing that actually wins is state-aware retrieval**\n\nEveryone frames this like a debate: RAG vs fine-tuning vs agents.\n\nIn real production systems, those aren’t competitors. They’re layers.\n\nMy hot take after building and watching systems break:\n\nThe practical winner in 2026 is “state-aware retrieval” — not plain RAG, not “agents everywhere,” and not fine-tuning as the default.\n\nMost teams are shipping one of these two extremes:\n\nStatic RAG: embed docs, top-k similarity, dump chunks into a prompt\n\nOver-agenting: tools + planner + loops… still fed by mediocre retrieval\n\nBoth fail in the same place: the system doesn’t “know what to fetch” for this moment.\n\nThe real problem: retrieval is treated like a database query… but built like a lottery\n\nStatic top-k works for simple Q&A.\n\nIt collapses when users do normal human things:\n\nchange their mind mid-thread\n\nrefer to “that earlier thing”\n\nask for something that spans multiple docs/sources\n\nask for a plan that requires constraints (budget, policy, system state)\n\nask questions that look similar semantically but require different knowledge (pricing vs compliance vs implementation)\n\nThis is why people say “RAG is meh” or “agents are flaky.”\n\nIt’s not that RAG is dead.\n\nIt’s that retrieval is under-specified.\n\nWhat works: stop retrieving chunks; start building a retrieval plan\n\nThink of your system like this:\n\nUser message → interpretation → retrieval plan → retrieval execution → answer or action\n\nThat middle piece is what most stacks ignore.\n\nA retrieval plan is just a structured decision like:\n\nWhat is the user really trying to do? (intent)\n\nWhat constraints matter? (policy, budget, availability, permissions)\n\nWhat context should be remembered? (session + durable memory)\n\nWhich knowledge sources are relevant? (collections / namespaces / tools)\n\nDo we need one hop or multiple hops? (lookup → refine → verify)\n\nThis is where systems start feeling “agentic” without needing a big autonomous loop.\n\nThe pattern (grounded, implementable)\n\nA minimal production-friendly pattern looks like:\n\nState extraction\n\nExtract: intent, entities, constraints, risk level, and “what would make this wrong”\n\nSource routing\n\nDecide where to look: product docs, tickets, CRM, policies, codebase, past convo memory, etc.\n\nQuery construction\n\nBuild 1–3 targeted queries (not one vague embedding query)\n\nRetrieval with controls\n\nUse metadata filters + recency + access control + diversity (avoid 5 near-duplicate chunks)\n\nSynthesis with citations / traceability\n\nAnswer with grounded references + keep a compact trace for later\n\nThat’s it. No sci-fi. Just good systems engineering.\n\nWhy dataset structure matters more than people admit\n\nIf your data is “big pile of text,” retrieval can only do “big pile of guesses.”\n\nIf your knowledge is structured with:\n\nentities (products, endpoints, policies, SKUs, teams)\n\nrelationships (depends_on, supersedes, owned_by, compatible_with)\n\nmetadata (version, locale, customer tier, priority, last_updated)\n\n…then retrieval becomes composable.\n\nThe system can reliably pull the right info, not just similar info.\n\nThis is also why many “agents” look smart in demos and fall apart in real use:\n\nthey’re powered by a prompt, not by an information structure.\n\nWhere fine-tuning actually fits (and where it doesn’t)\n\nFine-tuning is great when you need:\n\nconsistent output formatting / style\n\ntool calling behavior that must be stable\n\ndomain language that’s hard to learn from small context windows\n\nclassification/routing models you want cheap and fast\n\nFine-tuning is not the best default for “keeping knowledge up to date.”\n\nIf your source of truth changes weekly, you’ll hate your retrain loop.\n\nIn most builder stacks, I’d use fine-tuning as a behavior stabilizer, not a knowledge store.\n\nWhere “agents” fit (in reality)\n\nAgents shine when you need:\n\nmulti-step workflows\n\ntool use across systems (tickets, emails, databases)\n\nverification steps (“check, then act”)\n\nlong tasks with intermediate state\n\nBut here’s the key:\n\nAgents don’t fix retrieval. They amplify it.\n\nIf retrieval is wrong, an agent just becomes confidently wrong at scale.\n\nThe 2026 stack I’m betting on\n\nNot “RAG vs agents.” It’s:\n\nState-aware retrieval as the backbone\n\nSmall, reliable decision layers (routing / policy / tone / risk)\n\nTool-using workflows only where needed\n\nLight fine-tuning for stability, formats, and cheap routing\n\nEvals + tracing so you can iterate like engineers, not gamblers\n\nIf you’ve ever felt “my agent is smart but inconsistent,” this is usually why.",

Static similarity search breaks when users shift intent, reference earlier context, or need multi‑document, constraint‑aware reasoning, while agents still depend on weak retrieval underneath. The fix isn’t abandoning RAG but replacing “retrieve chunks” with a retrieval plan that interprets intent, constraints, memory, relevant sources, and whether multi‑step lookup is needed—creating systems that feel agentic without heavy autonomous loops.",

The root nodes act as the router, the agent can move about the file by [2] style links. Can be searched directly or with grep, versioned, edited, diffed, basically a graph in a flat text file, and a format friendly for the agent.\n\nThe idea being - if you build the system like a graph, the agent can find the information navigating over it by links instead of similarities. You can scale a graph as large as you like, or even add similarity based search to the direct link navigation. The cool thing is that you can merge a lot of information in a graph, I got to 500 nodes with one. For software projects I get to 100 nodes.\n\nSo the solution I see is \"replace similarity rankings with link navigation\". It fixes the similarity based RAG problem of disconnected chunks",

I've seen this pattern break down constantly when users reference previous context or need information that spans multiple document types. The \"big pile of text\" problem you mentioned is real, especially when teams dump everything into embeddings without proper metadata tagging or entity extraction.\n\nYour point about data structure being the foundation hits hard. When I'm debugging why a system pulled irrelevant chunks, it's almost always because the chunking strategy didn't preserve enough context or the metadata wasn't granular enough to support proper filtering. The traceability piece matters too since with vectorflow.dev you get visibility into how documents got chunked before they hit your retrieval layer. What's your current approach for maintaining entity relationships across document boundaries when you're dealing with something like API docs that reference multiple services?",

DeepMind (UK): While part of Google, their London-based research remains the gold standard for machine learning and neural networks that push the boundaries of what autonomous agents can actually achieve in scientific and enterprise fields.\n3. Beetroot (Sweden/Ukraine): This is where the bridge between high-level strategy and execution happens. Beetroot stands out by combining a \"Lagom\" (balanced) Swedish management style with high-velocity engineering. They are particularly adept at building autonomous agents developers Europe needs for practical business cases, focusing on sustainable team scaling and long-term scalability.\n4. ElevenLabs (UK/Poland): Though famous for voice, their orchestration of AI agents that can interact naturally is setting new benchmarks for UX in the agentic space.\n5. Celonis (Germany): They aren’t just a data company anymore. By integrating AI agents into process mining, they allow enterprises to automate the \"fixing\" of business bottlenecks autonomously.\n6. 10Clouds (Poland): A strong contender in the AI agent development Europe scene, specifically for those looking to integrate LangChain and complex LLM stacks into existing products.\n7. Silo AI (Finland): As one of the largest private AI labs in Europe, they specialize in \"flagship\" AI projects, often building bespoke agents for heavy industry and telecommunications.\n8. STX Next (Poland): Known for their Python roots, they have pivoted heavily into agentic workflows, focusing on making Generative AI work within legacy enterprise architectures.\n9. Wayve (UK): Taking agents into the physical world. Their work on autonomous mobility shows how agents can handle real-world uncertainty using \"embodied\" AI.\n10. DeepL (Germany): While focused on translation, their recent API expansions allow agents to act as seamless multilingual intermediaries, a crucial component for global European brands.\n\nThe secret sauce for most of these companies is how they handle the reasoning layer. By using frameworks like LangChain or proprietary orchestration engines, they create a loop where the AI can check its own work. So, when looking for a partner, the question shouldn't be \"can you use an LLM?\" but rather \"can you build an agent that knows when it’s wrong?\"",

Foundation model labs (they power agents, but don’t usually “build your agent” end-to-end)\n2. Agent platforms / products (you buy a system)\n3. Implementation partners / dev shops (you hire a team to ship + integrate)\n\nIf the question is “who can actually deliver production agents in Europe?”, I’d shortlist like this:\n\nA) Model + sovereign deployment (EU-first constraints)\n\n* Mistral (FR)\n* Aleph Alpha (DE)\n\nB) Enterprise agent platforms (CX / voice / contact center)\n\n* Cognigy (DE)\n* PolyAI (UK)\n* Parloa (DE)\n* ElevenLabs (US, with major presence in UK/EU) — voice infra + “agent workflows”, depending on scope\n\nC) Orchestration / workflow automation (agentic automation in practice)\n\n* n8n (Berlin) — great glue layer when “agent” really means *multi-system automation*\n* Celonis (DE) — strong when the agent needs process context + enterprise ops\n\nD) Implementation partners (build + integrate + maintain)\n\n* 10Clouds (PL)\n* STX Next (PL)\n* Beetroot (SE/UA) (more generalist, but can execute well with the right spec)\n* Silo AI (FI) is legit historically, but note it’s now under AMD.\n\nAlso: DeepMind is research (world-class, but not a typical “agent dev company”), and DeepL is amazing but mostly a vertical product.\n\nBrand matters less than proof. I’d ask any vendor to show:\n\n* their eval harness (how they measure “agent success” + catch regressions)\n* tooling/permissions model (least-privilege, audit logs)\n* observability (traces, retries, human-in-the-loop points)\n* post-launch ownership (who maintains prompts/tools/data pipelines)\n\nHope this helps even a little.",

      "text": "Been playing around with these 5 Open Source AI Agents Repo's. Check them out:   \n  \n**1. AI Data Science Team** \n\n*The problem:* data science means spending 80% of time on boring prep work. Cleaning, feature engineering, SQL wrangling, visualization. Context switching everywhere.\n\n*How it works:* it's basically a team of specialized agents. You've got agents for cleaning, ML modeling, SQL queries, EDA, visualization. Each one knows its job. You say \"analyze this dataset and build a churn model,\" and the team figures out the flow. Cleaning agent preps the data, feature engineering agent adds what's needed, ML agent trains the model. The SQL Data Analyst agent is pretty solid, takes natural language and spits out SQL + visualizations. Saves you from jumping between tools constantly.\n\n**2. Agent Lightning by Microsoft** \n\n*The problem:* your agents make mistakes, but retraining means rewriting everything. Most people just accept mediocre agents instead of fixing them.\n\n*How it works:* this thing plugs into ANY framework. LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, raw Python, doesn't matter. Uses reinforcement learning to make agents learn from failures. The clever part? You can pick which agents in a multi-agent system to optimize. Router agent keeps messing up? Train just that one. And it's basically zero code changes. People are already running 128-GPU training with stable convergence. That's not a toy.\n\n**3. LibrePods by Solo Dev (kavishdevar)** \n\n*The problem:* you paid for AirPods Pro features but Apple locks them to their ecosystem. Cross-platform users get basic Bluetooth, nothing else.\n\n*How it works:* reverse-engineered Apple's protocols to unlock everything on Android and Linux. Noise control, ear detection, head gestures, hearing aid mode, dual-device connectivity. All the stuff Apple gatekeeps. It tricks your device into thinking it's an Apple product by spoofing Bluetooth packets. Catch is Android needs root because of Bluetooth stack issues (really Apple's fault for non-compliant behavior). 23.4k stars, clearly hit a nerve.\n\n**4. Reddit MCP Buddy by Solo Dev (karanb192)**\n\n*The problem:* connecting AI agents to Reddit means dealing with bloated responses and complex setup. Most Reddit tools return 100+ fields of garbage.\n\n*How it works:* clean MCP server that gives Claude (or any AI) direct Reddit access. Browse posts, search content, analyze users, get comments. Zero API keys to start. The whole point is LLM-optimized data, no fluff. Want higher rate limits? Add credentials. Otherwise just works. Perfect for agents that need Reddit integration without the noise.\n\n**5. Memory Layer for AI by Memvid** \n\n*The problem:* AI agents forget everything between sessions. Building persistent memory means vector databases, infrastructure, vendor lock-in.\n\n*How it works:* one portable .mv2 file that stores embeddings, search indices, everything. No databases, no setup. Drop in your docs/conversations/notes, it chunks and indexes automatically. Hybrid search (BM25 + semantic vectors) with sub-5ms latency. The file works everywhere, local or cloud, same performance. It's like giving agents a brain that actually remembers.  \n\n\nNow, these are tools for agents that learn, remember, and actually improve. And they're all open source so you can build on them.\n\nRepo Links in 1st comment 👇",

Agent Lightning and Memvid especially point toward agents that improve over time instead of just looping harder.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed while experimenting with similar repos is that execution still becomes the weak link once agents leave clean data and touch real apps or websites. Even the best planning falls apart if the environment is unstable. That’s why I’ve seen teams pair these kinds of agents with controlled execution layers like hyperbrowser when web interaction is involved, just to reduce random breakage.\n\nCurious if you tried combining any of these together yet, especially memory plus reinforcement learning. That combo feels like it sees around the corner a bit.",

That's quite something. we're a sfdc shop and had to do a bunch of stuff to make sure this doesn't happen to us. \n\n**for anyone who isn't aware of this, here's a quick breakdown:**\n\n* Attacker injected instructions on the web facing signup form into the 'description' field. \n* This form was connected to sfdc's agent force AI \n* Internal employee queries the AI normally and it executes the hidden instructions to leak the data to an expired domain which was still whitelisted.. let data exfil via \"images.\" PoC actually stole real emails.\n\nBelow is what we did but still think there could be something we're missing to make sure this doesn't happen to us.. landing in GDPR hell is the last thing we want rn. \n\n**Here's what we're doing to protect:**\n\n* patched the trusted URLs right after Salesforce pushed the fix\n* scrubbed every old lead for shady descriptions or hidden payloads\n* tightened our MCP layer with stricter controls and policies\n* built a data sandbox - stripped all PII, financials etc - so LLMs only can access from a constrained, governed view.\n\nWhat else do we need to do?",

For example an LLM only has access to data about the user that has been logged in.\nIt never has access to general data.\n\n\nAn LLM is not able to execute code or functions. It can only call tools. But those tools are, by code architecture design in such a way that they silo information based on access rights/users \n\n\nThis means if the user says:\nI want to know how many sales we had last April.\nThe LLM just calls the MCP with: user wants to know the count of sales in April for this subject.\nThe program itself sends to the MCP, irrespective of the LLM the user name that made the request and the files that the user has access to.\n\n\nThen it automatically validated if the user has access right to get the data it wants. And only then you might further engage with the LLM.\n\n\nYou don't give the entire responsibility for security to the LLM 😅\n\n\nLike it gives your MCP a file name and you just assume that it's safe to send all that info back ",

Plus, if you need to give the agent read access too for some reason then you somehow restrict this to individual rows or data items, never read-all.\n\nYou may also consider creating two separate agents with different access rights, one only writes to the CRM and the other only reads from it. Then, during the handover from one to the next action there has to be the human in the loop, approving the planned or requested action if the next agent.\n\nGenerally speaking it boils down to have a security model for your agent - often a subset of permissions compared to the impersonated human, but with less access, ideally.",

One thing that helped us was treating any user supplied text as untrusted forever, even after it’s inside the CRM, and being explicit about what an agent is never allowed to act on or transform. We also found value in having clear human review moments for anything that touches PII, even if it slows things slightly.

I also rely on agents that do background work rather than anything flashy. Stuff like monitoring dashboards, summarizing incoming info, and prepping first drafts so I am not starting from zero every time.\n\nOne thing that became part of my routine is letting agents handle web based checks for me. Instead of manually opening tools or admin panels, I let them run in a stable browser environment like hyperbrowser and just surface results when something changes. That quietly saves a lot of time without feeling like “using an AI tool.”\n\nThe pattern for me is that the agents I use daily are the ones I almost forget about. If I have to consciously decide to open them, they usually do not stick.",

      "text": "Most AI agents need access to structured data (CRMs, databases, warehouses), but giving them database access is a security nightmare. Having worked with companies on deploying agents in production environments, I'm sharing an architecture overview of what's been most useful- hope this helps!   \n  \n**Layer 1: Data Sources**  \nYour raw data repositories (Salesforce, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, etc.). Traditional ETL/ELT approaches to clean and transform it needs to be done here.  \n  \n**Layer 2: Agent Views (The Critical Boundary)**  \nMaterialized SQL views that are sandboxed from the source acting as controlled windows for LLMs to access your data. You know what data the agent needs to perform it's task. You can define exactly the columns agents can access (for example, removing PII columns, financial data or conflicting fields that may confuse the LLM)  \n  \nThese views:  \n• Join data across multiple sources  \n• Filter columns and rows  \n• Apply rules/logic  \n  \nAgents can ONLY access data through these views. They can be tightly scoped at first and you can always optimize it's scope to help the agent get what's necessary to do it's job.  \n  \n**Layer 3: MCP Tool Interface**  \nModel Context Protocol (MCP) tools built on top of agent data views. Each tool includes:  \n• Function name and description (helps LLM select correctly)  \n• Parameter validation i.e required inputs (e.g customer\\_id is required)  \n• Policy checks (e.g user A should never be able to query user B's data)  \n  \n**Layer 4: AI Agent Layer**  \nYour LLM-powered agent (LangGraph, Cursor, n8n, etc.) that:  \n• Interprets user queries  \n• Selects appropriate MCP tools  \n• Synthesizes natural language responses  \n  \n**Layer 5: User Interface**  \nEnd users asking questions and receiving answers (e.g via AI chatbots)  \n  \n*The Flow:*  \nUser query → Agent selects MCP tool → Policy validation → Query executes against sandboxed view → Data flows back → Agent responds  \n  \nAgents must never touch raw databases - the agent view layer is the single point of control, with every query logged for complete observability into what data was accessed, by whom, and when.  \n  \nThis architecture enables AI agents to work with your data while maintaining:  \n• Complete security and access control  \n• Reduces LLMs from hallucinating  \n• Agent views acts as the single control and command plane for agent-data interaction  \n• Compliance-ready audit trails",

For example an agent that get emails request of customers who want to buy something and new orders or SOW requests need to be added to the sale system etc.\n\nApart from adding or updating information the security needs more thought:\n1. In many cases you don’t want to restrict the agent from accessing the data, but you want to restrict what the agent can give back to different users. Like an HR agent that is allowed to tell an employee what his own salary is but not what other employees salary is. For this the information of the requestor should be passed down to the MCP layer. And access control should be enforced by the database or system of record, eg via an api call instead of direct table access.\n2. The MCP server needs an authentication mechanism, like with APIs you don’t want anyone be able to access the MCP server who knows the URL.",

Each is a small, typed API or stored proc that validates inputs, enforces quotas, and only touches the minimum set of tables. The agent never sees raw schemas, just these verbs.\n\nOn your HR example, passing the requester context all the way down is key. We attach a user/tenant identity to every tool call, then let the system of record apply row-level or object-level checks (e.g., only salary where employeeid == callerid, everything else is masked or aggregated).\n\nWe front MCP with the same controls as any internal API: mTLS or OAuth, per-client keys, and strict allowlists. I’ve used Kong + custom microservices for that, and also seen people use Supabase or DreamFactory to expose only pre-approved, RBAC’d DB endpoints so agents never talk to the database directly.\n\nThe main point: treat agent tools as narrow, authenticated business APIs that carry end-user identity, not generic DB pipes.",

How common decisions are made and why etc.\n\nI do think that the simpler the data model upfront submitted to the agent, the more likely it is for an LLM to understand it. hence when we build the agent views, we keep it as simple, just enough for the agent to do it's task and then we learn from actual usage on if we need to add more scope, context etc so the agent gets better incrementally.",

That separation (data scoping > tool semantics > agent reasoning) makes policy enforcement and auditing much cleaner. One thing worth emphasizing even more: this pattern also helps with **determinism and evaluation**. When agents can only see curated views, prompt + tool behavior becomes far more predictable and testable.\n\nGreat post, this is the kind of architecture that moves agents from demos to real systems.",

Especially if some work has to precede another (couple of PRs have to get merged before others can be created/started)\n* Ideally I can choose the level of supervision: “ask me before these X major decisions” vs “keep going unless you get stuck (can't solve something for hours)”\n* The agents should be able to run the project locally/CI to validate changes, but I’m not expecting them to do real-world admin stuff like creating whole new AWS accounts or entering billing details. The SaaS I am building has a fairly simple stack and whole product can be easily tested e2e locally.\n\nDoes anything like this exist today, or is everyone still having the same problems that I do?",

But when an AI agent decides to \"get customer insights,\" it might fan out into 47 parallel database queries, retry failed calls 3-4 times with slightly different parameters, chain requests recursively where one result triggers 10 more calls, and send massive SOAP/XML payloads that cost 5000+ tokens per call.\n\nWhat I'm seeing is backends getting hammered by bursty agent traffic, LLM costs exploding from verbose legacy responses, race conditions from uncontrolled parallel requests, and no clear way to group dozens of calls into one logical goal that the system can reason about.\n\nSo I'm wondering: is this actually happening to you, or am I overthinking agent infrastructure? How are you handling fan-out control just hoping the agent doesn't go crazy? Are you manually wrapping SOAP/XML APIs to slim them down for token costs? And do your backends even know the difference between a human and an agent making 50 calls per second?\n\nI'm not sure if this is a \"me problem\" or if everyone building agent systems is quietly dealing with this. Would love to hear from anyone running agents in production, especially against older enterprise backends.\n\n",

This is definitely a real problem once you move from toy agents to ones that actually hit production backends\n\nI’m building [meebly.ai](https://meebly.ai/), a platform for hosting agents that execute real actions on your app. Some of the things we've done to try and solve the pain you're describing is set a max number of steps per tool, adding human-in-the-loop to the most relevant/sensitive tools, and adding processors to filter out any information from long API responses.\n\nIt is true that APIs that were made for human are sometimes not optimal for agents, but with a combination of proper tool chaining, rigid guardrails, limiting max steps, and adding processors, we've been able to have pretty good reliability even for production apps.   \n  \nAlso, we added logging, monitoring, and traces at the agent + tool level, so at least you can see “this one goal triggered N calls and did X/Y/Z tools” instead of having a full black box. **This has been game changer!**\n\nWe still feel a lot of the pain you’re describing: bursty traffic, token bloat from legacy responses, and no universal concept of a “goal‑level transaction” across services. Right now we’re mostly solving it at the agent/platform layer (actions, workflows, monitoring, guardrails) rather than rewiring every downstream backend.​\n\nCurious how others are handling it:\n\n* Do you give agents explicit limits per “goal” (time/requests/tokens)?\n* Are you wrapping legacy SOAP/XML before exposing it to agents, or just eating the token cost?\n* Have you found a clean way to represent a multi‑call “agent workflow” as a first‑class concept in your stack?​\n\nAlso, are you mainly using agents for workflows or simply conversations?",

AI attracted a lot of users quickly and they were able to capatalize on that knowledge and feedback to get to the next version.",

There are some companies and managers that just want to ride the wave (and say \"we're also using AI agents\" to sound cool or to justify their promotion).\n\nBut in reality, there are a lot of complex workflows that teamd of AI agents can take care of, such as insurance claim processing, financial research, healthcare workflows and patient management, coding, etc. And like any other engineering problem, making reliable and robust systems requires good design and careful implementation and bug fixing.\n\nLLM performance is not even a bottleneck now. For the use cases that I'm working on, I use the cheapest LLMs out there and they work great (like for analyzing an image, controlling a browser, searching and fetching data from different DBs or the internet, analyzing PDFs, etc.). And considering the reasoning capabilities of these LLMs, you can have a pretty reliable system running (there's a big \"if\" of course, which is again it requires good engineering).",

But all these were accomplished by using AI, for any kind of task i am going to the AI, (gemini, grok, chatgpt, CLI, antigravity), at one point i felt like i am an outlier in my work space, even in my office everybody uses GPT for coding and project development. I have no idea of how to properly code a simple function without AI, I just know how to think logically and make things work (i do proper prompting, more like a prompt engineer than a dev), if somebody comes and asks me to code fibonacci series, i'm done. \n\nmy main concern here is if i want to switch to other company for better package or better role, i cant crack interviews, technical rounds, coding rounds \n\nNOW, I want to start fresh, from core level but with advanced way of learning, i want to code properly and be more like a developer than a mere vibe coder (ofc i would use AI for coding in the later phases as a vibecoder but with proper thinking and logic building)\n\nI want to learn DSA, ML, and a serious way of programming in parallel to my work, but was a little confused where to start (i can spend 2-3 hrs a day for this)\n\nwhere should i start ? and give me resources suggestions (Books), should i start with DSA? if yes suggest me best books, should i start system design? or since i'm in AI field, should i go with Advance ML, AI applications? should i do LEETCODE daily? \n\nAlso, i should also be staying relevant with the latest Techstacks for the line of my work, how do i manage all these???? so help me out guys ",

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n### Learning Path\n- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: This is a crucial area for any developer. Understanding DSA will not only help you in interviews but also improve your problem-solving skills.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Cracking the Coding Interview\"* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell\n    - *\"Introduction to Algorithms\"* by Thomas H. Cormen et al.\n  - **Practice**: Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank. Aim for a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems.\n\n- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Since you're in the AI field, a solid understanding of ML concepts will be beneficial.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\"* by Aurélien Géron\n    - *\"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\"* by Christopher M. Bishop\n  - **Courses**: Consider online courses from platforms like Coursera or edX that focus on practical applications of ML.\n\n- **System Design**: This is essential for backend development and will help you in interviews for senior roles.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\"* by Martin Kleppmann\n    - *\"System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide\"* by Alex Xu\n  - **Practice**: Engage in mock interviews focusing on system design.\n\n### Staying Updated\n- **Tech Stacks**: Follow industry news through blogs, podcasts, and newsletters. Websites like Medium, Dev.to, and specific tech blogs can be valuable.\n- **Hands-On Projects**: Continue working on personal projects or contribute to open-source projects. This will help you apply what you learn and stay relevant.\n\n### Time Management\n- **Daily Routine**: Dedicate specific days to focus on DSA, ML, and system design. For example:\n  - Monday, Wednesday, Friday: DSA practice\n  - Tuesday, Thursday: ML concepts and projects\n  - Saturday: System design and review\n- **Use AI Wisely**: While you can use AI tools for coding, try to solve problems manually first to build your skills, then use AI to refine your solutions.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **Online Platforms**: Websites like Coursera, Udacity, and edX offer courses on DSA, ML, and system design.\n- **Communities**: Join developer communities on platforms like Reddit, Stack Overflow, or Discord to engage with others and seek advice.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can enhance your coding skills and prepare for future opportunities while managing your current workload effectively.",

That's just the life of a modern developer. If you work for someone else, the engineers before you already made the decisions and you'll need to learn whatever packages are currently in production. You can choose your own environment for greenfield projects, in which case you should stick to industry standards. React, Postgres, Docker.

Here are some thoughts on your questions:\n\n- **Quality vs. Speed**: AI can enhance the speed of content production, but whether it improves quality is subjective. It often depends on how well the AI is prompted and the context provided. Well-crafted prompts can lead to more relevant and engaging content, while poorly defined ones may yield generic outputs.\n\n- **Impact on Writing Style**: Many users report that AI influences their writing style, either by introducing new vocabulary or altering their approach to structuring ideas. This can be beneficial for brainstorming but might lead to a homogenization of content if overused.\n\n- **Maintaining Human Touch**: To keep content genuinely human, creators should focus on integrating personal experiences, emotions, and unique perspectives that AI cannot replicate. It's essential to use AI as a tool for assistance rather than a crutch, ensuring that the final output reflects individual creativity and authenticity.\n\nUltimately, the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and maintaining a personal touch in content creation is crucial for creators navigating this evolving landscape.

Human agents follow business rules, norms etc.  - in many cases ai agents are only doing small well defined tasks to minimize turns, hallucination and long context. Real business have lots of business and domain specific rules. An hotel reservation system may issue refunds (partial, full) base on promo, type of customer, exceptions allowed - fall back to voucher, change of date and so on. These rules are also not static. So when implementing agents,\n\n1) How does one design these constraints? Code em, prompt?  \n2) How does one verify that system is designed within parameters, human agents often time takes test, quiz, training. \n\n  \nHow is the community taking care of these types of issues? Or is it a issue at all, anyone have to solve something similar. \n\nThx and happy holidays.",

          "text": "In my experience, determinism does not come from the model, it comes from the system design around it. You cannot prompt an LLM into behaving like a rule engine. Business rules need to live in code or configuration, not in free text prompts. The agent’s job is to interpret context and propose actions, not decide what is allowed.\n\nWhat works well is separating concerns very clearly. Rules, policies, and exceptions are encoded as deterministic logic or tables. The agent queries that logic and gets back what options are valid for a given situation. Verification then becomes testable, because you can unit test the rule layer independently from the LLM. The LLM is closer to a decision assistant than an authority.\n\nFor reliability, many teams also constrain where and how agents can act. When agents need to interact with real systems, running them in predictable environments like hyperbrowser helps keep execution consistent and auditable, which is critical in regulated workflows.\n\nI do think this is a real issue and one the community is slowly converging on. Deterministic agents are less about smarter models and more about boring architecture, explicit rules, validation layers, and human checkpoints where risk exists.",

          "text": "To make AI agents more deterministic and reliable, especially in complex business environments, consider the following approaches:\n\n- **Designing Constraints**:\n  - **Rule-Based Systems**: Implement business rules directly in the code. This can involve creating a structured set of rules that the agent must follow, similar to how human agents operate.\n  - **Prompt Engineering**: Use well-crafted prompts that clearly define the expected behavior and constraints of the agent. This helps guide the AI's responses to align with business norms and rules.\n  - **Dynamic Rules**: Incorporate mechanisms to update rules dynamically as business needs change. This could involve a management interface where rules can be modified without altering the core code.\n\n- **Verification of System Design**:\n  - **Testing Frameworks**: Develop a testing framework that simulates various scenarios to ensure the agent behaves as expected under different conditions. This can include unit tests and integration tests.\n  - **Training and Evaluation**: Similar to human agents, implement training sessions for AI agents where they can learn from past interactions. This could involve reinforcement learning techniques where the agent is rewarded for following rules correctly.\n  - **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback mechanisms where human supervisors can review agent decisions and provide corrections or adjustments, helping to refine the agent's behavior over time.\n\n- **Community Solutions**:\n  - Many in the AI community are focusing on creating more robust frameworks for agent orchestration that include built-in rule management and verification processes. This includes using orchestration tools that allow for better coordination among multiple agents, ensuring they adhere to business rules effectively.\n  - Discussions around best practices for prompt engineering and rule-based systems are common, with resources available for developers to share their experiences and solutions.\n\nFor further reading on AI agent orchestration and related topics, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

          "text": "Yes I most certainly have. And by legacy we’re talking a 10+ year old codebase. Many people will give you many answers to this, and some might be good or even great answers. But I will say there is one process that has been a game changer in efficiency and accuracy.\n\n1. I basically start with having Claude (Sonnet 4.5) thoroughly review the codebase, then create a file in the root of the project called ‘refactor-assessment.md’. I tell it the ultimate goal of the refactor, and that it needs to put a detailed assessment in that file with what needs to be done to make it happen. IMPORTANT: I also tell it to add a section at the top of the report where it can add clarifying questions it has for me to answer.\n\n2. I copy that report, open up something like ChatGPT, and give it the breakdown. Tell it your goal, and that you had Claude do an assessment, and you would like to get its feedback on the report created by Claude. This basically gives you very valuable feedback from two sources.\n\n3. Then, while still in ChatGPT, once we have ironed out the details and answered clarifying questions, I ask it to create its own report that is broken into phases that should be the focus one at a time. Save that file.\n\n4. I ask ChatGPT to write an implementation plan for phase 1, broken into manageable steps/stages. IMPORTANT: I ask it to specifically include a good prompt in each stage I can give Claude in my IDE to implement that stage in a way that is most effective for an LLM to understand and do the task properly. Again, save that file. That one is your source of truth.\n\n5. Now, you have that last file saved in the project. You can ask Claude something like “please review and complete stage 1 in <file_name> and summarize your changes at the bottom of that stage in the report. And clearly state a % complete. If you couldn’t complete it 100%, then explain why.”\n\nI know it seems like a little overkill. But it has allowed me to help fix mistakes others were struggling to get AI to do properly. There are additional things I do that help. But that’s the process that has helped the most. And of course add tests along the way. Just make sure you pay attention if it marks any task at less than 100% complete. Often you’ll still have to do something on your end.",

I asked it to convert the scripts into workers that get called from a central worker manager, then I asked it to bundle a bunch of methods for dealing with documents together into one Document class, then I had it make some changes to how logging is done across everything, and so forth. I tested the changes out at each step along the way.\n\nBugs happened sometimes, but Jules was really good at fixing them when I specifically called them out.

          "text": "The challenges you’re observing with AI agents during execution versus planning can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Environmental Variability**: AI agents often operate in dynamic environments where changes can occur unexpectedly, such as UI updates or slow loading times. These changes can disrupt the execution flow, leading to failures.\n\n- **Dependency on External Tools**: Many agents rely on external tools or APIs to perform tasks. If these tools experience downtime or changes in their interfaces, it can cause the agent's execution to fail.\n\n- **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: While agents may be good at reasoning and planning, they often lack the necessary error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected situations during execution.\n\n- **Memory Limitations**: If an agent does not effectively utilize memory to retain context or adapt to changes, it may struggle to execute tasks that require continuity or awareness of previous interactions.\n\n- **Complexity of Execution Logic**: The logic required for execution can be more complex than planning. Agents may have to navigate various states and conditions that weren't fully accounted for during the planning phase.\n\n- **Execution Environment Stability**: Controlled environments, like hyperbrowser setups, can provide more stability for agents interacting with real websites. This suggests that the execution environment itself can significantly impact performance.\n\nIn summary, while reasoning capabilities are crucial, the execution environment's stability and the agent's ability to adapt to changes play a significant role in their overall effectiveness.

This is crucial for maintaining and scaling agentic AI systems.\n- Observability and evaluation from the start is a strong point. It helps in identifying issues early and ensures that the system can be iteratively improved.\n- Vendor flexibility is also important, especially in a rapidly evolving landscape. Using a mix of managed services and open-source solutions can provide both reliability and customization.\n- The orchestration layer with LangGraph for workflows and state management is a solid choice. PostgreSQL for checkpointing adds robustness.\n- The connectors layer using LangChain and LlamaIndex is sensible, especially if LlamaIndex excels in document processing tasks.\n- For the RAG & storage layer, using pgvector and Redis for caching is a good approach to enhance performance.\n- The LLM layer's flexibility with primary and fallback options is wise, as it allows for adaptability based on availability and performance.\n- The evaluation layer with Langfuse and RAGAS is a good inclusion, but consider how you will handle the feedback loop for continuous improvement.\n- Observability tools like OpenTelemetry and Grafana are essential for monitoring system health and performance metrics.\n\nIn terms of feedback:\n- Ensure that the layer boundaries are not too rigid; flexibility is key as requirements evolve.\n- Consider adding a component for user feedback or interaction logging, which can provide insights into real-world usage and help refine the system.\n- Be cautious of overengineering; focus on the core functionalities first and iterate based on user needs and system performance.\n\nOverall, it looks like a comprehensive approach to building a production-grade agentic AI system. \n\nFor further reading on agentic architectures, you might find insights in the following resources:\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)\n- [Understanding Agentic RAG](https://tinyurl.com/bdcwdn68)",

The layer separation looks clean and the observability-first approach will save you pain later.\n\nOne thing that tends to bite people with this setup is assuming the RAG layer is working correctly when retrieval starts acting weird. LlamaIndex handles the indexing well but you're still flying blind during document processing. If your PDFs are getting mangled during parsing or your chunking strategy splits content poorly, even perfect orchestration won't fix the garbage data underneath.\n\nMost teams discover their preprocessing is broken only after they've embedded everything and users start complaining about responses. The evaluation layer catches output quality but by then you're debugging three steps removed from the root cause. I've been working on document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev specifically because this preprocessing visibility gap keeps coming up.\n\nFor production readiness, consider adding some way to audit what your documents actually look like after each transformation step. The rest of your architecture handles the complexity well, but if the foundation is shaky everything else just amplifies the problems.",

The biggest win here is treating state, checkpoints, and observability as first class concerns instead of afterthoughts. Most teams regret skipping that early.\n\nA few practical notes from the field based on similar setups I have worked on\n\nLangGraph plus Postgres for state works well, but you will want to be very intentional about state size and lifecycle. Long running agents can quietly bloat tables if checkpoints are not pruned or summarized.\n\nMixing LangChain and LlamaIndex is reasonable, but over time teams often converge on one dominant abstraction to reduce cognitive load. Not a blocker, just something to watch as the system grows.\n\nEvaluation and observability from day one is the right call. In production, most failures are not model failures but prompt drift, data issues, or tool misuse. Having traces and evals early saves weeks later.\n\nOne thing I do not see explicitly called out is human in the loop or override mechanisms. Even lightweight approval hooks or replay tooling becomes very valuable once customers depend on the system.\n\nOn overengineering versus underengineering, this stack is opinionated but not excessive if you already have real users or revenue tied to the agents. For a prototype it would be heavy, but for a production grade system this is a sensible baseline.\n\nFor context, I am Akash, founder of CodemyPixel. I work with teams building agent based AI features into live SaaS products, and this looks very close to what actually survives contact with real users.\n\nOverall, this is a thoughtful architecture. The main risks are complexity creep and operational discipline, not the tools themselves.",

      "text": "After a year of building agentic systems, I’ve come to a pretty strong belief: most “context engineering” problems boil down to two things: **compression and isolation**. And handoffs are where isolation actually becomes real.\n\nIn agent-to-agent workflows, coordination shouldn’t rely on shared memory or implicit context. Each agent should receive an **explicit handoff payload**: a compressed, well-defined snapshot of state.\n\nExample:\n\nA planning agent explores multiple paths and alternatives. It then hands off only the **selected plan**, constraints, assumptions, and success criteria. All speculative reasoning and abandoned branches are intentionally excluded.\n\nThat handoff creates a hard boundary. The next agent executes against a clear contract, not a polluted history.\n\nThe same principle applies to agent-to-human handoffs.\n\nEscalation shouldn’t mean dumping transcripts or logs. A safe handoff should surface:\n\n* What decisions were made\n* What remains uncertain\n* What action is needed next\n\nThis is the difference between **context sharing** and **context transfer**.\n\nIn my experience, agent systems scale when handoffs are:\n\n* explicit, not implicit\n* compressed, not verbose\n* isolated, not shared\n\nMost failures I’ve seen in multi-agent systems aren’t intelligence failures. They’re handoff failures.\n\nCurious where others disagree: Where *does* shared context still outperform explicit handoffs? Or what edge cases break this model?",

You’ll see it in the middle of sentences like `do X or Y and then…` or `(optionally, you could X)`\n\nSo unless you have a human in the loop, or a really good agent that owns judgement + style + decision making, all of the handoffs will end up passing down black ice.\n\nUltimately, black ice increases the surface area for non-deterministic outcomes, and over a long enough time horizon that will lead to major drift.\n\nThis far, I don’t think this is a problem that can be solved with current models and current scaffolding—because it’s the same problem the frontier labs are actively still solving (i.e. how do you get an agent to autonomously deliver _value_ against an objective where many paths “work” but only one or two actually deliver value)",

I have found that the big LLMs are terrible coding agents, I can only attest to my experiences which have been very stressful at times, especially when you realize you made a wrong turn somewhere and the LLM can't bail you out. Talk about a stress filled journey of, \"OH, I understand your frustrations and below I have the 100% fix for XYZ issue\" results in a new insultingly simple UI and half your buttons are gone and the LLM finishes the response with \"Since you're all good now, I can do these other great things next\" and you're sitting there with your hair in your fists that you just pulled from your already thinning dome and diligently talking yourself out of smashing your computer. What a day that was... \n\nAh, but I figured out a way that works for me. Two words, Specification Blueprint. I provide what I want, multiple items are fine, then I ask the AI for a specification blueprint and expressly tell it \"Do not write any code, only provide the blueprint\" it complies, I read through, make adjustments and request again. Then when ready I tell it the blueprint is approved and to make changes only outlined in the blueprint and hands off all other code and aesthetics, etc. AI studio is a good platform because I can roll back if things aren't what I wanted and it does a great job of following this flow. It's also important to use the correct LLM, Gemini 3.5 Thinking, and provide instructions. My biggest hurdle when I started this journey was AI Studio would provide updates in the chat instead of the directory files or it'll tell you it competed the updates when it actually didn't do anything. Before specification blueprints, resending requests it didn't complete, took about a third of the entire build time. I have nothing but respect for coders and the way you think but I couldn't do that job. You are a different breed all together. \n\nThis is my project, www.promptlockerpro.com, it's an extension for chrome to work with prompts and data management 100% vibe coded. Check out the user guide on the website if you don't want or need the extension. Just a proof of work I guess. I'd love some feedback if anyone uses it or tries it.",

This can be frustrating, especially when you trust the AI's suggestions.\n- Another common issue is the hallucination of intent, where the AI confidently makes changes based on assumptions rather than your actual requirements, which can lead to significant rework.\n- Pricing models can also be a shock; for instance, running out of tokens quickly on a high-cost plan can disrupt your workflow and lead to unexpected expenses.\n- Even with rigorous coding practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), relying on AI defaults can sometimes result in oversights, as the AI may not align perfectly with your coding standards or project needs.\n\nFor more insights on agentic workflows and coding, you might find this article useful: [Building an Agentic Workflow: Orchestrating a Multi-Step Software Engineering Interview](https://tinyurl.com/yc43ks8z).",

      "text": "Over the last few months, I’ve been building and deploying AI agents for real workflows (not demos), and one thing became very clear: most people don’t struggle with “AI” — they struggle with system design. The models are good enough. What usually breaks is context, handoffs between tools, unclear stopping conditions, or nobody knowing why the agent did what it did. If you’re thinking of using agents in anything serious, design for failure first: logging, human checkpoints, cost limits, and a clear definition of when the agent should not act.\nAnother pattern I keep seeing is shiny-object syndrome. New frameworks, new models, new agent ideas every week — but nothing actually ships. In hindsight, the biggest unlock isn’t intelligence or tooling, it’s commitment. One workflow. One real problem. One outcome you can measure. Most “AI products” fail not because the tech is bad, but because the builder switches ideas before users ever get a chance to care.\nIf you’re experimenting with AI agents right now, a simple starting point that works: pick a task that’s boring, repetitive, and already well-understood by humans (lead qualification, data cleanup, triage, internal reporting). Make the agent assist first, not replace. Measure time saved, not vibes. Iterate slowly. That’s where agents quietly create real leverage.\nSide note: I’m building 3 production-style AI agents for free to study different workflows. If you have a clear use case and want to collaborate, feel free to DM me.",

Once agents had to interact with real dashboards or tools, things improved a lot only after moving those steps into something predictable like hyperbrowser. That removed a whole class of random failures that I initially blamed on the model.\n\nI agree with your point about commitment too. The agents that actually shipped were boring, narrow, and well scoped. The flashy ones never made it past demos.",

I've seen the exact same pattern, teams get stuck not because the LLM isn't smart enough, but because the agent's behavior is unpredictable across edge cases.\n\nOne thing you touched on briefly but is absolutely critical: **reliability at the prompt and model level**. Even with great system design, agents still drift when:\n\n* The task shifts slightly from training examples\n* The model misinterprets context in domain-specific workflows\n* Prompt templates that worked in testing start failing in production\n\nWe've been using UBIAI's platform to fine-tune models specifically for agent tasks , things like structured extraction, classification with strict output formats, and instruction-following in narrow domains. The difference is night and day. Instead of wrestling with prompt engineering every time the agent misbehaves, you bake reliability directly into the model.\n\nThe workflow you described (boring, repetitive, well-understood tasks) is actually the perfect candidate for this. Fine-tune on your actual data, test with UBIAI's modela nd prompt optimization tools, then deploy. You get consistency without constantly babysitting prompts.",

The scary part was not jailbreak demos, it was how easy it was for a normal looking conversation to drift into something it should not answer or act on. From an ops side, the only thing that helped was assuming the model will misbehave and designing guardrails around data access and actions, not around prompts.\n\nWe ended up separating read vs write access very aggressively and limiting what the AI could even see by default. It reduced risk but also reduced how impressive the demos looked, which was a tough internal sell. I agree the industry is moving faster than the controls, and support and finance are probably the most exposed because they touch real people and money every day. Curious how many teams are actually threat modeling this versus trusting system prompts and hoping for the best.",

Raise your hand if you feel qualified to bound GPT-5.2 to only ever do what you tell it.\n\nHaving said all that, i think the *output* of AI can be used for all kinds of things as long as that output is shuttled where it needs to go by humans.

      "text": "AI automation is moving faster than ever, but most people chase tools and trends instead of solving the real problem: how work actually flows. Automation without clarity often multiplies inefficiency, turning manual chaos into automated chaos. The key is understanding processes first mapping bottlenecks, handoffs and failure points before touching any platform. Effective automation focuses on workflows that truly compound value, often cutting manual effort by 50% or more, while systems are designed to last: clean, documented and adaptable automations built in n8n, Zapier or AI agents that can scale with your team. People remain central automation should augment teams, not replace them, improving throughput and adoption while reducing friction. In practice, this approach delivers measurable results: WhatsApp automations handling 1,000+ daily inquiries with zero data loss, AI workflows boosting revenue by 40% and operations automations saving hours daily while improving client response quality. The best automation is almost invisible: reliable, context-aware and giving teams the space to focus on decisions, growth and innovation. Ultimately, its clarity over chaos, outcomes over optics. For anyone serious about AI automation, start by mapping your work first tools and hype come second.",

Their current future plans require more power than can be generated by the world's power plants.  And of course, they'll make more money (or lose less money) if they can reduce costs.\n\n>The human brain runs on just \\~20 watts, but today’s AI systems gulp billions of watts\n\nThe human brain's neurons and synapses are implemented in analog hardware (brain cells).  Current LLMs are implemented in digital software, using linear algebra to perform the calculations.  If anyone can economically create an LLM with hard-wired analog synapses, the electric cost will rival a biological brain (for a given number of total synapses), plus it will be several orders of magnitude faster.  I heard some researcher (at IBM?) made a tiny analog neural network that ran very fast with very little power.\n\nBtw, you compared a single human brain to the entirety of the AI industry (10s of watts to billions of watt).  Plus you used power units (watts) instead of energy units (watt-hours), which makes little sense.  A better comparison would be the watt-hours used to answer a single prompt for an LLM vs a human brain.  You'd have to consider the amount of time each took (minutes or hours for a human brain vs seconds for an LLM).\n\n> —\n\nThis type of dash is an indication of an AI generated or enhanced post.",

I'm out of credits right now so they get refreshed everyday. My stripe payment is still in the sandbox in testing mode. And I can't get it out so I've got to wait until I get more credits to have it fixed. \n\nIt's not the fanciest website in the world but it was built for free. \n\nI have no education I didn't even finish high School. \n\nI've also custom trained llms on my own emotional literacy framework that I put together from experiencing an identity collapse and ending up homeless and working my way out of the streets... All by my f****** self... With the heavyweight of the loss of two beloved daughters..... And the grief of not even being able to talk with them. \n\nLuckily their dad had them and in spite of the breakdown in our relationship.... He had a very good job and provided them a very stable environment and their financially well taken care of. \n\nLuckily I was very nurturing and attuned with them for the first parts of their lives I didn't start breaking down until my youngest was about 5 years old. \n\nSo they had their foundation set. But I didn't know that when I was in the middle of collapse and tossed to the sidewalk like garbage. \n\nAnyhow.... Turns out being tossed to the sidewalk like garbage is the best thing that ever happened to me... Not losing my kids but having to become capable. Having to learn how to protect myself and defend myself. I became a very strong person and I had a command presence from being a mom for 28 years.... Which kept even the toughest of the street punks in line LMAO\n\nSo don't be intimidated. Don't need to turn to other people to do things for you. \n\nWe live in a world where you can do things for yourself! And that is what my emotional literacy program is. It is all about self empowerment through changing the stories we narrate to ourselves. \n\n\nAnd becoming loyal to ourselves. \n\nYou can't be loyal to yourself when you're telling yourself I have to have somebody else do this for me. That's like saying oh I'm not capable I've got to go get someone else to do it. \n\nThat is hurting your feelings so don't do that you guys. \n\nJust get on these AI systems and prompt them yourself. Talk to them just like you would talk to a friend. \n\nWhen you're working with vertex AI it is a powerhouse but it will talk to you just like Claude AI does. \n\nYou don't want to waste a bunch of credits I'm trying to have small talk with it though because every single message you send is a prompt to build the app or the website. \n\nLet's say you're building a chatbot for a website.\nYou can say this: \n\nI've uploaded a phenomenological paper that I published on zenodo.. do you think we should add this file  to the knowledge base?\n\n\nAnd it will answer you back; \n\n\nOh this is excellent addition to the knowledge base.... Let me go ahead and add that in. \n\n\nOr it might say.... I don't think this would really be relevant it might not be useful to add this paper. \n\n\n\n\nAnd these are just a few things that you can make apps or web pages with. \n\nYou don't need to go to anybody else to have it done for you. \n\nEmpower yourselves!",

This can be particularly beneficial for startups with tight budgets.\n\n- **Flexibility**: Subscription models often provide more flexibility, allowing you to scale up or down based on your needs. If your startup grows rapidly, you might find that a subscription service offers more advanced features or better support.\n\n- **Updates and Support**: Subscription services typically include regular updates and customer support, which can be crucial for maintaining functionality and security. A lifetime deal may not offer the same level of ongoing support or updates.\n\n- **Feature Set**: Evaluate whether the features included in the lifetime deal meet your current and future needs. If the tool lacks essential features that you might need as your business grows, a subscription service might be a better option.\n\n- **Risk of Obsolescence**: Technology evolves quickly, and a lifetime tool may become outdated. Subscription services often adapt to new trends and technologies more rapidly.\n\nUltimately, the decision should align with your startup's growth strategy, budget constraints, and the specific features you require. Balancing immediate cost savings with potential future needs is key.",

      "text": "By 2025, the math behind AI had finally exposed a decade-old lie: moving data costs far more energy than computing on it. Shuttling a single bit from RAM to a CPU or NPU burns 100–1,000× more energy than the arithmetic operation itself. That “data-movement tax” is why every so-called AI flagship throttles, dims, and turns into a hand-warmer after ten minutes of real inference. Heat isn’t intelligence—it’s a penalty for a broken architecture.\n\nLPDDR6-PIM, Samsung’s CES 2026 Innovation Award winner, fixes this by moving AI’s core matrix multiplication directly into memory banks. Bus contention vanishes, the memory wall collapses, and system energy drops roughly 70%. A PIM-equipped device can sustain 20–25 tokens per second on a 70B-parameter model indefinitely, on a normal phone battery, without fans, vapor chambers, or liquid cooling. Same watts in. Radically more useful work out.\n\nFull PIM is the gold standard—but it’s premium. Adding logic to the DRAM array increases die area, complicates yields, and drives cost. That’s where “re-engineered PIM” comes in: Near-Memory Computing (NMC) and Analog/Charge-Domain PIM. By placing lightweight accelerators adjacent to DRAM banks via tight stacking, we eliminate most of the data-movement tax with minimal impact on yield. Analog PIM can handle transformer kernels like Attention with efficiency gains of up to 70,000×, delivering sustained high token throughput without thermal spikes. Minimalist “PIM-Lite” designs target only GEMM/matrix ops in subsets of banks, achieving 80–90% of the PIM energy win at roughly 5–10% added BOM.\n\nStacked with a software-hybrid approach—offloading only memory-bound operations while leaving complex branching on the 2nm Tensor G6—the result is a self-contained AI appliance. A $800 Pixel could run a 70B model locally, fully offline, at 0.2–0.4 Wh per query. Thermal throttling disappears, battery life doubles, and $20/month “Pro” AI subscriptions become unnecessary relics. Physics already picked a winner. Energy doesn’t lie, latency doesn’t negotiate, and thermals don’t care about corporate roadmaps.\n\nThe takeaway: full LPDDR6-PIM is ideal for max efficiency, but Near-Memory, Analog, and PIM-Lite are the pragmatic path to mass-market, high-performance, locally intelligent phones. This stack bridges the gap between bleeding-edge lab tech and consumer-ready devices while demolishing the economics of cloud AI. Once deployed, cloud-tethered AI won’t just be inferior—it will be exposed as optional infrastructure, a dying business model artificially protected until now.",

The moment you scale to parallel agent swarms, each agent runs its own write, select, compress, and isolate loop, and you suddenly have system problems: conflicting “canonical” facts, incompatible compression policies, and very brittle ad hoc synchronization of shared memory.​",

      "text": "**Deterministic prompts for non-deterministic users.**\n\nI keep seeing the same failure mode in agents: the model isn’t “dumb,” the prompt contract is vague.\n\nSo I built Gardenier, an open-source prompt compiler that converts messy user input + context into a structured, enforceable prompt spec (goal, constraints, output format, missing info).\n\nIt’s not a chatbot and not a framework, it’s a build step you run before your runtime agent(s). Why it exists: when prompts get serious, they behave like code: you refactor, version, test edge-cases, and fight regressions.\n\nMost teams do this manually. Gardenier makes it repeatable.\n\nWhere it fits (multi-agent):\n\nUpstream. It compiles the request into a clear contract that a router + specialist agents can execute cleanly, so you get fewer contradictions, faster routing, and an easier final merge.\n\nTiny example Input (human): “Write a pitch for my product, keep it short, don’t oversell, include pricing, target founders.”\n\nCompiled (spec-like): Goal: 1-paragraph pitch + bullets Constraints: no hype claims, no vague superlatives, max 120 words Output: [Pitch], [3 bullets], [Pricing line], [CTA] Missing info: product category + price range + differentiator What it’s not: it won’t magically make a weak product sound good — it just makes the prompt deterministic and easier to debug.\n\nHere you find the links (IN THE COMMENTS = BELOW) to repo of the project :\n\nFiles:\n\nSystem Instructions, Reasoning, Personality, Memory Schemas, Guardrails, RAG optimized datasets and graphs! :) feel free to tweak and mix.\n\nIf you build agents, I’d love to hear whether a compiler step like this improves reliability in your stack.\n\nI 'd be happy to receive feedback and if there is anyone out there with a real project in mind, that needs synthetic datsets and restructure or any memory layers, or general discussion, send a message.\n\nCheers 👍\n\n*special thanks to ideator : Munchie",

Agents are brittle because they're trying to operate in systems designed for humans, not programmatic access.\n\nUI-based agents fail because web pages change, elements move, timing varies. The agent thinks it clicked a button but the page was still loading. Or it finds the wrong element because the DOM structure shifted. Hyperbrowser helps because it provides a more controlled, consistent interface layer.\n\nBut even with API-based tools, the environment causes most silent failures. Network timeouts that look like success. Partial responses that get truncated. Rate limits that trigger retries in weird ways. The agent gets back what looks like valid data but it's incomplete or stale.\n\nThe orchestration layer gets blamed for a lot of this, but it's usually just surfacing environmental inconsistencies. State management becomes a nightmare when you can't trust that tool calls actually completed successfully.\n\nWhat kind of environment are your agents running in? The failure patterns are pretty different between web automation, API orchestration, and local tool execution.",

While they learn and explore newer platforms everytime they're deployed, agents should have the ability to recall where they've seen the pattern/ element before and what the case was. This is especially helpful in automating platform-based repetitive tasks that consist of clicking similar buttons and intertacting with standard elements. Another super obvious use case is QA for your web apps. If the agent can't tell what changed, you'll stay stuck maintaining scripts and feeding schema docs into the agent everytime it has to test things live and tell you if things are working or not. Used a tool called 100x bot recently and it solved for this part. They went a step furhter and created a \"network memory\" that kicks in everytime a user tries to use the same steps as a previous user. This makes the patterns stronger, and actions reproducible at scale. worked pretty well for the fact that it didn't depend on APIs or wasn't a separate browser all together. Just a chrome extension doing it's part silently and keeping everything in mind",

You'll have to be able to do it, but it's going to become easy enough that everyone will be able to do it too. As a result, you won't be able to get a job with it if it's the only thing on your resume.  \n\nBut right now, it's still a bit of a rare skill because it's still new. This is good news and bad news. The bad news is that there aren't enough employers who know enough about it to put \"Agentic AI Skills\" as a skill they want to hire for, so you won't find too many jobs asking for it. (For example, out of the 100,000+ jobs advertised on my favourite Australian job board, just 61 include the word \"Agentic\"). But the good news is that once employers start to ask for it, the demand will probably be higher than supply, so salaries will be great. But then the other bad news is that this will only last for a short while. After a couple of years more and more people will learn Agentic AI skills, and the platforms will make them easier and easier to use. They'll become a commodity, like using Word or Excel.    \n\nOne approach you could take is to learn those skills anyway, and then get an administrative job of ANY sort. It will allow you to use your skills to automate the business as much as possible. This will help you leapfrog your way into a better job even after Agentic AI skills are commoditised, because you'll be able to brag about saving money for a business by improving their process, rather than talking about the technicalities of how you know LLMs (which many employers don't understand or trust).",

The model is good at moment to moment narration, but it is not actually tracking state the way a real DM does, so plots drift and rules get fuzzy over time. Uploading rulebooks helps with grounding, but it does not solve memory or consistency once sessions get long. What worked better for me was keeping the model very constrained, short arcs, explicit reminders of current plot and character state every session, and treating it more like a co DM than the source of truth. I have not seen a model yet that can run a long campaign cleanly without a lot of human correction in the loop.",

If I were going to make it usable, I'd attach something to make sure it can track the math with a calculator tool (don't trust them to do math in their head, they're almost as bad as humans at it) and a semantic vector memory system + campaign notes RAG, with an updated rules reference (knowledge window might not include current systems), so it could run a long game. Opus was also good, but didn't have the narrative flourish of Sonnet (new model has come out now, though, so could be matched).\n\n\nClaude can nail character dialog, and even come up with some surprising plot twists if you encourage it to think that way. I ran a bunch of tests out of curiosity when I started really studying LLMs and agentic design, and thinking about it with what I know now it's absolutely feasible. Of the others I tested, ChatGPT was ok, but nothing special. Grok sucked, but it's new model has improved everything significantly, so who knows? You could also throw time and money at fine tuning a FOSS to perform to spec, but I haven't tested any.\n\n\nUltimately, though, it's going to be the harness, tools, and system prompting that's going to make it work, more than the model itself. Give it libraries of source material, themes/settings/moods/tone etc. to execute in the system prompt, and maybe even some lists of fiction to use as inspiration (but not to copy), and I can see it being something pretty special.",

The system uses the recording from the session to create a summary note (that I review) to update the ongoing lore. It uses the same keyword and semantic processes to display NPC's, locations, faction bonds, ongoing conditions (curses, etc), plot hook tie-ins, etc, as tiles in the left window that I can click to expand. \n\nIt also hosts an action calculator for my players specific builds that they can access on their phones, akin to what ppl have on critical role, but more customizable because I can add homebrew stuff easily.\n\nAfter each session, I run a post-game analysis where I review its summary note, update specific info about characters, and then discuss the next steps in the game with it as a suggestions counter-point.",

They break flow more than people admit.\n\n  \n**Claude felt like talking to a smart peer.**  \nNot a tutor. Not a cheerleader.  \nMore like that colleague who says, *“Wait, that assumption doesn’t make sense.”*\n\nWhen I dumped long customer conversations and asked,  \n“What’s the real frustration underneath this?”  \nClaude got it.\n\nWhen I brainstormed positioning, it didn’t just add ideas — it pushed back.  \nThat matters way more than people think.\n\nNo hand-holding.  \nNo “great question!” energy.  \nJust… thinking alongside you.\n\n  \n**Gemini surprised me in a very specific way.**  \nIt’s fast.

People are not asking for “the best model,” they are asking for help thinking, deciding, or resolving something in a specific moment. The frustration usually shows up when a tool optimizes for safety or speed at the expense of actually engaging with the problem the user is stuck on. That is when it feels dismissive or shallow, even if the output is technically fine. The idea of matching tools to cognitive load and task type is underrated, especially in support and research work.

They land on a page, scan for a few seconds, and then hit that familiar moment of friction. Where is the answer? Does this even fit what I need? Why is this taking effort?\n\nPeople aren’t trying to understand your site structure. They’re trying to solve a problem and move on.\n\nThat’s why conversational experiences are starting to feel less like “chatbots” and more like a natural layer on top of the web. Instead of clicking through menus, users just ask what’s on their mind. Can this work for my use case? Does it integrate with what I already use? What’s the fastest way to get started?\n\nWhen the answer comes back clearly, the reaction isn’t excitement about AI. It’s relief.\n\nThis shift quietly changes what a website even is. A website used to be something you learned how to navigate. Now it’s becoming something you talk to. Two people can land on the same page and leave with completely different experiences, simply because their intent was different.\n\nOne might be comparing options. Another might need support. Someone else just wants a straight answer without digging.\n\nWhat disappears in the process is a lot of unnecessary friction. No guessing which page has the answer. No repeating the same question across forms. No waiting for a follow-up for things that should be instant.\n\nNot everything needs a human. But when a human is needed, the context is already there.\n\nThis isn’t about replacing navigation menus or sales teams overnight. It’s about giving visitors a faster, more natural way to move forward when they’re ready.\n\nCurious how others here experience this personally. Do you prefer asking a website a question instead of clicking around, or does chat still feel like an interruption to you?\n\nGenuinely interested in real experiences, not hot takes.\n\n— Team **Kong.ai**\n\n*Side note: this post itself was drafted with the help of AI — fitting, given the topic.*",

Like people did use google instead as it actually worked, most likely nobody will be interested in half backed failing chatbots on random websites.

          "text": "You’re thinking about a very real use case. No-code AI builders can handle simple tagging and routing, and they’re pretty approachable for non-developers. That said, they can get shaky when requests are messy or don’t fit neatly into rules. A lot of people start with no-code to prove the flow works, then bring in something more custom once they see real volume. It’s a good way to test without overcommitting early.",

You’ll still need to refine prompts and logic rules, but you don’t need traditional programming — it’s mostly configuration and a bit of tuning to make it reliable in real work.",
