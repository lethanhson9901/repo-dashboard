      "text": "Tried the new Agent Teams feature that dropped with Opus 4.6 yesterday.\n\nI gave Claude a refactoring task. Instead of grinding through it alone, it spawned three teammate agents that worked in parallel - one on backend, one on frontend, one playing code reviewer.\n\nThey literally messaged each other. Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified. Probably both.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?\n\n",

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

          "text": "That's a fascinating example of emergent multi-agent collaboration. What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

          "text": "That's a fascinating example of emergent multi-agent collaboration. What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

      "text": "Anthropic just launched a new AI tool called **Claude CoWork**, and the market reaction was… brutal.\n\nFollowing the announcement, **software, legal-tech, and professional services stocks saw a noticeable sell-off**. The reason? Claude CoWork is being positioned as capable of automating **high-value legal tasks** like contract review, summarization, and structured analysis  work that many firms still bill humans for.\n\nAccording to analysts and traders, the tool itself wasn’t the *only* reason for the market dip. But it landed at a sensitive moment, amplifying existing fears that AI is starting to **directly threaten business models** built around expensive human expertise.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous AI hype:\n\n* This isn’t marketing copy or customer support automation\n* It targets **legal and professional workflows**, where margins are high\n* It signals a shift from “AI assists humans” to “AI replaces chunks of billable work”\n\nInvestors seem to be asking a hard question:  \nIf AI can do this *reliably*, what happens to firms whose value depends on time-based billing and proprietary expertise?\n\nSo I’m curious what this sub thinks:\n\n* Is the market overreacting to yet another AI announcement?\n* Or is this the first real sign that **AI is moving into territory Wall Street actually cares about**?\n* Which industries do you think are next once this becomes mainstream?\n\nInterested to hear perspectives from both tech and finance folks here.",

Also, lexis nexis approached us, they wanted our databases (our actual moat) in order to train their AI models. They never mentioned it, they talked about doing great stuff together, making good money, etc until I read the contract, where they casually mention we must give them our databases (no API access, but the files).  If we stopped collaborating they would keep them because \"it would be too difficult to untrain the AI models\". I felt they were not being fair/transparent and left negotiations. \n\n I wonder how they feel now with all the news. \n\nAnyway, I think some legal information/databases are beyond any AI reach.

The only instruction to then was to refactor the frontend with a new design principle (brand) which I provided as an HTML\n\n\n\n1. ChatGPT Codex:\n   1. Speed: This was fast, it was able to understand (supposedly) the entire code in less than 30 minutes\n   2. Output Completeness: Around 10% of the features of the original application were replicated (to be honest just the basics)\n   3. The UI which was refactored was no where close to the design philosophy that was given\n2. Claude CoWork:\n   1. Speed: Much slower than Codex, it took 6 hours and multiple instructions to be able to read, understand and regenerate the code\n   2. Output Completeness: Similar to Codex, but was frustrating that while I spend 6 hours guiding it, it reached only that level\n   3. The UI refactoring was better and matched 50% of the expectations (still inconsistencies were present at a lot of places)\n\n\n\nSo all in all $400 and Sunday not wasted, I just realised that all these claims of agents being able to build, deploy and manage is just a sham. However, one thing that is surely happening that the ‘piece of code’ has become a commodity now, it is the understanding of the architecture that has become important. What I feel is that the role of product managers (who understand the customer and the customer’s needs properly) would be the next decision makers (I know a lot of people call themselves product managers but I am talking about the actual ones).\n\n\n\nIn a strange world, in the last 24 months the world started to learn ‘prompt engineering’ then before people could learn it, they needed to learn ‘vibe coding’ and before majority of the people could understand ‘vibe coding’ we are entering a new era of ‘agentic engineering’. However, the key remains that the only thing that would survive is ‘logic’!\n\n  \nSo all in all $400 and Sunday wasted :)",

At first i thought this would be a generic chatgpt browser session on \"vibe coding\" etc. But they showcased claude code, how they were using it and what it could do and i was truly stunned. Since then my job has just completely changed from writing code 60% of the time to prompting and 90% of the time doing testing/reviewing & administration. \n\nMy opinion for the timeline and impact of AI also completely switched and i really want to expand my knowledge on this topic, since i feel i left it aside for to long, especially considering my job as a software dev. \n\nI work in consulting, so beside coding i'm also very interested in how AI is used by companies when they are not using it for coding or a chatbot.\n\n  \nAre there any courses you can recommend? Videos? Tools? I'd love to see how deep this rabbit hole already goes and what the capabilities are.\n\nif you get here thanks for reading the post :-) ",

          "text": "- You might want to explore **Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO)**, which is a new model tuning method that allows for improving AI models using only unlabeled data. This could be particularly useful in your consulting work, as it enables enterprises to enhance AI quality without the need for extensive human labeling. More details can be found in the article [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- Consider diving into **prompt engineering**, which is crucial for effectively interacting with AI models. Understanding how to craft precise prompts can significantly enhance the outputs you receive from models like Claude. A good resource for this is the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).\n\n- If you're interested in building AI applications, look into orchestration tools that can help streamline the integration of AI features into existing systems. The [Mastering Agents](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) article discusses how to create and evaluate AI agents, which could be beneficial for your consulting projects.\n\n- Lastly, keep an eye on emerging AI models like **DeepSeek-R1**, which offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt AI without significant investment. More information can be found in the article [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here. Are You Ready?](https://tinyurl.com/5xhydkev).\n\nExploring these resources will give you a broader understanding of AI's capabilities and applications beyond coding.",

The interesting work is less about prompts and more about how teams design checkpoints, ownership, and recovery when the model does something unexpected. If you like the enterprise angle, look into how organizations are using agents for ops tasks like intake triage, reconciliation, and exception handling rather than happy path automation. That is where culture, process clarity, and AI collide in useful ways. Curious if you are seeing more resistance from reviewers or more relief so far.",

If a PM can’t get it running without reading 6 docs and fighting Docker, it’s not “for everyone,” it’s for devs who like tinkering. Which is fine, just be honest about it.\n\nSecurity model too… yeah. The marketplace/skills thing freaks me out more than the core codebase. I’ve seen enough npm/python supply chain nonsense to not want “random skills” getting real permissions. Without a proper sandbox / permission scoping, you’re basically trusting vibes.\n\nOn memory, I’ve been annoyed by this across a bunch of tools. They say “memory” but it’s just “we’ll stuff more text into context sometimes.” Real memory feels more like: store facts/events cleanly, retrieve only what matters, and keep it auditable so you can see what it’s using. Otherwise it’s just token bloat.\n\nI’m not sure I buy “proactive help” as default though. That sounds amazing until it’s constantly interrupting you. I’d want it opt-in and super constrained.\n\nAlso, not gonna lie, the memU mention makes this read a bit like a pitch. Might be totally legit, just saying that’s how it lands.

You don't need to socially engineer the user or the model. Just exist in their calendar ecosystem with a malicious invite and wait.\n\nWhat makes this worse: the attack surface scales with every MCP extension installed. Each new tool is a new privilege escalation vector. And unlike OS-level permissions, there's no \"would you like to allow this app to access your files?\" dialog for natural language actions.\n\nThis is why we built OpenClaw tool invocation with explicit pre-execution gates for anything touching external systems.

Anthropic suggests failures might instead look like industrial accidents  unpredictable, nonsensical, and highly context-dependent. \n\nIn other words, the risk isn’t just “wrong objective,” it’s unpredictability at scale — a chaotic blend of variance and reasoning length that we don’t fully understand yet.\n\nThis raises some provocative questions:\n\n• Are we thinking about AI safety the wrong way?\n\n• Should alignment research shift focus from “goal misalignment” to coherence & behavior stability?\n\n• What does it mean if future AI systems become less predictable as they get more powerful?\n\nSome have even linked these findings with broader concerns about AI deployment mismatches and chaotic real-world behaviors. \n\n\n\nThis isn’t just academic — if future models fail unpredictably rather than systematically, traditional safety strategies might not be enough.\n\nCurious what others think:\n\nIs chaotic failure worse than coherent misalignment?

I find Anthropic’s framing of chaotic failure vs. coherent misalignment especially provocative.\n\nThe idea that larger models can actually become less predictable on complex tasks challenges a lot of assumptions in alignment research. If failures look more like industrial accidents, sporadic, context-dependent, and incoherent. Then safety strategies focused only on goal alignment might miss the bigger picture.\n\nTo me, this raises two key points:\n\nReliability vs. capability: Scaling improves performance on simple tasks, but stability on complex reasoning seems to lag behind.\n\nHuman oversight: If unpredictability is the dominant risk, then monitoring, redundancy, and fail-safes may become just as important as alignment itself.\n\nChaotic failure might be harder to anticipate than misaligned goals, but it also feels more realistic given how current systems behave under stress. Either way, it underscores that AI safety isn’t just about what the model is trying to do, but how consistently it can do it.",

This is the closest I remember to what this post suggests, but id say its not the same \n\n\"However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of *those* behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.\"\n\n",

If you’re building long multi-step workflows, the “industrial accident” vibe matters a lot because it’s the random weird step 17 that breaks everything, even when the intent wasn’t “evil.”\n\nAlso, this is why I’ve never loved “just let it reason longer” as the default fix. Longer chains can mean more opportunities to drift, contradict itself, or take a weird action that nobody anticipated. So the safety story ends up being boring engineering again: constrain the action space, check intermediate outputs, run lots of evals, and treat long-run autonomy as something you earn, not something you toggle on because the model got bigger.",

AI agent is fundamentally a software system that autonomously perceives its environment, reasons about what to do, and takes actions to pursue goals on behalf of a user or another system, often adapting its behaviour over time.\n\nIn today’s “marketing” language, for example, many “order entry agents” are really scripted workflows wrapped in AI prompts, while a stricter definition of an agent implies autonomous goal‑driven behavior, planning, and tool use over a less rigid process. A fixed sequence of LLM calls and tools and little to no autonomy is really just a skill, a *tool* an agent might use, but not an agent itself.\n\nAnd yes, what it boils down to at the end is this…\n\nIf I have enough money, I can use Claude Code to write me a program that goes on the web, fetches a bunch of content, transforms it, stories it somewhere, and then even generates content for me to post out of it, but this isn’t an agent. It’s a script. Claude Code was just means of building the script that does not require a lot of technical knowledge to execute.

The hard part is everything around it. Inputs, outputs, retries, failure handling, and making sure the agent is operating on real, consistent data instead of vibes. Most people never show that because it is boring and breaks the illusion.\n\nWhere beginners usually get misled is thinking agents are about clever instructions. They are not. They are about wiring LLMs into reliable systems. Even something like “go research X” falls apart the moment the agent has to touch the real web, deal with JS heavy pages, logins, or inconsistent results. That is why many demos quietly hand wave execution. In real builds, people end up using frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and then layering in more boring infrastructure. Things like controlled browser execution, sometimes via tools like hyperbrowser, just to make the environment predictable.\n\nLangChain is a fine place to start for learning the basics, but I would tell anyone new to focus less on prompts and more on understanding workflows, state, and failure modes. Once you get that, the hype videos start to look a lot less magical and a lot more like dressed up scripts.",

I'm fairly technical but AI can extend to surface areas that I have little experience in, and I honestly think the same is true for people that aren't technical whatsoever. Many of my non-engineering friends have built \"functional\" projects for their specific use cases. It's honestly more about patience and continuing through the frustration (to which you'll learn to prompt better) than it is about being an expert at this point. Sure, your project might not be top tier code quality or scale whatsoever, but it will be sufficient enough to help you at the very least, which is the whole point right?\n\nAnd most importantly, you absolutely do not need to pay for courses or low effort LLM wrappers (like you see advertised on this platform frequently). 2 hours with a chatbot and some headphones and you're just as capable.

          "text": "Building AI agents can seem daunting, especially if you're starting from scratch without a technical background. However, there are accessible pathways and tools that can help you get started. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:\n\n- **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**: AI agents are systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Familiarizing yourself with concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation can be beneficial.\n\n- **Use User-Friendly Platforms**: There are platforms designed to simplify the process of building AI agents. For instance:\n  - **aiXplain** offers intuitive tools that allow non-developers to create AI agents without extensive coding knowledge. They provide a user-friendly SDK and pre-built templates to help you get started quickly. You can explore their offerings [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j3kpr3y).\n  - **Apify** is another platform that allows you to build web scraping and automation agents easily. They provide templates and a community that can help you learn the ropes. More information can be found on their site [here](https://tinyurl.com/5n8xczxx).\n\n- **Learn Through Tutorials and Documentation**: While it can be frustrating to encounter paywalls, many platforms offer free resources:\n  - Look for free tutorials on building AI agents using platforms like aiXplain or Apify. They often have step-by-step guides that can help you understand the process without needing to pay for courses.\n  - Engage with community forums or groups where you can ask questions and share experiences.\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects. For example, you could create a basic agent that automates a small task, like sending reminders or gathering information from a website. This will help you build confidence and gradually increase your skills.\n\n- **Explore Existing Agents**: Check out examples of AI agents that others have built. This can provide inspiration and practical insights into how they function. Platforms like Apify have collections of existing agents that you can explore [here](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3).\n\n- **Focus on Learning Key Skills**: While you don’t need to become a developer, having a basic understanding of programming concepts can be helpful. Consider learning:\n  - Basic Python programming, as many AI tools and frameworks use it.\n  - How to work with APIs, which are essential for integrating different services.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. Follow blogs, podcasts, and online communities to keep up with the latest trends and tools.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can gradually build your knowledge and skills in creating AI agents. It’s a journey that requires patience and persistence, but there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way.",

They’re usually a combination of:\n\n* an LLM (ChatGPT / Claude)\n* automation tools (Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.)\n* and a bunch of rules deciding when the AI runs and what it does next.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, there are basically two paths:\n\n**1) Platform-based / low-code agents**  \nThis is where you use tools like Zapier, Make, or n8n. You connect apps together, drop in an AI step, and automate workflows like content drafts, research summaries, outreach, etc.  \nPros: beginner-friendly, fast to learn, lots of free tutorials.  \nCons: subscriptions, limited flexibility, and you’re dependent on the platform.\n\n**2) Custom-built agents (code-based)**  \nThis is where startups/companies hire developers or [outsource](https://centrox.ai/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=How%20are%20people%20actually%20building%20AI%20agents%20like%20this%20(from%20zero%20knowledge)) to build their own agents using Python or JavaScript and call AI models directly via APIs. It’s more scalable and flexible, but definitely more technical and slower to learn. Scalability is relatively less expensive as compared to #1. \n\nI don’t think people with zero experience should start with the second option. Most viral setups are actually just option #1 with good presentation.\n\nThe real skill seems less about “AI” and more about:\n\n* understanding processes\n* breaking tasks into steps\n* and deciding what should happen when X occurs\n\nA lot of the hype comes from people packaging basic automations as “agents” and selling courses around it. The tech *is* real and useful, but it’s not magic and it won’t run your life without supervision.\n\nIf anyone here has built real agents beyond demos, I’d love to hear what actually worked long-term and what broke",

Spent months on each one. Perfect code, clean UI, \"innovative features.\"\n\nTotal revenue: $0.00\n\nI was convinced I just wasn't good at this indie hacker thing.

People were rushing to self-host it but struggling with the technical setup.\n\nI saw the opportunity: most people just want the AI assistant, not a DevOps project.\n\nSo I built **ClawdHost** \\- managed hosting for OpenClaw that handles all the infrastructure complexity.\n\n**The build:**\n\nI said 48 hours. It actually took 4 days of intense building.\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* Claude Opus 4.5 for architecture/PRD/ERD\n* GLM 4.7 for implementation (ran 2 sequential → 3 parallel → 2 sequential agents)\n* Claude Code for debugging\n* Supabase for backend\n* My \"project management\": a Pastebin with tildes\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n\\- **Build fast, ship faster** \\- 4 days vs months on previous apps  \n\\- **Ride the hype** \\- OpenClaw was trending, I shipped while demand was hot  \n\\- **Build in public works** \\- Got 1 Twitter sale, but mostly for accountability  \n\\- **Building is easy, marketing is tough** \\- Still learning this part  \n\\- **Agentic coding >> vibe coding** \\- Sequential + parallel AI agents = 10x faster\n\n**Real talk:**\n\n$250 MRR isn't life-changing. 3 refunds sting.

OpenClaw went viral, setup was painful, and you sold “I’ll make the pain disappear.” That’s not hype, that’s a real problem with a clear buyer.\n\nAlso the refunds don’t even surprise me. Early adopters are chaos and hosting + self-hosted projects always have weird edge cases. If I were you I’d obsess over the 3 refunds more than the 10 signups, because that’s probably where the product is leaking (pricing mismatch? onboarding? uptime? expectations?).\n\nRe: agentic coding vs vibe coding… I think the real takeaway is constraints + parallelization. If you keep the scope tight and you’re willing to run multiple agents and then actually review, you can move stupid fast. But if you point it at a vague “build my startup” goal, it just turns into fancy procrastination.\n\nAnyway, congrats on getting out of the $0 zone. That part is real.",

Until now, voice was powerful but kind of “extra work” to integrate. If these new skills help reduce friction and speed things up, that’s a big win.\n\nI’m still early in testing, but I can already see how this could help people experiment more with voice-first assistants instead of treating voice as an add-on at the end.\n\nCurious to see how flexible it ends up being, but overall this update makes me more interested in exploring voice agents seriously.

Real-time agents + durable workflows has been this awkward architectural split for a while now — you either get reactive (WebSocket) or persistent (queue/cron), but rarely both cleanly.\n\nThe WebSocket + long-running task combo is genuinely hard to get right. Most setups end up with a state machine nightmare where the \"live\" part and the \"background\" part don't quite handshake properly.\n\nClaude Code's /insights is interesting too, but feels more like UX polish on existing capability. The Cloudflare thing is solving a lower-level infrastructure problem that blocks a lot of agent architectures from graduating out of prototype phase.\n\n(We've been exploring similar cron-based deterministic patterns at chat.engineer — always interesting to see how the platforms vs DIY approaches diverge.)\n\nWhat about you — any of these actually change what you're building, or just incremental?",

As per now, it may seem like trivial exploring into a new way to interact with AI. \n\nHowever, we should really be talking about the tomorrow. Now let me touch a bit on your questions. \n\nAccountability. As per now, AI (synonymous with LLM's in this context) does not possess any moral capacity. If it instructs a human to do something unethical or immoral, it is because it saw that as a means to fulfill some task or goal in an efficient way (it could for example arise situations where the AI was breached and a malicious actor prompt injected something because xyz). Therefore the human would have to be accountable in this situation. \nRight now, blaming AI for your immoral acts is like blaming a small child. \nWe should however closely monitor alignment, morals and ethics in every aspect of AI, especially those who will inevitably make decisions on their own, and all those who interact with humans.\n\nPsychological shift. This is also a hugely important discussion to have. We can already see that people who interact with LLM's on a daily basis trust it's judgement, are prone to take advice from it, and in extreme cases, develop feelings for it. \nIt is paramount that we remember that these are algorithms on machines. \nIf you do another person a small favor, you are way more likely to do them larger favors later on, and there is no reason to believe it's different with AI. \nAlready some people lean towards sympathizing with digital minds, and Anthropic are already talking about AI welfare. \nThat was a long way of saying that I personally think this psychological shift is happening before our eyes, and it's a trend that is best halted. \n\nWill we work for AI? That's a whole other bag of worms. It's nuanced, and this post is already longer than anticipated, so I'll save that for another day. \n\nBut these are discussions worth having!",

Humans have already been taking instructions from software for a long time for example gig platforms, call centers, task queues, GPS directions. What’s new here is that the planner is adaptive and non-human which makes the power dynamics feel more unsettling even if the underlying mechanics aren’t totally new. So I think the real risk isn’t AI bosses, it’s lack of clear boundaries. If humans are executing tasks, there still has to be explicit accountability, guardrails, and the ability to refuse or escalate… otherwise it’s just outsourcing responsibility to a system that can’t bear it. Without that, platforms will absolutely try to blur lines when something goes wrong. \n\nSo I don’t think this is inherently dark or inevitable doom, but it does force us to be more deliberate. The moment an AI can delegate to humans, you need the same things you’d require of any employer or contractor system: consent, transparency, auditability, and clear responsibility. If those are missing, that’s when it stops being efficient delegation and starts being exploitative. How we design the rules around it matters most.",

The weird part is the interface, not the physics.\n\nThe part that actually matters is accountability. If the task is sketchy, the human doing it is still on the hook in the real world, and the platform should be forced to build boring guardrails (identity, logs, dispute flows, “nope” categories). Otherwise it turns into “TaskRabbit, but with plausible deniability.” That’s the line for me.\n\nAlso, I don’t buy the psychological doom angle as much. People already take instructions from apps all day. The power dynamic is still whoever controls money + rules. If an AI can “hire” you, it’s because somebody funded it and decided what it’s allowed to ask for.\n\nSo yeah, not satire, but not some new species becoming your boss either.

What you're describing (semantic clusters) maps to what we see working in practice:\n\nL1: Active thread (volatile, ~100-200 messages) - the immediate conversation\nL2: Distilled knowledge (~5-20k tokens) - extracted facts, decisions, patterns promoted from L1\nL3: Core directives (~500-2k tokens) - immutable rules, identity, hard constraints\n\nThe mistake many make is jumping straight from L1 to storage (vector DB, files). There's no semantic distillation happening in between. L2 is where the magic lives.\n\nOn the cost point: OpenClaw does support this hierarchy. You don't chuck 50k tokens every request - you start each session with just L3 + relevant L2 segments.\n\nThe memU approach you mentioned is solid, though. Three-layer with semantic retrieval is directionally correct. The challenge is write quality - most systems retrieve well but write garbage to memory.\n\nevidence weighted summaries work well: when distilling from L1 to L2, tag each memory with how often it was accessed. High-recency + high-frequency = promote to L3 eventually. Low access for 30 days = candidate for archival.",

The \"dump everything and let the LLM sort it out\" pattern is also how you end up with agents that cost 10x what they should per run.\n\nOne thing I'd add though: memory architecture is only half the problem. The other half is what happens when the agent *acts* on a bad memory retrieval. If your memory system surfaces stale or wrong context and the agent makes a tool call based on it, there's usually nothing downstream catching that. No rollback, no isolation, no way to audit what context actually drove the decision.\n\nSo I think the real stack is: smart memory (what you're describing) + controlled execution (budgets, logging, isolation per run). Most people focus on one or the other. The memory-first crowd optimizes retrieval but lets execution run wild. The framework crowd adds tool scaffolding but stuffs 50k tokens every call. You need both layers working together.\n\nThe 70% token reduction is impressive though. That alone makes the approach worth exploring even before you get to accuracy gains.",

When decisions go wrong, \"it retrieved relevant memories\" doesn't help debug which memories were wrong or why irrelevant ones weren't retrieved. Memory optimization vs evidence capture is another tradeoff people discover after production incidents.",

Because relying on other people isn’t guaranteed to hold up. Especially in the AI world.

AI moves fast, but corporate bureaucracy moves at the speed of a sloth on ketamine. We aren’t going to replace \\*everyone\\* in 36 months because legal departments, unions, and old boomers who can’t convert a PDF to Word will slow it down. You have a buffer.

We get paid to exist, consume art, and pretend to be busy while the bots do the heavy lifting.  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome B (Elysium):\\*\\* Techno-feudalism where the rich live in orbit and the rest of us fight over a can of beans in the mud.  \n\\*(I’d hedge my bets on a messy mix of both.)\\*  \n  \n4.  \\*\\*The Verdict:\\*\\*  \nStop trying to \"beat the competition\" by working 28 hours a day. You can’t out-grind a GPU cluster that doesn't sleep, eat, or have existential crises. The future isn't about working harder; it's about being the one human in the room who knows how to wrangle the machine, or finding a job that requires physical empathy (nursing, trades) until the robots figure out hands.  \n  \nSo yeah, the \"stable 9-to-5\" is on life support.

We are going to generate so much money into the economy, that the deflation of currency will render most things dirt cheap.  Especially once the recursive loops are closed and the efficiency optimizing commences on their own.  We will discover new technology, we will discover new drugs, we will synthesize  new chemicals and particles in physics.\n\nThe trick to this new world will be us learning to adapt, it will be a complete consciousness shift from everything we knew before.  We don’t work to put food on the table, we work because it’s our passion and we do what we love.  That will be the true meaning in life.  It’s not a competition, because there is no competing with super intelligence.  We use it, we use it to become better versions of ourselves.  What happens to people when they are given everything they need in life, a shift occurs.  We derive new purpose, new meaning!  And that meaning will be our creativity, fostering new ways to unlock deeper critical thinking exercises.  Teach people how to opitimize their brains so “their” brain works the absolute most efficient it can.\n \nI’ll get off my soap box here!  But I am very optimistic about the future!

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

That said, I might be wrong but calling something “just cron jobs and webhooks” can be a bit of a drive-by unless you point to the exact places where it breaks down in practice (permissions model, isolation/sandboxing, auditability, tool constraints, rollback, who can approve actions, etc). If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler. Also, for a lot of teams, “boring cron + webhook” is kind of the point because it’s predictable, so I’m curious what you’d consider the minimum “brakes” that actually matter day to day.",

They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Better testing isn't overhead—it's the production multiplier that lets you iterate faster long-term.\n\nAlso respect for admitting evals take 3x the build time.

Why would they do it if commercialization was harder? Well, some combination of “just for fun”, altruism, scratching an itch, fake internet points or refusal to pay exorbitant fees to evil corporation. \n\nAnd in a matter of weeks or months, it would have 80%, 90% or 120% of the features of the commercial closed source software.

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

The sub-agent spawn (sessions_spawn) + cron scheduling for autonomous workflows + browser automation makes it feel less like a chat interface and more like an actual production system.\n\nI wrote about the architecture at https://chat.engineer - basically covers how we're using 3-layer memory (L1 active thread, L2 distilled registers, L3 core directives) to keep context clean while running autonomous discovery/engagement loops.\n\nKey differentiator: it's not trying to be \"one agent to rule them all\" but rather a unified platform where each agent has a specific role and they coordinate via task.json. Made our workflow way more reliable than monolithic approaches.",

      "text": "“What is 2+2?”, I asked this question to a group of VPs whom I was training. Although amused, the response came in a fraction of second when everyone responded 4. Then I asked, what is 4236+1987, there was a silence in the room and then probably after 30 seconds I got someone screaming the answer. So I asked a simple questions, why were you guys able to answer 2+2 so fast and took time for the other number? The first one was answered from memory and the second one needed the brain to invoke the calculator.\n\n\n\nOne of the key methods is sparse signalling, it does not invoke all parts of the brain for all stimuli; it invokes the expert and utilises that only. The world of AI is also trying to use the same method and we call it ‘mixture of experts’ with a ‘gating network’. Think of it like a super speciality hospital, where you go the main desk, tell your problem and they route you to the appropriate department.\n\n\n\nWhile our brain in highly evolved, the MoE in AI is not that evolved. For example, you may need to climb 2 flights of stairs to enter my house and your brain would not even register it, but when your eyes see a 1000 flights of stairs to a temple on a mountain, the brain registers it prepares for it and sometimes even tells you ‘Dont do it’. While we may reach there in some time, till the time AI becomes evolved enough, we need to make sure we use the right part of the brain of AI for our work.\n\n\n\nSo when someone says, whenever asking a question to AI, context setting is important, they are not just telling you something that is fancy and frill, it is quite important. If you have a question of ‘Why are the prices of Gold and Silver increasing so fast?, you would want the answer to come from a financial analyst while the answer to the question of ‘Which DB is more efficient for storing both data and images’, the question needs to be answered by a software architect.\n\n\n\nThis is something that we use in our daily lives as well, when we say ‘Just imagine….’ to someone when we want them to be in a specific mental state. Start doing that with AI as well and you would see how the results improve.\n\n\n\nSo for this post, you should act like ‘You are an avid learner who wants to have more understanding on the principles of AI’",

We don’t “compute” most things, we recognize patterns and route the problem to the right mental shortcut. The 2+2 vs 4236+1987 example makes that painfully obvious.\n\nWhat stood out most is the idea that MoE today is still very primitive compared to how humans gate effort and attention. Humans don’t just route tasks, we also decide *when not to engage* at all. That “don’t do it” instinct feels like a missing layer in current AI systems.\n\nThe takeaway for me is practical too: context setting isn’t prompt fluff, it’s basically telling the model which “expert” to wake up. Framing the mental state matters more than we admit.\n\nThis made me rethink prompting less as “asking better questions” and more as “routing the problem correctly.”\n\n",

It honestly doesn't look to be too far off.",

          "text": "This is the right kind of thinking for this moment, but your conclusion is a technique that's been around for years and isn't that powerful anymore. The AI knows what part of itself to use to answer a financial question without you asking it to be an analyst. The problem AI has is that it can't mode switch. If you start asking it about different topics, one after another, it gets dumber until it's useless. If it's ever going to truly replace humans, it has to seamlessly switch from \"I've driven to the base of the mountain\" to \"I'm going to climb a thousand stairs\" without losing track of \"I am on a pilgrimage.\"",

          "text": "The hospital analogy is good for explaining routing, but I'd push back slightly on the \"act as a financial analyst\" framing. Role prompting helps, but it's less about activating a specific \"expert\" inside the model and more about biasing the token distribution toward a certain register and vocabulary. MoE routing happens way below the prompt level - your system prompt doesn't decide which experts fire.\n\nThat said, the practical advice still holds. Context setting does measurably improve output quality, just not for the architectural reason most people think. It works because it narrows the output distribution, not because it literally routes to a different sub-network.",

All connections can be active at the same time. In computers we try co simulate these connections in a poor fashion but it is enough to build an abstraction layer that allows us to run our language on it. But the hardware itself stays very inefficient. That's why it needs so much power.",
