      "text": "Google just announced **UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol)** and it feels like a bigger deal than the name suggests.\n\nUCP is an **open standard** that lets **AI agents actually buy things**, not just recommend them. Think: product discovery → checkout → payment, all handled inside AI tools like **Google Search AI Mode** and **Gemini**.\n\nThe interesting part?\n\nThis isn’t just Google experimenting.\n\nPartners include:\n\n* Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy\n* Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, AmEx\n\n# Why this matters:\n\n* AI agents are becoming **buyers**, not assistants\n* Checkout pages and funnels could slowly disappear\n* Whoever controls AI discovery controls commerce\n* This feels like the **Stripe moment for AI-driven shopping**\n\nGoogle says merchants keep control and data — but if AI becomes the main interface, that balance could shift fast.\n\nThe entire shopping industry might change drastically. Whole different concerns about security and KYC problems.\n\nVisa and Mastercard have been partnering with agentic commerce companies since last Spring. They really don't want to miss this one.",

As a dev, I love the idea of it from an innovative standpoint, but how would one balance it in such a way that the customer retains control, and in a meaningful way that something like an autoship scheme already handles? Where is the safe and practical use case?",

Cursor cutting token usage, Claude improving tool handling, and Anthropic focusing on evals all point to the same thing: agents are hitting real-world limits and teams are now optimizing for reliability and cost instead of wow demos.\n\nI’m also noticing more attention on execution environments as agents move beyond clean APIs. Health, jobs, and enterprise coding all require agents to interact with messy, real systems. That’s where things tend to break unless the environment is controlled. We’ve seen better results when web interactions run in predictable setups like hyperbrowser, because it makes failures observable instead of mysterious.\n\nFeels like the next phase of agentic AI is less about new agents and more about making existing ones trustworthy enough to live in production.",

      "text": "idk who needs to hear this, but vector dbs are not the same as memory. ive been banging my head against the wall for the last month building a personal coding tutor agent and it was a total disaster until i realized this.\n\nBasically the goal was simple: an agent that remembers my skill level, current project, and coding style (like 'I hate list comprehensions, just give me loops'). I did the standard thing: **Pinecone, chunking, and a RAG pipeline.**\n\nIt worked for like an hour. By Day 3, the agent was a complete mess.\n\n1. Context Pollution: I ask about Python, it pulls a chunk from 3 days ago about SQL just because the semantic similarity was 'vaguely close' lol.\n2. No State Updates: If I tell it 'Actually, I want to switch to TypeScript,' it still pulls the old 'I use Python' chunks and gets confused.\n3. Token Bloat: I was retrieving so many 'relevant' chunks that my system prompt was hitting 4k+ tokens just for simple context. Its a nightmare for latency.\n\nHonestly, I fell into the trap of thinking RAG = Memory. It’s not. RAG is for static, encyclopedic knowledge. Memory is for user state, and state is dynamic.\n\nI eventually stumbled on an **open-source project** called **MemOS** ( **on github** ) that actually works for this. Instead of just dumping text into a vector store, it treats memory more like an OS. It has this 'lifecycle' concept (Generated -> Activated -> Merged -> Archived).\n\nBasically, when I tell the agent I’m done with Python, MemOS doesn't just leave that in the vector store to confuse the model later. It updates the state. It also separates 'Facts' from 'Preferences' during retrieval which is huge.\n\nThe result?

What finally clicked for me was stopping the attempt to make the Vector DB do the heavy lifting.\n​Instead, I started treating the vectors as localized pointers. Basically, the vector just identifies the 'neighborhood,' but then it triggers a look-up to a local reference file that holds the actual state and specific memory connections. It’s like using the Vector DB as an index for a separate, dynamic state-machine rather than a giant box of text. Has anyone else tried decoupling the 'search' from the 'truth' like this?\n\n1. The \"Vector as a Key\" (The Look-up)\n​Instead of storing the whole conversation in the Vector DB, you store a Key ID.\n​Vector Search: \"User wants to talk about Python loops.\"\n​The Result: It doesn't return text; it returns ID: PYTHON_001.\n\n​2. The \"Local File\" (The State Manager)\n​You have a simple local file (like a JSON or a small database) where PYTHON_001 lives. This file holds the \"Localized Value.\"\n\n{\n  \"PYTHON_001\": {\n    \"core_fact\": \"User uses loops, not comprehensions.\",\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"last_modified\": \"2026-01-16\",\n    \"dependency\": \"SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. The \"Logic Gate\" (The Final Prompt)\n​Your code looks at the local file before it talks to the LLM.\n​If the local file says status: Archived or language: Outdated, the agent ignores that vector.\n​If the file says dependency: SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER, the agent knows to keep the explanation simple.\n\nThe trick is to stop putting the 'answer' inside the Vector DB. Just use the Vector DB to retrieve a unique ID.\n​Once you have the ID, hit a local JSON or SQLite file that contains the 'state' for that ID. This local file acts as a filter. If your local state says 'User moved to TypeScript,' you can programmatically tell the agent to ignore any Python-related IDs the Vector DB tries to pull. You're basically building a state-machine that sits on top of your embeddings.",

          "text": "It sounds like you've had quite the experience with your coding tutor agent. Here are some insights that might resonate with your situation:\n\n- **Memory vs. Vector Databases**: It's crucial to differentiate between memory and vector databases. While vector databases like Pinecone are excellent for storing and retrieving static information, they don't inherently manage dynamic user state or preferences. Memory in applications is about retaining context and adapting to user interactions over time.\n\n- **Context Pollution**: This is a common issue when relying solely on vector databases. If the retrieval mechanism pulls in older, less relevant chunks, it can lead to confusion and a lack of coherence in responses.\n\n- **State Updates**: Dynamic state management is essential for applications that need to adapt to user changes. If your agent doesn't update its understanding of the user's current preferences or projects, it will continue to reference outdated information.\n\n- **Token Management**: Keeping the system prompt lightweight is vital for performance. By focusing on active memory rather than a large volume of historical data, you can significantly improve response times and reduce latency.\n\n- **Lifecycle Management**: The approach you found with MemOS, which treats memory like an operating system with a lifecycle concept, seems promising. This method allows for more effective state management by updating and archiving information as needed.\n\nFor further reading on memory and state management in LLM applications, you might find this resource helpful: [Memory and State in LLM Applications](https://tinyurl.com/bdc8h9td).",

If a customer has to wait 1.2s for every single hop in a multi-step flow, the UX just falls apart.\n\nI’ve realized that standard API-wrapper setups are often the bottleneck. The latency usually comes from the constant 'round-trips' between your backend, the LLM, and the tools.\n\nI’ve had much better results moving to a dedicated managed runtime where the agent logic runs closer to the execution layer. It handles the state persistence and retries natively, which shaves off those extra milliseconds that stack up in a typical backend. Plus, using smaller, specialized models for the intermediate steps (instead of one giant expensive model for everything) helps a lot with both speed and costs.\n\nHave you looked into using an agent-specific runtime yet, or are you still running everything through a standard REST API?",

Every extra hop (tool call, retrieval, function call, logging, retries) stacks. Even just TLS + region mismatch can add a few hundred ms.\n\nThe best ways I’ve found to reduce the latency are usually the following:\n- Stream the response so the user sees tokens immediately (perceived latency drops a lot)\n- Reduce round trips (one call instead of 2–4 calls, avoid “agent thinks → agent calls → agent thinks again” loops)\n- Cache aggressively (embeddings, retrieval results, common answers, even tool outputs)\n- Keep everything in the same region (your server + vector DB + model endpoint)\n- Use a small fast model for the first draft and only escalate to a bigger model when needed\n\nAnother thing… are you measuring from “user hits enter” to “first token,” or to “complete answer”? First token should be your target metric for “feels snappy.”",

      "text": "I’ve been building AI agents as a part of my work for the past year and the industry is almost changing too rapidly to keep up. I’m listing some of the tools I’ve found useful along the way.\n\n**High-code Tools**\n\n1. **Claude Agent SDK**: This is a python package that lets you use Claude Code directly. If you have an Anthropic subscription, it doesn’t get much better than this. Integrations are a problem though (can be resolved with MCPs)\n2. **Google ADK**: Google’s Agent Development Kit is another good option. It’s updated more frequently and is maintained slightly better than Claude’s agent SDK.\n3. **Deep Agents** (on LangGraph/LangChain/LangSmith): This is a relatively new library but is built on the existing Lang ecosystem so you get several integrations and easy observability out of the box. Best for people already familiar with the ecosystem.\n4. **PydanticAI**: In terms of overall abstractions I like this one quite a lot. It’s great for people who are agnostic on which model/ecosystem they want to use.\n5. **AutoGen**: This one is by Microsoft but doesn’t seem to be well maintained. It’s popular due to how early it was in the market though.\n\n**No/low-code Tools**\n\n1. **CrewAI**: Great for people who want a low-code experience where they can dip into the code when required but also achieve a lot without code.\n2. **NoClick**: Recent platform but they offer free unlimited usage for individuals. There are some basic integrations and support for arbitrary agent hierarchies + custom tools in a no-code interface.\n3. **n8n**: Classic for agentic automation and open-source. If you’re good with self-hosting, it can also be a pretty cheap option. They have hundreds of integrations and thousands of templates.\n4. **LangFlow**: This is a good one but you need their desktop app to use it which makes it a little inconvenient. They’re a mature platform with an active community though.\n5. **OpenAI Agent Builder**: Also recent and directly from OpenAI. It’s quite early though and limits you to the OpenAI ecosystem. Good to keep an eye on it though as it evolves and becomes more mature.\n\nCurious what tools people here are using and if I missed any good ones?",

          "text": "Solid list. One thing I’d add, which is less about agent logic and more about making agents actually work in the real world, is browser infrastructure. A lot of agent failures I’ve seen don’t come from planning or reasoning, but from interacting with messy websites, logins, dynamic pages, or JS heavy flows. Once agents leave clean APIs, things get fragile fast.\n\nThat’s why some teams pair these frameworks with a controlled browser layer like hyperbrowser. It’s not an agent framework itself, but it solves a big missing piece by giving agents a stable, observable environment to browse, extract, and act without fighting selectors or flaky automation. In practice, that often matters more than switching between LangGraph, PydanticAI, or CrewAI once you hit production.",

Here are some thoughts to strengthen your post:\n\n**Completeness & Clarity**: The post cuts off mid-sentence at the end (OpenAI Agent Builder description), so finishing that would be helpful. Also, consider adding a brief comparison matrix or decision tree (e.g., \"Choose this if you need X\") to help readers pick the right tool for their use case rather than just listing features.\n\n**Missing Context & Best Practices**: You could enhance this by mentioning important considerations like: cost comparison, learning curve, community size, production-readiness, and vendor lock-in risks. For example, noting that self-hosted options (n8n, LangFlow) have different operational overhead than managed platforms would help readers make informed decisions. Also, a brief note on when to use agents vs. simpler automation would add value.\n\n**Depth & Specificity**: While you mention integrations and observability, consider adding real-world use case examples for each tool or tier. For instance, \"CrewAI excels at multi-agent workflows where agents need to collaborate\" gives readers clearer guidance. Also, your note about MCPs resolving Claude SDK's integration issues deserves more explanation—many readers may not know what MCPs are.\n\n**Engagement & Updates**: Since you mention the industry changes rapidly, consider adding a note about how often you plan to update this list or inviting community feedback on newer tools. This positions you as a trusted, ongoing resource rather than a static reference.",

Will you stick to plans provided by such agent?\n\n  \nDid you use any food recommendation AI agent?

Not ones that auto reply to everything, but agents that triage, summarize long threads, and draft responses so I’m never starting from scratch. That alone saves mental energy every day.\n\nFor travel or food, I trust agents more as filters than deciders. I like when an agent narrows options based on constraints and context, then lets me choose. When those agents pull real availability, prices, or menus from the web in a stable way, they become much more useful. That’s where reliable browsing matters. If an agent can actually check current info through a predictable setup like hyperbrowser instead of guessing, I’m far more likely to trust the suggestion.\n\nOverall, most people still default to ChatGPT style chats, but agents start to feel valuable when they handle background work continuously. The moment you stop thinking “I need to ask the AI” and just get a helpful nudge or summary, that’s when daily life agents really click.",

      "text": "A lot of people are disappointed after building their first “AI agent.” It works in a demo… then collapses the moment you try to run it twice, scale it, or trust it with real work.\n\nThe failure usually isn’t the model. It’s the **architecture**.\n\nMost agent projects fail because they’re built like *chatbots with tools* instead of **agent-native systems**. There’s a big difference.\n\nHere are a few patterns that actually matter if you want something resembling a Digital FTE:\n\n**1. Agents should execute specs, not vibes**  \nIn reliable systems, agents don’t just “figure it out.” They operate against explicit specifications: inputs, outputs, constraints, and success criteria. This makes behavior repeatable and auditable instead of probabilistic chaos.\n\n**2. Orchestration is a control plane, not a loop**  \nA simple `while(true)` agent loop is not orchestration. Real orchestration decides:\n\n* which agent runs\n* with what context\n* under what conditions\n* and when to stop or escalate\n\nWithout this, you don’t have a worker — you have an infinite prompt generator.\n\n**3. State must survive the model**  \nIf all your state lives inside the LLM context window, your agent is amnesic. Agent-native systems treat state as external and persistent so work can resume, be inspected, or be corrected later.\n\n**4. Tools > text**  \nMature agents spend most of their time calling tools, not generating prose. The model reasons *about* actions; the system executes actions deterministically. This is how you reduce hallucinations and increase trust.\n\n**5. Failure paths are first-class**  \nHuman workers escalate when something is unclear. Digital FTEs need the same behavior. If your agent never says “I’m unsure,” it’s not autonomous — it’s dangerous.\n\nNone of this is flashy, but this is the difference between:\n\n* “Cool demo”\n* and “Something you can actually deploy”\n\nI’m still building and learning in this space, but the biggest takeaway so far is this: **agent systems look more like distributed systems than prompt engineering**.\n\nCurious how others here are thinking about agent reliability and orchestration — especially outside toy examples.",

If you cannot inspect, rewind, or resume work, you are basically running a fancy autocomplete loop and hoping it behaves. Failure paths are another one people skip because demos never show escalation.\n\nI like the framing that agent systems look closer to distributed systems than prompt engineering.

Systems behave fine until they’re retried, restarted, or partially fail — then actions that shouldn’t proceed still do.\nIt seems less like a prompting problem and more like an execution problem: how decisions are ordered, when they’re allowed to advance, and what happens when assumptions break.\nOnce you start looking at agents through that lens, a lot of “AI bugs” start to resemble classic distributed systems failures — replay, double-commit, stale context, silent retries.\nCurious how others think about enforcing when an agent is allowed to act, not just what it says.",

You need BOTH and you need them to work TOGETHER.

Reliability comes from enforcement, not better prompts.\n\nThe “state surviving the model” point is where most projects quietly fail. If you can’t explain why a step was allowed, blocked, or escalated after the fact, you don’t really have an agent — you have a one-shot suggestion generator with memory loss.\n\nFailure paths are the tell. Real systems assume disagreement, uncertainty, and interruption as the default, not the edge case. If escalation isn’t structurally possible, autonomy is just optimism.\n\nTotally agree on the distributed systems comparison. Once you start thinking in terms of contracts, invariants, and commit boundaries, prompt quality becomes almost secondary.",

This tool is designed specifically for extracting data from Glassdoor, including job listings.\n\n- **Set Up Your Scraper**:\n  - Create an account on Apify for free.\n  - Add the URLs of the Glassdoor pages you want to scrape into the scraper's input fields. You can include various types of pages such as job postings, company reviews, etc.\n  \n- **Start the Scraping Process**: Once your URLs are set, click the \"Start\" button to begin scraping. The tool will run and extract the data you need.\n\n- **Export the Data**: After the scraping process is complete, you can export the data in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or XML. This makes it easy to feed the data into your AI SDR.\n\n- **Automation**: If you're looking to scrape at a larger scale, consider automating the process using Apify Actors, which can schedule and manage your scraping tasks efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the tutorial on how to scrape Glassdoor [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j6u272j).",

Many of the tasks you've outlined are indeed repetitive and can consume a lot of time and resources. Here are some thoughts on your idea of creating an SDK or hosted service to streamline this process:\n\n- **Standardization Potential**: There is definitely room for standardization in the AI agent space. Many developers face similar challenges, and a well-designed SDK could save time and reduce redundancy.\n  \n- **Existing Solutions**: While there are frameworks and platforms that address some of these needs, they often require significant customization. A solution that provides a more integrated approach could fill a gap in the market.\n\n- **Focus on Flexibility**: Ensure that your SDK allows for flexibility and customization. Different projects may have unique requirements, and a one-size-fits-all approach might limit its appeal.\n\n- **Community Feedback**: Engaging with the developer community could provide valuable insights. Gathering feedback on what features are most needed could help shape your SDK.\n\n- **Market Demand**: Assessing the demand for such a solution is crucial. If many developers express similar frustrations, it could indicate a viable market for your product.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this further, consider looking into existing frameworks and identifying what they lack. This could help you create a more compelling offering.",

It can also connect with internal services and answer questions like package tracking etc\n2. Data driven content creation & repurposing: Stuff like analyzing content gaps on Google search console to improve google ranking and creating content for this has been completely automated using AI agents like Frizerly for us! The key is ensuring the agent is plugged into all your data sources including customer case studies, product data etc! Its pretty cool how it can auto publish blogs on our website and then cross post then automatically on social media  etc!\n3. A/B testing ads: AI agents like Plai has been able to automate a/b testing ads including image assets for us! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved!",

Instead of focusing only on technical frameworks, I grouped tools by how much setup or coding effort they require. Here’s a practical list based on my experience.\n\nNo / Low-Code Tools (Great for Fast Deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no code AI agent focused on execution rather than complex setup. You simply describe or demonstrate the task, and it performs the actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than configuring automation, making it ideal for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflow creation and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be challenging for beginners, but it’s very powerful once set up.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors without writing much code, but still tweak if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, though requiring the desktop app can be restrictive for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Early stage but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n***High Code / Developer Focused Tools***\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for using Claude models directly. Powerful if you’re already in the Anthropic ecosystem, though integration options are limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is updated frequently and maintained actively. Great for developers wanting robust integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph / LangChain / LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the existing Lang ecosystem. Best for those familiar with Lang tools, offering easy observability and several integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nHighly abstracted framework that allows flexibility across models and ecosystems. Suitable for developers who prefer model agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nAn early entrant in autonomous agents. Popular for its history, though maintenance is limited. Best for experimentation and learning purposes.\n\nCurious to hear what tools others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms that you’ve found practical in 2026?",

The no‑code platforms feel more like delegation (you describe the task, it executes), while the high‑code ones are closer to building a system from scratch where you define the logic and observability.\n\nWhat I’m curious about is how these tools evolve beyond “execution engines” into something that manages relationships and memory. Dashboards give you data, but agents are starting to act like collaborators. That shift changes not just the technical stack but how we design workflows around them.\n\nPersonally I’ve been experimenting with CrewAI and LangFlow for quick prototyping, then moving into LangGraph when I want more control. Would love to hear if anyone’s found newer platforms that balance ease of use with deeper context management.",

The difference between a demo that works on a clean test site vs something that handles real world web complexity is massive, and honestly most of these platforms still fall apart when you try to use them for anything beyond basic workflows.",

Very few are just getting in to distributed agents and just-in-time dynamic tooling. Even all the agentic frameworks have development patterns from the 00s in their examples. I’ve been saying this a long time but software engineering was ‘solved’ as far as ‘how it’s done’ - microservices and distributed resources. For some reason everyone forgot when AI came around… it’s been confusing. \n\nLearn advanced RAG techniques. Built out tooling to make it easy to perform RAG over any corpus. Modular, scalable development with maintainable, extendable modules for ingestion, processing, storage, retrieval. Every company on earth needs this. Focus on demand today. \n\nBe active. Every conversation look for opportunities to ‘flex’. Don’t be annoying (it’s a fine line) but it’s OK to talk about things you’ve done/worked on if it’s relevant. \n\nFinally, always look for work. Even if you get a job - these skills are the highest demand skills and the more projects you do the more valuable you become. Take on side gigs, keep your resume up to date, be proactive: if someone has a question you are confident about answering, just ask - ‘do you need help?’ \n\nCheers!",

Those two packages are literally all you need for (on top of OpenAI’s Agents SDK) to build 99% of solutions. Don’t use MCP as an API wrapper… that’s dumb.

I’ve done it for myself extensively and now for a handful of companies… some extremely large (tens of millions of documents). \n\nI realized early that some form of RAG is needed by literally every company in the world and, as people start having personal assistants I didn’t want to rely on OpenAI or Anthropic or *whoever* to be responsible for managing my context. As such, I built a sovereign context management box that is essentially a mini datacenter in a 10U server rack flight case. It’s a Kubernetes cluster running distributed agents and HA, durable storage with on-board local LLM compute. I then proceeded to build connectors for every part of my life: meetings, email, text messages, life… needed a system to store and retrieve it. It became more complex but more performant over time. Then I found a few companies and people who were also interested in managing their context outside of corporate control so I built them systems. \n\nI went into a little detail recently here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/n1Sp1jaKW2. \n\nAnyway… it was a multi-year learning path. For a shortcut I recommend just starting with graphRAG and understanding how to store data without a bunch of duplication and how to interface search between vectors and graph traversal and how you build the architecture for artifact storage, summaries, etc. \n\nHope that helps lol",

While AI tools have indeed made it easier to produce content, they have also democratized access to high-quality outputs, leading to increased competition.\n- The ease of production means that more people can create and share their work, but this saturation can make it challenging for individual contributions to stand out.\n- As a result, the average quality of work may have improved, but so have the expectations from audiences and consumers. This can lead to a scenario where only exceptional work is recognized, leaving mediocre efforts overlooked.\n- In essence, while AI can facilitate the shipping of work, it also demands a higher standard of quality and originality to capture attention and be taken seriously.\n\nFor further insights on the implications of AI in various domains, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h)\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)",

It supports BYOK and can help you to organize local files, automate browsers end-to-end.\n\nAt the core is CAMEL’s Workforce system, which is inspired by distributing systems: a root node for task planning and coordination, worker nodes for execution, and an asynchronous task channel. It also supports failure tolerance and recursive workers for long-horizon tasks. All of this is open source.\n\nFor browser automation, Eigent uses a two-layer architecture:\n\n* a Python layer for agent reasoning and orchestration\n* a TypeScript layer (built on Playwright) for native browser control (DOM ops, SoM markers, occlusion handling)\n\nThese two layers communicate asynchronously via WebSockets to keep things low-latency and avoid the limits of Python-only automation. This stack is also open source.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests!",

Tried finding an alternative for weeks — zero results for combining LangGraph with Claude Agent SDK.\n\nSo I figured it out. Here's the pattern:\n\nLangGraph handles orchestration — state management, conditional routing, parallel execution. Claude Agent SDK handles what happens inside each node — full agent capabilities, tool use, context, not just raw API responses.\n\nYou define your workflow graph in LangGraph, but each node calls the SDK instead of hitting the API directly. You get the best of both and you're not burning credits while prototyping.\n\nBuilt an 11-agent system with this. Research agents run in parallel, analysis agents process outputs, synthesis agents compile reports. LangGraph controls the flow, SDK powers every step.\n\nDocumented the whole thing into a workshop because I genuinely couldn't find this anywhere online.\n\nMaybe there's a reason everyone's using direct calls and I'm missing it. But this has been working well for months. Curious what others think — anyone tried something similar?",

Is plugged into a data driven feedback loop where the agent can look at results and self improve\n\nFor example, let's take the simplest example! For example, if you are using an AI agents like Frizerly to automate SEO, not only should the AI agents be properly trained on your business data, customer data and products, but you should also ensure its plugged into analytics like Google search console so that that agent can self improve over time based on results!\n\nWithout completing this loop, its basically just automation, not agents :)",

          "text": "The biggest lesson for me was that agents fail far more often because of system design than model quality. Reasoning is rarely the bottleneck. What breaks is state, assumptions about inputs, flaky tools, or unclear stopping conditions. Once an agent touches real data or real apps, every hidden shortcut shows up fast.\n\nAnother big realization was how much execution stability matters. When agents interact with the web or dashboards, running those steps in a predictable environment like hyperbrowser made a noticeable difference. It helped separate “bad reasoning” from “the world behaved differently than expected.” After that, agents became less impressive but far more useful, which is usually the trade you want in real workflows.",

          "text": "- One significant lesson is the importance of having a robust framework for evaluating AI agents. Without proper evaluation metrics, it can be challenging to determine how well an agent performs in real-world scenarios. This includes tracking agent-specific metrics, visibility into planning and tool use, and managing costs and latency effectively. [Introducing Agentic Evaluations - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3zymprct)\n\n- Another key takeaway is the need for clear orchestration among multiple agents. As workflows become more complex, ensuring that agents do not duplicate efforts or fail to complete tasks is crucial. Using an orchestrator can help coordinate these agents effectively. [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)\n\n- Additionally, understanding the reasoning cycle of AI agents—reason, act, observe, and respond—can help in designing more effective workflows. This structured approach allows agents to handle complex tasks more dynamically than traditional systems. [Do You Really Understand AI Agents? - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/4vr8vdz6)\n\n- Finally, the integration of AI agents into existing systems can be simplified with platforms that streamline deployment and reduce code complexity. This can significantly enhance the development process and make it easier to create reliable AI solutions.

With access to 100% of PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, DailyMed, Clinicaltrials gov, live web search, and now I have also added: ChEMBL, Drugbank, Open Targets, SEC fillings, NPI Registry, and WHO ICD codes.\n\nI was at a top London university for CS and was always watching my girlfriend and other biology/science PhD students waste entire days because every single AI tool is fundamentally broken for them. These people are smart people doing actual research. Comparing CAR-T efficacy across trials. Tracking ads adverse events. Tryign to figure out why their $50k mouse model won't replicate results from a paper published 6months ago.\n\nThey ask ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity about a 2024 pembrolizumab trial. It confidently cites a paper. The paper does not exist. It made it up. My friend asked all these AIs for keynote-006 Orr values. Three different numbers. All wrong. Not even close. Just completely fabricated.\n\nThis is actually insane. The information all exists. Right now. 37 million papers on Pubmed. Half a million registered trials. 2.5+ million bioactive compounds on ChEMBL. Every drug mechanism in DrugBank with validated targets.Every preprint ever released. Every FDA label. All of it public. \n\nBut you ask an AI and it just fucking lies to you. Not because Claude or gpt are bad models, they're incredible, but they literally just don't have the search tools needed. They are doing statistical parlor tricks on training data from 2024. They're blind.\n\nThe dbs exist. The models exist. Someone just needs to connect these together...\n\nSo, I have been working on this...\n\n**What it has access to:**\n\n* PubMed (37M+ papers, fulltext multimodal not just abstracts)\n* ArXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv (every preprint in bio/physics/etc)\n* Clinicaltrials dot Gov (complete trial registry)\n* DailyMed (FDA drug labels and safety data)\n* ChEMBL (2.5M+ bioactive compounds with bioactivity data)\n* DrugBank (15K+ drugs with mechanisms, interactions, pharmacology)\n* Open Targets (60K+ drug targets with disease associations)\n* SEC Filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks - useful for pharma pipeline/financial research)\n* NPI Registry (8M+ US healthcare providers)\n* WHO ICD Codes (ICD-10/11 diagnosis and billing codes)\n* Live web search (useful for realtime news/company research etc)\n\nThis way every query hits the primary literature and returns proper citations. \n\n**Technical capabilities:**\n\nPrompt it: \"Pembrolizumab vs nivolumab in NSCLC. Pull Phase 3 data, compute ORR deltas, plot survival curves, export tables.\"\n\nExecution chain:\n\n1. Query clinical trial registry + PubMed for matching studies\n2. Retrieve full trial protocols and published results\n3. Parse results, patient demographics, efficacy data\n4. Execute Python: statistical analysis, survival modeling, visualization\n5. Generate report with citations, confidence intervals, and exportable datasets\n\nWhat takes a research associate 40 hours happens in \\~5mins.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\nAI + Execution:\n\n* Vercel AI SDK (the best framework for agents + tool calling in my opinion)\n* Daytona - for code execution (so easy to use... great DX)\n* Next.js + Supabase\n\nSearch Infrastructure:\n\n* valyu Search API (this search API gives the agent access to all the biomedical data, pubmed/clinicaltrials/chembl/drugbank/etc that the app uses, it is a single search endpoint which is nice)\n\nIt can also hook up to local LLMs via Ollama / LMStudio (see readme for self-hosted mode)\n\nIt is 100% open-source, self-hostable, and model-agnostic. I also built a hosted version so you can test it without setting anything up. Only thing is oath signup so the search works.\n\nIf something's broken, or you think something is missing, please file an issue or PR the fix! Really appreciate any contributions to it! Especially around the workflow of the app if you are an expert in the sciences.\n\nThis is a bit of a relaunch with a bunch more datasets - we've added ChEMBL for compound screening, DrugBank for drug mechanisms and interactions, Open Targets for target validation, NPI for provider lookups, and WHO ICD for medical coding. Basically everything you need for end-to-end biomedical research.\n\nHave left the github repo below!",

When something goes wrong, you can point to which invariant blocked or allowed progress, instead of spelunking through planner internals.\n\nYour emphasis on replayability and explicit control planes is exactly where this space needs to go. Treating agent runs like infrastructure events rather than “smart conversations” makes a lot of downstream problems much easier to reason about — especially once failures and escalation paths become first-class instead of edge cases.",

The whole cycle takes seconds. Compare that to real-world processes where you make a decision and find out six months later if it was good, through vague signals like \"the client seemed unhappy\" or quarterly revenue dipping.\n\nOn top of that, errors in code are structured. You don't get fuzzy complaints, you get standardized error codes, line numbers, logs that are parseable and consistent. The signal is clean. In the real world, feedback is noisy, ambiguous, and often contradictory.\n\nPlus there's millions of examples online: code repos, Stack Overflow threads, documentation. The training data basically maps problems to solutions directly.\n\nSo yeah, coding gets crushed by AI because it's the rare domain where success is objective, feedback is instant, and the signal is crystal clear.
