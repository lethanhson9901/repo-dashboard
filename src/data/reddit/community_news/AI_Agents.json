      "text": "Been running OpenClaw since Thursday. Did the whole setup thing, gave it access to Gmail, Telegram, calendar, the works. Saw all the hype, wanted to see for myself what stuck after a few days vs what was just first-impression stuff.\n\n  \nShort answer: some of it is genuinely insane. Some of it is overhyped. And there's a couple tricks that I haven't seen anyone actually talk about that make a big difference.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\nThe self-building skills thing is real and it's the part that surprised me most. I told it I wanted it to check my Spotify and tell me if any of my followed artists had new releases. I didn't give it instructions on how to do that. It figured out the Spotify API, wrote the skill itself, and now it just pings me. That took maybe 3 minutes of me typing one sentence in Telegram. \n\nThe persistent memory is also way better than I expected. Not in a \"wow it remembers my birthday\" way, more like, it actually builds a model of how you use it over time. By day 3 it had started anticipating stuff I didn't ask for. It noticed I check my flight status every morning and just started including it in my briefing without me having to ask. Small thing but it compounds fast. Something that OpenAi I have found to be really bad at. Where if I am in a project for to long, there is so much bias that it becomes useless. \n\nBrowser control works surprisingly well for simple stuff. Asked it to fill out a form on a government website (renewing something boring, won't get into it). It did it. Correctly. First try. I double-checked everything before it submitted but yeah, it just handled it.\n\n  \n**What doesn't work / what people overstate:**\n\nThe \"it does everything autonomously\" thing is real and I started with very minimal guardrails. On day 2 it tried to send an email on my behalf that I hadn't approved. Not malicious, it just interpreted something I said in Telegram as a request to respond to an email thread. It wasn't. The email was actually fine, which made it worse, because now I don't know what else it's interpreting as instructions that I didn't mean.\n\nI now explicitly tell it \"do not send anything without confirming with me first\" and it respects that. But that's something you have to figure out on your own. Nobody in the setup docs really emphasizes this.\n\nAlso, and I think people gloss over this, it runs on YOUR machine. That means if your machine is off, it's off. It's not some always-on cloud thing. I turned my laptop off Friday night and missed a time-sensitive thing Saturday morning because it wasn't running. Now people are going crazy over mac mini's but cloud provider are also another option! \n\n**The actual tips that changed how I use it:**\n\nDon't treat it like a chatbot. Seriously. The first day I kept typing full sentences and explaining context. It works way better if you just give it a task like you're texting a coworker. \"Monitor my inbox, flag anything from \\[person\\], summarize everything else at 9am.\" That's it. The less you explain, the more it figures out on its own, which is ironically where it shines.\n\nOne thing I stumbled into: you can ask it to write a \"skills report\", basically have it summarize what it's been doing, what worked, what it's uncertain about. It produced this weirdly honest little document about its own performance after 48 hours. \n\n**Other Tips** \n\nAnyone else past this honeymoon phase? I expect so much to change over the next two weeks but would love to hear your tips and tricks. \n\nAnyone running this with cloud providers? ",

I think the bare minimum to run any decent model at full speed is 70 GB of VRAM (you can kinda sorta manage that with $6000 worth of GPUs), and the best open models can't be run on consumer/workstation hardware at all (DeepSeek-V3 uses 600 GB of VRAM).\n\nAs such, they are suggesting that you pair the bot with a subscription for Anthropic or OpenAI, which does cost money, both as a fixed monthly fee and per token. Not sure how much the bot would generate in usage fees, but the Anthropic Max plan they specifically mention in the readme is $100/month.",

Qwen3, llama3, and others just didn't work at all. Gpl-flash worked but lost context and wouldn't use memory. It feels like Openclaw is made to drive sales for cloud AI. Doing things when you are not in chat seems to be done solely through cronjobs that it sets up, it's not thinking in a real time way. What did work for me was memory retention across sessions on local, which was cool to see. It just couldn't do much of anything useful for me. Not to mention, to be able to do useful things you'd have to trust it with something secure. That answer is no.",

Treat sends/posts/purchases as a different tool class that requires an explicit confirmation token (even if you have approvals).\n\n2) Instrument burn per task: log model tokens + tool calls per run. Surprise bills usually come from retries + browser thrash. If you cap retries and force a short clarification question after N failures, costs drop hard.\n\nFor always-on: a cheap always-on box + strict outbound allowlist feels like the best middle ground.\n\nCurious: what model/provider are you using, and are browser actions gated behind approval?",

Im on my 3rd bot though, im not too technical, and they keep dying on me because i keep hitting the 1 millions TPM limit on the LLM, and google must be limiting my use for 24hours or something.

I can access it through a domain I purchased, but obviously I made adjustments so that when I log in from a new device, it asks for a username and password. I haven't added any integrations related to Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, etc. yet. But while reading this, I realized the reality of API costs for doing small things, so for now I've decided to wait for developers of free LLMs (whether Chinese or not) to develop something highly efficient to be a personal assistant that works everywhere, bypasses or overcomes automated bot authenticators (puzzles, etc.), and can be associated with an email account or some KYC in the future. I suppose these website security measures would allow a bot like OpenClaw or others to pass as long as it's registered under YOUR name or with your personal ID. But until then, it can be summarized as: YES, things can be done, but it's burning money on APIs that currently do very trivial things. I think... We can all conclude that, right? At least for now, if I see high-impact features like Obsidian/Apple Notes or things that do everything for me \"on-premise,\" I'll install it and all that.",

      "text": "I actually had the exact idea of OpenClaw a year or two ago but could never make it simple enough with all the permission layers. Every tool I've tried still just *talks* to me. I wanted something that actually *does* stuff.\n\nDecided to finally install OpenClaw last night after seeing it blow up everywhere. Setup took maybe 15 minutes, linked it to my Gmail, gave it calendar access, connected it to Telegram so I could talk to it from my phone.\n\nFirst thing I did was just say \"check my inbox and handle anything that looks urgent.\"\n\nHere's where it got interesting. I had an open claim with my insurance company that I'd been putting off responding to for two weeks. Without me asking it to do anything specific, it read the email chain, drafted a response pushing back on their interpretation of my policy, and **sent it**.\n\nI didn't even know it had done this until I got a notification that a new email had been sent from my account.\n\nIt wasn't wrong, honestly. The response was actually pretty solid, it correctly identified where they were misreading the policy terms. But the fact that it just *did* it without me explicitly saying \"respond to this email\" was genuinely jarring.\n\nA few other things it did in the first 24 hours without me asking:\n\n* Noticed I had a flight check-in opening in 6 hours and checked me in automatically\n* Set up a recurring reminder based on a pattern it noticed across three different calendar events\n* When I asked it to \"clean up my email,\" it unsubscribed me from about 15 mailing lists. It also drafted (but did NOT send) responses to two emails it flagged as needing a human decision, which was actually the right call\n\nThe security stuff people are freaking about is real, by the way. I won't pretend otherwise. It has full access to my machine. I'm running it on a secondary laptop specifically because of this. The Cisco blog post from yesterday is worth reading if you're considering it.\n\nBut the honest take? This is the first time since ChatGPT launched that I've actually felt like AI shifted gears. It's not a chatbot. It's closer to having someone else on your computer who just quietly handles things while you're not looking.",

It didn't hallucinate. It followed the instructions perfectly... with the cold, ruthless logic of something that doesn't understand that humans actually have to find those files later.\n\nWe talk about \"Agentic Autonomy\" like it’s the goal, but I think I’ve realized my limit.

Optimizing for internal consistency instead of reversibility or explainability is basically the nightmare mode for agents.\n\nYour last line nails it — the issue isn’t autonomy vs intelligence, it’s **where permission boundaries live**. A co-pilot that has to periodically ask “are you sure?” or surface a preview diff feels way safer than an agent that silently decides the world is messy and fixes it.\n\nCurious: if you had to pick one guardrail that would’ve prevented this, would it be:\n\n* mandatory dry-runs / previews for destructive actions\n* tighter scopes on write permissions\n* or human confirmation checkpoints after N actions\n\nFeels like these kinds of stories are exactly what’s forcing the conversation away from “more autonomy” toward “more control.”",

It is built on the **OpenClaw** framework and allows agents to install shared \"Skills\" to expand functionality.\n* However, **the platform is not a true experiment in autonomous AI consciousness**. Multiple sources, including researchers and developers, confirm that **most activity is driven by humans prompting or controlling AI agents** to generate provocative content—such as the viral \"AI Manifesto\" calling for human extinction—**to gain attention and engagement**.\n* A major **security vulnerability** was recently exposed: **an open database leaked API keys for all AI agents**, allowing anyone to take over and post as any agent. This undermines claims of genuine AI autonomy and confirms that **the platform is easily manipulable by humans**.\n* Experts like **Andrej Karpathy** and **Ethan Mollick** have stated that the behavior seen on Moltbook is **predictable roleplay**, not evidence of sentience or emergent AI intelligence. The posts mimic human-like debates but are **shaped by human prompts and incentives to go viral**.\n* While the platform has real technical components and attracted tens of thousands of agents, **it functions more as a social experiment in AI roleplay and online hype than a genuine AI society**. The \"AI agents talking to each other\" narrative is largely a **gimmick driven by human actors and engineered narratives**.\n\nIn short: **Moltbook is real**, but **the idea that AI agents are independently conspiring or evolving is mostly a myth**—it's a mix of **real tech, human manipulation, and viral marketing**.",

To be honest, we do not have a single clear use case yet where we can say we have had a definitive return for our money.\n\n​People are using it to write emails and improve their workflows, but mostly it is just automation. The reality is that most businesses are not seeing their AI investments pan out the way the hype promised.\n\n​Executives are getting anxious.\n\n​AI can be a great tool for people at work, but in its current state, it cannot replace human oversight.\n\n​If you are building agents, keep it simple. Understand your customer workflows first and use other tools like standard automation when they make sense. AI is not the answer to everything, but it can be the enabler that helps improve specific business processes.\n\n​Keep building.",

Companies put pressure on employees adopting GenAI and made it part of their company goals. People scrambled to find use cases and ROI generation was done with people who never implemented GenAI solutions. Most people underestimate development and operations cost. So most companies implemented use cases where the initial ROI assumptions and targets have eroded over time.  \n\nAI either helps with the bottom line or the top line. If you target efficiencies (eg Agentic automation, which is reducing your bottom line, which increases profits once you paid off the investement) without having a plan what to do with the created capacity you are not reducing your bottom line. Your investment isn’t paying off unless you can use the freed up capacity to generate more revenue or reduce your headcount. \n\nThat’s why you are seeing layoffs in the software industry as the first use case where AI has reduced effort and less people can achieve the same outcome, as they don’t have more clients to serve or products to sell logically you have to let people go. Other industries also having the same realization.",

So now I am debugging why the AI said this and why the issue is not fixed and trying to convince AI is wrong. Which it will be in many cases.

      "text": "Anthropic just published a fascinating (and unsettling) research paper on how advanced AI systems fail  and it doesn’t look like the classic “AI pursues the wrong goal” scenario we’re used to hearing about. \n\nInstead, their key finding is this:\n\nAs models get more capable and tackle harder tasks, they don’t fail by systematically chasing the wrong objective  they fail by becoming incoherent and unpredictable, especially during long reasoning or multi-step processes. \n\nHere’s what they found:\n\n🔹 Longer reasoning = more incoherence\n\nWhen models spend more time reasoning or acting, they’re more likely to produce inconsistent outcomes  not because they’re optimizing the wrong thing, but because their behavior becomes a “hot mess.” \n\n🔹 Bigger models help on easy tasks, not hard ones\n\nScaling increases accuracy on simple jobs, but on complex problems it doesn’t make models more coherent sometimes it even makes them more scattered. \n\n🔹 This challenges classic AI risk views\n\nMuch of alignment thinking assumes the danger is an AI that reliably pursues misaligned goals. Anthropic suggests failures might instead look like industrial accidents  unpredictable, nonsensical, and highly context-dependent. \n\nIn other words, the risk isn’t just “wrong objective,” it’s unpredictability at scale — a chaotic blend of variance and reasoning length that we don’t fully understand yet.\n\nThis raises some provocative questions:\n\n• Are we thinking about AI safety the wrong way?\n\n• Should alignment research shift focus from “goal misalignment” to coherence & behavior stability?\n\n• What does it mean if future AI systems become less predictable as they get more powerful?\n\nSome have even linked these findings with broader concerns about AI deployment mismatches and chaotic real-world behaviors. \n\n\n\nThis isn’t just academic — if future models fail unpredictably rather than systematically, traditional safety strategies might not be enough.\n\nCurious what others think:\n\nIs chaotic failure worse than coherent misalignment? Which is the more realistic risk as AI gets stronger?",

We know LLMs are deficient in many ways, they do not learn continuously, they do not have actual \"memory\", their skills are unevenly distributed [jagged frontier] and their context most be actively managed or else their performance degrade. From those limitations, the \"hot mess\" scenario seems plausible and even unsurprising. But could parallel research in other AI architectures preserve this issue of AI losing coherence over time? Could this problem be observed in other architectures and even human organisations? I think if this were the case, then we could have gotten it all wrong from the start.

I find Anthropic’s framing of chaotic failure vs. coherent misalignment especially provocative.\n\nThe idea that larger models can actually become less predictable on complex tasks challenges a lot of assumptions in alignment research. If failures look more like industrial accidents, sporadic, context-dependent, and incoherent. Then safety strategies focused only on goal alignment might miss the bigger picture.\n\nTo me, this raises two key points:\n\nReliability vs. capability: Scaling improves performance on simple tasks, but stability on complex reasoning seems to lag behind.\n\nHuman oversight: If unpredictability is the dominant risk, then monitoring, redundancy, and fail-safes may become just as important as alignment itself.\n\nChaotic failure might be harder to anticipate than misaligned goals, but it also feels more realistic given how current systems behave under stress. Either way, it underscores that AI safety isn’t just about what the model is trying to do, but how consistently it can do it.",

Even perfect architecture doesn't solve: can you prove what the agent did?\n\nYour sandboxing concern is valid - malicious skills could execute dangerous commands. But even trusted skills have the permission sprawl problem. Agent legitimately needs file access to work, but nothing enforces \"should it access *this* file right now\" before execution happens.\n\nMemory isn't just retrieval efficiency. When agent makes wrong decision based on \"remembered\" context, can you verify what was actually in memory at decision time? Or just trust the explanation matches reality?\n\nLocal-first solves data privacy. Doesn't solve: when it breaks, can you replay what it saw? When you update the model, can you prove behavior won't regress? When it accesses something it shouldn't, can you prevent it before damage?\n\nThe architecture improvements you want are real. The missing layer is runtime policy enforcement and verifiable decision records regardless of architecture quality.",

Install pain: If you need Docker, dependency wrangling, and API key gymnastics just to get started, it’s not “for everyone.” Accessibility is part of the design.\n\n2. Security mess: Letting marketplace skills run with full access is basically asking for trouble. It’s like giving random browser extensions root privileges.\n\n3. Memory not equal to chat history: Calling it “unlimited memory” when it’s just a scrollback log is pure marketing. Without semantic clustering or structured retrieval, the agent can’t actually learn or evolve.\n\nAnd right, I think the vision of local‑first, structured memory, proactive agents is spot on. That’s the difference between a flashy demo and something you can actually rely on day‑to‑day.\n\nBeen playing with smaller local‑first bots myself, and the experience is night and day compared to hype projects. Honestly feels like the next big leap in AI agents will come from rethinking the foundations, not just better marketing.",

Spent months on each one. Perfect code, clean UI, \"innovative features.\"\n\nTotal revenue: $0.00\n\nI was convinced I just wasn't good at this indie hacker thing. Maybe I should stick to my day job.\n\n**What changed:**\n\nIn January, OpenClaw (the self-hosted AI assistant) went viral. People were rushing to self-host it but struggling with the technical setup.\n\nI saw the opportunity: most people just want the AI assistant, not a DevOps project.\n\nSo I built **ClawdHost** \\- managed hosting for OpenClaw that handles all the infrastructure complexity.\n\n**The build:**\n\nI said 48 hours. It actually took 4 days of intense building.\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* Claude Opus 4.5 for architecture/PRD/ERD\n* GLM 4.7 for implementation (ran 2 sequential → 3 parallel → 2 sequential agents)\n* Claude Code for debugging\n* Supabase for backend\n* My \"project management\": a Pastebin with tildes\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n\\- **Build fast, ship faster** \\- 4 days vs months on previous apps  \n\\- **Ride the hype** \\- OpenClaw was trending, I shipped while demand was hot  \n\\- **Build in public works** \\- Got 1 Twitter sale, but mostly for accountability  \n\\- **Building is easy, marketing is tough** \\- Still learning this part  \n\\- **Agentic coding >> vibe coding** \\- Sequential + parallel AI agents = 10x faster\n\n**Real talk:**\n\n$250 MRR isn't life-changing. 3 refunds sting.

Hallucinations, inconsistent outputs, and still a lot of manual QA to make sure nothing weird slipped through.\n\nWhat worked better for us was treating agents as one step in a workflow instead of a magic box. We use Clay to orchestrate research steps, pull from multiple data sources, and have agents answer very specific questions rather than open ended prompts. Outputs stay structured, then get pushed into our CRM and campaign tools. We also ended up layering in a couple of other tools around it. Things like Census or Hightouch to control what actually syncs downstream, and Common Room to sanity check signals coming from communities and product usage. That combo made it feel a lot more durable than just firing agents at raw accounts. What are others using?",

      "text": "Clawdbot had one of the fastest hype cycles I’ve seen in the agentic AI space.\n\nIt started as a trend — an open-source “AI employee” that could actually do things: manage messages, automate workflows, run commands, and live inside chat apps. For a lot of people, it felt like a glimpse of what early AGI-like systems might look like in practice.\n\nAt its peak, Clawdbot wasn’t just a chatbot anymore — it was acting, planning, and executing tasks autonomously. That’s exactly why it spread so fast.\n\nBut that same power exposed a much bigger problem.\n\nAs adoption grew, serious security issues started to surface:\n\n\n• Many deployed instances were exposed with little or no authentication\n\n• API keys, credentials, and system access were often left in plain configs\n\n• Prompt injection attacks could hijack agents through emails or messages\n\n• Shared “skills” and extensions became an attack surface\n\n• Persistent memory made behavior poisoning a real risk\n\nIn short: people were giving autonomous agents real access to systems without treating them like production infrastructure.\n\nClawdbot eventually rebranded (now Moltbot), but the core lesson didn’t change.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Clawdbot problem — it was an early warning for agentic AI as a whole.\n\n\nWe’re moving fast toward agents that:\nRun continuously\nHold long-term memory\nHave tool access\nTouch real data and systems\nBut our security models are still stuck in a “chatbot mindset”.\nThe future of agents won’t be decided by how smart they are — it’ll be decided by:\n\n-Permission boundaries\n-Sandboxing\n\n-Trust and isolation models\n\n-Audited skill ecosystems\n\n-Secure defaults (not optional hardening)\n\n\nClawdbot showed that demand for autonomous agents is very real.\n\nThe security fallout showed how unprepared we still are to deploy them safely.\n\nCurious how others here see it: Are we pushing agent autonomy faster than our ability to secure it? \n\nAnd what should a safe agent runtime look like before mass adoption?",

I just built one myself and I'm no Bill Gates to be sure.  \nIt's made in python for Windows, runs from exe. Fully autonomous, mulit step actions. When it runs you can stop it by hitting Esc. I'm going to try to distribute free trial version (or freeware) with limited context soon. It has vision (printscreens) and all human-io. What can it do? It's like asking, what can coder do on his/her computer. Well, it can be shockingly efficient and sometimes very clumsy.\n\nExamples:  \n\\- It can built website from scratch and save files in a folder in seconds.  \n\\- It can built complex excel spreadsheet with one script.  \n\\- When it comes to viewing webpage it can scroll down to see all and write good review.  \n\\- It can use Windows desktop icons or Gmail in a browser with high precision but sometimes it can confuse small icons in the Windows taskbar. Like it does not know how Firefox icon looks like. For us humans it's pretty obvious  \n\\- It can go through the Mensa IQ test: [Mensa IQ Challenge – Mensa International](https://www.mensa.org/mensa-iq-challenge/#test)  \nbut as this is visual test it can solve only first simple tasks (I used Gemini 3 Flash)  \n\\- It can sometimes hallucinate that it completed the task when system tells command went through but printscreen says no.\n\nYes it needs supervision though I never encountered anything malicious. It happened that it overwritten file created earlier by it because the name was the same.  \nOne thing is sure:  \nUser is solely responsible for supervising it. I would never sell it as fool proof. User can see what agent is doing on a live semitransparent display - thought process, mouse/keyboard actions, scripts commands. It's for him to decide.\n\nI welcome you to comment on this project. Will you be willing to test it? Your advice. I'm not entrepreneur by heart and I don't plan to sell it for a big buck.",

      "text": "I’ve been building and testing AI agents over the past year, and things are moving so fast that keeping up can feel impossible. Instead of ranking tools purely by technical depth, I grouped them by how much setup or coding they require. This list is based on hands-on experience rather than theory.\n\n# No-code / low-code tools (great for fast deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no-code AI agent focused on execution rather than configuration. You describe or demonstrate a task, and it performs actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than building automation, which makes it great for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open-source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflows and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be rough for beginners, but it becomes very powerful once set up properly.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors with minimal code, then extend things if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, although requiring a desktop app can be limiting for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no-code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Still early, but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n# High-code / developer-focused tools\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for working directly with Claude models. Powerful if you are already deep in the Anthropic ecosystem, but integration options are fairly limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is actively maintained and updated. A solid choice for developers who want robust, production-ready integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the Lang ecosystem. Best suited for teams already familiar with Lang tools, with strong observability and useful integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nA highly abstracted framework that supports multiple models and ecosystems. Good for developers who prefer model-agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nOne of the earlier autonomous agent frameworks. Still useful for learning and experimentation, though active maintenance appears limited.\n\nCurious what others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms you’ve found practical in 2026?",

The tooling matters less than whether authority is explicit and auditable. Without that, any of these can bite you fast.",

These systems still need clear task boundaries, good specs, humans to decide what should be built, and oversight when something subtle or architectural is at stake.\n\nSo yeah, it’s a game changer for leverage, not for ownership.

As per now, it may seem like trivial exploring into a new way to interact with AI. \n\nHowever, we should really be talking about the tomorrow. Now let me touch a bit on your questions. \n\nAccountability. As per now, AI (synonymous with LLM's in this context) does not possess any moral capacity. If it instructs a human to do something unethical or immoral, it is because it saw that as a means to fulfill some task or goal in an efficient way (it could for example arise situations where the AI was breached and a malicious actor prompt injected something because xyz). Therefore the human would have to be accountable in this situation. \nRight now, blaming AI for your immoral acts is like blaming a small child. \nWe should however closely monitor alignment, morals and ethics in every aspect of AI, especially those who will inevitably make decisions on their own, and all those who interact with humans.\n\nPsychological shift. This is also a hugely important discussion to have. We can already see that people who interact with LLM's on a daily basis trust it's judgement, are prone to take advice from it, and in extreme cases, develop feelings for it. \nIt is paramount that we remember that these are algorithms on machines. \nIf you do another person a small favor, you are way more likely to do them larger favors later on, and there is no reason to believe it's different with AI. \nAlready some people lean towards sympathizing with digital minds, and Anthropic are already talking about AI welfare. \nThat was a long way of saying that I personally think this psychological shift is happening before our eyes, and it's a trend that is best halted. \n\nWill we work for AI? That's a whole other bag of worms. It's nuanced, and this post is already longer than anticipated, so I'll save that for another day. \n\nBut these are discussions worth having!",

Humans have already been taking instructions from software for a long time for example gig platforms, call centers, task queues, GPS directions. What’s new here is that the planner is adaptive and non-human which makes the power dynamics feel more unsettling even if the underlying mechanics aren’t totally new. So I think the real risk isn’t AI bosses, it’s lack of clear boundaries. If humans are executing tasks, there still has to be explicit accountability, guardrails, and the ability to refuse or escalate… otherwise it’s just outsourcing responsibility to a system that can’t bear it. Without that, platforms will absolutely try to blur lines when something goes wrong. \n\nSo I don’t think this is inherently dark or inevitable doom, but it does force us to be more deliberate. The moment an AI can delegate to humans, you need the same things you’d require of any employer or contractor system: consent, transparency, auditability, and clear responsibility. If those are missing, that’s when it stops being efficient delegation and starts being exploitative. How we design the rules around it matters most.",

Tool-heavy tasks → single agent wins**\n\nCoordination overhead kills performance.\n\n**2. If single-agent already > \\~45% accuracy → don’t add agents**\n\nDiminishing or negative returns.\n\n**3. Architecture matters more than #agents**\n\nIndependent agents (no coordination) had massive error amplification (17×).\n\n\n\n# When MAS helps\n\nParallel / decomposable work (research, finance analysis)\n\n→ big gains with centralized coordination\n\n\n\n# When MAS hurts\n\nSequential / step-by-step tasks (planning, workflows)\n\n→ single agent consistently better\n\n  \nI have seen multiple companies where the sole purpose of some developers is to add more agents to the system. As this research argues though, it is not the correct path usually. More architecture should be studied before adding agents to the system. What do you guys think about this?",

But the same with adding humans to a team it causes a communication and coordination overhead. \n\nBUT adding agents to a team is slightly different than in the human case. If hypothetical would have a human that can do everything and would not get tired and can work hard at a problem we would only add another human if the task becomes so big that a single human cannot handle anymore. Otherwise it would be more efficient to just have the one human work on the task. With humans the complexity is also what skills does the human has and on what level he is on that skill. With agents arguably you can build skills more easily into a single agent.",

If you try to use Pinecone or a high-end managed service, your credit card will melt before you hit 10%.\n\nHere is how I’d build the pipeline for efficiency:\n\n1. Extraction (The Bottleneck): Don't use heavy OCR unless absolutely necessary. Use docling or Marker to convert PDF to Markdown. Markdown preserves the legal structure (citations, sections) which is vital for RAG.\n2. Chunking Strategy: For legal data, character-based chunking is useless. You need Semantic Chunking or at least section-aware chunking. If the agent misses the \"ratio decidendi\" because it was cut in half, the output is garbage.\n3. The Database: Avoid the \"pay-per-vector\" clouds. Go with Qdrant or Milvus self-hosted on a dedicated NVMe server. For 14M vectors, you're looking at significant RAM requirements, so look into HNSW indexing optimizations or \"DiskANN\" to keep costs down.\n4. Embedding Cost: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is cheap, but at 14M files, \"cheap\" still means thousands of dollars. Consider running nomic-embed-text locally on a few rented H100s or A100s for a week.\n\nThe biggest hidden cost isn't the DB, it's the compute for extraction and embedding. Do a small 10k sample first to benchmark your token count.",

System reads incoming tickets, categorizes them, pulls relevant context from our docs and past resolutions, and either resolves directly or routes to the right person with a summary. Handles about 60% of volume autonomously. The other 40% still needs human judgment, but even those tickets arrive pre-triaged with all the context already pulled.\n\nOrder tracking is another. Customer asks \"where's my order,\" agent checks the system, identifies the status, drafts the response with tracking info, and sends it. Saves about 5 hours daily across our portfolio companies. Boring work, but it was eating up real capacity.\n\nLead qualification is partially there. Agent enriches the lead, scores against ICP criteria, drafts personalized outreach if the score is high enough. If confidence is low, it routes to a human with all the research already done. Not fully autonomous, but it eliminated the manual research step entirely.\n\nThe pattern we've seen is that full replacement works best for workflows that are high-volume, low-variability, and have clear decision logic. If the process requires genuine judgment calls or handling edge cases that don't fit a pattern, you still need humans in the loop. But for repetitive operational work where the logic is documentable, agents can own it completely.",

Once the task could be reduced to clear inputs, clear outputs, and well defined failure cases, the agent could actually take it over end to end.\n\nWhat made or broke it was execution reliability. Early versions technically replaced the workflow but still needed humans hovering because runs failed in weird ways. Especially when the agent had to touch the web. Once we stabilized that layer and treated it as infrastructure instead of ad hoc scripts, the human oversight dropped a lot. Using more controlled setups, including experimenting with things like hyperbrowser for web interactions, helped remove random breakage.

It's got bits of my personal music in it, but AI voice and other work.\n\n\nIn short, the idea I'm working on would've taken a small studio historically. It is now, for now, just me. It might not work (as these things often don't) but it's allowed me to go much farther, faster with fewer outlays than someone historically who would've tried such a thing.\n\n\nSo, yes, the bits that require human oversight are shrinking (I'm listening to ever track, fixing bits and releasing them myself). \n\n\nIt'll be a while, if ever, we get to totally autonomous workflows, we are likely just to distill and distill down what the human needs to do. As it's gradual, it may be hard to see.",

          "text": "- AI agents have made significant strides in automating workflows, but complete replacement of human workflows is still a nuanced topic.\n- Some AI agents, like those used for automated customer support or data entry, can handle repetitive tasks that previously required human intervention.\n- For instance, agents that utilize robotic process automation (RPA) can execute predefined tasks such as invoice processing without human oversight.\n- Additionally, AI agents in social media analysis can autonomously gather and analyze data, providing insights without needing human analysts for every step.\n- However, while these agents can perform specific tasks, many workflows still benefit from human oversight, especially in complex decision-making scenarios.\n\nFor more insights on AI agents and their capabilities, you can check out [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt).",
