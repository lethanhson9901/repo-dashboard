      "text": "I’ve been a loyal ChatGPT/Claude power user for years. The convenience was unmatched. But recently, something shifted. Between the rising subscription costs (which seem to be everywhere now) and the increasing \"censorship\" or over-tuning of cloud models, I decided to build my own local AI workstation.\n\nAfter spending the last few weeks testing **Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and DeepSeek** locally, I’ve realized that the \"Cloud dominance\" is starting to fade. Here’s why I think 2026 is the year of Local AI:\n\n1. **Zero Latency:** No more waiting for server queues. The response is instant.\n2. **True Privacy:** I’m a developer, and I can finally feed my proprietary code into an LLM without worrying about where that data ends up.\n3. **No Filters:** You get the raw power of the model, exactly how the researchers intended it.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There’s a learning curve with hardware (VRAM requirements are still the biggest bottleneck) and quantization formats (GGUF vs EXL2).\n\nI’ve documented my entire setup process, the specific hardware I used (and some budget mistakes I made), and a step-by-step guide for anyone looking to make the switch this year. If you're tired of being tethered to a subscription, you might find my breakdown helpful.",

I did the standard thing: **Pinecone, chunking, and a RAG pipeline.**\n\nIt worked for like an hour. By Day 3, the agent was a complete mess.\n\n1. Context Pollution: I ask about Python, it pulls a chunk from 3 days ago about SQL just because the semantic similarity was 'vaguely close' lol.\n2. No State Updates: If I tell it 'Actually, I want to switch to TypeScript,' it still pulls the old 'I use Python' chunks and gets confused.\n3. Token Bloat: I was retrieving so many 'relevant' chunks that my system prompt was hitting 4k+ tokens just for simple context. Its a nightmare for latency.\n\nHonestly, I fell into the trap of thinking RAG = Memory. It’s not. RAG is for static, encyclopedic knowledge. Memory is for user state, and state is dynamic.\n\nI eventually stumbled on an **open-source project** called **MemOS** ( **on github** ) that actually works for this. Instead of just dumping text into a vector store, it treats memory more like an OS. It has this 'lifecycle' concept (Generated -> Activated -> Merged -> Archived).\n\nBasically, when I tell the agent I’m done with Python, MemOS doesn't just leave that in the vector store to confuse the model later. It updates the state. It also separates 'Facts' from 'Preferences' during retrieval which is huge.\n\nThe result? My system prompt is way lighter now because I’m only injecting the active memory (like 'User is currently working on a React App') rather than 10 chunks of raw chat logs. The hallucinations about my tech stack have basically dropped to zero.\n\nHow are you guys handling the 'forgetting' curve for long-running agents? I feel like we need to stop treating Vector DBs as a silver bullet for state management, because they definately aren't.",

What finally clicked for me was stopping the attempt to make the Vector DB do the heavy lifting.\n​Instead, I started treating the vectors as localized pointers. Basically, the vector just identifies the 'neighborhood,' but then it triggers a look-up to a local reference file that holds the actual state and specific memory connections. It’s like using the Vector DB as an index for a separate, dynamic state-machine rather than a giant box of text. Has anyone else tried decoupling the 'search' from the 'truth' like this?\n\n1. The \"Vector as a Key\" (The Look-up)\n​Instead of storing the whole conversation in the Vector DB, you store a Key ID.\n​Vector Search: \"User wants to talk about Python loops.\"\n​The Result: It doesn't return text; it returns ID: PYTHON_001.\n\n​2. The \"Local File\" (The State Manager)\n​You have a simple local file (like a JSON or a small database) where PYTHON_001 lives. This file holds the \"Localized Value.\"\n\n{\n  \"PYTHON_001\": {\n    \"core_fact\": \"User uses loops, not comprehensions.\",\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"last_modified\": \"2026-01-16\",\n    \"dependency\": \"SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER\"\n  }\n}\n\n3. The \"Logic Gate\" (The Final Prompt)\n​Your code looks at the local file before it talks to the LLM.\n​If the local file says status: Archived or language: Outdated, the agent ignores that vector.\n​If the file says dependency: SKILL_LEVEL_BEGINNER, the agent knows to keep the explanation simple.\n\nThe trick is to stop putting the 'answer' inside the Vector DB. Just use the Vector DB to retrieve a unique ID.\n​Once you have the ID, hit a local JSON or SQLite file that contains the 'state' for that ID. This local file acts as a filter. If your local state says 'User moved to TypeScript,' you can programmatically tell the agent to ignore any Python-related IDs the Vector DB tries to pull. You're basically building a state-machine that sits on top of your embeddings.",

          "text": "It sounds like you've had quite the experience with your coding tutor agent. Here are some insights that might resonate with your situation:\n\n- **Memory vs. Vector Databases**: It's crucial to differentiate between memory and vector databases. While vector databases like Pinecone are excellent for storing and retrieving static information, they don't inherently manage dynamic user state or preferences. Memory in applications is about retaining context and adapting to user interactions over time.\n\n- **Context Pollution**: This is a common issue when relying solely on vector databases. If the retrieval mechanism pulls in older, less relevant chunks, it can lead to confusion and a lack of coherence in responses.\n\n- **State Updates**: Dynamic state management is essential for applications that need to adapt to user changes. If your agent doesn't update its understanding of the user's current preferences or projects, it will continue to reference outdated information.\n\n- **Token Management**: Keeping the system prompt lightweight is vital for performance. By focusing on active memory rather than a large volume of historical data, you can significantly improve response times and reduce latency.\n\n- **Lifecycle Management**: The approach you found with MemOS, which treats memory like an operating system with a lifecycle concept, seems promising. This method allows for more effective state management by updating and archiving information as needed.\n\nFor further reading on memory and state management in LLM applications, you might find this resource helpful: [Memory and State in LLM Applications](https://tinyurl.com/bdc8h9td).",

      "text": "We built an open source, rust-native alternative of Claude Cowork\n\nWhen Claude Cowork first dropped, tbh it hit us a bit hard.\n\nWe have been building our product Kuse confidently for a long time, and overnight we found ourselves becoming a web-based Claude Cowork alternative. That was frustrating at first. But also sparked a different kind of curiosity.\n\nSo over the past 48 hours, together with Claude Code, we built a fully open-source project: Kuse Cowork.\n\n**Native Rust, Zero-Wrappers:** This isn't just another agent wrapper. It’s a ground-up implementation in Rust. No heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on OpenCode/AgentSDK. Just raw performance and a tiny binary.  \nDocker Sandboxing: Since agents execute code, security is paramount. Open Cowork runs commands inside a transient Docker container.\n\n**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or run entirely offline with Ollama/Local LLMs. You own the keys and the privacy.\n\n**Skills, and MCPs:** It can already handle complex document tasks (PDF, Excel, etc.) out of the box.\n\n**The Development Story:** The most interesting part is that the builder fellow had zero Rust experience before this weekend. It was a surreal experience: an AI agent (Claude Code) helping me build a faster, secure, and open-source version of \"itself.\"\n\nIt's still very early, and there's a long roadmap ahead.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Docker sandboxing helps with blast radius, but operators still need clear logs, versioning, and a way to reconstruct what the agent saw and decided at the time. That is usually where escalations come from.\n\nI would be curious how you are thinking about audit trails and recovery. Not just “it failed,” but which prompt, tool call, file state, and assumption led to that outcome. Speed matters, but explainability is what makes these safe to run outside of a demo.",

Open source is great for trust, but the gap between a cool build and something teams can rely on day to day is usually in the boring edges, not the core architecture.",

Seeing Kuse Cowork lean into native performance and sandboxing makes me wonder - are we heading toward a world where the differentiator isn’t the UI layer, but how well the agent manages context, privacy, and trust?\n\nCurious how others here think about that - does “agent‑native” design feel like the next step beyond dashboards, or just another layer on top of existing tools?",

JS heavy sites that load half the content late. Random layout changes. Logins expiring. Cloudflare or basic bot checks suddenly blocking requests that worked yesterday. Even when it works, it feels fragile. One small site update and the whole pipeline falls over.\n\nI have tried the usual stack. Requests + BeautifulSoup is fine until it isn’t. Playwright and Puppeteer work but feel heavy and sometimes unpredictable at scale. Headless browsers behave differently from real users. And once you add agents on top, debugging becomes painful because failures are not always reproducible.\n\nLately I have been experimenting with more “agent friendly” approaches where the browser layer is treated as infrastructure instead of glue code. I have seen tools like hyperbrowser mentioned in this context, basically giving agents a more stable way to interact with real websites instead of brittle scraping scripts. Still early for me, so not claiming it solves everything.\n\nI am genuinely curious what people here are using in production. Are you sticking with traditional scraping and just accepting breakage? Using full browser automation everywhere? Paying for third party APIs? Or building some custom hybrid setup?\n\nWould love to hear what has actually held up over time, not just what works in demos.",

If possible, use that  \n2 - If there isn't, on the [Apify store](https://apify.com/store?fpr=9lmok3) for a website scraper. These are maintained dedicated scrapers, and any popular websites have something here.  \n3 - If there isn't any specific scraper, use a general purpose one such as this [Website Content Crawler (also Apify](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler?fpr=9lmok3)), and then feed the pages text output to a cheap LLM to get structured data.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

For anything mission critical, we ended up mixing approaches. Static or semi static stuff stayed simple, and anything JS heavy or behind auth went through a full browser layer that we treated like infrastructure, with retries, health checks, and clear failure signals. That helped more than the specific library choice.\n\nPlaywright has been the least painful for us long term, but only once we accepted the overhead and built guardrails around it. Where it really falls down is when people expect agents to just handle breakage automatically. In practice, you still need someone owning selectors, login flows, and change detection.

But LLM agent searchig is better if you need precise information of some exact stuff that needs to be up to date and it not being blocked as much.\n\nFor example the tool i made with gemini, which gathers a lot of data and thus needs to make multiple searches to gather data from one company costs like 2€ per 100 companies searched. Also this is quite slow with 100 company informations taking like 1.5 hours to do (but wouod be possible to run multiple at the same time, but they might search duplicate information as one agent does not know what the other is doing at the same time). Which is definitely tons more than what scraping and searching from scraped stuff would cost, but easily justifiable cost for many use cases.

That’s usually what kills pipelines, not the HTML changing.\n\nIn production we treat CAPTCHA handling as infrastructure, same as proxies or retries. Browser automation still does the heavy lifting, but when Cloudflare / Turnstile / reCAPTCHA kicks in, a solver keeps the flow moving instead of stalling or looping. Services like CapMonster Cloud are commonly used here, especially because most challenges are invisible and don’t fail loudly.\n\nIt doesn’t make scraping “unbreakable”, but it dramatically extends how long things stay stable.

This tool is designed specifically for extracting data from Glassdoor, including job listings.\n\n- **Set Up Your Scraper**:\n  - Create an account on Apify for free.\n  - Add the URLs of the Glassdoor pages you want to scrape into the scraper's input fields. You can include various types of pages such as job postings, company reviews, etc.\n  \n- **Start the Scraping Process**: Once your URLs are set, click the \"Start\" button to begin scraping. The tool will run and extract the data you need.\n\n- **Export the Data**: After the scraping process is complete, you can export the data in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or XML. This makes it easy to feed the data into your AI SDR.\n\n- **Automation**: If you're looking to scrape at a larger scale, consider automating the process using Apify Actors, which can schedule and manage your scraping tasks efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the tutorial on how to scrape Glassdoor [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j6u272j).",

The issue isn’t that users are messy, it’s that production systems quietly assume cooperative behavior, and at scale that assumption becomes a risk. From an ops perspective, the failure mode that matters is not the agent being wrong once, it’s no one being able to explain why it acted the way it did. We design defensively from day one now, because leadership always asks what happens when it’s wrong, not how impressive it looked in testing. Treating human input as adversarial forces clearer boundaries between reasoning, execution, and validation, which is the only way to make these systems survivable under real volume. Without that separation and traceability, you end up with something that works in theory and escalates in practice.",

Humans are inconsistent, they change goals midstream, and they rarely give complete inputs.

When the agent isn’t sure, it still answers confidently, and that breaks trust fast. Defensive design from day one helps, but only if it includes clear stop conditions, visible state, and an easy way to reset or hand off. Loops and confident wrong answers create more damage than asking a clarifying question or deferring. The messy behavior isn’t an edge case, it’s the default.",

Many of the tasks you've outlined are indeed repetitive and can consume a lot of time and resources. Here are some thoughts on your idea of creating an SDK or hosted service to streamline this process:\n\n- **Standardization Potential**: There is definitely room for standardization in the AI agent space. Many developers face similar challenges, and a well-designed SDK could save time and reduce redundancy.\n  \n- **Existing Solutions**: While there are frameworks and platforms that address some of these needs, they often require significant customization. A solution that provides a more integrated approach could fill a gap in the market.\n\n- **Focus on Flexibility**: Ensure that your SDK allows for flexibility and customization. Different projects may have unique requirements, and a one-size-fits-all approach might limit its appeal.\n\n- **Community Feedback**: Engaging with the developer community could provide valuable insights. Gathering feedback on what features are most needed could help shape your SDK.\n\n- **Market Demand**: Assessing the demand for such a solution is crucial. If many developers express similar frustrations, it could indicate a viable market for your product.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this further, consider looking into existing frameworks and identifying what they lack. This could help you create a more compelling offering.",

Agents look great when they operate on structured inputs or well defined APIs, but once they have to interact with real websites, dashboards, or internal tools, reliability drops fast.\n\nDynamic pages, auth flows, inconsistent UI states, partial loads… all of that turns a “smart” agent into something brittle very quickly. I’ve tried different orchestration frameworks and models, and the issue rarely feels like reasoning. It’s almost always execution and grounding.\n\nLately I’ve been thinking more about treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure instead of something the agent improvises against. Tools like hyperbrowser made me rethink this, not as an agent framework, but as a way to give agents a stable place to observe and act so failures are actually debuggable.\n\nCurious how others here are handling this.

Of course we’re never going to get to 100% accuracy. Stuff happens. That’s where observability really shines. Why is that error happening all the time? Great I see and now I can fix it. \n\nBoth Evaluation & Observation are still under appreciated and definitely under utilized imo. Proper engineering practices have either been tossed aside in the name of expediency or the people developing stuff have never even heard of them. It’s one thing for a personal project. It’s another for a real world application especially in critical verticals.

Here are a few thoughts on the topic:\n\n- **Brittleness in Dynamic Environments**: Many agents struggle with dynamic web pages due to issues like changing DOM structures, authentication flows, and inconsistent UI states. This can lead to failures that are hard to debug.\n\n- **Execution vs. Reasoning**: As you've noted, the problems often stem from execution rather than reasoning. Agents may be capable of understanding tasks but falter when it comes to interacting with unpredictable web interfaces.\n\n- **Infrastructure Perspective**: Treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure is an interesting approach. By providing a stable environment for agents to operate, you can potentially reduce the number of failures and make debugging easier.\n\n- **Guardrails and Specialized Environments**: Some developers opt for heavy guardrails to manage interactions with UI elements, while others may use specialized environments or tools designed to handle the complexities of web automation more effectively.\n\nIf you're looking for more insights or specific frameworks that address these issues, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "I get it, AI has made it easier to build software, but it’s not as if you can magically do months worth of coding in days or even weeks.\n\nHere’s the pattern I’ve discovered:\n\nThere are a bunch of creators who have hyped people up, saying you do not need to have coding knowledge to build AI systems. Is it true? No.\n\nUnless your job is to build small demos/MVPs or content on AI.\n\nYou might be able to sell your “product” by showing your leads the automation you built on n8n but when it’s time to deploy it into the real world, it’ll fail on day 1.\n\nHere’s a recent case study from one of my leads:\n\nThey needed a WhatsApp reservation and admin system for a network of \\~9000 restaurants.\n\nSo they did what most people feel is the logical solution, hire developers.\n\nThe developers that they had, built a WhatsApp bot using n8n. They showed it to the client, it worked fine. Because obviously it’s a simple chatbot so you can’t really do much with it except talk.\n\nCan you jailbreak it? Piece of cake.\n\nDoes it have any logical awareness? No.\n\nIs it anywhere close to a usable demo? Not at all.\n\nSo they start reaching out to people who can actually build the system. That’s where I come into picture.\n\nThey tell me, they already have a system built “halfway” and need me to finish it in the next 3 days (that too for free lmfao, I’ll get to this part later).\n\nMy CTO sits with their developer and sees the system they had.\n\nSurprise! The system is just an n8n template copy pasted with vibe coding done all over (the guy didn’t even remove the ChatGPT comments in the code).\n\nSo I tell them, that this cannot be done within 3 days. Your system is pretty much useless, we’ll have to build everything from scratch. We can give you a small demo in the next 12 days, but that requires a certain upfront payment so that we can start working.\n\nThat’s where he paused and told “he’ll talk to his partners”.\n\nApparently all of their budget was already allocated to marketing, they hired a lot of sales people and could only allocate the budget for “API Token costs”.\n\nSo yeah, we’re not going forward with them.\n\nP.S. they would’ve paid us once 4-5 restaurants would’ve found the system useful, then they’d recommend it to the 6th restaurant and this time charge money.\n\nNow here comes the issue: People have learned how to put together different blocks on no code tools and call it a day. But someone who had actual coding knowledge knows that it’s only the start.\n\nHere’s the things which were missing from the WhatsApp n8n automation they had:\n\n1. Edge cases.\n\nNobody tested how the system would reply if there were unwanted inputs, which is like the 90% of human input. The automation kept talking rubbish when things went out of context.\n\n2. No guard rails.\n\nIt was extremely easy to jailbreak the system. Few fishy prompts and it would give away every single internal data to the user.\n\n3. Sky high costs.\n\nThe workflow had no structure. The vibecoded schema would have cost about 10-20$ on an average per user. Rest you can calculate how costly the operation would be if they even got 10,000 users :) (Apparently they kept pushing every single thing through LLM and the tokens would’ve kept compounding overtime, not gonna go into details).\n\n4. No GDPR knowledge.\n\nBeing a bad developer is one thing, but when it comes to WhatsApp, how come people don’t think about the GDPR rules??? Unless you’re asking for trouble.\n\n5. Overpromises.\n\nAI can do everything! Add unlimited features and make revenue based promises to the clients!\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause people are underestimating how hard it is to really create a scalable and usable AI system.\n\nThere are thousands of people selling themselves as one man dev team who can apparently build saas level systems on his own that too for free.\n\nWhy for free? Because no one hires them, I mean why should they? When your services are pretty much useless.\n\nBut when new business owners enter this market, they get a feeling that AI has made software development very easy, cheap and almost free. So they have sky high expectations. Every single guy out there is legit selling his “business changing automation” for free. Is that how software industry works? NO.\n\nThese no code tools have only added more to the noise. I see so many people who have made absurd promises to their clients which apparently AI can magically solve. They promise to give a demo + result for free. Then they start building using no code tools, fail miserably, try to find builders, get faced by the fact that even demos need some capital to be built, ultimately they are simply unable to deliver.\n\nConclusion? AI has not made the market cheap, but more complex. People who do not have good software development knowledge CANNOT build scalable AI systems just because they are good at operating no code tools.\n\nSo if you’re a business owner, watch out. It’s hard to find the right people for the job when there’s so much noise.\n\nPro tip: if someone is providing you something for free, chances are. It was worth the same.",

When the bot gives a confident wrong answer, loops, or leaks context, who sees it, who can explain why it happened, and how fast can it be unwound. Most of these glued together systems have no visibility or brakes, so the first failure turns into a customer trust problem, not a technical one.\n\nAI did not make systems cheaper, it moved the cost into design, guardrails, and accountability.

While AI tools have indeed made it easier to produce content, they have also democratized access to high-quality outputs, leading to increased competition.\n- The ease of production means that more people can create and share their work, but this saturation can make it challenging for individual contributions to stand out.\n- As a result, the average quality of work may have improved, but so have the expectations from audiences and consumers. This can lead to a scenario where only exceptional work is recognized, leaving mediocre efforts overlooked.\n- In essence, while AI can facilitate the shipping of work, it also demands a higher standard of quality and originality to capture attention and be taken seriously.\n\nFor further insights on the implications of AI in various domains, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h)\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)",

Tried finding an alternative for weeks — zero results for combining LangGraph with Claude Agent SDK.\n\nSo I figured it out. Here's the pattern:\n\nLangGraph handles orchestration — state management, conditional routing, parallel execution. Claude Agent SDK handles what happens inside each node — full agent capabilities, tool use, context, not just raw API responses.\n\nYou define your workflow graph in LangGraph, but each node calls the SDK instead of hitting the API directly. You get the best of both and you're not burning credits while prototyping.\n\nBuilt an 11-agent system with this. Research agents run in parallel, analysis agents process outputs, synthesis agents compile reports. LangGraph controls the flow, SDK powers every step.\n\nDocumented the whole thing into a workshop because I genuinely couldn't find this anywhere online.\n\nMaybe there's a reason everyone's using direct calls and I'm missing it. But this has been working well for months. Curious what others think — anyone tried something similar?",

Over long-running tasks, they usually have no plan, lose context and their execution gets messy.\n\nMore capable agents like Claude Code and Manus get around this by following a common pattern: they plan first, externalize working context (files) and break work into isolated sub-tasks.\n\nDeep Agents from LangChain are really the next level, which essentially package this pattern into a reusable runtime. you call `create_deep_agent(...)` and get a StateGraph that:\n\n* plans explicitly\n* delegates work to sub-agents\n* keeps its state in files instead of bloating the prompt\n\nEach piece is implemented as middleware (To-do list middleware, Filesystem middleware, Subagent middleware).\n\nConceptually it looks like this:\n\n    User goal\n      ↓\n    Deep Agent (LangGraph StateGraph)\n      ├─ Plan: write_todos → updates \"todos\" in state\n      ├─ Delegate: task(...) → runs a subagent with its own tool loop\n      ├─ Context: ls/read_file/write_file/edit_file → persists working notes/artifacts\n      ↓\n    Final answer\n\nIt push key parts into explicit state (e.g. `todos` \\+ files + messages), but the main thing I noticed was visibility over frontend.\n\nI wired it up with CopilotKit - Infrastructure for building AI copilots into any app.\n\nIt keeps the frontend in sync with what the agent is doing by streaming events and state updates in real time (using AG-UI protocol under the hood).\n\nDeep Agents is really good at multi-step workflows & CopilotKit as the orchestration + UI layer.

      "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nFor the past six months, we’ve been building an open-source local agent called Eigent, an open-source alternative of Cowork and was #1 on GitHub Trending! It supports BYOK and can help you to organize local files, automate browsers end-to-end.\n\nAt the core is CAMEL’s Workforce system, which is inspired by distributing systems: a root node for task planning and coordination, worker nodes for execution, and an asynchronous task channel. It also supports failure tolerance and recursive workers for long-horizon tasks. All of this is open source.\n\nFor browser automation, Eigent uses a two-layer architecture:\n\n* a Python layer for agent reasoning and orchestration\n* a TypeScript layer (built on Playwright) for native browser control (DOM ops, SoM markers, occlusion handling)\n\nThese two layers communicate asynchronously via WebSockets to keep things low-latency and avoid the limits of Python-only automation. This stack is also open source.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests!",

          "text": "It's common to feel overwhelmed when diving into building agents, especially with the plethora of tools and frameworks available. Here are some thoughts that might resonate:\n\n- **Start Small**: Instead of aiming for a complex agent, consider a simple use case. For example, automating a repetitive task you do daily, like summarizing emails or gathering data from a website. This can help build confidence without the pressure of perfection.\n\n- **Use Existing Templates**: Platforms like Apify offer templates that can jumpstart your projects. For instance, the [CrewAI](https://tinyurl.com/jc5bza4w) framework provides a structured way to define agents and integrate them with tools, which might lower the barrier for you.\n\n- **Focus on a Specific Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in your daily routine. This could be anything from social media analysis to automating data entry. When you have a clear problem to solve, it can guide your development process.\n\n- **Set Time Limits**: Allocate a specific amount of time to work on your agent. This can help combat perfectionism and keep you moving forward. Even if you don't finish, you'll have made progress.\n\n- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities can provide motivation and inspiration. Sharing your struggles might lead to suggestions or collaboration opportunities that can help you overcome hurdles.\n\n- **Iterate and Improve**: Remember that your first agent doesn't have to be perfect. Build something functional, then iterate on it. Each version can improve based on feedback and your own experiences.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, consider checking out the [AI agent workflow](https://tinyurl.com/3rppepvb) for insights on building agents that query datasets. It might spark some ideas for your own projects.",

      "text": "**The use case:** \n\nYou want a small model fine-tuned on a specific task (text classification, SQL generation, tool calling, etc.) but don't want to deal with data formatting, training infrastructure, or deployment configs.\n\n**What the agent does:**\n\nInstead of running CLI commands yourself, you describe the task in natural language. Claude figures out:\n\n1. Which task type fits your problem (QA, classification, tool calling, RAG)\n2. How to convert your messy input data into proper training format\n3. Whether the task is even learnable (runs teacher evaluation first)\n4. Training orchestration and progress monitoring\n5. How to package and deploy the result\n\nThe skill wraps our distil-cli and reads the docs to figure out the right commands and parameters.\n\n**Example conversation:**\n\n```bash\nMe: I have conversation logs in ./data where I asked for SQL queries. \n    Train a model that can do this locally.\n\nClaude: → Analyzes the data format\n        → Creates job_description.json, config.yaml, train.jsonl, test.jsonl\n        → Runs teacher eval (DeepSeek-V3 scores 80%)\n        → Kicks off distillation training\n        → Downloads 2.2GB GGUF when done\n        → Writes deployment script for Ollama\n```\n\nTotal hands-on time: maybe 10 minutes of chatting. Training runs in the background.\n\n**What makes it agentic:**\n\n- Reads documentation to understand available commands\n- Makes decisions about task type and data format based on your description\n- Interprets evaluation metrics and recommends whether to proceed\n- Handles errors and retries\n- Can write follow-up code (deployment scripts, test apps) using the trained model\n\n**Results from a Text2SQL test:**\n\n| Model | Accuracy (LLM-as-a-Judge) |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| Base Qwen3 0.6B | 36% |\n| Teacher (DeepSeek-V3) | 80% |\n| Agent-trained 0.6B | 74% |\n\nThe agent got a 0.6B model to nearly match a state-of-the-art teacher on this task.",
