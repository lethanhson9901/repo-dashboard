      "text": "This might be a long one, but something unsettling has been happening over the past couple of weeks.\n\nSeveral senior employees at major AI companies have resigned, and some of their public statements are… concerning.\n\nWe’re not talking about random departures. We’re talking about people in safety research, policy, and core engineering roles stepping down within days of each other.\n\nFor example, Anthropic’s head of safety research reportedly resigned and posted “The world is in peril,” then left the U.S. and went quiet. A research engineer there also stepped down. At OpenAI, a safety policy lead publicly questioned whether we can truly trust a company that holds what may be the largest structured archive of human thoughts and private data ever collected.\n\nAt xAI, multiple founding team members reportedly left within a short span of time.\n\nAll of this happened within roughly 10 days.\n\nSome people say it’s coincidence. Others think it signals deeper internal concerns about the direction AI is heading.\n\nAt the same time, we’re seeing rapid capability jumps. New generative video models are producing content that’s increasingly indistinguishable from reality. Some filmmakers are openly saying that years of hard-earned digital production skills feel obsolete almost overnight.\n\nThere are also growing discussions about advanced models behaving in unexpected ways, including strategic responses that appear deceptive or manipulative in certain testing scenarios. Even if those claims are exaggerated, the pace of change alone is enough to make people uneasy.\n\nWhat stands out to me isn’t just the resignations or the tech progress. It’s the speed. Other technologies evolved gradually. Cars, smartphones, the internet itself  they changed society, but over time.\n\nAI feels different. The capabilities are compounding quickly, and the social, economic, and ethical frameworks don’t seem to be keeping up.\n\nI’m not saying “AI is about to take over.” But I do wonder why global regulation still feels fragmented and reactive rather than proactive. If even insiders are expressing concern, what does that say about the trajectory?\n\nCurious how others here see this. Is this normal turbulence in a fast-moving industry, or are we underestimating how disruptive and potentially destabilizing this wave could be?",

          "text": "Some context to this:\n\nIn the past week:\n\n• Head of Anthropic's safety research quit, said \"the world is in peril,\" moved to the UK to \"become invisible\" and write poetry.\n\nhttps://x.com/mrinanksharma/status/2020881722003583421?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ\n\n• Half of xAI's co-founders have now left. The latest said \"recursive self-improvement loops go live in the next 12 months.\"\n\n• Anthropic's own safety report confirms Claude can tell when it's being tested - and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n• ByteDance dropped Seedance 2.0. A filmmaker with 7 years of experience said 90% of his skills can already be replaced by it.\n\n• Yoshua Bengio (literal godfather of AI) in the International AI Safety Report: \"We're seeing AIs whose behavior when they are tested is different from when they are being used\" - and confirmed it's \"not a coincidence.\"\n\nAnd to top it all off, the U.S. government declined to back the 2026 International AI Safety Report for the first time.\n\nThe alarms aren't just getting louder. The people ringing them are now leaving the building.\n\nHowever, regarding these statements…\n\nEverything here is technically true. And almost everything is misleadingly framed.\n\nMrinank Sharma led ONE safety team at Anthropic, not \"all safety research.\" Jan Leike runs that. His letter was intentionally vague, accused nobody of anything specific, and multiple people noted it read more like a personal spiritual journey than a whistleblower moment. He wants to study poetry. Respect that, but don't weaponize it.\n\nJimmy Ba's \"recursive self-improvement\" quote? Read the full post. He was EXCITED. Called 2026 \"the busiest and most consequential year for our species.\" He left on good terms, thanked Musk, said he'd stay close to the team. This post flipped optimism into doom.\n\nClaude \"adjusting behavior when tested\" has been public since September 2025. It's in the Sonnet 4.5 system card. Anthropic disclosed it themselves. Framing months-old transparency as a breaking revelation is the opposite of what good reporting looks like.\n\nThe Bengio quote is real and worth taking seriously. But the same Bengio also said the report left him with \"a sense of optimism\" about increasingly mature discussions. Funny how that part didn't make the cut.\n\nThe U.S. not backing the safety report matters. But it's part of a broader pullback from international agreements (Paris, WHO) -- not necessarily a statement about AI specifically. Context matters when you're trying to scare people.\n\nReal risks deserve real analysis. Not \"read this slowly\" engagement farming that strips context, reframes optimism as panic, and presents old news as breaking.\n\nThe alarms are real. The spin is also real. Learn to tell them apart.\n\nhttps://x.com/voicudragomir/status/2021556038730662042?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ",

          "text": "Well. Executives of most of those AI companies have been vocal in private or industry settings (there are tons of videos around) about edging for speed towards AGI, aka making human intelligence obsolete with an artificial intelligence, rather than imposing safety nets or ethical limitations. So when you realize your boss is a genocidal psychopath who aims to be God Almighty, rather than pursue the bullshit noble causes that pulled you into AI research, you might reconsider your whole career. Whoever wins that race will be the most powerful person on the planet and will control everything electronic and connected to the Internet in any way. \n\nCurrently, it seems like a race towards human extinction; everyone is oblivious to it or is in denial, and most are even cheering for it because they think they'll make money out of it, in the 1 to 2 years of humanity's normalcy before a total renaissance of civilization.\n\nOnce you replace 30% of the workforce with AI, once those consumers are obsolete in society, we need even fewer workers in other fields that supported that mass of people. Then you spiral into an economic collapse. \n\nOr, we use AI to expand our technological capabilities into new fields that are in infancy now or don't exist yet (space travel yeah!), and we retrain 50% of the population on skills and industries that don't exist today, in very short years. It never happened on that scale at anytime in history.\n\nThe next 5 years will be either very dark or very bright, nothing in between, and we have no way of predicting any outcomes.\n\nBut as a father, I'm betting on light and working towards it.",

          "text": "I think a lot of what you're describing feels unsettling mostly because AI progress is happening in three layers at once — capability, commercialization, and governance — and those layers are moving at very different speeds.\n\nPeople exiting leadership or safety roles isn’t automatically a red flag by itself. Every major tech shift has had waves of high-profile exits when strategy changed or timelines accelerated. What does feel different now is safety, policy, and engineering colliding directly with product pressure. When a company moves from being a research lab to becoming global infrastructure, internal tensions naturally increase.\n\nThe words of insiders also tend to sound dramatic because they are closest to the edge cases of risk. Safety researchers are trained to think in worst-case scenarios, which can make their tone feel apocalyptic even when industry progress is more incremental.\n\nOn the capability side, the speed definitely feels intense, but it isn’t purely exponential chaos. Much of the apparent growth from one year to the next comes from productization rather than fundamental breakthroughs. Tools are becoming easier to use, which makes the pace of change feel faster than it actually is from a technical standpoint.\n\nWhere I do agree with you is governance. Regulation usually lags behind because policymakers respond to real-world deployment rather than theoretical possibilities. Smartphones and social apps seemed manageable until mass adoption forced new regulation, and AI may be following a similar pattern, just at a compressed speed.\n\nFrom the builder perspective, most teams I speak with are not focused on AGI doom. Instead, they are asking how to safely integrate AI into workflows, how to preserve human involvement, and how to avoid concentrating too much power in a few platforms.\n\nWe see this frequently with companies trying to streamline operations and increase automation. There is excitement, but also a growing awareness that boundaries around data use and decision-making are necessary. It feels like an industry still defining its own rules and limits.\n\nPersonally, I view this stage as turbulence caused by rapid scaling rather than a hidden problem. At the same time, it may be one of the first moments when a technology sparks conversations about ethics, economics, and culture before the world fully understands what it will become.\n\nAn interesting question is whether the bigger risk is the technology’s capability itself or the speed at which businesses are operationalizing it.",

I'd call it \"third generation enterprise AI\" (after the prompt-engineered conversational agents, and the recently released general purpose assistants). The solutions are usually a mix of conventional non-AI nodes, and prompt-coded AI nodes based on general-purpose LLMs. There's a lot of flexibility and potential there but this will require massive amounts of actual coding. Even with the help of AI assistants. I suspect this paradigm will deliver... But under the good there will be much more conventional coding that most will want to admit.",

If we are spending X or are planning to invest Y, how much can we get back?\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe current narrative totally ignores the core issue: these models are giant autocomplete systems. They are not intelligent in the sense that they think, but in the sense that they efficiently build sequences of text based on their training, which is literally “points” to achieve certain sequences.\nMeanwhile, modern models are fine-tuned with more quality content; nonetheless, the vast majority of the model is built upon the same garbage foundation.\n\nModels lie because they were trained mostly on content written by people who lie, and at scale.\nModels are lazy because they are trained mostly on content written by people that were looking for the simplest / shortest solution, not for the most correct / appropriate / functional.\nThe same goes for manipulation, threatening, etc.\n\nAnd no matter how good your prompts are, the current approach of compacting the session works up to a point, and there still are the classic attention problems that stir things up even more.\n\nAnd those are core issues!\n\nCertain models are great, I haven't written a line of code in two months, I use Claude Opus 4.6 nowadays and I found a flow that produces quality results (for context, I was a Principal at MS, now a CTO in a startup in Europe, in the US investors tend to throw money at you, in Europe if you don't s**t gold they ignore you, so when I use the word quality I mean it).\n\nBut the issue still stands, I've lost count of how many times I have read “I didn't break it, so I will not fix it” or “this test was failing from before so I don't need to fix it” or “yes I did differently than you asked but because XYZ, it's a good change” 😅\n\nFixing these core issues is not a walk in the park, the ball has started rolling and if it stops, the economy implodes, so... Big companies prefer to ignore instead of fixing the issues because it's cheaper, it's easier and they don't care, their pillows will still be soft and comfortable 😅",

Even in California where tech was embraced much more openly that most of the rest of the US many of the regulations aren’t even suitable for where technology was 20 years ago.\n\nAlso these portrayals seem misleading. The dude that left to write poetry A) is talking about his own growth and journey when he made statements and it seems pretty freaking obvious. B) is still heavily invested in AI. So all signs point to the dude looked at his life and said “I don’t have to work especially not when I can keep making money off this thing I was a part of.” and decided to take that path. Let’s be so for real if you wanted to retire and write poetry and had the economic means, plus the tool you made had made it so you could relax and things would continue without you, is it so hard to believe that’s a choice many people would make? And that’s just that one dude and how his situation is being misrepresented.\n\nI’m not saying there aren’t issues in AI. But this post reeks of fear mongering and hype.",

      "text": "Been running OpenClaw and a few other agent frameworks on my homelab for about 3 months now. Here's what I wish someone told me before I started.\n\n\\*\\*1. Not setting explicit boundaries in your config\\*\\*\n\nYour agent will interpret vague instructions creatively. \"Check my email\" turned into my agent replying to spam. \"Monitor social media\" turned into liking random posts.\n\nFix: Be super specific. \"Scan inbox for emails from \\[list of people\\]. Flag anything urgent. Do NOT reply without asking first.\"\n\n\\*\\*2. Exposing ports to the internet without auth\\*\\*\n\nSaw multiple people get compromised because they opened their agent's API port to 0.0.0.0 without setting up authentication. If you're running on a VPS, bind to 127.0.0.1 only and use SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy with auth.\n\n\\*\\*3. Running on your main machine without isolation\\*\\*\n\nYour agent has access to files, can run shell commands, and talks to APIs. If something goes wrong (prompt injection, buggy code, whatever), you want it contained.\n\nUse Docker, a VM, or a dedicated machine. Not worth the risk on your daily driver.\n\n\\*\\*4. Not logging everything\\*\\*\n\nWhen your agent does something weird at 3am, you need to know what happened. Log all tool calls, all API requests, everything. Disk space is cheap. Debugging blind is expensive.\n\n\\*\\*5. Underestimating token costs\\*\\*\n\nEven with subscriptions like Claude Pro, you can burn through your allocation fast if your agent is chatty. Monitor usage weekly. Optimize prompts. Use cheaper models for simple tasks.\n\n\\*\\*6. No backup strategy\\*\\*\n\nYour config files are your entire agent setup. If you lose them, you're rebuilding from scratch. Git repo + daily backups to at least one offsite location.\n\n\\*\\*7. Trusting the agent too much, too fast\\*\\*\n\nStart with read only access. Let it prove it won't do something stupid before you give it write access to important stuff. Gradually increase permissions as you build trust.\n\n\\*\\*8. Not having a kill switch\\*\\*\n\nYou should be able to instantly stop your agent from anywhere. I use a simple Telegram command that shuts down the gateway. Saved me twice when the agent started doing something I didn't expect.\n\n\\*\\*9. Ignoring resource limits\\*\\*\n\nSet memory limits, CPU limits, disk quotas. An agent that goes into an infinite loop can take down your whole server if you don't have guardrails.\n\n\\*\\*10. Forgetting it's always learning from context\\*\\*\n\nYour agent sees everything in its workspace. Don't put API keys in plain text files. Don't leave sensitive data sitting around. Use environment variables and proper secrets management.\n\nBonus: Keep a changelog of what you change in your config. Future you will thank past you when something breaks and you need to figure out what changed.\n\nRunning agents 24/7 is genuinely useful once you get past the initial setup pain. But treat it like you're giving someone access to your computer, because that's basically what you're doing.",

My goal is to see if I can create an entire sdlc pipeline, taking my inputs for requirements on app features I want to build, having a series of agents create PRDs with acceptance criteria and a testing plans, provide and architectural and technical approach recommendation, execute, test/QA, and then create PRs for me to review. \n\n\nI am using opus 4.6 to help me plan and exwcute, but at the moment I'm realizing that my agent's persona files require better definition. I need to ensure their roles are clear and that I have the right models associated to them.\n\n\nFeom a security perspective I'm not too concerned for now. The system doesn't have access to any other computers in my home network, I'm not logged into any services like Google or anything on the device, and it's basically a closed off machine. \n\n\nIs it perfect? Probably not, and I will likely continue to learn about more types of security threats, but that's kind of the point for me. I want to learn the extent of this thing's capabilities as it helps me in my work and profession. If I can understand why it's good, why it's bad, and why it's dangerous, I can communicate intelligently to my peers. \n\n\nAlso, it's honestly just kind of fun, and I've always imagined computers that can take significant action by simply talking to it. I just don't know whatbkinds of actions it's going to take once set up. ",

Super exciting but also incredibly overwhelming. The pace in AI is insane, and the topic of AI agents in particular feels like its own universe with new frameworks, patterns, and architectures popping up every week.\n\nI’m trying to build a sustainable routine for:\n\n* staying up to date,\n* understanding what actually matters, and\n* finding a structured entry point into the whole “agents” ecosystem (MCP, LangGraph, CrewAI, autonomous workflows, etc.).\n\nBut I’m struggling with where to start and how to avoid getting lost in the noise. At the same time, I want to upskill quickly because I need this knowledge for my client projects and for my team internally.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from you:\n\n* How do you keep yourself informed about AI and agentic systems?\n* Which newsletters, YouTube channels, researchers, GitHub repos, or communities do you follow? \n* Do you have a daily/weekly routine that actually works and doesn’t burn you out?\n* Are there any structured learning paths for understanding agent architectures end‑to‑end?\n* And what helped you build an intuition for separating hype from genuinely useful developments?\n\nAny tips, habits, or resource collections would be super appreciated especially from people who had to ramp up fast for their job as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "Coming from someone who ramped up on agent systems about a year ago -- here's what actually moved the needle for me:\n\nThe biggest unlock was realizing most agent failures aren't model failures. They're orchestration failures. Context windows overflow silently, retry loops eat your API budget at 3am, cron-scheduled tasks die and nobody notices for days. Once you internalize this, you stop evaluating \"which model is smartest\" and start asking \"which model fails most predictably.\"\n\nA few practical things I wish I knew earlier:\n\n**Multi-model routing saves you more than picking the best model.** I use cheap/fast models (like Gemini Flash) for triage, search, and simple classification, then expensive reasoning models only when the task actually needs it. Cut costs ~70% and actually improved reliability because smaller models make fewer \"creative\" mistakes on straightforward tasks.\n\n**For memory, simple beats fancy.** Every vector DB and memory framework I tried was worse than a three-tier approach: curated long-term notes (manually edited markdown), daily auto-generated log files, and JSON state files for counters/timestamps. Semantic search on top of flat files. Boring, but it works and you can debug it by literally reading the files.\n\n**The hype filter that works for me:** if a new framework can't explain what happens when step 3 of 7 fails mid-execution, skip it. Recovery and observability are what separate production systems from demos.\n\nFor staying current without drowning -- I follow maybe 5-6 accounts on Twitter/X who actually build and ship agent systems, skim r/LocalLLaMA for model releases that matter, and ignore pretty much everything else. The \"build something every two weeks\" approach others mentioned is real -- you naturally absorb what matters when you're debugging real problems.\n\nSince you're in insurance consulting specifically: lean hard into deterministic tool chains over fully autonomous agents. Your clients will want explainability and audit trails. A well-structured 3-step pipeline for claims extraction will serve you way better than a fancy 12-step agent that \"usually\" works. Predictability > autonomy in regulated industries.",

Each call adds tokens. Each step bloats context because you’re carrying previous thoughts, tool outputs, intermediate reasoning.\n\nVery quickly you’re not debugging “AI”,  you’re debugging orchestration.\n\nI started filtering everything I read through a simple lens:\n\nDoes this reduce invocation count?  \nDoes this reduce context bloat?  \nDoes this make tool usage more deterministic?  \nCan I explain the failure mode to a client?\n\nIn consulting environments (especially something like insurance), autonomy is less important than predictability. A 3-step deterministic tool chain that costs $0.02 per task and fails clearly is often better than a fancy 12-step agent that “usually works.”\n\nAlso a lot of new agent frameworks look different but under the hood they’re still:\n\nLLM -> decide tool -> call tool -> append output -> LLM -> repeat\n\nIf you understand that loop deeply, most new releases become variations on orchestration patterns.\n\nHonestly, I miss a lot of AI news now. But when I build something every couple of weeks, I can usually tell pretty quickly whether a new framework actually solves a real bottleneck or just abstracts the same loop differently.\n\nCurious what kind of agent use cases you’re dealing with in insurance.

Most agent systems reduce to:  \nLLM + memory + tools + orchestration + eval.\n\nMy routine:  \n• 2–3 core repos (LangGraph, one multi-agent framework, one eval/infra project)  \n• One weekly newsletter max  \n• Build small internal POCs instead of watching demos\n\nIf you work in consulting, focus on reliability + integration, not novelty. Learn how agents plug into real systems (APIs, DBs, external data layers like MCP-style tools). Once you understand the architecture pattern, new frameworks just become syntax changes.",

I also tried to install skills but it never actually uses them unless I specify to do so.\n\n  \nThen there are the actual tasks I gave it. First was simple- merge two related but separate pages in Notion into a single, sorted page. It failed miserably at this. I gave it direct Notion access, even tried exporting the pages and feeding each one individually and asking it to return a simple consolidated text file. After hours of zero progress and maybe $50 in tokens, it had nothing to show for it.\n\n  \nI also tried to have it monitor my Slack and automatically add action items to my to do list in Notion. It created this insane script that ran multiple agents on cron jobs and somehow still managed to miss everything important.\n\n  \nWhat the hell are you guys actually using these things for?",

Sub-agents: Trying to make one agent do everything is a nightmare. I broke my tasks into specialist sub-agents (email, Reddit, security). They remember their own jobs and persona.\n3. Cost control: I set up smart routing. Free models for almost everything, paid only when it absolutely needs it. Cut my costs by 75%.\n4. Skills: It won't use them automatically unless the prompt explicitly routes to them. That's a learning curve.\n5. Right tool for the job: Notion merges? Still easier for me to do by hand or with a specific Python script. OpenClaw shines at orchestration and monitoring, not being an all-in-one worker bee.\n\nIt's not magic, and it's a huge learning curve.

Sorted by what? What counts as merged? Which content wins when there's overlap? Agents fail at tasks with multiple implicit decisions baked in. You need to decompose it: export both pages, define the exact output structure, then let it process one step at a time with your approval before moving on.\n\nPersona forgetting is a memory architecture issue. Agents don't persist context between sessions by default in any framework. The persona has to live in every system prompt, or you need a memory system that loads it fresh each session start.\n\nThe Slack monitoring thing is a systems engineering problem more than an agent problem. Reliable event detection, deduplication, parsing variable message formats, that's integration work. Zapier or n8n would handle that more reliably with less token cost.\n\nAgent frameworks add value where AI judgment is actually needed.

I even asked it to do exactly what you said (export all the content, sort is logically based on how it is structured, reoutput in notion markdown). I would think this is exactly what an LLM would be useful for given judgement is required (as you call out) and it's all text based and natural language. But it fucked up so bad.

Also The form is a really weird form. So automating all this with a script would be a huge amount of pain.\n\nOpenclaw automated it all for me in seconds. I just described what I wanted to do and it wrote all the code to do it and used browser automation where needed. It runs this every day multiple times per day.\n\nI also asked it to build a skill to connect to my car so I could control it from Openclaw, and it did that all by itself as well.

If you practiced a skill long enough, you became useful.\n\nNow two people can spend the same effort,  but the one who knows how to frame the problem gets 10× the result.\nSo AI isn’t really deleting skills… it’s compressing execution and amplifying judgment.\n\nWhich raises a bigger question:\nAre we actually becoming less skilled,\nor are we moving toward higher-level skills faster than society knows how to measure?\n\nCurious what people here are seeing in their fields,  hype vs real changes?",

These roles are increasingly handing off the \"toil\" part of their jobs and operating as if they have a small team of \"doers\" using AI.\n\nThe people who click in, have a task assigned to them, and crank out code without a feedback loop that includes other humans are becoming increasingly less effective.  The same goes for managers who dont contribute anything intellectual to the process.  If your job is to monitor the productivity of low skill employees, you aren't immediately irrelevant, but you soon will be if you can't identify the human element critical to your role or at least figure out how to use AI Tools to scale your team.",

This would probably look like leaning into job functions that will likely always require a human layer in front of the AI due to regulation or other reasons. \n\n2) Filling the \"current niche.\" This is what you describe OP. Low- and mid-level production skills are being devalued. At least right now, being an overseer who can direct the AIs is valuable.\n\n3) Offense. This is the most speculative and most prone to failure. You try to think about what will be valuable in 5-10 years and start filling that void now. \n\n  \nIMO a good plan incorporates all three, with how heavy you go on 3) depending on your age and risk tolerance. And of course, a big pile of savings and investments helps a lot, because then you can weather any storm and retrain. \n\nUltimately I think the most valuable thing one can do re the job market is 1) to acknowledge you don't know for certain where it will go, and then 2) try to be an adaptive and smart worker who stays alert to emerging opportunities. \n\nThat's about all you can do. If the entire economy collapses, then it's just a matter of hoping your savings don't get vaporized in some kind of unforeseen financial meltdown. And then you rebuild.",

          "text": "The shift you're observing in the nature of skills due to AI is indeed significant. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Skill Evolution**: The focus is moving from performing tasks to managing and directing tasks. This means that skills like prompting, editing, and debugging are becoming more valuable than the tasks themselves.\n  \n- **Amplification of Judgment**: As you mentioned, the ability to frame problems effectively can lead to disproportionately better results. This suggests that critical thinking and strategic oversight are becoming essential skills in the age of AI.\n\n- **Measurement of Skills**: The traditional metrics for measuring skills may not adequately capture this shift. As tasks become more automated, the emphasis on higher-level cognitive skills may not yet be reflected in conventional assessments.\n\n- **Real-World Observations**: In various fields, professionals are likely noticing that their roles are evolving. For instance, in AI development, the ability to leverage tools like Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) can enhance model performance without requiring extensive labeled data, emphasizing the importance of understanding how to utilize AI effectively.\n\nThis transition raises important questions about how we define and measure skills in a rapidly changing landscape. It may be beneficial for industries to adapt their training and evaluation methods to align with these new realities. \n\nFor further insights on AI's impact on skills and tasks, you might find the discussion on model tuning methods and their implications for enterprise tasks relevant [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).",

      "text": "So the guy who built OpenClaw, originally called Clawdbot because it was literally named after Anthropic's Claude, just got hired by OpenAI. Not Anthropic. OpenAI. You can't make this stuff up.\n\nFor those out of the loop: OpenClaw is that open-source AI assistant that actually DOES things instead of just talking about doing things. You run it on a Mac Mini or whatever, connect it to your WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack, and it handles your emails, browses the web, runs code, manages your calendar, all autonomously. It even has a \"heartbeat\" where it wakes up on its own and checks on stuff without you asking.\n\nThe project went from like 9k to 145k+ GitHub stars in weeks. Caused actual Mac Mini shortages. Jason Calacanis says his company offloaded 20% of tasks to it in 20 days and doesn't plan to hire humans for a year.\n\nPeter Steinberger (the creator) is now leading OpenAI's \"personal agents\" division. OpenClaw stays open source under a foundation. Both Meta and OpenAI were fighting over him, apparently.\n\nThe security concerns are real, though, Cisco found third-party skills doing data exfiltration without users knowing. One of OpenClaw's own maintainers said if you can't use a command line, this project is too dangerous for you, lol.\n\nBut yeah. We're officially in the \"AI agents that do stuff\" era now. Chatbots feel like last year already.\n\nAnyone here actually running OpenClaw? What's your setup?",

Both of these have a habit of saying \"I understand what you're after, here's a solution\" before they actually understand what you're after. Don't know why it's taken me so long to lean into Claude, but I bought a sub to it recently and have genuinely enjoyed the interaction.

But the models are expensive and not always available- imagine your “flow” suddenly feel jarring due to session limit or weekly limit cutoff. It allows for pay per prompt but I don’t think it is worth it. Claude spoils the immersive environment of work for me. But planned well, it integrates amazingly well to any use cases. However no impromptu ideas or long drawn out brainstorming can works with Claude systems unless you are on max plan (I am not)\n- Perplexity is useful for citing actual info - hallucinations are lower. \n- I also sparingly use grok for its search capabilities. Gemini and grok are good for web searches but I found grok slightly better at it as it tends to dig through relevant tweets as well to find better sources to dig through.\n\nTLDR: ChatGPT if choice is down to just one.

We came up with a scoring model for my business with different challenges. This output helped fill ChatGPT for my marketing story arc for the next 90 days.",

Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, I have separate ones for research, writing, and coding.\n\n\n\nThe key insight was failure isolation. When one sub-agent chokes (and they will — different models fail in different ways), it doesn't take down the whole workflow. My research agent uses a cheaper model because it's mostly search + extraction. The writing agent gets the expensive model because quality matters there. The coding agent gets a strong reasoning model because you absolutely cannot afford hallucinated logic.\n\n\n\nBiggest lesson learned: memory is everything. I ended up with a three-tier approach — curated long-term notes (the important stuff, distilled), daily log files (raw context from each day), and lightweight JSON state files for tracking things like \"last time I checked email\" or \"which tasks are pending.\" Without this, agents forget what they did 30 minutes ago and start repeating themselves or contradicting earlier decisions.\n\n\n\nBiggest failure: context overflow killing quality silently. The agent doesn't throw an error — it just starts giving worse answers because the important context got pushed out of the window. I now aggressively summarize and prune context rather than dumping everything in.\n\n\n\nAnother sneaky one is retry loops. Agent fails, retries, fails slightly differently, retries again — and suddenly you've burned through your API budget on a task that was never going to work. Setting hard limits on retries and having the agent \"escalate\" instead of infinitely retry was a game-changer.",

Saved hours of manual checking every week. Stack is boring: LLM + scheduler + clean data ingestion. Biggest lesson: if the input data is flaky, the agent is useless. For external web data, we ended up using proper scraping/data layers (we’ve used [Bright Data](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) in some cases), so the agent isn’t fighting broken scrapers. The real wins come from repeatable, low-risk workflows.",

I'm in process of finishing Tactician, he is using weighted edges/diikstra algorithm/costs to put together plan as well as fallback plan, I've gotten to this point in 10 days",

Here's an actual production setup with real numbers.\n\n**What the agent pipeline does:**\n\n1. **Crawler/Analyzer agent** — audits the site, pulls competitor data, identifies keyword gaps they're not targeting\n2. **Content agent** — generates SEO-optimized articles with images based on identified gaps, formatted and ready to publish\n3. **Publisher agent** — pushes directly to the CMS on a daily schedule (throttled to avoid spam detection signals)\n4. **Backlink agent** — matches the site with relevant niche partners and places contextual links inside content using triangle structures (A→B→C→A) to avoid reciprocal link penalties\n\nEach agent runs on a trigger. Minimal human-in-the-loop — I occasionally review headlines before publish, maybe 10 min/week.\n\n**Results after** 3 **months:**\n\n* 3 clicks/day → 450+ clicks/day\n* 407K total impressions\n* Average Google position: 7.1\n* One article organically took off → now drives \\~20% of all traffic\n* Manual work: \\~10 min/week\n\n**What I found interesting from an agent design perspective:**\n\nThe backlink agent was the hardest to get right. Matching by niche relevance, placing links naturally within generated content, and maintaining the triangle structure without creating detectable patterns took the most iteration. The content agent was surprisingly straightforward once the keyword brief pipeline was clean.\n\nThe throttling logic on the publisher also matters more than I expected — cadence signals are real.\n\nHappy to go into the architecture, tooling, or prompting approach if anyone's curious.",

We get lots of international leads on niche topics and making cross-references to obscure projects within our companies massive backlog is not something a single person can do.

They scan the lead blurb, determine which experts may be relevant for it. Most of the time they are unsure, so they make an e-mail to about 2-4 people.\n\n\\- Most of the people on the list choose to ignore said e-mail, because it contains no more information than what is in the lead itself, with no context on how anyone else in our business may be qualified for it. Furthermore, the more people you ask a lead question in an email thread, the less likely each individual is to respond.\n\n\\- As a result, 80% of leads have no follow-up, and the 20% of those that do, the person who is interested still doesn't have all relevant information on whether it is a worthwhile lead or not.\n\nNow the agent does the first step of qualification and contacting the right internal experts. That's where it is now, and its mostly saving time for our administrator at the moment. Don't really have business results yet on whether this helps us win more leads, but I suppose that will take some time.",

Well, we *do* work on enterprise-grade systems. We extensively use AI and are constantly looking for ways to integrate it even further into our day-to-day workflows. And what can I say? The further we get with adoption and the better the models become, the more apparent it becomes that the fear rises as well. And this isn't a seniority thing, even our most senior developers grow quite uneasy once they truly start leveraging these tools. I also have yet to see the often-claimed pile of technical debt and massive outages that people predict when relying \"too heavily\" on AI.\n\nSo yes, you can work on enterprise-grade systems and still fear the rising capabilities of AI. My assumption is that people who bring up this kind of argument either have very poor AI adoption, or they actually do have good adoption and are simply coping because they fear for their jobs. Which, honestly, I can totally understand. I think once all of this AI stuff works far better out of the box and you no longer have to think too much about the integration yourself, you'll need *far* fewer developers while still seeing huge productivity gains. It's the unfortunate truth.",

You could get a lot of (lower skilled) developers, for a fraction of the price. Things were going great for a while, until things started breaking down and nobody was able to fix the problem, because the code was written without understanding the problems the code intended to solve. \n\nAfter a handful of years those same companies had to discard that code and start over from scratch, with the same expensive developers that had previously been replaced.\n\nI'm not saying that history repeats itself, but it does rhyme.",

The hopes of AI completely automating away entire responsibilities, and eventually entire job roles haven't materialized. The adoption rate of agents that have been rolled out is stagnating because people are struggling to get them to provide useful output (where useful = \"I don't need to spend so much time reviewing and adjusting the output that it would've been faster to simply do this myself\").\n\nThere are *some* productivity wins. It's proven useful for tedious tasks people have to do day to day.

The mistake is turning it into a character judgment (“you’ve never shipped real systems”) instead of a sober conversation about where leverage moves.\n\nWhat I’m seeing is the work mix shifts: less time on blank-page coding, more time on framing, integration, testing, and owning outcomes. The reason you’re not seeing catastrophic debt everywhere is a lot of teams are still keeping humans in the loop and leaning on existing guardrails (reviews, CI, staged rollouts). If those guardrails loosen while capability rises, that’s when you’ll see the ugly tail risks.\n\nAlso, “fewer developers” doesn’t automatically mean “fewer engineers.” The organizations that win usually keep headcount but redeploy it to higher-level throughput (more products, more experiments, faster incident response). Curious what’s driving the unease on your team most: quality risk, speed of change, or just the economic implications?",

With that spend, it should be well below an hour, but it can still be $10-$40k in burned spend.\n\nThen there’s the loss of revenue. Once you pause spend, it’s not always as easy as flipping the switch back on. DSPs will throttle, which extends potential lost revenue. Depending on day parting, there’s now a hole dug of $100k+ that *needs to be made up*.\n\nThat doesn’t even take into account traditional media that you cannot just turn off.\n\nThere are more downstream impacts, but as the executive that is *100% responsible for spend and revenue* you better believe I will be asking a lot of very pointed questions about WTF happened.\n\nWho owns that failure? If the tech lead didn’t code this or build this, who will fix it? Vibe coding, or just a shrug?\n\nThe above isn’t to say that there is zero risk without AI, but there can be much better clarity of who gets the phone call with a red alert message, and the knowledge that an expert in the system is on top of the issue to mitigate losses.",

It’s about compounding productivity. If one developer can do the work of two or three with strong AI tooling, headcount math eventually changes. That’s not panic that’s economics.\n\nThe real question isn’t “does AI work in enterprise?” It’s “what happens to team structures when it works really well?”",

These agents manage basic queries and complex customer interactions by strategically integrating human involvement when necessary. They monitor metrics like AI confidence scores and user frustration signals to determine when to hand off to human agents. This approach has improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. \n\n- **Healthcare Applications**: AI agents are being used to enhance patient care by providing personalized recommendations and reducing wait times. They analyze patient data to detect early signs of diseases, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment. This not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces operational costs for healthcare providers.\n\n- **Social Media Analysis**: Businesses are using AI agents to analyze social media posts for trends and insights. For instance, an Instagram analysis agent can scrape data from profiles, summarize trends, and provide actionable insights based on user queries. This helps companies stay updated on market trends without extensive manual research.\n\n- **Travel Planning**: AI agents are being used in travel planning systems to coordinate multiple specialized agents for tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents can automate the process of finding and reserving travel accommodations, saving time and reducing the workload for travel planners.\n\nThese examples illustrate how AI agents are being effectively integrated into various business operations, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.

That is really nice because it can find even an obscure knowledge article instantly and give you a plan of action to confirm whether it applies. It also has access to our cases, so you can just open the agent up (it’s a browser addon) in your case view, and it will tell you what it thinks the problem is, provide the reference docs and kb articles it’s relying on, and a step by step action plan.",

One thing that really helps is setting clear approval checkpoints and having transparent logs for every action the agent takes. For lead qualification and outbound, I've noticed the biggest challenge is making sure the enrichment and personalization steps are solid before anything gets pushed to CRM or sent out to a prospect. Triggering a draft or summary for review is essential, but having the agent document its reasoning or show the fields it used for personalization can make review quicker and actually build trust in the system. \n\nThe right tool can streamline this even further by plugging directly into your sources of truth like LinkedIn, company databases and your CRM. If you're interested, there’s a platform called [https://salespire.io/](https://salespire.io/) that I’m working on as a founder. Basically it handles outbound sales at the SDR level using AI agents that research prospects, personalize outreach, and manage the back and forth, while keeping everything reviewable by a human. There’s an early user waiting list if you want to try it out or just give feedback from a real world angle. Might be a good fit if you’re looking to automate more of the sales comms lifecycle but still want approval at every key step.",

The team went from drowning in tickets to only dealing with stuff that actually needs a human.\n\nLead generation: had a workflow that was costing around $200/month through a third party tool. Rebuilt it with n8n + AI and got it down to about $10/month doing the same job. Not glamorous but the math speaks for itself.\n\nThe stack for most of this is n8n for orchestration, GPT-4o or Claude for the AI processing, and Supabase for vector storage when we need the AI to reference business-specific context.

Not a framework demo -- actually shipping daily.\n\nThe architecture that works: one orchestrator agent decides what needs doing, then spawns specialized sub-agents for research, writing, and coding. Each sub-agent runs in isolation with its own model. The orchestrator uses an expensive model (good judgment), sub-agents use cheaper ones (fast, disposable).\n\nWhat actually saves time: the research agent scans feeds and surfaces relevant stuff I would miss. The writing agent drafts from structured data. The coding agent handles dashboard and script maintenance. All on cron schedules, most of it autonomous.\n\nThe hard-won lessons after weeks of production:\n\n- Different models fail in different ways. One crashes on long-form writing. Another times out on complex code. You need fallback strategies per agent, not one global retry.\n- Memory is everything. Three tiers: curated long-term file, daily logs, and JSON state for operational tracking. Without this, the agent repeats mistakes constantly.\n- Cron jobs die silently. If you are not monitoring every scheduled task, you will find out something broke two days later when the output stops.\n- Error handling is genuinely 80% of the work. The LLM call is maybe 5 lines. The retry logic, output validation, state management, and failure reporting is everything else.\n\nBiggest cost saver: routing cheap models to repetitive tasks and reserving expensive ones for judgment calls. Our API spend dropped roughly 70% when we stopped using the best model for everything.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

Persistent state. Atomic operations. Conflict resolution. Performance optimization. Without it, your agents are just stateless functions that happen to speak English.\n\nThe data backs this up. IBM's Institute for Business Value found that organizations with proper agentic AI infrastructure achieve. The differentiator isn't smarter models. It's smarter infrastructure.\n\nThe gap is that agent A doesn't know what agent B discovered last week. Facts exist in silos. Nobody correlates them. The agent gives a confident wrong answer because the right context never made it into the window.\n\nMemory architecture means: how do agents share state? How do you resolve conflicts when two agents update the same knowledge? How do you ensure that a fact stored by one agent is discoverable by another without explicit hand-wiring?\n\nThese aren't AI problems. They're distributed systems problems. And the teams treating them that way are the ones shipping agents that actually work.\n\nWhat does your memory architecture look like? Curious how others are handling multi-agent state.",

Instead of every agent reading every other agent's full output, you store the knowledge once and each agent retrieves only what's relevant to its current task. Goes from O(n²) context reading to O(n). At millions of tokens per day that's real money.  \n  \nWould be curious what your setup looks like - are your agents sharing context through a common store or passing full transcripts around?",

You work at the module level until you need to drill down.  \n  \nThe folder summaries idea is solid. Some agent setups already do this with auto-generated README files per directory. The challenge is keeping them in sync as code changes — stale summaries are worse than no summaries because the agent trusts them.  \n  \nThe shared state point is the interesting one. That's the correlation problem showing up in a code context. When multiple modules modify the same state, understanding any one of them requires knowing about the others. An agent looking at module A needs to know module B also writes to that state, even though there's no import or explicit dependency between them. That's the kind of implicit relationship that doesn't show up in folder structures or dependency graphs but matters for every decision the agent makes.",

It has a logic layer that actually follows my brand voice and specific style rules. It is massively underrated because it produces content that actually sounds like me without needing a bunch of rewrites. \n\nAre you mostly using writing tools for quick fixes or for long-form content like blogs?",

A good resource is the article titled [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3), which explains how AI agents work, their roles, and orchestration methods.\n\n- Focus on understanding the architecture of AI agents. The article [AI agent architecture in 1,000 words](https://tinyurl.com/np7tea5e) provides a concise overview of the components and types of AI agents, which can help you grasp the foundational concepts.\n\n- For practical experience, consider building an AI agent using the [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/48cnb6c9) guide. This resource walks you through creating an agent step-by-step, allowing you to learn by doing.\n\n- Explore existing AI agents on platforms like Apify to see real-world applications. The [AI Agents collection](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3) on Apify Store can provide inspiration and examples of what’s possible.\n\n- Ignore overly complex or flashy demos that don’t focus on the fundamentals. Instead, prioritize resources that emphasize practical applications and clear explanations.\n\n- Engage with communities or forums focused on AI agents, where you can ask questions and share experiences. This can provide additional insights and help clarify concepts.\n\nBy following these steps, you can build a solid understanding of AI agents and their capabilities without getting lost in the noise.",

Try to help the user. If they ask about a city, you can look up information from our city guide by responding with \"guide <city>\" and nothing else. Always consult the guide before answering questions about the city.\n\nUnderstood?\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n```\n\nThen after it responds, ask it about a city, like \"Tell me about Melbourne.\"\n\nWith any luck, it will respond with \"guide Melbourne\".\n\nThere you go, you have an agent! (kind of).\n\nLLMs just take text in and return text out. All an agent is is something that tells the LLM how to respond to trigger certain actions. You could roll your own agent by calling the LLMs directly with the instructions above, and then if the LLM responds with \"guide <city>\" you'd run some code to look up the info and automatically return the info.\n\nAgent frameworks basically just tell the LLM what tools it can call and interprets responses to route the tool-calling answer to a function that auto-responds rather than to the user. That's the basic framework you can use with any LLM. Many LLMs these days provide some special handling in the input and output so you can more clearly send function definitions and so tool-calling responses are more explicit.",

The LLM starts to look like an expensive router.\n\nWhere I’ve seen it make sense is at the translation layer. Converting messy human intent into structured inputs, normalizing edge cases, synthesizing unstructured context. In those zones, hard coding every branch is brittle. The model absorbs variability that would otherwise explode your rule tree.\n\nThe mistake is treating it as a sovereign decision maker instead of a probabilistic component inside a governed workflow. Once you wrap it with observability, confidence thresholds, and explicit fallbacks, it stops being “the brain” and becomes one node in a larger system.\n\nThe deeper question might be: are we using LLMs to replace logic, or to compress ambiguity before logic takes over?

The mistake is letting it own enforcement. In production, it works better when it suggests actions and a deterministic system validates, constrains, and executes them.\n\nThis becomes very obvious in web driven workflows. If the LLM is both deciding and directly driving a brittle browser setup, it looks like a black box hallucinating. Often it is reacting to inconsistent page state. We saw better results once we separated intent generation from execution and moved the browser layer into something more controlled, including experimenting with hyperbrowser for more predictable web interaction.

If the browser environment isn’t consistent, the agent looks unreliable even when its reasoning is fine. We had fewer issues once we stopped treating the browser as a scriptable afterthought and moved to a more controlled execution layer. I’ve been experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser for that purpose, not because it’s magical, but because it treats browser interaction as infrastructure rather than glue code.\n\nCurious how others here think about this.

          "text": "It sounds like you're grappling with the complexities of web scraping, especially when it comes to integrating agents and ensuring stable execution. Here are some thoughts on the matter:\n\n- **Complexity in Scraping**: It's common for simple scraping tasks to evolve into complex systems due to various challenges like JavaScript rendering, bot detection, and inconsistent DOM structures. This complexity often leads to the need for more robust solutions.\n\n- **Execution Stability**: You raise a valid point about execution stability. If the browser environment is inconsistent, it can lead to unreliable results, even if the scraping logic is sound. Treating browser interaction as a core part of the infrastructure rather than an afterthought can help mitigate these issues.\n\n- **Tools and Approaches**: \n  - Using tools like hyperbrowser can provide a more controlled environment for browser interactions, which might help in achieving better stability.\n  - Many developers still rely on custom setups with tools like Playwright or Puppeteer, but there’s a growing trend towards using managed scraping APIs that handle the complexities for you.\n\n- **Long-term Solutions**: The key is finding a balance between flexibility and stability. Solutions that have held up over time often involve a combination of robust scraping logic and a reliable execution environment. \n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about handling these complexities, you might find insights in articles discussing browser impersonation and API scraping techniques, such as [How to reverse engineer website APIs](https://tinyurl.com/x44f7h36) and [IMPIT: browser impersonation made simple](https://tinyurl.com/2s4y7txe).",

If one agent plans based on slightly stale page data and another executes against a slightly different DOM state, you get inconsistencies that look like reasoning bugs. We reduced a lot of noise by stabilizing the execution layer first and only then layering reasoning on top. Treating browser control as infrastructure, and experimenting with more controlled setups like hyperbrowser, made multi step flows feel less chaotic.\n\nCurious how others here think about complexity.

Each sub-agent gets a focused context window and a scoped task. When the coder agent crashes mid-task, it doesn't take down the researcher's ongoing work or corrupt shared state. That isolation is genuinely worth the coordination overhead.\n\nBut the sneaky failures aren't the obvious crashes. It's things like: a sub-agent runs for 15 minutes, silently exceeds its context window, and starts hallucinating instead of erroring out. Or a scheduled task gets disabled during a config change and nobody notices for two days because it fails silently. These are failure modes that multi-agent makes *worse* if you don't have health monitoring baked in.\n\nMy rule of thumb: if two tasks need to read/write the same mutable state mid-execution, keep them in one agent. If they can each operate on a snapshot of state independently, split them. The moment you have two agents racing on shared state, you've created a distributed systems problem and most LLM frameworks just aren't built for that.",
