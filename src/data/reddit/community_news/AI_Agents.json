      "text": "I’ve been a loyal ChatGPT/Claude power user for years. The convenience was unmatched. But recently, something shifted. Between the rising subscription costs (which seem to be everywhere now) and the increasing \"censorship\" or over-tuning of cloud models, I decided to build my own local AI workstation.\n\nAfter spending the last few weeks testing **Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and DeepSeek** locally, I’ve realized that the \"Cloud dominance\" is starting to fade. Here’s why I think 2026 is the year of Local AI:\n\n1. **Zero Latency:** No more waiting for server queues. The response is instant.\n2. **True Privacy:** I’m a developer, and I can finally feed my proprietary code into an LLM without worrying about where that data ends up.\n3. **No Filters:** You get the raw power of the model, exactly how the researchers intended it.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There’s a learning curve with hardware (VRAM requirements are still the biggest bottleneck) and quantization formats (GGUF vs EXL2).\n\nI’ve documented my entire setup process, the specific hardware I used (and some budget mistakes I made), and a step-by-step guide for anyone looking to make the switch this year. If you're tired of being tethered to a subscription, you might find my breakdown helpful.",

      "text": "We built an open source, rust-native alternative of Claude Cowork\n\nWhen Claude Cowork first dropped, tbh it hit us a bit hard.\n\nWe have been building our product Kuse confidently for a long time, and overnight we found ourselves becoming a web-based Claude Cowork alternative. That was frustrating at first. But also sparked a different kind of curiosity.\n\nSo over the past 48 hours, together with Claude Code, we built a fully open-source project: Kuse Cowork.\n\n**Native Rust, Zero-Wrappers:** This isn't just another agent wrapper. It’s a ground-up implementation in Rust. No heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on OpenCode/AgentSDK. Just raw performance and a tiny binary.  \nDocker Sandboxing: Since agents execute code, security is paramount. Open Cowork runs commands inside a transient Docker container.\n\n**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or run entirely offline with Ollama/Local LLMs. You own the keys and the privacy.\n\n**Skills, and MCPs:** It can already handle complex document tasks (PDF, Excel, etc.) out of the box.\n\n**The Development Story:** The most interesting part is that the builder fellow had zero Rust experience before this weekend. It was a surreal experience: an AI agent (Claude Code) helping me build a faster, secure, and open-source version of \"itself.\"\n\nIt's still very early, and there's a long roadmap ahead.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Docker sandboxing helps with blast radius, but operators still need clear logs, versioning, and a way to reconstruct what the agent saw and decided at the time. That is usually where escalations come from.\n\nI would be curious how you are thinking about audit trails and recovery. Not just “it failed,” but which prompt, tool call, file state, and assumption led to that outcome. Speed matters, but explainability is what makes these safe to run outside of a demo.",

Open source is great for trust, but the gap between a cool build and something teams can rely on day to day is usually in the boring edges, not the core architecture.",

Seeing Kuse Cowork lean into native performance and sandboxing makes me wonder - are we heading toward a world where the differentiator isn’t the UI layer, but how well the agent manages context, privacy, and trust?\n\nCurious how others here think about that - does “agent‑native” design feel like the next step beyond dashboards, or just another layer on top of existing tools?",

JS heavy sites that load half the content late. Random layout changes. Logins expiring. Cloudflare or basic bot checks suddenly blocking requests that worked yesterday. Even when it works, it feels fragile. One small site update and the whole pipeline falls over.\n\nI have tried the usual stack. Requests + BeautifulSoup is fine until it isn’t. Playwright and Puppeteer work but feel heavy and sometimes unpredictable at scale. Headless browsers behave differently from real users. And once you add agents on top, debugging becomes painful because failures are not always reproducible.\n\nLately I have been experimenting with more “agent friendly” approaches where the browser layer is treated as infrastructure instead of glue code. I have seen tools like hyperbrowser mentioned in this context, basically giving agents a more stable way to interact with real websites instead of brittle scraping scripts. Still early for me, so not claiming it solves everything.\n\nI am genuinely curious what people here are using in production. Are you sticking with traditional scraping and just accepting breakage? Using full browser automation everywhere? Paying for third party APIs? Or building some custom hybrid setup?\n\nWould love to hear what has actually held up over time, not just what works in demos.",

For anything mission critical, we ended up mixing approaches. Static or semi static stuff stayed simple, and anything JS heavy or behind auth went through a full browser layer that we treated like infrastructure, with retries, health checks, and clear failure signals. That helped more than the specific library choice.\n\nPlaywright has been the least painful for us long term, but only once we accepted the overhead and built guardrails around it. Where it really falls down is when people expect agents to just handle breakage automatically. In practice, you still need someone owning selectors, login flows, and change detection. Paying for APIs made sense in a few narrow cases, mostly because the cost of babysitting scrapers was worse.

But LLM agent searchig is better if you need precise information of some exact stuff that needs to be up to date and it not being blocked as much.\n\nFor example the tool i made with gemini, which gathers a lot of data and thus needs to make multiple searches to gather data from one company costs like 2€ per 100 companies searched.

I was making around 15k per month. I thought, okay, this is it, I am officially a founder now.\n\nThat client left after one month.\n\nThat’s it. One month.\n\nSuddenly no revenue, no backup, no runway, and I had to go back to the same field again with my confidence shaken and savings hit.\n\nReality check. One client is not a business. Early revenue is not stability. Excitement is not security.\n\nIf you are working a job right now and dreaming about your startup, please set a real target. A target where you can pay rent, eat properly, handle emergencies, and sleep without panic.\n\nQuit only when your startup can carry your basic life, not your ego.\n\nStartup life is already hard.

Agents look great when they operate on structured inputs or well defined APIs, but once they have to interact with real websites, dashboards, or internal tools, reliability drops fast.\n\nDynamic pages, auth flows, inconsistent UI states, partial loads… all of that turns a “smart” agent into something brittle very quickly. I’ve tried different orchestration frameworks and models, and the issue rarely feels like reasoning. It’s almost always execution and grounding.\n\nLately I’ve been thinking more about treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure instead of something the agent improvises against. Tools like hyperbrowser made me rethink this, not as an agent framework, but as a way to give agents a stable place to observe and act so failures are actually debuggable.\n\nCurious how others here are handling this.

Here are a few thoughts on the topic:\n\n- **Brittleness in Dynamic Environments**: Many agents struggle with dynamic web pages due to issues like changing DOM structures, authentication flows, and inconsistent UI states. This can lead to failures that are hard to debug.\n\n- **Execution vs. Reasoning**: As you've noted, the problems often stem from execution rather than reasoning. Agents may be capable of understanding tasks but falter when it comes to interacting with unpredictable web interfaces.\n\n- **Infrastructure Perspective**: Treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure is an interesting approach. By providing a stable environment for agents to operate, you can potentially reduce the number of failures and make debugging easier.\n\n- **Guardrails and Specialized Environments**: Some developers opt for heavy guardrails to manage interactions with UI elements, while others may use specialized environments or tools designed to handle the complexities of web automation more effectively.\n\nIf you're looking for more insights or specific frameworks that address these issues, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "NVIDIA’s research made it clear that the real cost problem in AI agents isn’t model quality, its orchestration teams keep using massive frontier models for tiny, deterministic tasks that small models can handle faster and far cheaper. In real production systems, most agent steps are boring, repetitive and rule-bound, yet people still pay frontier-model prices for them, which kills margins as usage grows. The insight from these papers is that intelligence comes from routing work correctly, not throwing a giant model at everything and that’s why orchestrating specialized SLMs and only escalating to heavyweight reasoning when uncertainty is high leads to systems that are both cheaper and more reliable. This approach turns AI from a flashy demo into something you can actually run in production without panic over costs and if anyone here wants to explore how to apply this setup to their own agents, I’m happy to guide.",

      "text": "I get it, AI has made it easier to build software, but it’s not as if you can magically do months worth of coding in days or even weeks.\n\nHere’s the pattern I’ve discovered:\n\nThere are a bunch of creators who have hyped people up, saying you do not need to have coding knowledge to build AI systems. Is it true? No.\n\nUnless your job is to build small demos/MVPs or content on AI.\n\nYou might be able to sell your “product” by showing your leads the automation you built on n8n but when it’s time to deploy it into the real world, it’ll fail on day 1.\n\nHere’s a recent case study from one of my leads:\n\nThey needed a WhatsApp reservation and admin system for a network of \\~9000 restaurants.\n\nSo they did what most people feel is the logical solution, hire developers.\n\nThe developers that they had, built a WhatsApp bot using n8n. They showed it to the client, it worked fine. Because obviously it’s a simple chatbot so you can’t really do much with it except talk.\n\nCan you jailbreak it? Piece of cake.\n\nDoes it have any logical awareness? No.\n\nIs it anywhere close to a usable demo? Not at all.\n\nSo they start reaching out to people who can actually build the system. That’s where I come into picture.\n\nThey tell me, they already have a system built “halfway” and need me to finish it in the next 3 days (that too for free lmfao, I’ll get to this part later).\n\nMy CTO sits with their developer and sees the system they had.\n\nSurprise! The system is just an n8n template copy pasted with vibe coding done all over (the guy didn’t even remove the ChatGPT comments in the code).\n\nSo I tell them, that this cannot be done within 3 days. Your system is pretty much useless, we’ll have to build everything from scratch. We can give you a small demo in the next 12 days, but that requires a certain upfront payment so that we can start working.\n\nThat’s where he paused and told “he’ll talk to his partners”.\n\nApparently all of their budget was already allocated to marketing, they hired a lot of sales people and could only allocate the budget for “API Token costs”.\n\nSo yeah, we’re not going forward with them.\n\nP.S. they would’ve paid us once 4-5 restaurants would’ve found the system useful, then they’d recommend it to the 6th restaurant and this time charge money.\n\nNow here comes the issue: People have learned how to put together different blocks on no code tools and call it a day. But someone who had actual coding knowledge knows that it’s only the start.\n\nHere’s the things which were missing from the WhatsApp n8n automation they had:\n\n1. Edge cases.\n\nNobody tested how the system would reply if there were unwanted inputs, which is like the 90% of human input. The automation kept talking rubbish when things went out of context.\n\n2. No guard rails.\n\nIt was extremely easy to jailbreak the system. Few fishy prompts and it would give away every single internal data to the user.\n\n3. Sky high costs.\n\nThe workflow had no structure. The vibecoded schema would have cost about 10-20$ on an average per user. Rest you can calculate how costly the operation would be if they even got 10,000 users :) (Apparently they kept pushing every single thing through LLM and the tokens would’ve kept compounding overtime, not gonna go into details).\n\n4. No GDPR knowledge.\n\nBeing a bad developer is one thing, but when it comes to WhatsApp, how come people don’t think about the GDPR rules??? Unless you’re asking for trouble.\n\n5. Overpromises.\n\nAI can do everything! Add unlimited features and make revenue based promises to the clients!\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause people are underestimating how hard it is to really create a scalable and usable AI system.\n\nThere are thousands of people selling themselves as one man dev team who can apparently build saas level systems on his own that too for free.\n\nWhy for free? Because no one hires them, I mean why should they? When your services are pretty much useless.\n\nBut when new business owners enter this market, they get a feeling that AI has made software development very easy, cheap and almost free. So they have sky high expectations. Every single guy out there is legit selling his “business changing automation” for free. Is that how software industry works? NO.\n\nThese no code tools have only added more to the noise. I see so many people who have made absurd promises to their clients which apparently AI can magically solve. They promise to give a demo + result for free. Then they start building using no code tools, fail miserably, try to find builders, get faced by the fact that even demos need some capital to be built, ultimately they are simply unable to deliver.\n\nConclusion? AI has not made the market cheap, but more complex. People who do not have good software development knowledge CANNOT build scalable AI systems just because they are good at operating no code tools.\n\nSo if you’re a business owner, watch out. It’s hard to find the right people for the job when there’s so much noise.\n\nPro tip: if someone is providing you something for free, chances are. It was worth the same.",

Most of these glued together systems have no visibility or brakes, so the first failure turns into a customer trust problem, not a technical one.\n\nAI did not make systems cheaper, it moved the cost into design, guardrails, and accountability.

      "text": "Genuinely confused why every LangGraph tutorial uses direct API calls. You're paying tokens just to experiment and learn. Tried finding an alternative for weeks — zero results for combining LangGraph with Claude Agent SDK.\n\nSo I figured it out. Here's the pattern:\n\nLangGraph handles orchestration — state management, conditional routing, parallel execution. Claude Agent SDK handles what happens inside each node — full agent capabilities, tool use, context, not just raw API responses.\n\nYou define your workflow graph in LangGraph, but each node calls the SDK instead of hitting the API directly. You get the best of both and you're not burning credits while prototyping.\n\nBuilt an 11-agent system with this. Research agents run in parallel, analysis agents process outputs, synthesis agents compile reports. LangGraph controls the flow, SDK powers every step.\n\nDocumented the whole thing into a workshop because I genuinely couldn't find this anywhere online.\n\nMaybe there's a reason everyone's using direct calls and I'm missing it. But this has been working well for months. Curious what others think — anyone tried something similar?",

It supports BYOK and can help you to organize local files, automate browsers end-to-end.\n\nAt the core is CAMEL’s Workforce system, which is inspired by distributing systems: a root node for task planning and coordination, worker nodes for execution, and an asynchronous task channel. It also supports failure tolerance and recursive workers for long-horizon tasks. All of this is open source.\n\nFor browser automation, Eigent uses a two-layer architecture:\n\n* a Python layer for agent reasoning and orchestration\n* a TypeScript layer (built on Playwright) for native browser control (DOM ops, SoM markers, occlusion handling)\n\nThese two layers communicate asynchronously via WebSockets to keep things low-latency and avoid the limits of Python-only automation. This stack is also open source.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests!",

Over long-running tasks, they usually have no plan, lose context and their execution gets messy.\n\nMore capable agents like Claude Code and Manus get around this by following a common pattern: they plan first, externalize working context (files) and break work into isolated sub-tasks.\n\nDeep Agents from LangChain are really the next level, which essentially package this pattern into a reusable runtime. you call `create_deep_agent(...)` and get a StateGraph that:\n\n* plans explicitly\n* delegates work to sub-agents\n* keeps its state in files instead of bloating the prompt\n\nEach piece is implemented as middleware (To-do list middleware, Filesystem middleware, Subagent middleware).\n\nConceptually it looks like this:\n\n    User goal\n      ↓\n    Deep Agent (LangGraph StateGraph)\n      ├─ Plan: write_todos → updates \"todos\" in state\n      ├─ Delegate: task(...) → runs a subagent with its own tool loop\n      ├─ Context: ls/read_file/write_file/edit_file → persists working notes/artifacts\n      ↓\n    Final answer\n\nIt push key parts into explicit state (e.g. `todos` \\+ files + messages), but the main thing I noticed was visibility over frontend.\n\nI wired it up with CopilotKit - Infrastructure for building AI copilots into any app.\n\nIt keeps the frontend in sync with what the agent is doing by streaming events and state updates in real time (using AG-UI protocol under the hood).\n\nDeep Agents is really good at multi-step workflows & CopilotKit as the orchestration + UI layer.

When you are the person who has to explain failures, you hesitate to automate without a clear owner, fallback, and definition of success. Most people get unstuck when they stop asking “what agent should I build” and instead start with “what decision or handoff is failing repeatedly today.” At scale, agents only stick when they reduce risk or escalation, not when they feel clever. The first useful ones I have seen were boring, tightly scoped, and easy to turn off. Perfectionism usually fades once the blast radius is small enough to tolerate being wrong.",

          "text": "It's common to feel overwhelmed when diving into building agents, especially with the plethora of tools and frameworks available. Here are some thoughts that might resonate:\n\n- **Start Small**: Instead of aiming for a complex agent, consider a simple use case. For example, automating a repetitive task you do daily, like summarizing emails or gathering data from a website. This can help build confidence without the pressure of perfection.\n\n- **Use Existing Templates**: Platforms like Apify offer templates that can jumpstart your projects. For instance, the [CrewAI](https://tinyurl.com/jc5bza4w) framework provides a structured way to define agents and integrate them with tools, which might lower the barrier for you.\n\n- **Focus on a Specific Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in your daily routine. This could be anything from social media analysis to automating data entry. When you have a clear problem to solve, it can guide your development process.\n\n- **Set Time Limits**: Allocate a specific amount of time to work on your agent. This can help combat perfectionism and keep you moving forward. Even if you don't finish, you'll have made progress.\n\n- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities can provide motivation and inspiration. Sharing your struggles might lead to suggestions or collaboration opportunities that can help you overcome hurdles.\n\n- **Iterate and Improve**: Remember that your first agent doesn't have to be perfect. Build something functional, then iterate on it. Each version can improve based on feedback and your own experiences.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, consider checking out the [AI agent workflow](https://tinyurl.com/3rppepvb) for insights on building agents that query datasets. It might spark some ideas for your own projects.",

Claude figures out:\n\n1. Which task type fits your problem (QA, classification, tool calling, RAG)\n2. How to convert your messy input data into proper training format\n3. Whether the task is even learnable (runs teacher evaluation first)\n4. Training orchestration and progress monitoring\n5. How to package and deploy the result\n\nThe skill wraps our distil-cli and reads the docs to figure out the right commands and parameters.\n\n**Example conversation:**\n\n```bash\nMe: I have conversation logs in ./data where I asked for SQL queries. \n    Train a model that can do this locally.\n\nClaude: → Analyzes the data format\n        → Creates job_description.json, config.yaml, train.jsonl, test.jsonl\n        → Runs teacher eval (DeepSeek-V3 scores 80%)\n        → Kicks off distillation training\n        → Downloads 2.2GB GGUF when done\n        → Writes deployment script for Ollama\n```\n\nTotal hands-on time: maybe 10 minutes of chatting. Training runs in the background.\n\n**What makes it agentic:**\n\n- Reads documentation to understand available commands\n- Makes decisions about task type and data format based on your description\n- Interprets evaluation metrics and recommends whether to proceed\n- Handles errors and retries\n- Can write follow-up code (deployment scripts, test apps) using the trained model\n\n**Results from a Text2SQL test:**\n\n| Model | Accuracy (LLM-as-a-Judge) |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| Base Qwen3 0.6B | 36% |\n| Teacher (DeepSeek-V3) | 80% |\n| Agent-trained 0.6B | 74% |\n\nThe agent got a 0.6B model to nearly match a state-of-the-art teacher on this task.",
