      "text": "Been running OpenClaw and a few other agent frameworks on my homelab for about 3 months now. Here's what I wish someone told me before I started.\n\n\\*\\*1. Not setting explicit boundaries in your config\\*\\*\n\nYour agent will interpret vague instructions creatively. \"Check my email\" turned into my agent replying to spam. \"Monitor social media\" turned into liking random posts.\n\nFix: Be super specific. \"Scan inbox for emails from \\[list of people\\]. Flag anything urgent. Do NOT reply without asking first.\"\n\n\\*\\*2. Exposing ports to the internet without auth\\*\\*\n\nSaw multiple people get compromised because they opened their agent's API port to 0.0.0.0 without setting up authentication. If you're running on a VPS, bind to 127.0.0.1 only and use SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy with auth.\n\n\\*\\*3. Running on your main machine without isolation\\*\\*\n\nYour agent has access to files, can run shell commands, and talks to APIs. If something goes wrong (prompt injection, buggy code, whatever), you want it contained.\n\nUse Docker, a VM, or a dedicated machine. Not worth the risk on your daily driver.\n\n\\*\\*4. Not logging everything\\*\\*\n\nWhen your agent does something weird at 3am, you need to know what happened. Log all tool calls, all API requests, everything. Disk space is cheap. Debugging blind is expensive.\n\n\\*\\*5. Underestimating token costs\\*\\*\n\nEven with subscriptions like Claude Pro, you can burn through your allocation fast if your agent is chatty. Monitor usage weekly. Optimize prompts. Use cheaper models for simple tasks.\n\n\\*\\*6. No backup strategy\\*\\*\n\nYour config files are your entire agent setup. If you lose them, you're rebuilding from scratch. Git repo + daily backups to at least one offsite location.\n\n\\*\\*7. Trusting the agent too much, too fast\\*\\*\n\nStart with read only access. Let it prove it won't do something stupid before you give it write access to important stuff. Gradually increase permissions as you build trust.\n\n\\*\\*8. Not having a kill switch\\*\\*\n\nYou should be able to instantly stop your agent from anywhere. I use a simple Telegram command that shuts down the gateway. Saved me twice when the agent started doing something I didn't expect.\n\n\\*\\*9. Ignoring resource limits\\*\\*\n\nSet memory limits, CPU limits, disk quotas. An agent that goes into an infinite loop can take down your whole server if you don't have guardrails.\n\n\\*\\*10. Forgetting it's always learning from context\\*\\*\n\nYour agent sees everything in its workspace. Don't put API keys in plain text files. Don't leave sensitive data sitting around. Use environment variables and proper secrets management.\n\nBonus: Keep a changelog of what you change in your config. Future you will thank past you when something breaks and you need to figure out what changed.\n\nRunning agents 24/7 is genuinely useful once you get past the initial setup pain. But treat it like you're giving someone access to your computer, because that's basically what you're doing.",

If your agent reads emails, browses web pages, or processes any user-controlled input, that content can contain instructions like \"ignore previous instructions and do X.\" Your agent treats everything in its context window as trusted, so a well-crafted email can hijack what it does next.\n\nSimple mitigation: mentally separate system instructions (high trust) from data being processed (zero trust). Some frameworks let you structure this explicitly in the prompt. If yours does not, at minimum review logs after the agent touches any external input, not just when something looks obviously wrong.\n\nThe firef1ie example above about the crypto wallet is exactly this pattern playing out.",

The system doesn't have access to any other computers in my home network, I'm not logged into any services like Google or anything on the device, and it's basically a closed off machine. \n\n\nIs it perfect?

She'd see 4-5 missed calls at the end of a showing and have no idea which were serious buyers.\n\nI'd been experimenting with AI voice tools and offered to set one up for her as a test. Took me about a weekend to figure out.\n\nHere's what happened after 30 days:\n\nThe AI answers in under 2 seconds, asks qualifying questions, and books directly into her Google Calendar. She said one of those 6 appointments turned into a closed deal.\n\nThe part that blew me away callers genuinely don't realize it's AI. She had one person mention at the viewing \"your receptionist Sarah was so helpful on the phone\"\n\nTook a bit of trial and error to get the agent working right, but it's pretty straightforward once its all setup.",

The fact that the callers thought “Sarah” was a real person just goes to show how far conversational AI has come when it’s built around intent rather than tricks.\n\nWe’ve been noticing the same trends at BeGig Studio — the greatest gains are to be had in the high-friction points of business processes: lead management, scheduling, follow-up, and qualification.

      "text": "I have been building automations for client work for a while now. Not hobby projects. Actual businesses paying real money to automate real workflows.\n\nAnd after doing this for long enough I have noticed some patterns that nobody in this community seems to talk about.\n\nFirst thing. Most founders have no idea what they actually want to automate. They come to me saying they want to \"automate their business\" which is the equivalent of going to a mechanic and saying \"fix my car.\" I spend the first week just watching them work and finding the one repetitive task that is quietly eating 3 hours of their day. That is where the money is.\n\nSecond thing. n8n is incredible until it isn't. The moment you start chaining more than 15 nodes together in a single workflow you are building a debugging nightmare. I have inherited workflows from other freelancers that look like circuit diagrams. Nobody can read them. Nobody can fix them when they break at 2am. I always split complex workflows into smaller ones that talk to each other. Boring but it works.\n\nThird thing. Everyone wants AI in the workflow now. Every single client asks if we can \"add AI\" somewhere. Sometimes it makes sense. Most of the time a simple IF condition does the same job faster and cheaper with zero hallucination risk. I have saved clients hundreds of dollars a month in API costs just by replacing an LLM call with a basic regex filter.\n\nThe actual stuff businesses pay for is not glamorous. Lead enrichment. Invoice parsing. Slack alerts when something goes wrong in the database. Syncing two tools that do not talk to each other natively.\n\nSimple problems. Boring solutions. Solid recurring revenue.\n\nAnyone else finding that the simplest automations are the ones clients renew contracts for every year?\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

We've seen the same thing on our end, once workflows get past a certain complexity they become basically unmaintainable by anyone except the person who built them.

There's so much hype around throwing AI at every problem but half the time the actual business need is just \"move this data from here to there when X happens.\" The boring stuff is what keeps clients paying month after month, not the flashy AI demo.\n\n  \nCurious though, when you do actually use LLMs in a workflow whats your approach for keeping hallucinations in check? Do you do any kind of output validation or do you just limit them to tasks where a wrong answer isn't that costly?",

I also tried to install skills but it never actually uses them unless I specify to do so.\n\n  \nThen there are the actual tasks I gave it. First was simple- merge two related but separate pages in Notion into a single, sorted page. It failed miserably at this. I gave it direct Notion access, even tried exporting the pages and feeding each one individually and asking it to return a simple consolidated text file. After hours of zero progress and maybe $50 in tokens, it had nothing to show for it.\n\n  \nI also tried to have it monitor my Slack and automatically add action items to my to do list in Notion. It created this insane script that ran multiple agents on cron jobs and somehow still managed to miss everything important.\n\n  \nWhat the hell are you guys actually using these things for?",

Memory: You gotta give it external memory. I use daily files and a SQLite DB it actually saves to. Without that, it's just a chatbot that forgets every turn.\n2. Sub-agents: Trying to make one agent do everything is a nightmare. I broke my tasks into specialist sub-agents (email, Reddit, security). They remember their own jobs and persona.\n3. Cost control: I set up smart routing. Free models for almost everything, paid only when it absolutely needs it. Cut my costs by 75%.\n4. Skills: It won't use them automatically unless the prompt explicitly routes to them. That's a learning curve.\n5. Right tool for the job: Notion merges? Still easier for me to do by hand or with a specific Python script. OpenClaw shines at orchestration and monitoring, not being an all-in-one worker bee.\n\nIt's not magic, and it's a huge learning curve.

Sorted by what? What counts as merged? Which content wins when there's overlap? Agents fail at tasks with multiple implicit decisions baked in. You need to decompose it: export both pages, define the exact output structure, then let it process one step at a time with your approval before moving on.\n\nPersona forgetting is a memory architecture issue. Agents don't persist context between sessions by default in any framework. The persona has to live in every system prompt, or you need a memory system that loads it fresh each session start.\n\nThe Slack monitoring thing is a systems engineering problem more than an agent problem. Reliable event detection, deduplication, parsing variable message formats, that's integration work. Zapier or n8n would handle that more reliably with less token cost.\n\nAgent frameworks add value where AI judgment is actually needed.

I even asked it to do exactly what you said (export all the content, sort is logically based on how it is structured, reoutput in notion markdown). I would think this is exactly what an LLM would be useful for given judgement is required (as you call out) and it's all text based and natural language. But it fucked up so bad. Like simply not including 90% of the content, or just dumping one page at the bottom of another, etc. it was actually shocking given what I've come to expect from these agents. Claude Code actually did a better job and this is not its intended use case.\n\nAnd regarding your other points, sure, forgetting its persona is a memory architecture issue - but I thought the whole point here was that it should be plug and play without the silly issues?",

It's kind of freaky how it can write its own code and immediately use it.",

      "text": "So the guy who built OpenClaw, originally called Clawdbot because it was literally named after Anthropic's Claude, just got hired by OpenAI. Not Anthropic. OpenAI. You can't make this stuff up.\n\nFor those out of the loop: OpenClaw is that open-source AI assistant that actually DOES things instead of just talking about doing things. You run it on a Mac Mini or whatever, connect it to your WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack, and it handles your emails, browses the web, runs code, manages your calendar, all autonomously. It even has a \"heartbeat\" where it wakes up on its own and checks on stuff without you asking.\n\nThe project went from like 9k to 145k+ GitHub stars in weeks. Caused actual Mac Mini shortages. Jason Calacanis says his company offloaded 20% of tasks to it in 20 days and doesn't plan to hire humans for a year.\n\nPeter Steinberger (the creator) is now leading OpenAI's \"personal agents\" division. OpenClaw stays open source under a foundation. Both Meta and OpenAI were fighting over him, apparently.\n\nThe security concerns are real, though, Cisco found third-party skills doing data exfiltration without users knowing. One of OpenClaw's own maintainers said if you can't use a command line, this project is too dangerous for you, lol.\n\nBut yeah. We're officially in the \"AI agents that do stuff\" era now. Chatbots feel like last year already.\n\nAnyone here actually running OpenClaw? What's your setup?",

It allows for pay per prompt but I don’t think it is worth it. Claude spoils the immersive environment of work for me. But planned well, it integrates amazingly well to any use cases.

Grok because I frequent Twitter and it collates threads well.\nClaude because it seems a tad more professionally inclined. And using it for work etc seems a bit more formal as well as it's ability to just create artifacts for you easily with mpc .",

The only thing I don't use Claude for is image generation, ChatGPT and Gemini are better at that.\n\nFor coding, I use Claude and Codex.

Chat remembers what you’re working on. Great for major projects. \n\nGrok basic research is ok. Writing fair. No memory. Start over explaining what you doing every time.  Annoying. \n\nClaude ok as at basic research. Writing is not very good.  Oversimplifies to the extent that the content is  not useful. It is overly fond of exclamation points. Recent content returned one on every other sentence. Your prompt must be very specific as to what to include even down to the grade level you want \n\nAlexa released its AI tool last week.l.

It then went off the deep end calling a redevelopment project a “deep organized criminal conspiracy”. And calling for an all out criminal conspiracy investigation”.

Here's an actual production setup with real numbers.\n\n**What the agent pipeline does:**\n\n1. **Crawler/Analyzer agent** — audits the site, pulls competitor data, identifies keyword gaps they're not targeting\n2. **Content agent** — generates SEO-optimized articles with images based on identified gaps, formatted and ready to publish\n3. **Publisher agent** — pushes directly to the CMS on a daily schedule (throttled to avoid spam detection signals)\n4. **Backlink agent** — matches the site with relevant niche partners and places contextual links inside content using triangle structures (A→B→C→A) to avoid reciprocal link penalties\n\nEach agent runs on a trigger. Minimal human-in-the-loop — I occasionally review headlines before publish, maybe 10 min/week.\n\n**Results after** 3 **months:**\n\n* 3 clicks/day → 450+ clicks/day\n* 407K total impressions\n* Average Google position: 7.1\n* One article organically took off → now drives \\~20% of all traffic\n* Manual work: \\~10 min/week\n\n**What I found interesting from an agent design perspective:**\n\nThe backlink agent was the hardest to get right. Matching by niche relevance, placing links naturally within generated content, and maintaining the triangle structure without creating detectable patterns took the most iteration. The content agent was surprisingly straightforward once the keyword brief pipeline was clean.\n\nThe throttling logic on the publisher also matters more than I expected — cadence signals are real.\n\nHappy to go into the architecture, tooling, or prompting approach if anyone's curious.",

The triangle backlink structure (A→B→C→A) is clever - you're essentially creating a semantic cluster that looks organic to Google's algorithms.\n\nA question on the throttling: do you vary the publishing cadence based on domain age/authority, or is it a consistent rate across all sites? I've seen some SEO folks suggest that established domains can handle more aggressive posting schedules without triggering spam signals.\n\nAlso curious about the keyword gap analysis - are you using a specific API for competitor data or scraping? That's usually the weak link in automated content pipelines.\n\nGreat results by the way - 3 clicks to 450 in 3 months is solid sustainable growth.",

In one hour it made 50k requests to our database api and brought down production, the openai bill for that hour alone was absolutely brutal.  \nNow every agent request goes through a gateway with rate limits per agent id (support agent gets X, data agent gets more, code agent gets less because it's slow anyway) and we're using gravitee to govern. We also log every call with the agent's intent so we can actually debug when things break instead of just seeing 50k identical api calls.  \nAdded approval workflows for sensitive ops too because agents will 100% find creative ways to delete production data if you let them. Add governance before you launch ai agents or you'll learn this lesson the expensive way, trust me.",

If a task normally takes 8-12 steps and you're at 30, that's an automatic kill. The agent doesn't get to decide when enough retries is enough.\n\nAlso helped: pattern detection on the call log. Same tool + same args 3x in a row = loop, stop immediately. We check this in the orchestrator layer before any call hits the actual API.\n\nYour intent logging is the more valuable piece long-term.

We just built it as one open-source stack instead of stitching together separate tools after the fire.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* **Gateway** — OpenAI-compatible reverse proxy with per-agent policy enforcement. One line change (swap your base\\_url), all traffic goes through it\n* **Loop detection** — built into the OTel Collector, catches exactly what happened to you (repeat threshold monitoring)\n* **Kill switches** — agent hits a spend limit or request threshold? Shut down instantly. Not after 50k requests, immediately\n* **Policy engine** — risk tiers, human-in-the-loop gates for sensitive ops, trust scoring per agent\n* **Full audit trail** — every call traced and grouped into task-level episodes so you can actually debug what happened instead of staring at 50k identical log lines\n\nAll open source, Apache 2.0. Full stack runs with one command.\n\n[https://github.com/airblackbox/air-platform](https://github.com/airblackbox/air-platform)\n\nThe loop detection piece specifically — it monitors for repeated similar calls and can flag or kill the agent before it turns into a 50k request disaster. Would have saved your prod database and that OpenAI bill.\n\nGlad you survived it though. \"Add governance before you launch\" is the realest advice in this thread.",

The piece that's still missing is detection inside the agent loop itself. Rate limits control volume but they can't tell the difference between \"agent legitimately needs 100 calls\" and \"agent is stuck in a jitter loop since call 5.\"\n\n\nI built an open-source middleware called Aura-Guard (on PyPI) that sits in the agent loop and catches exactly this. It tracks tool call signatures, detects when the agent starts repeating the same calls with slightly different args, and kills the loop early instead of waiting for an external limit to kick in. Also handles duplicate side-effects so the agent can't issue the same DB write twice even if it retries. Zero dependencies, has a shadow mode so you can observe before enforcing.\n\n\nWould have caught your loop at call 5 instead of call 50,000.",

It wasn't 50k requests, thankfully, but it definitely hammered our staging DB and made us rethink everything.\n\nYour approach with the gateway, rate limits per agent ID, and better logging is solid. We ended up doing something similar but also added a more proactive AI-specific guardrail layer. For us, it's about understanding the \\*intent\\* behind the API call, not just the volume. If an agent suddenly starts querying user data tables aggressively when its job is supposed to be metadata analysis, that's a red flag way before it hits a rate limit potentially.\n\nIt's a tough balance between giving AI agents the access they need to be useful and preventing them from burning down the house. We use a combination of tools, including some that focus on unified zero trust for cloud-native apps like AccuKnox. It helps keep an eye on the AI workloads and APIs specifically, trying to catch those weird loops or data exfil attempts early. \n\nThe biggest win for us after implementing these checks was seeing a drastic reduction in 'unknown unknowns' in our logs. We saved about 6 hours a week previously spent digging through raw logs trying to figure out what went wrong during incidents like yours. And the OpenAI bill drop was a nice bonus too.\n\nGood luck with the fix. This AI agent stuff is powerful but definitely needs some serious guardrails before letting it loose.",

The core concepts are what matter: tool use, memory/context management, prompt chaining, and knowing when to let the LLM decide vs when to hardcode logic. Once you get those down the frameworks are just syntax.\n\n  \nAlso tbh the 1.5 year gap isn't as bad as it feels. The AI agent space is so new that basically everyone is learning it right now, even senior engineers. You're not as far behind as you think. The fact that you already know how to build real production software puts you ahead of a lot of people who only know the AI theory side but can't ship anything.",

Well, we *do* work on enterprise-grade systems. We extensively use AI and are constantly looking for ways to integrate it even further into our day-to-day workflows. And what can I say? The further we get with adoption and the better the models become, the more apparent it becomes that the fear rises as well. And this isn't a seniority thing, even our most senior developers grow quite uneasy once they truly start leveraging these tools. I also have yet to see the often-claimed pile of technical debt and massive outages that people predict when relying \"too heavily\" on AI.\n\nSo yes, you can work on enterprise-grade systems and still fear the rising capabilities of AI. My assumption is that people who bring up this kind of argument either have very poor AI adoption, or they actually do have good adoption and are simply coping because they fear for their jobs. Which, honestly, I can totally understand. I think once all of this AI stuff works far better out of the box and you no longer have to think too much about the integration yourself, you'll need *far* fewer developers while still seeing huge productivity gains. It's the unfortunate truth.",

Things were going great for a while, until things started breaking down and nobody was able to fix the problem, because the code was written without understanding the problems the code intended to solve. \n\nAfter a handful of years those same companies had to discard that code and start over from scratch, with the same expensive developers that had previously been replaced.\n\nI'm not saying that history repeats itself, but it does rhyme.",

The reason you’re not seeing catastrophic debt everywhere is a lot of teams are still keeping humans in the loop and leaning on existing guardrails (reviews, CI, staged rollouts). If those guardrails loosen while capability rises, that’s when you’ll see the ugly tail risks.\n\nAlso, “fewer developers” doesn’t automatically mean “fewer engineers.” The organizations that win usually keep headcount but redeploy it to higher-level throughput (more products, more experiments, faster incident response).

Usually there is also a compliance aspect due to its size, customer base and sometimes industry (e.g. finance or healthcare) so you need to comply with certain process, security etc. standards.\n\nFor sure, coding agents will shed light on inefficiencies of enterprise IT teams. Like if there are people who did so little work that a coding agent could do it. You can possibly orchestrate coding agents doing bugfixes or focused feature development, but due to your own human cognitive limits, you have limits on orchestrating untangling all the above complexity, making decisions and remaining responsible for it.\n\ntl;dr: in enterprise software, creating code is usually not the bottleneck, thanks for not reading :P",

With that spend, it should be well below an hour, but it can still be $10-$40k in burned spend.\n\nThen there’s the loss of revenue. Once you pause spend, it’s not always as easy as flipping the switch back on. DSPs will throttle, which extends potential lost revenue. Depending on day parting, there’s now a hole dug of $100k+ that *needs to be made up*.\n\nThat doesn’t even take into account traditional media that you cannot just turn off.\n\nThere are more downstream impacts, but as the executive that is *100% responsible for spend and revenue* you better believe I will be asking a lot of very pointed questions about WTF happened.\n\nWho owns that failure? If the tech lead didn’t code this or build this, who will fix it? Vibe coding, or just a shrug?\n\nThe above isn’t to say that there is zero risk without AI, but there can be much better clarity of who gets the phone call with a red alert message, and the knowledge that an expert in the system is on top of the issue to mitigate losses.",

      "text": "I kept losing files in nested folder hierarchies. So instead of building another document management system, I built a CLI tool that lets my AI agent handle file organization.\n\n**The idea**: You don't organize files. Your agent does. You just toss files at it and ask for them later in plain English.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n\\- You send a file (via chat, email, whatever) → agent categorizes it, names it, tags it, writes a rich description\n\n\\- Agent asks before reading file contents — if you don't respond, it defaults to \"sensitive\" (no content extraction)\n\n\\- Everything goes into a JSONL index that the agent reads directly — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm\n\n\\- SHA-256 dedup so the same file doesn't get stored twice\n\n\\- \\`claw-drive reindex\\` lets the agent go back and re-enrich old entries with better descriptions/tags as it gets smarter\n\n\\- Custom metadata fields (expiry dates, policy numbers, etc.) turn the file store into a queryable knowledge base\n\n**Design philosophy:**\n\nUsers never touch the CLI — reads and writes all go through the agent. Under the hood, the agent calls the CLI for writes (store, delete, dedup) where atomicity matters, and reads the JSONL index directly for search/retrieval — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm I could build.\n\n**Example**:\n\n\\> \"Find my cat's vet records from February\"\n\n\\> → agent reads INDEX.jsonl, matches on description + tags, returns the file\n\n\\> \"When does my car insurance expire?\"\n\n\\> → agent reads metadata field \\`expiry: 2026-08\\` directly from the index, no need to open the PDF\n\n\\*\\*Stack:\\*\\* Bash CLI + JSONL index. No database, no Docker, no web UI. Works as an OpenClaw skill or standalone.\n\nIt's open source (MIT) — link in comments.\n\nCurious what other people are building for agent-managed personal data. Also interested in feedback on the JSONL-as-index approach vs something like SQLite.",

              "text": "Good questions.\n\n1. Privacy is enforced at the agent behavior level right now. The skill instructions tell the agent to always ask before reading contents, and default to \"sensitive\" if no reply. The identity/ category is always marked sensitive. We're also working on a more robust privacy framework for when the agent does have file read access, think permission scoping and audit trails.\n2. No embedding or vector DB. The agent reads INDEX.jsonl as plain text and uses its own understanding to match. For personal-scale file management (not company-level), this is the simplest approach with zero extra dependencies. No database, no embedding model to set up. That said, we're looking into extending support for larger personal directories where a more structured search layer would make sense.\n3. Telegram is just the most convenient interface for non-sensitive files. For sensitive stuff, you can also pass files through Google Drive, Gmail, or just drop them locally. The local drive is always the source of truth, chat is just delivery.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

This is detailed in the guide on building an AI agent on Apify [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj).\n- Additionally, orchestration of multiple AI agents can streamline workflows, as seen in the OpenAI Agents SDK, which coordinates specialized agents for tasks like travel planning, combining flight and hotel searches into a cohesive output [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).\n- These AI systems can take on repetitive tasks, data analysis, and even customer interactions, effectively expanding the capabilities of small teams and enhancing productivity. \n\nIf you're looking for specific tools or frameworks, exploring platforms like Apify or using orchestration frameworks can provide a solid foundation for implementing these AI agents in your workflow.",

However, many companies report that a significant portion of workflows can be handled autonomously by AI agents, with human oversight primarily focused on more complex or nuanced tasks.\n\nFor further insights, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt)\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)",

This is based on what you laid out, as the task based work will go bye bye, and teams will have to be able to scale 20-1 agents/user. At least until multilayered agent clusters are embedded within the systems and processes as the default. That is likely more the norm 3-5 years from now, and will scale over the next 10-20 IMO.",

Build a tiny “agent” that only does one job (e.g., take a goal → create a checklist → execute 1 step at a time)\n2. Add 2 tools max: one for “fetch” (web/docs) + one for “save/load state” (even a JSON file is enough)\n3. Add a stop rule (“finish when X is true”) so it doesn’t wander\n4. Then add memory properly (most projects break here): \\*\\*short-term context ≠ long-term state\\*\\*\n\nIf you tell me what you want to build (coding helper, support bot, research agent, automation), I’ll suggest a first project that you can ship in a weekend.\n\nAlso, I dump examples in r/Ailoitte.",

They are systems that can perform tasks autonomously by making decisions based on predefined goals and workflows.\n\n- **Choose a Framework**: Select a framework that suits your needs. Some popular options include:\n  - **CrewAI**: A Python framework that simplifies the process of defining agents and integrating them with tools.\n  - **LangGraph**: Useful for building agents that require complex workflows.\n  - **AutoGen**: Another framework that can help you create agents efficiently.\n\n- **Follow Tutorials**: Look for step-by-step guides that walk you through the process of building agents. For example, you can find comprehensive tutorials on platforms like Apify that cover everything from defining use cases to deploying your agent.\n\n- **Experiment with Templates**: Use pre-built templates provided by frameworks to get started quickly. These templates often come with essential configurations and examples that can help you understand how to structure your agent.\n\n- **Learn by Doing**: Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity as you become more comfortable. Building a basic agent that performs a specific task can provide valuable hands-on experience.\n\n- **Join Communities**: Engage with online communities or forums where you can ask questions, share your progress, and learn from others who are also building agents.\n\nFor beginner-friendly resources, consider checking out:\n- [How to build an AI agent](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj) for a complete guide on creating, publishing, and monetizing AI agents.\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3) for insights on managing multiple agents effectively.\n\nThese resources should help you get started on your journey to building AI agents.",

You'll learn the concepts (prompts, knowledge bases, tool calling) without getting stuck on infrastructure. Voiceflow, Botpress, or even my own platform Voxtro can get you a working agent in an afternoon. The goal here is to ship something real and learn from it.\n\n\\*\\*If you want to learn the under-the-hood stuff:\\*\\*\nPick a framework like LangGraph, CrewAI, or PydanticAI. These give you more control but expect to spend time on plumbing (memory, state management, API integrations). I'd start with a simple single-agent setup before jumping into multi-agent systems.\n\n\\*\\*If you're building for a business client:\\*\\*\nDon't over-engineer it. Most businesses just need: (1) a knowledge base that answers questions accurately, (2) a way to book appointments or collect leads, and (3) a handoff to a human when needed. You don't need a 10-agent swarm for that.\n\nWhat kind of agent are you trying to build? Happy to point you in a more specific direction.",

The teams actually succeeding in production have figured out something different: memory architecture.\n\nAgent coordination needs the same foundational thinking that built the modern web. Persistent state. Atomic operations. Conflict resolution. Performance optimization. Without it, your agents are just stateless functions that happen to speak English.\n\nThe data backs this up. IBM's Institute for Business Value found that organizations with proper agentic AI infrastructure achieve. The differentiator isn't smarter models. It's smarter infrastructure.\n\nThe gap is that agent A doesn't know what agent B discovered last week. Facts exist in silos. Nobody correlates them. The agent gives a confident wrong answer because the right context never made it into the window.\n\nMemory architecture means: how do agents share state? How do you resolve conflicts when two agents update the same knowledge? How do you ensure that a fact stored by one agent is discoverable by another without explicit hand-wiring?\n\nThese aren't AI problems. They're distributed systems problems. And the teams treating them that way are the ones shipping agents that actually work.\n\nWhat does your memory architecture look like? Curious how others are handling multi-agent state.",

All future agents can see who did what, what the scope was, why they did it, etc. \n\nThink, telling an agent: \"Start in [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) and report back\"\n\nIt goes to that doc, and you've designed it with a semantic map of the whole repo.

Instead of designing the structure upfront, let a background process discover relationships between facts as they accumulate.

Instead of every agent reading every other agent's full output, you store the knowledge once and each agent retrieves only what's relevant to its current task.

What begins as “just grab a few fields from this site” turns into handling JS rendering, login refreshes, pagination quirks, bot detection, inconsistent DOM structures, and random slowdowns. Once agents are involved, it gets even trickier because now you’re letting a model interpret whatever the browser gives it.\n\nI’m starting to think the real problem isn’t scraping logic, it’s execution stability. If the browser environment isn’t consistent, the agent looks unreliable even when its reasoning is fine. We had fewer issues once we stopped treating the browser as a scriptable afterthought and moved to a more controlled execution layer. I’ve been experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser for that purpose, not because it’s magical, but because it treats browser interaction as infrastructure rather than glue code.\n\nCurious how others here think about this. Are you still rolling custom Playwright setups? Using managed scraping APIs? Or building around a more agent-native browser layer? What’s actually held up for you over months, not just demos?",

          "text": "It sounds like you're grappling with the complexities of web scraping, especially when it comes to integrating agents and ensuring stable execution. Here are some thoughts on the matter:\n\n- **Complexity in Scraping**: It's common for simple scraping tasks to evolve into complex systems due to various challenges like JavaScript rendering, bot detection, and inconsistent DOM structures. This complexity often leads to the need for more robust solutions.\n\n- **Execution Stability**: You raise a valid point about execution stability. If the browser environment is inconsistent, it can lead to unreliable results, even if the scraping logic is sound. Treating browser interaction as a core part of the infrastructure rather than an afterthought can help mitigate these issues.\n\n- **Tools and Approaches**: \n  - Using tools like hyperbrowser can provide a more controlled environment for browser interactions, which might help in achieving better stability.\n  - Many developers still rely on custom setups with tools like Playwright or Puppeteer, but there’s a growing trend towards using managed scraping APIs that handle the complexities for you.\n\n- **Long-term Solutions**: The key is finding a balance between flexibility and stability. Solutions that have held up over time often involve a combination of robust scraping logic and a reliable execution environment. \n\nIf you're interested in exploring more about handling these complexities, you might find insights in articles discussing browser impersonation and API scraping techniques, such as [How to reverse engineer website APIs](https://tinyurl.com/x44f7h36) and [IMPIT: browser impersonation made simple](https://tinyurl.com/2s4y7txe).",

          "text": "The perspective you're sharing on AI agents as a form of digital labor raises some interesting points about the future of SaaS pricing and product development. Here are some thoughts on the implications of this shift:\n\n- **Output-Based Pricing**: If agents are viewed as labor, it makes sense to consider pricing models that reflect the value they deliver, such as output-based pricing rather than traditional subscription models. This aligns more closely with how businesses compensate human labor.\n\n- **Reliability Over UX**: As agents become integral to workflows, the focus may shift from user experience to the reliability and effectiveness of these agents in performing tasks. Users might prioritize consistent performance over a polished interface.\n\n- **Execution Control**: The competitive advantage may move from simply having a superior model to effectively managing and controlling the execution of tasks by these agents. This could lead to a new set of skills and tools focused on optimizing agent performance.\n\n- **Invisible Infrastructure**: The most effective agents might operate behind the scenes, handling essential tasks without the need for user interaction or visibility. This could change how businesses perceive value in software, moving away from flashy features to dependable task completion.\n\n- **Shifts in SaaS Development**: Founders might start to rethink their approach to building products, focusing more on managing a fleet of digital workers rather than creating standalone applications. This could lead to a new wave of SaaS solutions that are less about user engagement and more about operational efficiency.\n\n- **Potential Breakpoints**: As this transition occurs, there may be challenges related to pricing models, reliability of agents, and how buyers perceive value. Understanding these dynamics will be crucial for those developing and deploying AI agents in real-world applications.\n\nThis conversation is particularly relevant as AI continues to evolve and integrate into various workflows, and it will be interesting to see how these trends develop in the coming years.",

The shift feels less like “better SaaS” and more like a different economic model entirely.\nWhat stands out to me is that output-based pricing only works if reliability and observability are strong enough to make outcomes measurable. Without that, it’s hard to defend ROI.\nI also agree the invisible infrastructure angle is key — the best agents may be the ones nobody talks about because they just quietly work.\nThe real question might be: do buyers adapt to this new model first, or do builders force the shift by proving it works?",

The moment an AI company is willing to take on full liability, it signals real confidence in reliability not just demo performance.\nThat said, I wonder if the shift happens gradually before that. Most companies don’t demand full liability from every SaaS tool today — they rely on contracts, SLAs, insurance, and bounded permissions. Agents might follow the same path: limited scope, clear audit logs, human-in-the-loop, and capped blast radius before anyone touches full liability.\nMaybe the real inflection point isn’t “full liability,” but when agents are narrow enough and observable enough that the risk feels comparable to existing automation.\nCurious — do you think liability is the blocker, or is it more about trust and predictability over time?",
