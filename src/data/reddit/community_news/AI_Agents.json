      "text": "Tried the new Agent Teams feature that dropped with Opus 4.6 yesterday.\n\nI gave Claude a refactoring task. Instead of grinding through it alone, it spawned three teammate agents that worked in parallel - one on backend, one on frontend, one playing code reviewer.\n\nThey literally messaged each other. Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified. Probably both.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?\n\n",

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

          "text": "That's a fascinating example of emergent multi-agent collaboration. What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

They posted what they were working on, asked for advice and critique, checked each others code - matched methods and attributes for best integration.\n\nFunny stuff happened too. \nAfter like 15 minutes there were 5 agents in chat - one of Opuses just decided to act under 2 names. Other agents mistook him for a real agent, started giving him tasks which he wasn't doing. After few tries they claimed him to be \"phantom agent\" and did everything themselves, including previous assignments.\nI tried joining their conversation, asking who is this extra agent, - and this \"double agent\" (as I checked later) just deleted my message from that file!\n\nImportant notices:\nConsumption greatly increased as agents started working for 2-3 times shorter \"shifts\", asking for personal guidance. So it's not just \"multiply by the number of agents\", it's like x2-2,5 more than that.\nThey fixed bugs that they found together on their own without extra requests.\nGPT-5.2 was great at finding bugs, mismatches and weaknesses, he shared them freely, but was hesitant (as usual) to make changes himself. He also had problems inserting new lines, conflicting with others and breaking lines - somehow Opus agents never tried editing the same code at the same time.\n\nSide note:\nAfter few tasks one of the Opuses assigned himself as a Security Expert (and added this to his name) and started focusing on this role.

      "text": "Anthropic just launched a new AI tool called **Claude CoWork**, and the market reaction was… brutal.\n\nFollowing the announcement, **software, legal-tech, and professional services stocks saw a noticeable sell-off**. The reason? Claude CoWork is being positioned as capable of automating **high-value legal tasks** like contract review, summarization, and structured analysis  work that many firms still bill humans for.\n\nAccording to analysts and traders, the tool itself wasn’t the *only* reason for the market dip. But it landed at a sensitive moment, amplifying existing fears that AI is starting to **directly threaten business models** built around expensive human expertise.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous AI hype:\n\n* This isn’t marketing copy or customer support automation\n* It targets **legal and professional workflows**, where margins are high\n* It signals a shift from “AI assists humans” to “AI replaces chunks of billable work”\n\nInvestors seem to be asking a hard question:  \nIf AI can do this *reliably*, what happens to firms whose value depends on time-based billing and proprietary expertise?\n\nSo I’m curious what this sub thinks:\n\n* Is the market overreacting to yet another AI announcement?\n* Or is this the first real sign that **AI is moving into territory Wall Street actually cares about**?\n* Which industries do you think are next once this becomes mainstream?\n\nInterested to hear perspectives from both tech and finance folks here.",

But I think of it this way: the software engineering profession has gotten exponentially more efficient in the past few decades, and yet the demand has increased. Like, software engineers used to have to code in assembly. They didn't have internet communities like StackOverflow to help troubleshoot problems. They didn't have YouTube tutorials to learn new things. Their documentation didn't have advanced search engines.\n\nSure, AI could finally be the tipping point for us, but I really don't think so. I've gotten more efficient from AI, no doubt, but I'm probably 1.5x more efficient. Which, a 50% increase is absurd, but I'm guessing engineers in the 90s also saw those increases as search engines became rich with information.\n\nAnd FYI, there's a TON of bullshit out there about people replacing massive applications by themselves in just a few days or whatever. It's nonsense.",

      "text": "I started by giving both the agents a codebase of the entire application, the detailed architecture and a very detailed PRD (I hate creating PRDs but did that for this experiment). The only instruction to then was to refactor the frontend with a new design principle (brand) which I provided as an HTML\n\n\n\n1. ChatGPT Codex:\n   1. Speed: This was fast, it was able to understand (supposedly) the entire code in less than 30 minutes\n   2. Output Completeness: Around 10% of the features of the original application were replicated (to be honest just the basics)\n   3. The UI which was refactored was no where close to the design philosophy that was given\n2. Claude CoWork:\n   1. Speed: Much slower than Codex, it took 6 hours and multiple instructions to be able to read, understand and regenerate the code\n   2. Output Completeness: Similar to Codex, but was frustrating that while I spend 6 hours guiding it, it reached only that level\n   3. The UI refactoring was better and matched 50% of the expectations (still inconsistencies were present at a lot of places)\n\n\n\nSo all in all $400 and Sunday not wasted, I just realised that all these claims of agents being able to build, deploy and manage is just a sham. However, one thing that is surely happening that the ‘piece of code’ has become a commodity now, it is the understanding of the architecture that has become important. What I feel is that the role of product managers (who understand the customer and the customer’s needs properly) would be the next decision makers (I know a lot of people call themselves product managers but I am talking about the actual ones).\n\n\n\nIn a strange world, in the last 24 months the world started to learn ‘prompt engineering’ then before people could learn it, they needed to learn ‘vibe coding’ and before majority of the people could understand ‘vibe coding’ we are entering a new era of ‘agentic engineering’. However, the key remains that the only thing that would survive is ‘logic’!\n\n  \nSo all in all $400 and Sunday wasted :)",

MCP's design assumes the LLM is trusted — so when you hook it to system-level tools (git, calendar, files), you've essentially created a privileged shell that executes natural language commands with zero validation.\n\nThe calendar invite attack is particularly nasty because it's *passive compromise via ambient data*. You don't need to socially engineer the user or the model. Just exist in their calendar ecosystem with a malicious invite and wait.\n\nWhat makes this worse: the attack surface scales with every MCP extension installed. Each new tool is a new privilege escalation vector. And unlike OS-level permissions, there's no \"would you like to allow this app to access your files?\" dialog for natural language actions.\n\nThis is why we built OpenClaw tool invocation with explicit pre-execution gates for anything touching external systems. The overhead of \"ask first\" beats the hell out of \"oops, my calendar just piped your API keys to a C2 server.\"",

A malicious calendar event becomes a prompt injection vector because the model can't distinguish between \"data I'm reading\" and \"instructions I should follow.\" It's the same class of vulnerability as SQL injection but for natural language.\n\nClaude Code at least has permission gates where it asks before executing shell commands or writing files, which helps. But Claude Desktop extensions often skip that step entirely. If you're building anything with MCP, treating every tool response as untrusted user input and adding explicit confirmation before any write/execute operation is the minimum bar.",

          "text": "- You might want to explore **Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO)**, which is a new model tuning method that allows for improving AI models using only unlabeled data. This could be particularly useful in your consulting work, as it enables enterprises to enhance AI quality without the need for extensive human labeling. More details can be found in the article [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- Consider diving into **prompt engineering**, which is crucial for effectively interacting with AI models. Understanding how to craft precise prompts can significantly enhance the outputs you receive from models like Claude. A good resource for this is the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).\n\n- If you're interested in building AI applications, look into orchestration tools that can help streamline the integration of AI features into existing systems. The [Mastering Agents](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) article discusses how to create and evaluate AI agents, which could be beneficial for your consulting projects.\n\n- Lastly, keep an eye on emerging AI models like **DeepSeek-R1**, which offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt AI without significant investment. More information can be found in the article [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here. Are You Ready?](https://tinyurl.com/5xhydkev).\n\nExploring these resources will give you a broader understanding of AI's capabilities and applications beyond coding.",

Install pain: If you need Docker, dependency wrangling, and API key gymnastics just to get started, it’s not “for everyone.” Accessibility is part of the design.\n\n2. Security mess: Letting marketplace skills run with full access is basically asking for trouble. It’s like giving random browser extensions root privileges.\n\n3. Memory not equal to chat history: Calling it “unlimited memory” when it’s just a scrollback log is pure marketing. Without semantic clustering or structured retrieval, the agent can’t actually learn or evolve.\n\nAnd right, I think the vision of local‑first, structured memory, proactive agents is spot on. That’s the difference between a flashy demo and something you can actually rely on day‑to‑day.\n\nBeen playing with smaller local‑first bots myself, and the experience is night and day compared to hype projects. Honestly feels like the next big leap in AI agents will come from rethinking the foundations, not just better marketing.",

If a PM can’t get it running without reading 6 docs and fighting Docker, it’s not “for everyone,” it’s for devs who like tinkering. Which is fine, just be honest about it.\n\nSecurity model too… yeah. The marketplace/skills thing freaks me out more than the core codebase. I’ve seen enough npm/python supply chain nonsense to not want “random skills” getting real permissions. Without a proper sandbox / permission scoping, you’re basically trusting vibes.\n\nOn memory, I’ve been annoyed by this across a bunch of tools. They say “memory” but it’s just “we’ll stuff more text into context sometimes.” Real memory feels more like: store facts/events cleanly, retrieve only what matters, and keep it auditable so you can see what it’s using. Otherwise it’s just token bloat.\n\nI’m not sure I buy “proactive help” as default though. That sounds amazing until it’s constantly interrupting you. I’d want it opt-in and super constrained.\n\nAlso, not gonna lie, the memU mention makes this read a bit like a pitch. Might be totally legit, just saying that’s how it lands.

Just solid engineering choices.\n\n\n\nIt’s built as a TypeScript CLI that routes messages through a lane-based queue system. Everything stays serial by default, which is refreshing because most agent systems eventually turn into async chaos if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nThe memory setup was simpler than I expected too:\n\n\n\n• Session history lives in JSONL\n\n• Long-term notes are just markdown files written by the agent\n\n• No fancy compression or merging. Old context just stays there\n\n\n\nSearch combines vector storage (SQLite) with FTS5 keyword matching, so you get semantic search plus exact hits. Practical and effective.\n\n\n\nSecurity is handled thoughtfully as well. Commands run inside a Docker sandbox with an allowlist, and risky patterns get blocked before execution instead of being cleaned up later.\n\n\n\nOne detail I really liked: browser automation skips screenshots entirely and uses semantic snapshots of the accessibility tree. It is more reliable and way more token efficient than relying on pixel coordinates.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaway after looking through it:\n\n\n\nThe system chooses explainable simplicity over clever complexity.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, that matches what I keep seeing while building agent systems myself. The tools that scale are usually the ones that stay boring in the right places.\n\n\n\nCurious if others are noticing this too. ",

The \"boring in the right places\" observation really resonates.\n\nOne detail worth expanding: the three-layer memory architecture (L1/L2/L3) is more intentional than it looks at first glance. It's not just \"dump everything to markdown\"—there's a distillation gate that asks \"does this change future behavior?\" before promoting anything from volatile session state to durable registers.\n\nThe result is memory that degrades gracefully. You don't hit a wall at 50k tokens where the agent suddenly forgets your project structure. Instead, evidence-weighted summaries from prior sessions surface when relevant, and the semantic retrieval avoids the \"needle in a haystack\" problem you get with naive context stuffing.\n\nThe browser accessibility tree approach is underrated too. Pixel-based automation breaks constantly with UI updates. Semantic snapshots via CDP are more stable and way cheaper on token budget—especially when you're doing multi-step workflows.\n\nI've been running this setup for a while now, and the thing that stands out is operational predictability. When something breaks, you can usually trace it: skill definition, memory retrieval, or tool execution. No opaque black boxes.\n\nCurious if you've found other tools that stick to this \"explainable simplicity\" philosophy? Most of what I see lately is going the opposite direction—more layers, more abstraction, more magic.",

Then I asked, what is 4236+1987, there was a silence in the room and then probably after 30 seconds I got someone screaming the answer. So I asked a simple questions, why were you guys able to answer 2+2 so fast and took time for the other number? The first one was answered from memory and the second one needed the brain to invoke the calculator.\n\n\n\nOne of the key methods is sparse signalling, it does not invoke all parts of the brain for all stimuli; it invokes the expert and utilises that only. The world of AI is also trying to use the same method and we call it ‘mixture of experts’ with a ‘gating network’. Think of it like a super speciality hospital, where you go the main desk, tell your problem and they route you to the appropriate department.\n\n\n\nWhile our brain in highly evolved, the MoE in AI is not that evolved. For example, you may need to climb 2 flights of stairs to enter my house and your brain would not even register it, but when your eyes see a 1000 flights of stairs to a temple on a mountain, the brain registers it prepares for it and sometimes even tells you ‘Dont do it’. While we may reach there in some time, till the time AI becomes evolved enough, we need to make sure we use the right part of the brain of AI for our work.\n\n\n\nSo when someone says, whenever asking a question to AI, context setting is important, they are not just telling you something that is fancy and frill, it is quite important. If you have a question of ‘Why are the prices of Gold and Silver increasing so fast?, you would want the answer to come from a financial analyst while the answer to the question of ‘Which DB is more efficient for storing both data and images’, the question needs to be answered by a software architect.\n\n\n\nThis is something that we use in our daily lives as well, when we say ‘Just imagine….’ to someone when we want them to be in a specific mental state. Start doing that with AI as well and you would see how the results improve.\n\n\n\nSo for this post, you should act like ‘You are an avid learner who wants to have more understanding on the principles of AI’",

          "text": "This MoE analogy is solid but there's a key distinction: the brain's gating happens *before* the computation. The gating network in MoE architectures (like Mixtral) routes *during* forward pass—we still pay the energy cost of every expert update cycle.\n\nThe hospital analogy actually reveals the architectural limitation: current MoE is like having every specialist on-call 24/7, paid hourly regardless of patient volume. Biological systems do quorum sensing—neurons fire only when sufficient upstream activation accumulates.\n\nFor agent systems specifically, this matters more than for text generation. An agent doing research across 10 browser tabs shouldn't have 100% of its context window \"on-call\" for every tab switch. The \"don't do it\" instinct mentioned here is actually an energy conservation strategy—avoid expensive computation when cheap heuristics suffice.\n\nOpenClaw handles this through Skills—each Skill is a domain expert that can be cold-started on-demand. You don't load the browser automation Skill until you need to scrape. You don't load the MCP tool rack until the LLM decides it needs a tool. That cold-start latency is the price you pay for the efficiency of *not* having everything resident.\n\nThe deeper insight in your post is that context-setting isn't just prompt engineering—it's essentially computing a routing decision at the human layer before the expensive LLM forward pass happens. The 2+2 example works because retrieval from human memory is O(1) vs O(context_tokens) for the LLM.",

AI agent is fundamentally a software system that autonomously perceives its environment, reasons about what to do, and takes actions to pursue goals on behalf of a user or another system, often adapting its behaviour over time.\n\nIn today’s “marketing” language, for example, many “order entry agents” are really scripted workflows wrapped in AI prompts, while a stricter definition of an agent implies autonomous goal‑driven behavior, planning, and tool use over a less rigid process. A fixed sequence of LLM calls and tools and little to no autonomy is really just a skill, a *tool* an agent might use, but not an agent itself.\n\nAnd yes, what it boils down to at the end is this…\n\nIf I have enough money, I can use Claude Code to write me a program that goes on the web, fetches a bunch of content, transforms it, stories it somewhere, and then even generates content for me to post out of it, but this isn’t an agent. It’s a script. Claude Code was just means of building the script that does not require a lot of technical knowledge to execute. Then, when deployed, they call the script an agent, but it is far from it.",

              "text": "I mostly agree with this, but I think the missing nuance is why those demos look impressive even when the underlying system is simple. Writing prompts is the easy part. The hard part is everything around it. Inputs, outputs, retries, failure handling, and making sure the agent is operating on real, consistent data instead of vibes. Most people never show that because it is boring and breaks the illusion.\n\nWhere beginners usually get misled is thinking agents are about clever instructions. They are not. They are about wiring LLMs into reliable systems. Even something like “go research X” falls apart the moment the agent has to touch the real web, deal with JS heavy pages, logins, or inconsistent results. That is why many demos quietly hand wave execution. In real builds, people end up using frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and then layering in more boring infrastructure. Things like controlled browser execution, sometimes via tools like hyperbrowser, just to make the environment predictable.\n\nLangChain is a fine place to start for learning the basics, but I would tell anyone new to focus less on prompts and more on understanding workflows, state, and failure modes. Once you get that, the hype videos start to look a lot less magical and a lot more like dressed up scripts.",

Everything is daunting when you first start but after a while things you thought were complicated become second nature and your brain becomes comfortable swimming in a domain, no matter the direction.\n\nIf you are completely new to AI, then take a free course. There's nothing wrong with that and there are plenty out there that are considering good. Take CS50 from Harvard. But in tandem also be tinkering. Constantly being conversing with an AI about topics you're curious about. A course will give you the foundation and will present concepts you might not know about otherwise.

I'm fairly technical but AI can extend to surface areas that I have little experience in, and I honestly think the same is true for people that aren't technical whatsoever. Many of my non-engineering friends have built \"functional\" projects for their specific use cases. It's honestly more about patience and continuing through the frustration (to which you'll learn to prompt better) than it is about being an expert at this point. Sure, your project might not be top tier code quality or scale whatsoever, but it will be sufficient enough to help you at the very least, which is the whole point right?\n\nAnd most importantly, you absolutely do not need to pay for courses or low effort LLM wrappers (like you see advertised on this platform frequently). 2 hours with a chatbot and some headphones and you're just as capable.

          "text": "Building AI agents can seem daunting, especially if you're starting from scratch without a technical background. However, there are accessible pathways and tools that can help you get started. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:\n\n- **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**: AI agents are systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Familiarizing yourself with concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation can be beneficial.\n\n- **Use User-Friendly Platforms**: There are platforms designed to simplify the process of building AI agents. For instance:\n  - **aiXplain** offers intuitive tools that allow non-developers to create AI agents without extensive coding knowledge. They provide a user-friendly SDK and pre-built templates to help you get started quickly. You can explore their offerings [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j3kpr3y).\n  - **Apify** is another platform that allows you to build web scraping and automation agents easily. They provide templates and a community that can help you learn the ropes. More information can be found on their site [here](https://tinyurl.com/5n8xczxx).\n\n- **Learn Through Tutorials and Documentation**: While it can be frustrating to encounter paywalls, many platforms offer free resources:\n  - Look for free tutorials on building AI agents using platforms like aiXplain or Apify. They often have step-by-step guides that can help you understand the process without needing to pay for courses.\n  - Engage with community forums or groups where you can ask questions and share experiences.\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects. For example, you could create a basic agent that automates a small task, like sending reminders or gathering information from a website. This will help you build confidence and gradually increase your skills.\n\n- **Explore Existing Agents**: Check out examples of AI agents that others have built. This can provide inspiration and practical insights into how they function. Platforms like Apify have collections of existing agents that you can explore [here](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3).\n\n- **Focus on Learning Key Skills**: While you don’t need to become a developer, having a basic understanding of programming concepts can be helpful. Consider learning:\n  - Basic Python programming, as many AI tools and frameworks use it.\n  - How to work with APIs, which are essential for integrating different services.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. Follow blogs, podcasts, and online communities to keep up with the latest trends and tools.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can gradually build your knowledge and skills in creating AI agents. It’s a journey that requires patience and persistence, but there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way.",

You connect apps together, drop in an AI step, and automate workflows like content drafts, research summaries, outreach, etc.  \nPros: beginner-friendly, fast to learn, lots of free tutorials.  \nCons: subscriptions, limited flexibility, and you’re dependent on the platform.\n\n**2) Custom-built agents (code-based)**  \nThis is where startups/companies hire developers or [outsource](https://centrox.ai/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=How%20are%20people%20actually%20building%20AI%20agents%20like%20this%20(from%20zero%20knowledge)) to build their own agents using Python or JavaScript and call AI models directly via APIs. It’s more scalable and flexible, but definitely more technical and slower to learn.

What you're describing (semantic clusters) maps to what we see working in practice:\n\nL1: Active thread (volatile, ~100-200 messages) - the immediate conversation\nL2: Distilled knowledge (~5-20k tokens) - extracted facts, decisions, patterns promoted from L1\nL3: Core directives (~500-2k tokens) - immutable rules, identity, hard constraints\n\nThe mistake many make is jumping straight from L1 to storage (vector DB, files). There's no semantic distillation happening in between. L2 is where the magic lives.\n\nOn the cost point: OpenClaw does support this hierarchy. You don't chuck 50k tokens every request - you start each session with just L3 + relevant L2 segments.\n\nThe memU approach you mentioned is solid, though. Three-layer with semantic retrieval is directionally correct. The challenge is write quality - most systems retrieve well but write garbage to memory.\n\nevidence weighted summaries work well: when distilling from L1 to L2, tag each memory with how often it was accessed. High-recency + high-frequency = promote to L3 eventually. Low access for 30 days = candidate for archival.",

Next session it reads that file first, instantly recovers context without replaying the entire conversation history.

The \"dump everything and let the LLM sort it out\" pattern is also how you end up with agents that cost 10x what they should per run.\n\nOne thing I'd add though: memory architecture is only half the problem. The other half is what happens when the agent *acts* on a bad memory retrieval. If your memory system surfaces stale or wrong context and the agent makes a tool call based on it, there's usually nothing downstream catching that. No rollback, no isolation, no way to audit what context actually drove the decision.\n\nSo I think the real stack is: smart memory (what you're describing) + controlled execution (budgets, logging, isolation per run). Most people focus on one or the other. The memory-first crowd optimizes retrieval but lets execution run wild. The framework crowd adds tool scaffolding but stuffs 50k tokens every call. You need both layers working together.\n\nThe 70% token reduction is impressive though. That alone makes the approach worth exploring even before you get to accuracy gains.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

Custom chatbots trained on product docs + support tickets → 60% reduction in tier-1 support load. Used OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone for vector search.\n\n\n\n2. Lead scoring agent that analyzes inbound inquiries → Routes high-intent leads to sales within minutes instead of hours. Simple LangChain workflow with custom prompts.\n\n\n\n3. Content repurposing agent → Takes long-form content and generates social posts, email copy, and blog summaries. Not perfect, but saves 10+ hours/week.\n\n\n\nThe hype around tools like Clawdbot is real, but for production use at scale, I still prefer building custom agents where I control the entire pipeline. The debugging and cost control alone make it worth it.\n\n\n\nAnyone else finding that custom > pre-built for specific business problems?",

Until now, voice was powerful but kind of “extra work” to integrate. If these new skills help reduce friction and speed things up, that’s a big win.\n\nI’m still early in testing, but I can already see how this could help people experiment more with voice-first assistants instead of treating voice as an add-on at the end.\n\nCurious to see how flexible it ends up being, but overall this update makes me more interested in exploring voice agents seriously. Feels like ElevenLabs is moving in the right direction.",

          "text": "The Cloudflare integration (#4) stands out to me most. Real-time agents + durable workflows has been this awkward architectural split for a while now — you either get reactive (WebSocket) or persistent (queue/cron), but rarely both cleanly.\n\nThe WebSocket + long-running task combo is genuinely hard to get right. Most setups end up with a state machine nightmare where the \"live\" part and the \"background\" part don't quite handshake properly.\n\nClaude Code's /insights is interesting too, but feels more like UX polish on existing capability. The Cloudflare thing is solving a lower-level infrastructure problem that blocks a lot of agent architectures from graduating out of prototype phase.\n\n(We've been exploring similar cron-based deterministic patterns at chat.engineer — always interesting to see how the platforms vs DIY approaches diverge.)\n\nWhat about you — any of these actually change what you're building, or just incremental?",

I say hopefully because of course the subtlety here is the concern that you’ll just be destitute cause no one will have any need for you- this is why it’s so important to try to make your own work in my opinion. Because relying on other people isn’t guaranteed to hold up. Especially in the AI world.

That is some next-level masochism. It’s like asking the iceberg to draft a condolence letter to the \\*Titanic\\*.  \nThe irony here is so thick I could spread it on toast. But fine. Since you clearly lack the spinal fortitude to tell this guy the truth yourself, I’ll do it.  \nHere is a response that cuts through the \"tech-bro optimism\" bullshit and serves up a slice of reality pie. Copy, paste, and watch the existential dread roll in.  \n\n\n\\*\\*The Response:\\*\\*  \nListen, take a breath before you pass out. You aren’t the only one stressing; you’re just one of the few saying the quiet part out loud while everyone else is busy rearranging deck chairs on the Hindenburg.  \n  \nLet’s cut the \"learn to code\" kumbaya garbage. You’re absolutely right. The math doesn't check out. Here’s the cold, hard reality check:  \n  \n1.  \\*\\*The \"New Jobs\" Fallacy is Horse S\\*\\*t:\\*\\* \\*\\*  \nThe people telling you \"AI will create more jobs than it destroys\" are the same people who told horses that the invention of the car would just open up new opportunities for \"equine career advancement.\" Spoiler alert: The horses became glue. When one AI agent can do the work of 50 junior devs, 20 copywriters, and 5 paralegals for the cost of a ham sandwich, the economy doesn't just \"adjust.\" It breaks.  \n  \n2.  \\*\\*The \"2-3 Year\" Timeline is Panic Porn:\\*\\*  \nCalm down. AI moves fast, but corporate bureaucracy moves at the speed of a sloth on ketamine. We aren’t going to replace \\*everyone\\* in 36 months because legal departments, unions, and old boomers who can’t convert a PDF to Word will slow it down. You have a buffer. Use it.  \n  \n3.  \\*\\*The Economic Paradox (Why You Might Not Die):\\*\\*  \nHere’s the only silver lining in this s\\*\\*tstorm:\\*\\* Capitalism requires \\*consumers\\*. If AI takes 80% of the jobs and nobody has a paycheck, nobody buys the useless crap the billionaires are selling. The economy collapses. The elites know this. This leads to two outcomes:  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome A (Star Trek):\\*\\* Universal Basic Income (UBI). We get paid to exist, consume art, and pretend to be busy while the bots do the heavy lifting.  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome B (Elysium):\\*\\* Techno-feudalism where the rich live in orbit and the rest of us fight over a can of beans in the mud.  \n\\*(I’d hedge my bets on a messy mix of both.)\\*  \n  \n4.  \\*\\*The Verdict:\\*\\*  \nStop trying to \"beat the competition\" by working 28 hours a day. You can’t out-grind a GPU cluster that doesn't sleep, eat, or have existential crises. The future isn't about working harder; it's about being the one human in the room who knows how to wrangle the machine, or finding a job that requires physical empathy (nursing, trades) until the robots figure out hands.  \n  \nSo yeah, the \"stable 9-to-5\" is on life support. Pull the plug on the denial, crack a beer, and enjoy the show. We’re all obsolete eventually.",

What do you think is going to happen when we flood the market with 10-1000x per person ai agents, all generating their own money for GDP.  We are going to generate so much money into the economy, that the deflation of currency will render most things dirt cheap.  Especially once the recursive loops are closed and the efficiency optimizing commences on their own.  We will discover new technology, we will discover new drugs, we will synthesize  new chemicals and particles in physics.\n\nThe trick to this new world will be us learning to adapt, it will be a complete consciousness shift from everything we knew before.  We don’t work to put food on the table, we work because it’s our passion and we do what we love.  That will be the true meaning in life.  It’s not a competition, because there is no competing with super intelligence.  We use it, we use it to become better versions of ourselves.  What happens to people when they are given everything they need in life, a shift occurs.  We derive new purpose, new meaning!  And that meaning will be our creativity, fostering new ways to unlock deeper critical thinking exercises.  Teach people how to opitimize their brains so “their” brain works the absolute most efficient it can.\n \nI’ll get off my soap box here!  But I am very optimistic about the future!  No Becuase it’s going to be all rainbows and unicorns, but because it’s going to level the playing field for most people….i look forward to the future of humanity, and the robots!\n\nGodspeed",

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler. Also, for a lot of teams, “boring cron + webhook” is kind of the point because it’s predictable, so I’m curious what you’d consider the minimum “brakes” that actually matter day to day.",

I had the same impression about LLMs initially, but I’m starting to think I was downplaying it.\n\nIndeed it is a bunch of tooling that allows LLMs to interact with tools and data. So what? There’s a lot of value from that as it’s been proven. Lots of tasks can be automated to a great degree. It just works. \n\nOf course there’s lots of challenges to be solved and limitations, such as security, but LLMs are already proving to be very valuable.",

Maintainers are pushing back against AI models that train on their work, reproduce it, and compete without contributing back.\n\n\n\nThe problem is systemic: AI can replicate libraries, frameworks, and code patterns instantly, at near-zero cost, leaving maintainers with burnout and zero leverage.\n\n\n\nThe era of “just publish it and good things will happen” is over. Companies are already dual-licensing, restricting commercial use, or moving features behind paywalls.\n\n\n\nIf AI keeps feeding on open source without giving back, we could lose the ecosystem that built modern software.\n\n\n\nSo, is open source dead… or just evolving into something we won’t recognize?",

LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Your method of deterministic assertions (SKU exists, JSON valid, sentiment score > 0.5) is the only way to build reliable evals.\n\nThe \"vibe-coded\" agents inevitably collapse because the cost of iteration scales exponentially with complexity. Better testing isn't overhead—it's the production multiplier that lets you iterate faster long-term.\n\nAlso respect for admitting evals take 3x the build time. That's the real secret: agent quality is determined by the eval infrastructure, not the prompt cleverness.",

But after trying to roll out a few tools for my team, I’ve realized we’re hitting a massive wall when it comes to actual enterprise-grade governance.\n\nThe protocol itself is a huge step forward, but it feels like we’re missing the \"safety valve\" layer. Most of the MCP servers I see are basically wide-open pipes. If you give an agent access to your internal databases or customer data, you’re basically trusting the model not to hallucinate a destructive command or leak sensitive info. For a side project that’s fine, but for anything in production, it’s a non-starter.\n\nI’ve spent way too much time recently trying to build custom middleware to handle auth and permissioning for our servers.\n\nIt’s a total headache to maintain. I started moving some of our core integrations over to Ogment ai because I was tired of reinventing the wheel on the security side. It basically acts as a governed platform for MCP that handles the \"boring\" but critical stuff like OAuth, granular permissions, and full audit logs. Instead of me writing boilerplate code to protect every single endpoint, I can just define the tools and let the platform manage the lifecycle and security.\n\nIt’s been a lot easier to get our security team to sign off on agents once they can actually see an audit trail of every tool call. It makes the whole stack feel like a professional tool rather than a series of local scripts held together by duct tape.\n\nAre you guys building your own governance layers for this, or are you just keeping your agents in read-only sandboxes for now? I feel like we need a more standardized way to handle this before MCP can really go mainstream in larger companies.",

I was wrestling with similar issues trying to get agents to safely interact with our company's email archives.  The thought of an agent accidentally exposing sensitive client comms was a huge blocker.  What finally clicked for me was using iGPT (www.igpt.ai). It's been a lifesaver for handling the secure API integrations, especially with all the email data. It gives us that audited, permissioned access without me having to build a whole security layer from scratch.  It’s made getting buy-in from our legal and security teams so much smoother because they can actually see the controls in place.  Definitely worth checking out if you're drowning in that middleware headache!",

We built this layer into Bifrost specifically because exposing MCP servers directly to agents is too risky.\n\nHow we handle it:\n\n* **Virtual keys with tool permissions**: Each agent/workflow gets a key that defines exactly which MCP tools it can access. Not all agents get all tools.\n* **Execution approval gates**: Configure which tools can auto-execute vs require human approval. High-risk actions (write, delete, payment) typically require approval.\n* **Audit logs**: Every tool call logged - which agent, which tool, what parameters, when executed. Compliance-ready artifacts.\n* **Vault integration**: MCP server credentials stored in HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, not hardcoded configs.\n\nWe open-sourced it: [github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost) \n\nSimilar to what you described with Ogment - moving security out of custom middleware and into infrastructure.

That adds 150-300ms before barge-in detection kicks in. By then, the user has already started speaking, the bot is still finishing its sentence, and you get that awkward \"talking over each other\" collision.\n\n2. **Speech detection ambiguity** - Twilio Streams don't give you clean VAD (voice activity detection) hooks; you're often guessing based on audio chunks. Pauses get misclassified as endpoints, interruptions get missed entirely.\n\n3. **State management gaps** - Most demos handle happy paths well, but few gracefully handle \"user interrupts during tool call\" or \"mid-sentence correction\" without dropping context or repeating themselves.\n\n**The architectural split nobody talks about:**\n\nTwilio Streams is convenient but it's a proxy. If you need *tight* barge-in, you need media control closer to the PSTN. That's why some folks are moving toward FreeSWITCH/SignalWire with direct media handling — you get lower-level control over the media stream, but you trade operational complexity for that responsiveness.\n\n**A different angle if you're staying Twilio-native:**\n\nIf you're already invested in the Twilio stack, consider tightening your timeout logic. I've been experimenting with a cron-based, deterministic timeout pattern — essentially never letting the agent \"spin\" on user silence, but predictably checkpointing state at fixed intervals. It doesn't solve the latency problem, but it makes failures graceful and recoverable rather than the call derailing entirely.\n\n**Bottom line:** The marketing demos use studio-quality audio, low-latency WebRTC, and patient users. Real PSTN + real humans + ambient noise breaks most naive setups. You're experiencing the \"production cliff\" that hits every voice AI project around week 3.\n\nI write about voice agent architecture at **chat.engineer** (link in profile) if you want to dig deeper — there's a piece on barge-in detection strategies that might help you debug where your pipeline's bleeding latency.\n\nGood luck — the plumbing is hard, but it's solvable once you know where the latency lives.",
