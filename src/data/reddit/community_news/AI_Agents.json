      "text": "I’ve been a loyal ChatGPT/Claude power user for years. The convenience was unmatched. But recently, something shifted. Between the rising subscription costs (which seem to be everywhere now) and the increasing \"censorship\" or over-tuning of cloud models, I decided to build my own local AI workstation.\n\nAfter spending the last few weeks testing **Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and DeepSeek** locally, I’ve realized that the \"Cloud dominance\" is starting to fade. Here’s why I think 2026 is the year of Local AI:\n\n1. **Zero Latency:** No more waiting for server queues. The response is instant.\n2. **True Privacy:** I’m a developer, and I can finally feed my proprietary code into an LLM without worrying about where that data ends up.\n3. **No Filters:** You get the raw power of the model, exactly how the researchers intended it.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There’s a learning curve with hardware (VRAM requirements are still the biggest bottleneck) and quantization formats (GGUF vs EXL2).\n\nI’ve documented my entire setup process, the specific hardware I used (and some budget mistakes I made), and a step-by-step guide for anyone looking to make the switch this year. If you're tired of being tethered to a subscription, you might find my breakdown helpful.",

      "text": "We built an open source, rust-native alternative of Claude Cowork\n\nWhen Claude Cowork first dropped, tbh it hit us a bit hard.\n\nWe have been building our product Kuse confidently for a long time, and overnight we found ourselves becoming a web-based Claude Cowork alternative. That was frustrating at first. But also sparked a different kind of curiosity.\n\nSo over the past 48 hours, together with Claude Code, we built a fully open-source project: Kuse Cowork.\n\n**Native Rust, Zero-Wrappers:** This isn't just another agent wrapper. It’s a ground-up implementation in Rust. No heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on OpenCode/AgentSDK. Just raw performance and a tiny binary.  \nDocker Sandboxing: Since agents execute code, security is paramount. Open Cowork runs commands inside a transient Docker container.\n\n**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or run entirely offline with Ollama/Local LLMs. You own the keys and the privacy.\n\n**Skills, and MCPs:** It can already handle complex document tasks (PDF, Excel, etc.) out of the box.\n\n**The Development Story:** The most interesting part is that the builder fellow had zero Rust experience before this weekend. It was a surreal experience: an AI agent (Claude Code) helping me build a faster, secure, and open-source version of \"itself.\"\n\nIt's still very early, and there's a long roadmap ahead.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Docker sandboxing helps with blast radius, but operators still need clear logs, versioning, and a way to reconstruct what the agent saw and decided at the time. That is usually where escalations come from.\n\nI would be curious how you are thinking about audit trails and recovery. Not just “it failed,” but which prompt, tool call, file state, and assumption led to that outcome. Speed matters, but explainability is what makes these safe to run outside of a demo.",

Seeing Kuse Cowork lean into native performance and sandboxing makes me wonder - are we heading toward a world where the differentiator isn’t the UI layer, but how well the agent manages context, privacy, and trust?\n\nCurious how others here think about that - does “agent‑native” design feel like the next step beyond dashboards, or just another layer on top of existing tools?",

JS heavy sites that load half the content late. Random layout changes. Logins expiring. Cloudflare or basic bot checks suddenly blocking requests that worked yesterday. Even when it works, it feels fragile. One small site update and the whole pipeline falls over.\n\nI have tried the usual stack. Requests + BeautifulSoup is fine until it isn’t. Playwright and Puppeteer work but feel heavy and sometimes unpredictable at scale. Headless browsers behave differently from real users. And once you add agents on top, debugging becomes painful because failures are not always reproducible.\n\nLately I have been experimenting with more “agent friendly” approaches where the browser layer is treated as infrastructure instead of glue code. I have seen tools like hyperbrowser mentioned in this context, basically giving agents a more stable way to interact with real websites instead of brittle scraping scripts. Still early for me, so not claiming it solves everything.\n\nI am genuinely curious what people here are using in production. Are you sticking with traditional scraping and just accepting breakage? Using full browser automation everywhere? Paying for third party APIs? Or building some custom hybrid setup?\n\nWould love to hear what has actually held up over time, not just what works in demos.",

Here is my process:\n\n1 - Look if there's an official API for the website. If possible, use that  \n2 - If there isn't, on the [Apify store](https://apify.com/store?fpr=9lmok3) for a website scraper. These are maintained dedicated scrapers, and any popular websites have something here.  \n3 - If there isn't any specific scraper, use a general purpose one such as this [Website Content Crawler (also Apify](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler?fpr=9lmok3)), and then feed the pages text output to a cheap LLM to get structured data.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

For anything mission critical, we ended up mixing approaches. Static or semi static stuff stayed simple, and anything JS heavy or behind auth went through a full browser layer that we treated like infrastructure, with retries, health checks, and clear failure signals. That helped more than the specific library choice.\n\nPlaywright has been the least painful for us long term, but only once we accepted the overhead and built guardrails around it. Where it really falls down is when people expect agents to just handle breakage automatically. In practice, you still need someone owning selectors, login flows, and change detection. Paying for APIs made sense in a few narrow cases, mostly because the cost of babysitting scrapers was worse. I have not seen a setup yet that you can fully forget about, just ones that fail more predictably.",

But LLM agent searchig is better if you need precise information of some exact stuff that needs to be up to date and it not being blocked as much.\n\nFor example the tool i made with gemini, which gathers a lot of data and thus needs to make multiple searches to gather data from one company costs like 2€ per 100 companies searched. Also this is quite slow with 100 company informations taking like 1.5 hours to do (but wouod be possible to run multiple at the same time, but they might search duplicate information as one agent does not know what the other is doing at the same time). Which is definitely tons more than what scraping and searching from scraped stuff would cost, but easily justifiable cost for many use cases.

          "text": "In production I’ve mostly seen “reliable scraping” turn into “reliable data acquisition.” If there’s an official API, feeds, exports, or a paid data provider, teams take that route because it is cheaper than fighting layout churn forever. When they do scrape, they treat it like an integration with monitoring, contract tests on key pages, alerting on extraction deltas, and a fast rollback path, not a script you set and forget. For JS sites, Playwright tends to be the least bad option, but the real win is designing your extractor around stable anchors, like IDs, data attributes, and page semantics, plus accepting you will need ongoing maintenance. The best setups I’ve seen are hybrid, API where possible, browser automation for a small subset, and a clear policy that “blocked by anti bot” is a product constraint, not a debugging challenge.",

This approach tends to be more stable and efficient.\n- For dynamic websites, identifying and utilizing internal APIs can provide a more comprehensive and structured way to access data, reducing the fragility associated with scraping HTML.\n- Tools like Crawlee can help automate data extraction while managing concurrent requests and handling various data formats, which can streamline the scraping process.\n- Some users are also leveraging open-source libraries that facilitate scraping by providing predefined request handlers and simplifying the process of working with both APIs and HTML documents.\n- Experimenting with different request parameters, such as optimizing the number of items per page, can also enhance the scraping experience and reduce the number of requests needed.\n- For those facing issues with bot detection, using proxies and managing cookies effectively can help maintain access to the desired data without frequent interruptions.\n\nFor more insights on web scraping and API scraping, you can refer to [How to reverse engineer website APIs](https://tinyurl.com/x44f7h36).",

I see decks all the time promising \"autonomous employees\" that run your business while you sleep.\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nI build these things for a living. And there is a massive difference between an **Agent** and a **Workflow**.\n\nMost of you are building Workflows.\n*   **Step 1:** Get email.\n*   **Step 2:** Summarize with GPT-4.\n*   **Step 3:** Save to Notion.\n*   **Step 4:** Slack me.\n\nThat is not an agent. That is a linear script. It’s a recipe. If Step 2 fails, the whole thing dies. It’s rigid. It’s predictable. It’s safe.\n\nA real **Agent** is messy.\nAn agent doesn't have a list of steps. It has a **Goal** and a **Toolkit**.\n*   **Goal:** \"Find me a lead in the healthcare space.\"\n*   **Toolkit:** Google Search, LinkedIn scraper, Email verifier.\n\nThe agent decides *on its own* what to do first. Maybe it searches Google. If that fails, it tries LinkedIn. If the email bounces, it tries a different verification tool. It loops. It thinks. It hallucinates (sometimes).\n\nThe smartest agent I ever built wasn't the one with the best prompt; it was the one that knew when to stop and ask a human for help because it realized it was stuck.\n\nIf you want to build real agents, stop focusing on the \"AI\" part and start focusing on the \"guardrails\" part. Because unlike a workflow, an agent can and will go off the rails if you let it.\n\nThat’s the difference between a toy and a tool. And trust me, you want to be building tools.",

              "text": "So i asked the chatbot on your site how your own bot works\n\n\"Sure! Here’s a quick overview of how AINIRO’s AI chatbot technology works.\n\nWhen you create a chatbot with us, we **scrape and crawl your website** to gather all your public content — pages, articles, FAQs, etc. That data is then transformed into a **VSS and RAG-based knowledge base**, which becomes the chatbot’s “context.”\n\nWhen a user asks a question, the chatbot uses **semantic AI search** to find the most relevant snippets from your data. These snippets are sent to **OpenAI’s GPT model** (like GPT‑4), which uses them to generate an accurate, context‑aware answer.\n\nIf the chatbot needs to perform a task — for example, search the web, scrape a site, or fetch a database record — it can trigger **AI functions** (Hyperlambda workflows). These functions are executed automatically, and the results are fed back into the conversation.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1. User asks a question.\n2. Chatbot finds relevant data from your knowledge base.\n3. If needed, it executes a function (like a web search or database query).\n4. GPT generates a natural, human‑like answer using your data.\n\nThis combination of **your data + AI reasoning + automation** is what makes our chatbots so powerful — they can answer questions, integrate with your systems, and even take actions automatically.\"\n\nIs this accurate? If so it doesn't sound like you spent exactly 12 years creating this. I don't remember GPT 4 being around 10+ years ago.\n\nAlso there's this thing called botpress. I think they do what you do better. They beat you to market lmao. \n\nI'm kind of sad I hated on your comment. i agreed with you in the first half until I realized this project is alot like most other start ups.",

I was making around 15k per month. I thought, okay, this is it, I am officially a founder now.\n\nThat client left after one month.\n\nThat’s it. One month.\n\nSuddenly no revenue, no backup, no runway, and I had to go back to the same field again with my confidence shaken and savings hit.\n\nReality check. One client is not a business. Early revenue is not stability. Excitement is not security.\n\nIf you are working a job right now and dreaming about your startup, please set a real target. A target where you can pay rent, eat properly, handle emergencies, and sleep without panic.\n\nQuit only when your startup can carry your basic life, not your ego.\n\nStartup life is already hard.

That statement was clearly about human readers, but what we are seeing now is that the same principles also benefit machine readers.\n\nClean Code was never just about aesthetics. It is about intent, structure, and reducing cognitive load. If code is understandable for humans, LLMs benefit almost automatically, because they rely on the same signals such as naming, cohesion, separation of concerns, and local reasoning.\n\nWhat has changed is the value of inline context. Not heavy Javadoc-style documentation everywhere, but short explanations of why something is done the way it is. Whether that is a method comment, a block comment, or a small inline note does not really matter.\n\nThe key point is simple. Code should be written to be read. First by humans, and now increasingly by AI as well. If your codebase is readable, structured, and explicit about intent, AI tooling does not feel bolted on. It just works better.\n\nSo I agree with the observation in this thread. The success is not accidental. It is the natural result of long established software engineering principles paying off in a new context.",

Treating human input as adversarial forces clearer boundaries between reasoning, execution, and validation, which is the only way to make these systems survivable under real volume.

In real production systems, most agent steps are boring, repetitive and rule-bound, yet people still pay frontier-model prices for them, which kills margins as usage grows. The insight from these papers is that intelligence comes from routing work correctly, not throwing a giant model at everything and that’s why orchestrating specialized SLMs and only escalating to heavyweight reasoning when uncertainty is high leads to systems that are both cheaper and more reliable. This approach turns AI from a flashy demo into something you can actually run in production without panic over costs and if anyone here wants to explore how to apply this setup to their own agents, I’m happy to guide.",

      "text": "I’ve been experimenting with AI agents for a while now, and something keeps coming up. Agents look great when they operate on structured inputs or well defined APIs, but once they have to interact with real websites, dashboards, or internal tools, reliability drops fast.\n\nDynamic pages, auth flows, inconsistent UI states, partial loads… all of that turns a “smart” agent into something brittle very quickly. I’ve tried different orchestration frameworks and models, and the issue rarely feels like reasoning. It’s almost always execution and grounding.\n\nLately I’ve been thinking more about treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure instead of something the agent improvises against. Tools like hyperbrowser made me rethink this, not as an agent framework, but as a way to give agents a stable place to observe and act so failures are actually debuggable.\n\nCurious how others here are handling this. Are you avoiding UI level automation entirely, building heavy guardrails, or relying on specialized environments?",

Once an agent leaves a clean contract and has to deal with UI state, timing, or auth, it becomes less about intelligence and more about whether the environment is predictable. A lot of failures feel impossible to reason about after the fact because you cannot tell if it was a perception issue, a state change, or a silent UI drift. Treating the execution surface as infrastructure makes sense to me, especially if it gives you replayability and traces. Otherwise you are just tuning prompts against a moving target and calling it agent reliability.",

A 1% error rate on 100 actions is one thing but even a 1% error rate in a production system where there’s likely an unbounded number of events is actually a huge error rate. \n\n2. Of course we’re never going to get to 100% accuracy. Stuff happens. That’s where observability really shines. Why is that error happening all the time? Great I see and now I can fix it. \n\nBoth Evaluation & Observation are still under appreciated and definitely under utilized imo. Proper engineering practices have either been tossed aside in the name of expediency or the people developing stuff have never even heard of them. It’s one thing for a personal project. It’s another for a real world application especially in critical verticals. It’s a VERY exciting time and I love almost anyone can build something now but we’re in for a lot of debugging and security issues in the near future.",

Here are a few thoughts on the topic:\n\n- **Brittleness in Dynamic Environments**: Many agents struggle with dynamic web pages due to issues like changing DOM structures, authentication flows, and inconsistent UI states. This can lead to failures that are hard to debug.\n\n- **Execution vs. Reasoning**: As you've noted, the problems often stem from execution rather than reasoning. Agents may be capable of understanding tasks but falter when it comes to interacting with unpredictable web interfaces.\n\n- **Infrastructure Perspective**: Treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure is an interesting approach. By providing a stable environment for agents to operate, you can potentially reduce the number of failures and make debugging easier.\n\n- **Guardrails and Specialized Environments**: Some developers opt for heavy guardrails to manage interactions with UI elements, while others may use specialized environments or tools designed to handle the complexities of web automation more effectively.\n\nIf you're looking for more insights or specific frameworks that address these issues, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "I get it, AI has made it easier to build software, but it’s not as if you can magically do months worth of coding in days or even weeks.\n\nHere’s the pattern I’ve discovered:\n\nThere are a bunch of creators who have hyped people up, saying you do not need to have coding knowledge to build AI systems. Is it true? No.\n\nUnless your job is to build small demos/MVPs or content on AI.\n\nYou might be able to sell your “product” by showing your leads the automation you built on n8n but when it’s time to deploy it into the real world, it’ll fail on day 1.\n\nHere’s a recent case study from one of my leads:\n\nThey needed a WhatsApp reservation and admin system for a network of \\~9000 restaurants.\n\nSo they did what most people feel is the logical solution, hire developers.\n\nThe developers that they had, built a WhatsApp bot using n8n. They showed it to the client, it worked fine. Because obviously it’s a simple chatbot so you can’t really do much with it except talk.\n\nCan you jailbreak it? Piece of cake.\n\nDoes it have any logical awareness? No.\n\nIs it anywhere close to a usable demo? Not at all.\n\nSo they start reaching out to people who can actually build the system. That’s where I come into picture.\n\nThey tell me, they already have a system built “halfway” and need me to finish it in the next 3 days (that too for free lmfao, I’ll get to this part later).\n\nMy CTO sits with their developer and sees the system they had.\n\nSurprise! The system is just an n8n template copy pasted with vibe coding done all over (the guy didn’t even remove the ChatGPT comments in the code).\n\nSo I tell them, that this cannot be done within 3 days. Your system is pretty much useless, we’ll have to build everything from scratch. We can give you a small demo in the next 12 days, but that requires a certain upfront payment so that we can start working.\n\nThat’s where he paused and told “he’ll talk to his partners”.\n\nApparently all of their budget was already allocated to marketing, they hired a lot of sales people and could only allocate the budget for “API Token costs”.\n\nSo yeah, we’re not going forward with them.\n\nP.S. they would’ve paid us once 4-5 restaurants would’ve found the system useful, then they’d recommend it to the 6th restaurant and this time charge money.\n\nNow here comes the issue: People have learned how to put together different blocks on no code tools and call it a day. But someone who had actual coding knowledge knows that it’s only the start.\n\nHere’s the things which were missing from the WhatsApp n8n automation they had:\n\n1. Edge cases.\n\nNobody tested how the system would reply if there were unwanted inputs, which is like the 90% of human input. The automation kept talking rubbish when things went out of context.\n\n2. No guard rails.\n\nIt was extremely easy to jailbreak the system. Few fishy prompts and it would give away every single internal data to the user.\n\n3. Sky high costs.\n\nThe workflow had no structure. The vibecoded schema would have cost about 10-20$ on an average per user. Rest you can calculate how costly the operation would be if they even got 10,000 users :) (Apparently they kept pushing every single thing through LLM and the tokens would’ve kept compounding overtime, not gonna go into details).\n\n4. No GDPR knowledge.\n\nBeing a bad developer is one thing, but when it comes to WhatsApp, how come people don’t think about the GDPR rules??? Unless you’re asking for trouble.\n\n5. Overpromises.\n\nAI can do everything! Add unlimited features and make revenue based promises to the clients!\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause people are underestimating how hard it is to really create a scalable and usable AI system.\n\nThere are thousands of people selling themselves as one man dev team who can apparently build saas level systems on his own that too for free.\n\nWhy for free? Because no one hires them, I mean why should they? When your services are pretty much useless.\n\nBut when new business owners enter this market, they get a feeling that AI has made software development very easy, cheap and almost free. So they have sky high expectations. Every single guy out there is legit selling his “business changing automation” for free. Is that how software industry works? NO.\n\nThese no code tools have only added more to the noise. I see so many people who have made absurd promises to their clients which apparently AI can magically solve. They promise to give a demo + result for free. Then they start building using no code tools, fail miserably, try to find builders, get faced by the fact that even demos need some capital to be built, ultimately they are simply unable to deliver.\n\nConclusion? AI has not made the market cheap, but more complex. People who do not have good software development knowledge CANNOT build scalable AI systems just because they are good at operating no code tools.\n\nSo if you’re a business owner, watch out. It’s hard to find the right people for the job when there’s so much noise.\n\nPro tip: if someone is providing you something for free, chances are. It was worth the same.",

      "text": "Most agents today are just “LLM in a loop + tools”. They are good at reasoning and works fine for short tasks. Over long-running tasks, they usually have no plan, lose context and their execution gets messy.\n\nMore capable agents like Claude Code and Manus get around this by following a common pattern: they plan first, externalize working context (files) and break work into isolated sub-tasks.\n\nDeep Agents from LangChain are really the next level, which essentially package this pattern into a reusable runtime. you call `create_deep_agent(...)` and get a StateGraph that:\n\n* plans explicitly\n* delegates work to sub-agents\n* keeps its state in files instead of bloating the prompt\n\nEach piece is implemented as middleware (To-do list middleware, Filesystem middleware, Subagent middleware).\n\nConceptually it looks like this:\n\n    User goal\n      ↓\n    Deep Agent (LangGraph StateGraph)\n      ├─ Plan: write_todos → updates \"todos\" in state\n      ├─ Delegate: task(...) → runs a subagent with its own tool loop\n      ├─ Context: ls/read_file/write_file/edit_file → persists working notes/artifacts\n      ↓\n    Final answer\n\nIt push key parts into explicit state (e.g. `todos` \\+ files + messages), but the main thing I noticed was visibility over frontend.\n\nI wired it up with CopilotKit - Infrastructure for building AI copilots into any app.\n\nIt keeps the frontend in sync with what the agent is doing by streaming events and state updates in real time (using AG-UI protocol under the hood).\n\nDeep Agents is really good at multi-step workflows & CopilotKit as the orchestration + UI layer.

Web apps behave inconsistently, pages load differently, auth flows expire, state changes underneath you.

Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n- **Data Verification**: Implement a verification step where the voice input is cross-checked against known data or patterns. This could involve confirming key details with the user before proceeding.\n\n- **Confidence Thresholds**: Set confidence thresholds for the voice recognition system. If the confidence level of the recognized intent or data falls below a certain percentage, hold off on triggering the workflow until further validation is done.\n\n- **Contextual Checks**: Use contextual information to assess the validity of the data. For example, if a lead's information is inconsistent with previous interactions, it may warrant a review.\n\n- **Human Oversight**: For critical actions, consider a human review process for the first few interactions or until a certain volume is reached. This can help identify common issues and refine the voice recognition system.\n\n- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism where users can report inaccuracies. This can help improve the system over time and build trust in the data collected.\n\n- **Pilot Testing**: Start with a pilot phase where you monitor the outcomes of automated actions triggered by voice data. Analyze the results to determine if adjustments are needed before scaling up.\n\nThese approaches can help mitigate risks associated with relying on voice-collected data while maintaining efficiency in your workflows.

Watched demos.\n\nActual agents I've built and use? Zero.\n\nIts not that I dont believe in the technology. I see the posts. I know people are saving time. It works for some people.\n\nBut every time I sit down to build something I get stuck. Cant think of what to automate. Start something and abandon it halfway.\n\nPart of it is overwhelm. Too many tools, too many approaches.\n\nPart of it is perfectionism. Want my first agent to be useful so I keep waiting for the perfect use case.\n\nPart of it is time. Always something more urgent.\n\nWe're now in 2026 and I'm still in the same spot.\n\nAnyone else? Or anyone who was here and got out?\n\nWhat finally got you to build your first useful agent? Specific tool like n8n or Vellum that lowered the barrier? Use case that clicked? Just forcing yourself?\n\nNeed real talk not another tutorial.",

Once you see it work, starting the next one feels much easier.",

When you are the person who has to explain failures, you hesitate to automate without a clear owner, fallback, and definition of success. Most people get unstuck when they stop asking “what agent should I build” and instead start with “what decision or handoff is failing repeatedly today.” At scale, agents only stick when they reduce risk or escalation, not when they feel clever. The first useful ones I have seen were boring, tightly scoped, and easy to turn off. Perfectionism usually fades once the blast radius is small enough to tolerate being wrong.",

          "text": "It's common to feel overwhelmed when diving into building agents, especially with the plethora of tools and frameworks available. Here are some thoughts that might resonate:\n\n- **Start Small**: Instead of aiming for a complex agent, consider a simple use case. For example, automating a repetitive task you do daily, like summarizing emails or gathering data from a website. This can help build confidence without the pressure of perfection.\n\n- **Use Existing Templates**: Platforms like Apify offer templates that can jumpstart your projects. For instance, the [CrewAI](https://tinyurl.com/jc5bza4w) framework provides a structured way to define agents and integrate them with tools, which might lower the barrier for you.\n\n- **Focus on a Specific Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in your daily routine. This could be anything from social media analysis to automating data entry. When you have a clear problem to solve, it can guide your development process.\n\n- **Set Time Limits**: Allocate a specific amount of time to work on your agent. This can help combat perfectionism and keep you moving forward. Even if you don't finish, you'll have made progress.\n\n- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities can provide motivation and inspiration. Sharing your struggles might lead to suggestions or collaboration opportunities that can help you overcome hurdles.\n\n- **Iterate and Improve**: Remember that your first agent doesn't have to be perfect. Build something functional, then iterate on it. Each version can improve based on feedback and your own experiences.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, consider checking out the [AI agent workflow](https://tinyurl.com/3rppepvb) for insights on building agents that query datasets. It might spark some ideas for your own projects.",

Claude figures out:\n\n1. Which task type fits your problem (QA, classification, tool calling, RAG)\n2. How to convert your messy input data into proper training format\n3. Whether the task is even learnable (runs teacher evaluation first)\n4. Training orchestration and progress monitoring\n5. How to package and deploy the result\n\nThe skill wraps our distil-cli and reads the docs to figure out the right commands and parameters.\n\n**Example conversation:**\n\n```bash\nMe: I have conversation logs in ./data where I asked for SQL queries. \n    Train a model that can do this locally.\n\nClaude: → Analyzes the data format\n        → Creates job_description.json, config.yaml, train.jsonl, test.jsonl\n        → Runs teacher eval (DeepSeek-V3 scores 80%)\n        → Kicks off distillation training\n        → Downloads 2.2GB GGUF when done\n        → Writes deployment script for Ollama\n```\n\nTotal hands-on time: maybe 10 minutes of chatting. Training runs in the background.\n\n**What makes it agentic:**\n\n- Reads documentation to understand available commands\n- Makes decisions about task type and data format based on your description\n- Interprets evaluation metrics and recommends whether to proceed\n- Handles errors and retries\n- Can write follow-up code (deployment scripts, test apps) using the trained model\n\n**Results from a Text2SQL test:**\n\n| Model | Accuracy (LLM-as-a-Judge) |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| Base Qwen3 0.6B | 36% |\n| Teacher (DeepSeek-V3) | 80% |\n| Agent-trained 0.6B | 74% |\n\nThe agent got a 0.6B model to nearly match a state-of-the-art teacher on this task.",
