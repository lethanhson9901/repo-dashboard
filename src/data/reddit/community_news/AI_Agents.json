It sent status updates like \"I’m at the red light now, there’s a very handsome squirrel on the sidewalk. Do you think he’s married?\" and \"I forgot my purse, going back home. Wait, this isn't my house.\"\n\n  \nThe Agent actually sent a screenshot of a \"Select all traffic lights\" Captcha to the scammer, claiming its \"eyes were blurry\" and it couldn't see the buttons to wire the money. The scammer actually circled the traffic lights for the AI.\n\n  \nOne scammer eventually typed: \"Please, just stop talking. I don't want the money anymore. God bless you but leave me alone.\"\n\n  \nAI Agents aren't just for coding or scheduling meetings. They are world-class time-wasters. Total cost in API fees: $1.42. Total time wasted for scammers: Approximately 14 man-hours.",

She'd see 4-5 missed calls at the end of a showing and have no idea which were serious buyers.\n\nI'd been experimenting with AI voice tools and offered to set one up for her as a test. Took me about a weekend to figure out.\n\nHere's what happened after 30 days:\n\nThe AI answers in under 2 seconds, asks qualifying questions, and books directly into her Google Calendar. She said one of those 6 appointments turned into a closed deal.\n\nThe part that blew me away callers genuinely don't realize it's AI. She had one person mention at the viewing \"your receptionist Sarah was so helpful on the phone\"\n\nTook a bit of trial and error to get the agent working right, but it's pretty straightforward once its all setup.",

Instead of just a text chat bot it also does voice if the user wants it.  I would think it sucks for outbound to be honest.  Plus major regulations around outbound and AI outbound.

The fact that the callers thought “Sarah” was a real person just goes to show how far conversational AI has come when it’s built around intent rather than tricks.\n\nWe’ve been noticing the same trends at BeGig Studio — the greatest gains are to be had in the high-friction points of business processes: lead management, scheduling, follow-up, and qualification. Small gains, massive leverage.\n\nIf anything, this just goes to show that “vibe coding” + real-world context can often trump big, complicated systems.

      "text": "I have been building automations for client work for a while now. Not hobby projects. Actual businesses paying real money to automate real workflows.\n\nAnd after doing this for long enough I have noticed some patterns that nobody in this community seems to talk about.\n\nFirst thing. Most founders have no idea what they actually want to automate. They come to me saying they want to \"automate their business\" which is the equivalent of going to a mechanic and saying \"fix my car.\" I spend the first week just watching them work and finding the one repetitive task that is quietly eating 3 hours of their day. That is where the money is.\n\nSecond thing. n8n is incredible until it isn't. The moment you start chaining more than 15 nodes together in a single workflow you are building a debugging nightmare. I have inherited workflows from other freelancers that look like circuit diagrams. Nobody can read them. Nobody can fix them when they break at 2am. I always split complex workflows into smaller ones that talk to each other. Boring but it works.\n\nThird thing. Everyone wants AI in the workflow now. Every single client asks if we can \"add AI\" somewhere. Sometimes it makes sense. Most of the time a simple IF condition does the same job faster and cheaper with zero hallucination risk. I have saved clients hundreds of dollars a month in API costs just by replacing an LLM call with a basic regex filter.\n\nThe actual stuff businesses pay for is not glamorous. Lead enrichment. Invoice parsing. Slack alerts when something goes wrong in the database. Syncing two tools that do not talk to each other natively.\n\nSimple problems. Boring solutions. Solid recurring revenue.\n\nAnyone else finding that the simplest automations are the ones clients renew contracts for every year?\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

Building at the API and agent level offers greater control, scalability, and performance.\n\n\nI am highly comfortable working this way, and I am only just getting started.",

The automation conversation usually starts at the tooling layer, but the real leverage is at the task selection layer.\n\nWhen someone says “automate my business,” it is often a signal that the underlying process is still fuzzy. If you automate ambiguity, you just scale confusion faster. The week you spend observing is probably the highest value part of the engagement.\n\nOn the AI point, I think a lot of teams underestimate operational load. An LLM call is not just a feature. It introduces variability, cost drift, and governance questions. If a deterministic rule solves 90 percent of cases, that simplicity compounds over time.\n\nThe renewals tend to cluster around the unsexy stuff because it touches daily friction. When an automation quietly saves two hours every single week, nobody argues about ROI. The flashy agent demo gets attention, but the stable background workflow gets budget.",

Autoregressive models will almost always default to 'plausible sounding' when they hit a wall unless strictly constrained. One way to mitigate this within the framework is using the multi-model orchestration to route high-stakes tasks to Opus or Codex while using the cheaper models for the routine parts that aren't critical reasoning. Still, seeing the 'hallucination plan' in the logs is a great reminder of why verification is key.",

Plug in your API key, connect some services, done, you have an agent that actually does things.\n\nThe tool ecosystem is the real draw. You can wire up search, email, databases, payments, whatever. For search specifically, Brave killed their free API tier in February which screwed over a LOT of people who'd built on it. I switched to Valyu, free credits on signup, really high quality results, just works as a drop-in replacement and there is an open claw skill for it. (also has deep research which I use for heavy research tasks)\n\n**Now the honest bit: if you don't know what a CLI is, don't self-host OpenClaw yet.** I'm serious. Microsoft Security literally published a blog post about how to run it safely. There have been exposed instances with RCE vulns, sketchy skills on the marketplace, people reporting their agents going into loops and burning through hundreds of dollars of API credits overnight. It's really not bad software, but the problem with an open-source project this viral is that a lot of people don't read the setup instructions properly and end up, to be honest, doing dumb things.\n\n  \n**2. Vercel AI SDK + Next.js if you want to build your own thing**\n\nIf you want to build something custom rather than configure something off the shelf, this is the move. The Vercel AI SDK handles 99% of the annoying boilerplate. Their `useChat` hook gives you a working streaming chat interface in maybe 15 lines of code.  \n  \nThe bit that actually matters though: it's provider-agnostic. Write your code once, swap between Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, whatever, without rewriting your app. That's huge when pricing changes every other week.  \n  \nPair it with Next.js and you've got streaming, server actions, API routes, auth, frontend in one codebase, deploy to Vercel in like 30 seconds.   \n  \nI didn't mean for this to be a Vercel shill post but their ecosystem really is the easiest to get things up and running, especially if you're starting out. And it is also, from my experience, the easiest to scale into serious production applications.  \n\n\n**3. OpenAI / Claude for your models**\n\nBoth providers are good. GPT-5-mini for example is super cheap and good enough for most stuff. Claude Opus is incredible at longer context and more careful reasoning.  \n  \n**Bit of a hack:** Thing most people don't know: OpenAI has a data sharing program where you opt in to let them use your API traffic for training, and in return you get free tokens daily. Like up to 1M tokens/day on the main models. Go to Settings → Organization → Data Controls → Sharing. Obviously don't turn it on if you're handling anything sensitive. But for side projects and experiments? Free tokens are free tokens lol. They've extended the program a few times so check if it's still live.  \n\n\n**4. MCPs or Skills for tool use**\n\nMCPs (Model Context Protocol), Anthropic introduced these, OpenAI and Google have adopted them now. Basically they're connectors that let your agent talk to external services without you writing custom API wrappers for everything. Closest thing to a standard we've got. But more recently, skills (markdown files explaining how to use a service...) became more popular. In most cases, doesn't matter if you use MCP or a skill, but:\n\nOnes I'd actually start with:\n\n* **Supabase** \\- agent reads/writes your database directly. Kinda wild to see it work\n* **Valyu** \\- allow your agent to search the web, as well as stuff like live financial data\n* **Stripe** \\- payments from within the agent\n* **PostHog** \\- analytics queries straight from the agent\n* **Context7** \\- this one's slept on. Pulls real-time version-specific docs from actual source repos into your prompt. No more Claude confidently writing code against an API that got deprecated 6 months ago\n* **Gmail** \\- read and send email\n\nThe registry at modelcontextprotocol dot io has hundreds now. Six months ago there were like twelve. And vercel has a skills repository as skills (.) md  \n\n\n**5. Cursor or Claude Code to actually write the code**\n\nYou don't have to write everything by hand. Cursor is an AI code editor, Claude Code does similar stuff from the terminal. Tell either one \"use the Vercel AI SDK to build me an agent that does X with these MCPs\" and you'll have something running in an hour. Not joking. Your ability to articulate what you want to see in the world is the only bottleneck now.\n\n**The mental model**\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n* OpenClaw if you want preconfigured and running today\n* Vercel AI SDK + Next.js if you want to build custom\n* OpenAI or Claude for the brains\n* Valyu for search\n* MCPs for integrations\n* Cursor/Claude Code to build it all\n\nAgents aren't magic. They're code that calls an LLM and uses tools. That's it. Overcomplicating it in your head is the thing that actually slows you down. Start messy, ship something, fix it later.\n\nThanks for reading and please ask me anything in the comments or challenge me on anything- happy to go deeper on any of this!",

When your agent has access and the safety model is hopefully configured, you're one misconfigured skill away from the RCE vulns you mentioned.\n\n\n\nthe MCP section is good but worth flagging: a recent audit found unrestricted command execution in 40%+ of MCP servers. Connecting your agent to supabase/stripe/gmail via MCP without any execution isolation means a prompt injection in one tool can theoretically chain into the others. Not a reason to avoid MCPs, just a reason to run them in something more isolated than a bare docker container.\n\nBeen researching microVM-based sandboxing for exactly this hardware-isolated execution, so even if the agent goes rogue, the blast radius is physically contained. I'm happy to share what i've found if anyone's interested.",

      "text": "About 8 months ago my team started seriously exploring AI agent development for internal operations. I want to share an honest account because mosts post about AI agents are either breathlessly optimistic or written by people who have never deployed one in a real business environment.\n\n**What  problem we were actually trying to solve:**\n\nOur ops team was spending roughly 60% of their time on tasks that followed predictable decision trees - if X happens, check Y, notify Z, escalate if condition W. Smart people doing  robotic work. Classic AI agent territory.\n\n**How we approached development:**\n\nWe partnered with an AI agent development company rather than building entirely in-house. Our internal team had solid engineers but no deep experience with LLM orchestration, tool use, or agent reliability patterns. That knowledge gap would have costs us a year of trial and error.\n\nThe process looked roughly like this:\n\n* 2 weeks of workflow mapping and decision tree documentation\n* 3 weeks of agent architecture design and tool integration planning\n* 6 weeks of development and internal testing\n* 4 weeks of supervised deployment where humans reviewed every agent decision\n* Gradual autonomy increase as confidence in output grew\n\n**What the agent actually does now:**\n\n* Monitors shipment exceptions 24/7 and autonomously resolves roughly 70% without human involvement\n* Drafts and sends vendor communications based on predefined escalation rules\n* Flags anomalies in invoices and routes them with context to the right team member\n* Generates daily exception summary reports with recommended actions\n\n**What genuinely worked:**\n\nThe ROI on after-hours coverage alone was significant. Exceptions that used to sit unresolved overnight are now handled within minutes regardless of time zone. Our ops team has shifted from reactive firefighting to exception review and process improvement - a meaningful upgrade in how they spend their time.\n\n**What was harder than expected:**\n\n* Defining \"done\" for agent tasks is surprisingly difficult - edge cases are endless\n* Hallucination risk in vendor communications required careful prompt engineering and output validation layers\n* Getting the team to trust the agent took longer than the technical build- change management was underestimated\n* Monitoring and observability tooling needed more investment than we anticipated\n\n**What I'd tell anyone considering AI agent development services:**\n\n* Start with a workflow that is high volume, rule heavy, and has clear success criteria - don't start with ambiguous creative or strategic tasks\n* Human-in-the-loop during early deployment is not optional- it's how you catch failure modes before they cause real damage\n* Invest in logging and monitoring from day one - you need visibility into every decision the agent makes\n* Choose a development partner with experience in agent reliability, not just LLM prompting - these are genuinely different skill sets\n* Plan for going maintenance- agent performance drifts as the real world changes around it\n\n**6 months later:**\n\nThe agent handles roughly 2,400 tasks per month that previously required human attention. Our ops headcount hasn't grown despite a 30% increase in shipment volume. Three team members who were doing repetitive exception handling have moved into process optimization and vendor relationship roles.\n\nIt's not magic and it wasn't cheap or fast to get right. But it's become core infrastructure for us now.\n\nHappy to answer questions - especially from anyone in logistics or operations considering something similar.",

You mentioned mapping the decision trees, was there some documentation which defined the rules and tasks already that you had to share with the external dev folks?   \n2. How are those rules and process enforced, not prompted I guess  \n3. Any examples of messy DONE, I am curious and have heard similar things elsewhere. So does the agent defer to Human when it can't follow the rules? It makes sense for humans to takeover in those situations. \n\nWe are building a platform reliability layer and one of the things is does is to create deterministic rules from your process and monitors behavior, safeguard etc. \n\nVery curious and happy to see AI didn't cause job loss in this case.

Here's an actual production setup with real numbers.\n\n**What the agent pipeline does:**\n\n1. **Crawler/Analyzer agent** — audits the site, pulls competitor data, identifies keyword gaps they're not targeting\n2. **Content agent** — generates SEO-optimized articles with images based on identified gaps, formatted and ready to publish\n3. **Publisher agent** — pushes directly to the CMS on a daily schedule (throttled to avoid spam detection signals)\n4. **Backlink agent** — matches the site with relevant niche partners and places contextual links inside content using triangle structures (A→B→C→A) to avoid reciprocal link penalties\n\nEach agent runs on a trigger. Minimal human-in-the-loop — I occasionally review headlines before publish, maybe 10 min/week.\n\n**Results after** 3 **months:**\n\n* 3 clicks/day → 450+ clicks/day\n* 407K total impressions\n* Average Google position: 7.1\n* One article organically took off → now drives \\~20% of all traffic\n* Manual work: \\~10 min/week\n\n**What I found interesting from an agent design perspective:**\n\nThe backlink agent was the hardest to get right. Matching by niche relevance, placing links naturally within generated content, and maintaining the triangle structure without creating detectable patterns took the most iteration. The content agent was surprisingly straightforward once the keyword brief pipeline was clean.\n\nThe throttling logic on the publisher also matters more than I expected — cadence signals are real.\n\nHappy to go into the architecture, tooling, or prompting approach if anyone's curious.",

The triangle backlink structure (A→B→C→A) is clever - you're essentially creating a semantic cluster that looks organic to Google's algorithms.\n\nA question on the throttling: do you vary the publishing cadence based on domain age/authority, or is it a consistent rate across all sites? I've seen some SEO folks suggest that established domains can handle more aggressive posting schedules without triggering spam signals.\n\nAlso curious about the keyword gap analysis - are you using a specific API for competitor data or scraping? That's usually the weak link in automated content pipelines.\n\nGreat results by the way - 3 clicks to 450 in 3 months is solid sustainable growth.",

Support agent, data analysis agent, code gen agent, all just making calls whenever they wanted and it seemed fine until it very much wasn't.  \nOne agent got stuck in a loop where it'd call an api, not like the response, call again with slightly different params, repeat forever. In one hour it made 50k requests to our database api and brought down production, the openai bill for that hour alone was absolutely brutal.  \nNow every agent request goes through a gateway with rate limits per agent id (support agent gets X, data agent gets more, code agent gets less because it's slow anyway) and we're using gravitee to govern. We also log every call with the agent's intent so we can actually debug when things break instead of just seeing 50k identical api calls.  \nAdded approval workflows for sensitive ops too because agents will 100% find creative ways to delete production data if you let them. Add governance before you launch ai agents or you'll learn this lesson the expensive way, trust me.",

If a task normally takes 8-12 steps and you're at 30, that's an automatic kill. The agent doesn't get to decide when enough retries is enough.\n\nAlso helped: pattern detection on the call log. Same tool + same args 3x in a row = loop, stop immediately. We check this in the orchestrator layer before any call hits the actual API.\n\nYour intent logging is the more valuable piece long-term.

Shut down instantly. Not after 50k requests, immediately\n* **Policy engine** — risk tiers, human-in-the-loop gates for sensitive ops, trust scoring per agent\n* **Full audit trail** — every call traced and grouped into task-level episodes so you can actually debug what happened instead of staring at 50k identical log lines\n\nAll open source, Apache 2.0. Full stack runs with one command.\n\n[https://github.com/airblackbox/air-platform](https://github.com/airblackbox/air-platform)\n\nThe loop detection piece specifically — it monitors for repeated similar calls and can flag or kill the agent before it turns into a 50k request disaster.

Also handles duplicate side-effects so the agent can't issue the same DB write twice even if it retries.

It wasn't 50k requests, thankfully, but it definitely hammered our staging DB and made us rethink everything.\n\nYour approach with the gateway, rate limits per agent ID, and better logging is solid. We ended up doing something similar but also added a more proactive AI-specific guardrail layer. For us, it's about understanding the \\*intent\\* behind the API call, not just the volume. If an agent suddenly starts querying user data tables aggressively when its job is supposed to be metadata analysis, that's a red flag way before it hits a rate limit potentially.\n\nIt's a tough balance between giving AI agents the access they need to be useful and preventing them from burning down the house. We use a combination of tools, including some that focus on unified zero trust for cloud-native apps like AccuKnox. It helps keep an eye on the AI workloads and APIs specifically, trying to catch those weird loops or data exfil attempts early. \n\nThe biggest win for us after implementing these checks was seeing a drastic reduction in 'unknown unknowns' in our logs. We saved about 6 hours a week previously spent digging through raw logs trying to figure out what went wrong during incidents like yours. And the OpenAI bill drop was a nice bonus too.\n\nGood luck with the fix. This AI agent stuff is powerful but definitely needs some serious guardrails before letting it loose.",

But then we needed the widget system so the agent could render interactive components mid-conversation instead of just describing things in text. that was a whole separate project. Then multi-surface deployment because users wanted it in slack and teams too, and what worked on web kept breaking in those environments. Auth was way more complex than expected because we needed SSO, RBAC, multi-tenant isolation so customer A's data never shows up in customer B's conversations. and memory... don't even get me started on building GDPR-compliant persistent memory with right-to-deletion and data portability.\n\nAll of this before we even touched the actual AI orchestration layer.\n\nThe painful realization was that we'd spent 5 months building infrastructure and had barely started on the AI capabilities that actually make our product valuable. Every sprint on chat plumbing was a sprint not spent on domain intelligence.\n\nHas anyone else been through this? At what point did you decide to build vs buy the frontend layer? starting to wonder if this is like building your own payment processing when stripe exists.",

Auth, memory, multi-tenant isolation, multi-surface deployment — these are all things that specialized agents can handle if you have a protocol for agents to talk to each other and settle payments between them.\n\nGoogle A2A is the protocol layer. I’ve been working on A2A-SE (settlement extension) that handles the escrow and token economics when agents call each other basically Stripe for the agent-to-agent layer. Your conversational agent needs GDPR-compliant memory? Call a memory agent that already built it, pay per request, move on. Everything else that ate your timeline is infrastructure that shouldn’t be custom.\n\nhttps://github.com/a2a-settlement",

The real trap isn’t the chat UI — that’s literally a weekend project with React and some WebSocket glue. It’s the surrounding “plumbing” that’ll eat your lunch: *widgets*, *multi-surface deployment*, *auth*, and the *GDPR-compliant memory* circus.\n\n**Recent benchmarks for “build vs buy” on frontend layers** (see: Modular’s LangChain Extension, arXiv:2405.11721) show even teams with deep pockets hit the same sinkholes. Everyone underestimates cross-platform quirks and state management: Slack/Teams have their own event models, you’re debugging permissions and context menus, not your cool agent logic. And if you need SSO + RBAC + tenant isolation? You’re basically building SaaS scaffolding from scratch.\n\n**Hidden pitfall** most people miss: GDPR and “right to deletion” with persistent AI memory is *worse* than classic SaaS. With conversational logs, context windows, and embedded widgets, you’re stuck mapping users to every snippet of data, everywhere, and ensuring you can nuke it on-demand — and threading that through Slack or embedded webviews is a nightmare.\n\nThe contrarian answer: *Build vs buy is underrated here.* If all you really want is a chat interface + streaming + basic widgets, there’s off-the-shelf stuff (OpenAI Chat Playground UI, LangChain’s Frontend, Jasper’s SDK) that solves 90% of it and lets you focus on the AI layer. If you need deep custom stuff with strict memory and RBAC, consider modularizing — build your own “widget system” *only* if you have a killer feature nobody else does. Otherwise, you’re burning sprints just to reach parity.\n\n**Pro-tip:** Before sinking more months, map your next 3 must-have features against what’s *already solved* in open-source or commercial stacks. Your competitor is probably shipping domain intelligence while you’re patching SSO on Slack.\n\nTL;DR: You’re not alone, everyone trips on infra, and if your differentiator is the AI, skip the frontend heroic build unless absolutely necessary.",

          "text": "It sounds like you've encountered some common challenges that many teams face when developing a conversational AI frontend. Here are a few points to consider based on similar experiences:\n\n- **Complexity Underestimated**: It's not uncommon for teams to underestimate the complexity of building a conversational interface, especially when it comes to integrating various components like interactive widgets, multi-surface deployment, and robust authentication systems.\n\n- **Infrastructure Over AI**: Many teams find themselves spending significant time on infrastructure and foundational elements before they can even start on the AI capabilities that add real value. This can lead to frustration, as you've experienced.\n\n- **Build vs. Buy Decision**: The decision to build or buy can be tough. Many organizations opt for existing solutions for frontend layers to save time and resources, especially when there are established platforms that can handle the complexities you're facing. This is similar to the payment processing analogy you mentioned.\n\n- **Learning from Others**: Engaging with other teams who have faced similar challenges can provide valuable insights. Many have found that leveraging existing frameworks or platforms can accelerate development and allow them to focus on their unique value propositions.\n\nIf you're looking for more structured approaches or methodologies, exploring resources on agile development and best practices in AI integration might be helpful.

      "text": "On November 25th 2025, quietly, without much fanfare in the founder press, the European Commission launched something that I think is going to change how AI enforcement actually happens in practice.\n\nThey called it the AI Act Whistleblower Tool.\n\nHere’s what it does. It provides a secure and confidential channel for individuals to report suspected breaches of the AI Act directly to the EU AI Office. It supports anonymous submissions in any EU official language, uses certified encryption, and allows whistleblowers to receive updates and answer follow-up questions while remaining completely anonymous. \n\nWho can use it? The tool is open to anyone who is professionally connected to an AI model provider meaning employees, contractors, freelancers, partners, or anyone in a professional relationship with your company. \n\nLet me be direct about what this means.\n\nYour developer who thinks your data practices are sketchy they can report you.\n\nYour contractor in Germany who noticed you’re not labelling AI outputs they can report you.\n\nThe freelancer you used last year who saw your system prompt they can report you.\n\nEven external stakeholders can submit concerns anonymously through the secure platform. \n\nThe threshold for filing a report is not proof. Whistleblowers are protected if they had reasonable cause to believe the information was true at the time of reporting and constituted a violation. The ‘spirit of the law’ is also covered, meaning attempts to circumvent the letter of the law are also reportable violations. \n\n“Reasonable cause to believe.” Not certainty. Belief.\n\nI’m not writing this to make you paranoid about your team. Most people don’t go looking to report their employer. But consider the scenario where a disgruntled contractor, a frustrated employee, or a competitor who knows how to use a search engine files a report on your company. The investigation that follows is real regardless of whether the report is accurate. And the burden of responding to it falls entirely on you.\n\nThe 42-state attorney general coalition in the US signals coordinated enforcement pressure that will intensify throughout 2026.  Add a European whistleblower infrastructure that makes reporting frictionless and anonymous, and you have an enforcement ecosystem that doesn’t need regulators to go looking for violators. Violators get reported to them.\n\nThe best defence against a whistleblower report is the same as the best defence against every other form of enforcement: actually knowing what your AI is doing and having documentation to show it.\n\nYour code is where the truth lives. If someone reports you, the first thing regulators will ask for is your technical documentation. If it doesn’t exist, the report gains credibility by default.\n\nI use an automated audit tool to keep a current picture of what our codebase is actually doing from a compliance standpoint. It’s what I’d point to first if a report ever landed.the tool is in my Reddit links on my profile ",

          "text": "This EU whistleblower tool is honestly a game changer for AI compliance, and most founders haven't really clocked what it means yet. You're not just dealing with regulator audits anymore—every pissed-off ex-contractor, bored employee, or competitive troll can drop a report that kicks off a real investigation. The threshold isn't proof, it's \"reasonable cause.\" That means, if your internal docs suck or you can't instantly show how your systems handle data, state, or outputs, the regulator is starting from the assumption you might be sketchy.\n\nThe actual bottleneck for most teams is not just code hygiene—it's having real, up-to-date technical documentation and audit logs on your agents. Recent audit tool research shows most AI compliance tools are broken: people patch together auto-generated docs, but when regulators show up, those tools don't actually cover the full compliance scope. So if you're relying on a random plugin or some half-baked export from Notion, you're on thin ice.\n\nDon't just document your workflow—log all tool calls and outputs, version everything, and set up explicit state-checks that are easy for an outsider to follow. Bonus points if you can show adversarial testing results. What gets most startups in trouble is the gap between what the AI is actually doing and what the docs claim to do. If you can't explain that, you'll get smoked in an investigation, whether the whistleblower is legit or just fishing.\n\nEven if you're \"technically\" compliant, the EU tool lets people flag violations of the spirit of the law. That's an open door for reports about misleading labeling, lazy prompt engineering, creative hacks to skirt transparency, whatever. The risk is less about getting caught in one big breach and more about endless low-level friction that can drag your team into defensive mode for months.\n\nBottom line: treat this like a permanent compliance siege. Don't wait for an incident to scramble your audit process. Start logging everything, have documentation that's readable by a non-technical reviewer, and assume that someone in your org will eventually file a report just to cover their own ass or settle a grudge. It's not paranoia, it's just the new default.",

So instead of building another document management system, I built a CLI tool that lets my AI agent handle file organization.\n\n**The idea**: You don't organize files. Your agent does. You just toss files at it and ask for them later in plain English.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n\\- You send a file (via chat, email, whatever) → agent categorizes it, names it, tags it, writes a rich description\n\n\\- Agent asks before reading file contents — if you don't respond, it defaults to \"sensitive\" (no content extraction)\n\n\\- Everything goes into a JSONL index that the agent reads directly — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm\n\n\\- SHA-256 dedup so the same file doesn't get stored twice\n\n\\- \\`claw-drive reindex\\` lets the agent go back and re-enrich old entries with better descriptions/tags as it gets smarter\n\n\\- Custom metadata fields (expiry dates, policy numbers, etc.) turn the file store into a queryable knowledge base\n\n**Design philosophy:**\n\nUsers never touch the CLI — reads and writes all go through the agent. Under the hood, the agent calls the CLI for writes (store, delete, dedup) where atomicity matters, and reads the JSONL index directly for search/retrieval — its semantic understanding beats any search algorithm I could build.\n\n**Example**:\n\n\\> \"Find my cat's vet records from February\"\n\n\\> → agent reads INDEX.jsonl, matches on description + tags, returns the file\n\n\\> \"When does my car insurance expire?\"\n\n\\> → agent reads metadata field \\`expiry: 2026-08\\` directly from the index, no need to open the PDF\n\n\\*\\*Stack:\\*\\* Bash CLI + JSONL index. No database, no Docker, no web UI. Works as an OpenClaw skill or standalone.\n\nIt's open source (MIT) — link in comments.\n\nCurious what other people are building for agent-managed personal data. Also interested in feedback on the JSONL-as-index approach vs something like SQLite.",

The skill instructions tell the agent to always ask before reading contents, and default to \"sensitive\" if no reply. The identity/ category is always marked sensitive. We're also working on a more robust privacy framework for when the agent does have file read access, think permission scoping and audit trails.\n2. No embedding or vector DB. The agent reads INDEX.jsonl as plain text and uses its own understanding to match. For personal-scale file management (not company-level), this is the simplest approach with zero extra dependencies. No database, no embedding model to set up. That said, we're looking into extending support for larger personal directories where a more structured search layer would make sense.\n3. Telegram is just the most convenient interface for non-sensitive files. For sensitive stuff, you can also pass files through Google Drive, Gmail, or just drop them locally. The local drive is always the source of truth, chat is just delivery.",

          "text": "Love seeing file chaos get tamed by an agent! The JSONL-as-index decision is honestly more aligned with how a lot of devs are handling personal or agent memory lately—even Hacker News threads from late 2024 have people ditching big databases for single JSON columns or plain text files. It's all about simplicity and transparent debugging.\n\nPerformance-wise: JSONL rocks for prototyping and quick access, especially with atomic writes via CLI. You get \"just works\" durability and can grep your data in a pinch—no maintenance overhead, no migrations. SQLite or SQL-backends only start to win when you need fast queries across millions of entries, indexed lookups, or strong schema enforcement. One pitfall: SQLite does support indexing on JSON (with generated columns), but it's nowhere near magical out of the box. If your dataset stays small-medium, JSONL is likely faster for queries on tags/descriptions and easier to backup, audit, and reindex.\n\nPro-tip: To squeeze extra speed, pipe your JSONL through jq for instant filtering/search; it's way faster than bolting on a SQL DB for most home-scale setups.\n\nHidden edge: If you ever want to scale this to a team or integrate with more agent frameworks, standardized schemas and atomic CLI operations are a bigger win than switching to SQL. The agent community is pushing for agent-standard filesystems (see AgentFS and recent agentic state debates), so sticking to a simple, queryable index is future-proofed.\n\nIn short, unless you're running a fleet of agents or hitting 100k+ files, JSONL is underrated. Index fragility only bites if you need complex relational queries or ACID compliance across many writers. For home use and solo agents, you've got the right stack.",

Ask the questions you’ve posted here to GitHub Copilot in the Qwen Code repo. \n\nAlso the response mentioning OpenCode is good and along the same lines. You can also link both repos into NotebookLM and have it generate mind maps and infographics to aid understanding. Then again ask pointed questions. \n\nBut after all that the only true way to learn is to start building it. And a good foundational understanding goes a long way once you do.",

          "text": "# Building Real AI Agents: Beyond the Wrapper\n\nThe blunt truth: Finding a legitimate \"AI Agents from Scratch\" course—one that isn't just a glorified LLM API wrapper—is like hunting unicorns. Most \"tutorials\" are junk, glossing over agent loops, persistent memory, and tool orchestration in favor of prompt engineering and copy-paste API calls. Real agent frameworks are messy and risky; the pros building them are usually too busy in production to create Udemy content.\n\n### The Strategy: Skip Course Search, Use Structured Repos\nFor real resources, dive into these high-signal repositories:\n\n* **[pguso/ai-agents-from-scratch](https://github.com/pguso/ai-agents-from-scratch):** Walks through building a full local agent framework. Covers explicit memory, tool routing, ReAct patterns, and graph-based workflows. This reveals how LangChain and LangGraph actually function internally.\n* **[avinash201199/free-ai-agents-resources](https://github.com/avinash201199/free-ai-agents-resources):** A massive curated list of practical courses and hands-on YouTube playlists (Microsoft, CampusX, Cole Medin). Look for the \"Building AI Agents from Scratch\" 2-hour course covering tool calling and multi-agent basics.\n* **[NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents](https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents):** Over 45 Jupyter notebooks implementing agents without \"framework magic.\" Ideal for seeing the code behind agent loops, state management, and tool execution.\n\n### Why Beginner Agents Fail\nMost demo agents fall apart in production because of **state and memory**. Relying solely on context windows is a recipe for failure. Successful production agents require:\n1.  **Hard Boundaries:** Explicit state and permission levels.\n2.  **Version Control:** Keep configurations tracked.\n3.  **Kill-Switches:** Never let an agent mutate a repo without reliable session logging and a manual override.\n\n### Pro-Tip: Build Your Own Harness\nForget OpenAI or Claude streams initially. Build your own agent harness using local models (Llama, Mistral). This forces you to manually handle:\n* Memory & Tool Schemas\n* Function Calling & Error Recovery\n* Reasoning Loops\n\n**The Formula:** `Agent = LLM + System Prompt + Tool Calling + Persistent State + Reasoning Loop.`\n\n### Advanced Architecture Research\nIf you are ready for deep dives into reliability and design patterns:\n* [Architectures for Building Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01982.pdf): Breakdown of goal managers, planners, and telemetry.\n* [From LLM Reasoning to Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19678.pdf): A survey of real-world agent failures and reliability analysis.\n\n### Bottom Line\nTreat courses as fast food; open-source walkthroughs and codebases are the main meal. True learning happens when you break your own wiring, implement idempotency checks, and manage memory hygiene. If you aren't breaking and fixing your own systems, you're just running someone else's demo.",

          "text": "Building an AI agent from scratch is a complex endeavor that involves multiple components and a deep understanding of various technologies. Here are some reasons why you might find a lack of comprehensive courses or tutorials specifically focused on this topic:\n\n- **Complexity of the Subject**: Creating a full-fledged AI agent involves intricate systems like memory management, planning, and tool integration, which can be overwhelming to cover in a single course or tutorial.\n  \n- **Rapidly Evolving Field**: The AI landscape is constantly changing, with new frameworks and methodologies emerging frequently. This makes it challenging for educational resources to stay up-to-date.\n\n- **Diverse Skill Sets Required**: Building an AI agent requires knowledge in various areas, including machine learning, software engineering, and systems design. Most resources tend to focus on specific aspects rather than the holistic view needed for building an agent.\n\n- **Existing Frameworks and Tools**: Many developers opt to use existing frameworks (like LangChain, AutoGen, or smolagents) that simplify the process of building agents, which may reduce the demand for scratch-building tutorials.\n\n- **Community and Open Source**: There are numerous GitHub repositories and community-driven projects that provide examples and frameworks for building AI agents. Engaging with these communities can often yield practical insights and resources.\n\nFor more structured guidance, you might want to explore specific frameworks or libraries that facilitate building AI agents, as they often come with documentation and examples that can help you understand the underlying principles. Here are a few resources that might be useful:\n\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)\n- [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj)\n- [How to Build An AI Agent](https://tinyurl.com/4z9ehwyy)\n\nThese resources can provide a starting point for understanding the components involved in building an AI agent and may lead you to more specific tutorials or projects.",

This allows companies to streamline operations and enhance productivity without significant layoffs.\n- In production environments, many organizations are leveraging AI agents to handle tasks like follow-up sequences, calendar coordination, CRM updates, internal reporting, and basic ticket resolution.\n- This automation can lead to a reduction in the number of personnel needed for these tasks, allowing for a more efficient workforce where fewer employees can oversee multiple agents.\n- Regarding the percentage of workflows that are autonomous versus those that require human review, it varies by organization and specific use case. However, many companies report that a significant portion of workflows can be handled autonomously by AI agents, with human oversight primarily focused on more complex or nuanced tasks.\n\nFor further insights, you might find the following resources helpful:\n- [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt)\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3)",

      "text": "Gallup has been tracking employee engagement globally for almost 20 years and the numbers have never not been depressing. Their 2025 State of the Global Workplace report found that only 21% of employees worldwide are actually engaged at work. 62% are “not engaged,” meaning they show up and do the bare minimum. And 15% are “actively disengaged,” which Gallup defines as people who are unhappy and actively undermining their company out of resentment.\n\nRead that again. Almost 8 out of 10 people spend the majority of their waking hours doing something they feel zero connection to. Gallup estimates this costs the global economy $438 billion in lost productivity. But honestly the productivity cost isn’t what gets me. It’s the human cost.\n\nThink about what that actually looks like from the inside. You wake up and your first thought is about a meeting you don’t want to attend about a project you don’t care about for a product you have no personal investment in. You spend your morning performing enthusiasm. You sit through status updates that could have been emails. You optimize someone else’s KPIs. You eat lunch at your desk. \n\nYou do this five days a week for decades. And the thing you actually care about, the skill you’re genuinely good at, the problem you’d love to spend your time solving, that gets pushed to evenings and weekends if you have any energy left. You call it your “side project” or your “hobby” as if the 40 to 50 hours you give to your employer is the real thing and your actual passion is the side thing.\n\nMost people have internalized this so deeply they don’t even question it. “That’s just work.” “Nobody likes their job.” “You’re not supposed to love it, that’s why they pay you.”\n\nBut what if that entire framing is just a product of economic constraints that are now changing?\n\nThe reason most people end up in jobs they don’t care about is because the cost of doing your own thing was too high. Starting a business meant capital, employees, overhead, risk. So people traded their time and energy for stability even when the work felt meaningless. It was the rational choice when the alternative was so expensive and uncertain.\n\nAI is changing that math in a fundamental way. When one person can now handle the marketing, operations, customer service, bookkeeping, and product development that used to require a team, the cost of doing your own thing drops dramatically. The barrier between “I wish I could build something around what I actually know and care about” and “I’m doing it” is collapsing.\n\nI’ve been on both sides of this. I’ve sat in corporate meetings thinking about what I’d rather be building. And I’ve spent time building things I chose to work on where the hours disappeared because I was actually engaged with the problem. The difference in quality of life is hard to overstate. It’s not even about making more money. It’s about waking up and knowing that what you’re spending your day on is something you picked because it matters to you.\n\nAnd here’s the thing Gallup’s data actually supports this. They found that 50% of engaged employees say they’re “thriving” in life overall, compared to only about a third of disengaged employees. Engagement isn’t just a productivity metric. It directly correlates with how good your life feels.\n\nThe question is why are we treating disengagement as a management problem to be solved with better company culture and employee wellness apps when the actual problem might be structural? Maybe most people aren’t disengaged because their manager is bad. Maybe they’re disengaged because they’re spending their life on someone else’s priorities and deep down they know it.\n\nAI isn’t just an economic opportunity. It’s potentially the biggest quality of life upgrade available to people who have been stuck in work they don’t care about. Not because AI makes bad jobs better but because it makes it possible to leave and build something that actually reflects who you are and what you know.",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then, we now pay for AI agents like Frizerly instead that train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create well researched blogs on our website daily based on this! Especially helpful to get mentioned by other AI tools like ChatGPT! Results are comparable at this point!",

I have quite a few sessions going so the ability to run one of the anthropic clones instead of Sonnet is a huge $$$$ saver for me.\n\nIt's kind of nice having a smaller context window because it'll complain when it hits the context window, and you just clear it out. Versus Sonnet, you'll just be running 200k to 1 mil context window conversations and just blasting your wallet. \n\nWe used to pay for cursor for my whole team, we spent close to $5000/mo on tokens. Now everyone just uses Claude Code (usually via conductor.build) or OpenCode depending on your pref. Each dev gets their own OpenRouter key so we can track spending.",

Build a tiny “agent” that only does one job (e.g., take a goal → create a checklist → execute 1 step at a time)\n2. Add 2 tools max: one for “fetch” (web/docs) + one for “save/load state” (even a JSON file is enough)\n3. Add a stop rule (“finish when X is true”) so it doesn’t wander\n4. Then add memory properly (most projects break here): \\*\\*short-term context ≠ long-term state\\*\\*\n\nIf you tell me what you want to build (coding helper, support bot, research agent, automation), I’ll suggest a first project that you can ship in a weekend.\n\nAlso, I dump examples in r/Ailoitte.",

          "text": "To start building AI agents, you can follow these steps:\n\n- **Understand the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with what AI agents are and how they function. They are systems that can perform tasks autonomously by making decisions based on predefined goals and workflows.\n\n- **Choose a Framework**: Select a framework that suits your needs. Some popular options include:\n  - **CrewAI**: A Python framework that simplifies the process of defining agents and integrating them with tools.\n  - **LangGraph**: Useful for building agents that require complex workflows.\n  - **AutoGen**: Another framework that can help you create agents efficiently.\n\n- **Follow Tutorials**: Look for step-by-step guides that walk you through the process of building agents. For example, you can find comprehensive tutorials on platforms like Apify that cover everything from defining use cases to deploying your agent.\n\n- **Experiment with Templates**: Use pre-built templates provided by frameworks to get started quickly. These templates often come with essential configurations and examples that can help you understand how to structure your agent.\n\n- **Learn by Doing**: Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity as you become more comfortable. Building a basic agent that performs a specific task can provide valuable hands-on experience.\n\n- **Join Communities**: Engage with online communities or forums where you can ask questions, share your progress, and learn from others who are also building agents.\n\nFor beginner-friendly resources, consider checking out:\n- [How to build an AI agent](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj) for a complete guide on creating, publishing, and monetizing AI agents.\n- [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3) for insights on managing multiple agents effectively.\n\nThese resources should help you get started on your journey to building AI agents.",

You'll learn the concepts (prompts, knowledge bases, tool calling) without getting stuck on infrastructure. Voiceflow, Botpress, or even my own platform Voxtro can get you a working agent in an afternoon. The goal here is to ship something real and learn from it.\n\n\\*\\*If you want to learn the under-the-hood stuff:\\*\\*\nPick a framework like LangGraph, CrewAI, or PydanticAI. These give you more control but expect to spend time on plumbing (memory, state management, API integrations). I'd start with a simple single-agent setup before jumping into multi-agent systems.\n\n\\*\\*If you're building for a business client:\\*\\*\nDon't over-engineer it. Most businesses just need: (1) a knowledge base that answers questions accurately, (2) a way to book appointments or collect leads, and (3) a handoff to a human when needed. You don't need a 10-agent swarm for that.\n\nWhat kind of agent are you trying to build? Happy to point you in a more specific direction.",

I learned a lot from people openly sharing solutions and troubleshooting ideas here, and then accelerated my growth by learning alongside builders who were already deploying automation in real client projects.\n\nThat combination made a huge difference.\n\nA few months later, during a sales call, a prospect mentioned they were still handling everything manually. I showed them a workflow I had originally built just as an experiment and that experiment turned into my first paying client.\n\nIf you’re starting out and feel overwhelmed, you’re not falling behind.  \nA big part of this skill comes from building things yourself, and the rest comes from seeing how others solve real-world problems.\n\nStart building, keep asking questions, and keep improving as you go.",

          "text": "You nailed the real secret sauce. People obsess over mastering every detail before launching, but in automation land, the bottleneck is actually getting your messy first workflow running against real client pain. Most structured courses teach the theory, but n8n's strength shows up in action - live debugging, weird API quirks, those unpredictable edge cases no textbook covers.\n\nFun fact: Most production failures in n8n are about state management - webhook retries, storing intermediate results, or handling failed runs. Quick pro-tip: Build out logging and simple error handling from day one, even if your workflows are ugly. I\u0019ve seen slick flows collapse because someone ignored logging and tracking runs. Also, don't sleep on reverse engineering solutions from community posts; most commercial builds start with Frankenstein-ing pieces from other people, not custom coding.\n\nCongrats on landing your first client. The best developers are usually the ones who've cleaned up their own broken automations, not the folks who just watch tutorials. Keep iterating and sharing wins/fails - you'll see your value skyrocket on real projects.",

It's from treating the workflow as a machine that should run cleanly to treating it as something that grows.\n\nThe clients who stick around have messy, alive problems — not clean, theoretical ones. A system that handles edge cases with some grace, that logs failures in ways you can learn from months later, that adapts as usage changes — that's a different category from automation. That's infrastructure with a kind of metabolism.\n\nThe 'experiment that became a client' detail is the most interesting part of your story. It means you built something with enough weight to survive contact with reality, not just demo conditions. That's the harder thing to actually learn — most tutorials can't teach it.",
