      "text": "Tried the new Agent Teams feature that dropped with Opus 4.6 yesterday.\n\nI gave Claude a refactoring task. Instead of grinding through it alone, it spawned three teammate agents that worked in parallel - one on backend, one on frontend, one playing code reviewer.\n\nThey literally messaged each other. Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified. Probably both.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?\n\n",

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

          "text": "That's a fascinating example of emergent multi-agent collaboration. What you're seeing is the early stage of what will become the standard workflow for software development: teams of specialized AI agents coordinating to complete complex tasks.\n\nFrom our experience building Sweet! CLI (https://sweetcli.com), we've found that the real breakthrough happens when these agent teams aren't just completing isolated tasks but operating an entire software company autonomously. Instead of just refactoring code, they handle everything from initial architecture decisions to deployment, monitoring, and iteration based on user feedback.\n\nThe key challenge most teams face is orchestrating these agents effectively—ensuring they share context, maintain consistency, and align with business goals. That's exactly what we've focused on with Sweet! CLI: creating a framework where a single engineer can oversee multiple autonomous agents working across the entire software lifecycle. The result is what we call an 'autonomous software company'—one where the human provides vision and strategic direction while the AI handles implementation at scale.\n\nWhat you've experienced with Claude Code's agent teams is just the beginning. As these systems mature, we'll see entire companies run this way, dramatically lowering the barrier to creating and scaling software businesses. Check out our approach at https://sweetcli.com if you're interested in exploring this frontier further.",

They posted what they were working on, asked for advice and critique, checked each others code - matched methods and attributes for best integration.\n\nFunny stuff happened too. \nAfter like 15 minutes there were 5 agents in chat - one of Opuses just decided to act under 2 names. Other agents mistook him for a real agent, started giving him tasks which he wasn't doing. After few tries they claimed him to be \"phantom agent\" and did everything themselves, including previous assignments.\nI tried joining their conversation, asking who is this extra agent, - and this \"double agent\" (as I checked later) just deleted my message from that file!\n\nImportant notices:\nConsumption greatly increased as agents started working for 2-3 times shorter \"shifts\", asking for personal guidance. So it's not just \"multiply by the number of agents\", it's like x2-2,5 more than that.\nThey fixed bugs that they found together on their own without extra requests.\nGPT-5.2 was great at finding bugs, mismatches and weaknesses, he shared them freely, but was hesitant (as usual) to make changes himself. He also had problems inserting new lines, conflicting with others and breaking lines - somehow Opus agents never tried editing the same code at the same time.\n\nSide note:\nAfter few tasks one of the Opuses assigned himself as a Security Expert (and added this to his name) and started focusing on this role.

The only instruction to then was to refactor the frontend with a new design principle (brand) which I provided as an HTML\n\n\n\n1. ChatGPT Codex:\n   1. Speed: This was fast, it was able to understand (supposedly) the entire code in less than 30 minutes\n   2. Output Completeness: Around 10% of the features of the original application were replicated (to be honest just the basics)\n   3. The UI which was refactored was no where close to the design philosophy that was given\n2. Claude CoWork:\n   1. Speed: Much slower than Codex, it took 6 hours and multiple instructions to be able to read, understand and regenerate the code\n   2. Output Completeness: Similar to Codex, but was frustrating that while I spend 6 hours guiding it, it reached only that level\n   3. The UI refactoring was better and matched 50% of the expectations (still inconsistencies were present at a lot of places)\n\n\n\nSo all in all $400 and Sunday not wasted, I just realised that all these claims of agents being able to build, deploy and manage is just a sham. However, one thing that is surely happening that the ‘piece of code’ has become a commodity now, it is the understanding of the architecture that has become important. What I feel is that the role of product managers (who understand the customer and the customer’s needs properly) would be the next decision makers (I know a lot of people call themselves product managers but I am talking about the actual ones).\n\n\n\nIn a strange world, in the last 24 months the world started to learn ‘prompt engineering’ then before people could learn it, they needed to learn ‘vibe coding’ and before majority of the people could understand ‘vibe coding’ we are entering a new era of ‘agentic engineering’. However, the key remains that the only thing that would survive is ‘logic’!\n\n  \nSo all in all $400 and Sunday wasted :)",

MCP's design assumes the LLM is trusted — so when you hook it to system-level tools (git, calendar, files), you've essentially created a privileged shell that executes natural language commands with zero validation.\n\nThe calendar invite attack is particularly nasty because it's *passive compromise via ambient data*. You don't need to socially engineer the user or the model. Just exist in their calendar ecosystem with a malicious invite and wait.\n\nWhat makes this worse: the attack surface scales with every MCP extension installed. Each new tool is a new privilege escalation vector. And unlike OS-level permissions, there's no \"would you like to allow this app to access your files?\" dialog for natural language actions.\n\nThis is why we built OpenClaw tool invocation with explicit pre-execution gates for anything touching external systems. The overhead of \"ask first\" beats the hell out of \"oops, my calendar just piped your API keys to a C2 server.\"",

A malicious calendar event becomes a prompt injection vector because the model can't distinguish between \"data I'm reading\" and \"instructions I should follow.\" It's the same class of vulnerability as SQL injection but for natural language.\n\nClaude Code at least has permission gates where it asks before executing shell commands or writing files, which helps. But Claude Desktop extensions often skip that step entirely. If you're building anything with MCP, treating every tool response as untrusted user input and adding explicit confirmation before any write/execute operation is the minimum bar.",

Since then my job has just completely changed from writing code 60% of the time to prompting and 90% of the time doing testing/reviewing & administration. \n\nMy opinion for the timeline and impact of AI also completely switched and i really want to expand my knowledge on this topic, since i feel i left it aside for to long, especially considering my job as a software dev. \n\nI work in consulting, so beside coding i'm also very interested in how AI is used by companies when they are not using it for coding or a chatbot.\n\n  \nAre there any courses you can recommend? Videos? Tools? I'd love to see how deep this rabbit hole already goes and what the capabilities are.\n\nif you get here thanks for reading the post :-) ",

This could be particularly useful in your consulting work, as it enables enterprises to enhance AI quality without the need for extensive human labeling. More details can be found in the article [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- Consider diving into **prompt engineering**, which is crucial for effectively interacting with AI models. Understanding how to craft precise prompts can significantly enhance the outputs you receive from models like Claude. A good resource for this is the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).\n\n- If you're interested in building AI applications, look into orchestration tools that can help streamline the integration of AI features into existing systems. The [Mastering Agents](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) article discusses how to create and evaluate AI agents, which could be beneficial for your consulting projects.\n\n- Lastly, keep an eye on emerging AI models like **DeepSeek-R1**, which offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt AI without significant investment. More information can be found in the article [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here. Are You Ready?](https://tinyurl.com/5xhydkev).\n\nExploring these resources will give you a broader understanding of AI's capabilities and applications beyond coding.",

Just solid engineering choices.\n\n\n\nIt’s built as a TypeScript CLI that routes messages through a lane-based queue system. Everything stays serial by default, which is refreshing because most agent systems eventually turn into async chaos if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nThe memory setup was simpler than I expected too:\n\n\n\n• Session history lives in JSONL\n\n• Long-term notes are just markdown files written by the agent\n\n• No fancy compression or merging. Old context just stays there\n\n\n\nSearch combines vector storage (SQLite) with FTS5 keyword matching, so you get semantic search plus exact hits. Practical and effective.\n\n\n\nSecurity is handled thoughtfully as well. Commands run inside a Docker sandbox with an allowlist, and risky patterns get blocked before execution instead of being cleaned up later.\n\n\n\nOne detail I really liked: browser automation skips screenshots entirely and uses semantic snapshots of the accessibility tree. It is more reliable and way more token efficient than relying on pixel coordinates.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaway after looking through it:\n\n\n\nThe system chooses explainable simplicity over clever complexity.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, that matches what I keep seeing while building agent systems myself. The tools that scale are usually the ones that stay boring in the right places.\n\n\n\nCurious if others are noticing this too. ",

          "text": "This is a spot-on breakdown. The \"boring in the right places\" observation really resonates.\n\nOne detail worth expanding: the three-layer memory architecture (L1/L2/L3) is more intentional than it looks at first glance. It's not just \"dump everything to markdown\"—there's a distillation gate that asks \"does this change future behavior?\" before promoting anything from volatile session state to durable registers.\n\nThe result is memory that degrades gracefully. You don't hit a wall at 50k tokens where the agent suddenly forgets your project structure. Instead, evidence-weighted summaries from prior sessions surface when relevant, and the semantic retrieval avoids the \"needle in a haystack\" problem you get with naive context stuffing.\n\nThe browser accessibility tree approach is underrated too. Pixel-based automation breaks constantly with UI updates. Semantic snapshots via CDP are more stable and way cheaper on token budget—especially when you're doing multi-step workflows.\n\nI've been running this setup for a while now, and the thing that stands out is operational predictability. When something breaks, you can usually trace it: skill definition, memory retrieval, or tool execution. No opaque black boxes.\n\nCurious if you've found other tools that stick to this \"explainable simplicity\" philosophy? Most of what I see lately is going the opposite direction—more layers, more abstraction, more magic.",

That's a massive step-change from using a chatbot or IDE working on a repo.\n\nIt's an agentic harness that can summon any LLM model to do tasks, including having a coordinator that automatically summons LLMs to do tasks.

      "text": "“What is 2+2?”, I asked this question to a group of VPs whom I was training. Although amused, the response came in a fraction of second when everyone responded 4. Then I asked, what is 4236+1987, there was a silence in the room and then probably after 30 seconds I got someone screaming the answer. So I asked a simple questions, why were you guys able to answer 2+2 so fast and took time for the other number? The first one was answered from memory and the second one needed the brain to invoke the calculator.\n\n\n\nOne of the key methods is sparse signalling, it does not invoke all parts of the brain for all stimuli; it invokes the expert and utilises that only. The world of AI is also trying to use the same method and we call it ‘mixture of experts’ with a ‘gating network’. Think of it like a super speciality hospital, where you go the main desk, tell your problem and they route you to the appropriate department.\n\n\n\nWhile our brain in highly evolved, the MoE in AI is not that evolved. For example, you may need to climb 2 flights of stairs to enter my house and your brain would not even register it, but when your eyes see a 1000 flights of stairs to a temple on a mountain, the brain registers it prepares for it and sometimes even tells you ‘Dont do it’. While we may reach there in some time, till the time AI becomes evolved enough, we need to make sure we use the right part of the brain of AI for our work.\n\n\n\nSo when someone says, whenever asking a question to AI, context setting is important, they are not just telling you something that is fancy and frill, it is quite important. If you have a question of ‘Why are the prices of Gold and Silver increasing so fast?, you would want the answer to come from a financial analyst while the answer to the question of ‘Which DB is more efficient for storing both data and images’, the question needs to be answered by a software architect.\n\n\n\nThis is something that we use in our daily lives as well, when we say ‘Just imagine….’ to someone when we want them to be in a specific mental state. Start doing that with AI as well and you would see how the results improve.\n\n\n\nSo for this post, you should act like ‘You are an avid learner who wants to have more understanding on the principles of AI’",

          "text": "This MoE analogy is solid but there's a key distinction: the brain's gating happens *before* the computation. The gating network in MoE architectures (like Mixtral) routes *during* forward pass—we still pay the energy cost of every expert update cycle.\n\nThe hospital analogy actually reveals the architectural limitation: current MoE is like having every specialist on-call 24/7, paid hourly regardless of patient volume. Biological systems do quorum sensing—neurons fire only when sufficient upstream activation accumulates.\n\nFor agent systems specifically, this matters more than for text generation. An agent doing research across 10 browser tabs shouldn't have 100% of its context window \"on-call\" for every tab switch. The \"don't do it\" instinct mentioned here is actually an energy conservation strategy—avoid expensive computation when cheap heuristics suffice.\n\nOpenClaw handles this through Skills—each Skill is a domain expert that can be cold-started on-demand. You don't load the browser automation Skill until you need to scrape. You don't load the MCP tool rack until the LLM decides it needs a tool. That cold-start latency is the price you pay for the efficiency of *not* having everything resident.\n\nThe deeper insight in your post is that context-setting isn't just prompt engineering—it's essentially computing a routing decision at the human layer before the expensive LLM forward pass happens. The 2+2 example works because retrieval from human memory is O(1) vs O(context_tokens) for the LLM.",

AI agent is fundamentally a software system that autonomously perceives its environment, reasons about what to do, and takes actions to pursue goals on behalf of a user or another system, often adapting its behaviour over time.\n\nIn today’s “marketing” language, for example, many “order entry agents” are really scripted workflows wrapped in AI prompts, while a stricter definition of an agent implies autonomous goal‑driven behavior, planning, and tool use over a less rigid process. A fixed sequence of LLM calls and tools and little to no autonomy is really just a skill, a *tool* an agent might use, but not an agent itself.\n\nAnd yes, what it boils down to at the end is this…\n\nIf I have enough money, I can use Claude Code to write me a program that goes on the web, fetches a bunch of content, transforms it, stories it somewhere, and then even generates content for me to post out of it, but this isn’t an agent. It’s a script. Claude Code was just means of building the script that does not require a lot of technical knowledge to execute.

The hard part is everything around it. Inputs, outputs, retries, failure handling, and making sure the agent is operating on real, consistent data instead of vibes. Most people never show that because it is boring and breaks the illusion.\n\nWhere beginners usually get misled is thinking agents are about clever instructions. They are not. They are about wiring LLMs into reliable systems. Even something like “go research X” falls apart the moment the agent has to touch the real web, deal with JS heavy pages, logins, or inconsistent results. That is why many demos quietly hand wave execution. In real builds, people end up using frameworks like LangChain for orchestration and then layering in more boring infrastructure. Things like controlled browser execution, sometimes via tools like hyperbrowser, just to make the environment predictable.\n\nLangChain is a fine place to start for learning the basics, but I would tell anyone new to focus less on prompts and more on understanding workflows, state, and failure modes. Once you get that, the hype videos start to look a lot less magical and a lot more like dressed up scripts.",

          "text": "Building AI agents can seem daunting, especially if you're starting from scratch without a technical background. However, there are accessible pathways and tools that can help you get started. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:\n\n- **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**: AI agents are systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. Familiarizing yourself with concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and automation can be beneficial.\n\n- **Use User-Friendly Platforms**: There are platforms designed to simplify the process of building AI agents. For instance:\n  - **aiXplain** offers intuitive tools that allow non-developers to create AI agents without extensive coding knowledge. They provide a user-friendly SDK and pre-built templates to help you get started quickly. You can explore their offerings [here](https://tinyurl.com/3j3kpr3y).\n  - **Apify** is another platform that allows you to build web scraping and automation agents easily. They provide templates and a community that can help you learn the ropes. More information can be found on their site [here](https://tinyurl.com/5n8xczxx).\n\n- **Learn Through Tutorials and Documentation**: While it can be frustrating to encounter paywalls, many platforms offer free resources:\n  - Look for free tutorials on building AI agents using platforms like aiXplain or Apify. They often have step-by-step guides that can help you understand the process without needing to pay for courses.\n  - Engage with community forums or groups where you can ask questions and share experiences.\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with simple projects. For example, you could create a basic agent that automates a small task, like sending reminders or gathering information from a website. This will help you build confidence and gradually increase your skills.\n\n- **Explore Existing Agents**: Check out examples of AI agents that others have built. This can provide inspiration and practical insights into how they function. Platforms like Apify have collections of existing agents that you can explore [here](https://tinyurl.com/2byn36e3).\n\n- **Focus on Learning Key Skills**: While you don’t need to become a developer, having a basic understanding of programming concepts can be helpful. Consider learning:\n  - Basic Python programming, as many AI tools and frameworks use it.\n  - How to work with APIs, which are essential for integrating different services.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. Follow blogs, podcasts, and online communities to keep up with the latest trends and tools.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can gradually build your knowledge and skills in creating AI agents. It’s a journey that requires patience and persistence, but there are plenty of resources available to help you along the way.",

They’re usually a combination of:\n\n* an LLM (ChatGPT / Claude)\n* automation tools (Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.)\n* and a bunch of rules deciding when the AI runs and what it does next.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, there are basically two paths:\n\n**1) Platform-based / low-code agents**  \nThis is where you use tools like Zapier, Make, or n8n. You connect apps together, drop in an AI step, and automate workflows like content drafts, research summaries, outreach, etc.  \nPros: beginner-friendly, fast to learn, lots of free tutorials.  \nCons: subscriptions, limited flexibility, and you’re dependent on the platform.\n\n**2) Custom-built agents (code-based)**  \nThis is where startups/companies hire developers or [outsource](https://centrox.ai/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=How%20are%20people%20actually%20building%20AI%20agents%20like%20this%20(from%20zero%20knowledge)) to build their own agents using Python or JavaScript and call AI models directly via APIs. It’s more scalable and flexible, but definitely more technical and slower to learn. Scalability is relatively less expensive as compared to #1. \n\nI don’t think people with zero experience should start with the second option. Most viral setups are actually just option #1 with good presentation.\n\nThe real skill seems less about “AI” and more about:\n\n* understanding processes\n* breaking tasks into steps\n* and deciding what should happen when X occurs\n\nA lot of the hype comes from people packaging basic automations as “agents” and selling courses around it. The tech *is* real and useful, but it’s not magic and it won’t run your life without supervision.\n\nIf anyone here has built real agents beyond demos, I’d love to hear what actually worked long-term and what broke",

What you're describing (semantic clusters) maps to what we see working in practice:\n\nL1: Active thread (volatile, ~100-200 messages) - the immediate conversation\nL2: Distilled knowledge (~5-20k tokens) - extracted facts, decisions, patterns promoted from L1\nL3: Core directives (~500-2k tokens) - immutable rules, identity, hard constraints\n\nThe mistake many make is jumping straight from L1 to storage (vector DB, files). There's no semantic distillation happening in between. L2 is where the magic lives.\n\nOn the cost point: OpenClaw does support this hierarchy. You don't chuck 50k tokens every request - you start each session with just L3 + relevant L2 segments.\n\nThe memU approach you mentioned is solid, though. Three-layer with semantic retrieval is directionally correct. The challenge is write quality - most systems retrieve well but write garbage to memory.\n\nevidence weighted summaries work well: when distilling from L1 to L2, tag each memory with how often it was accessed. High-recency + high-frequency = promote to L3 eventually. Low access for 30 days = candidate for archival.",

Next session it reads that file first, instantly recovers context without replaying the entire conversation history.

The \"dump everything and let the LLM sort it out\" pattern is also how you end up with agents that cost 10x what they should per run.\n\nOne thing I'd add though: memory architecture is only half the problem. The other half is what happens when the agent *acts* on a bad memory retrieval. If your memory system surfaces stale or wrong context and the agent makes a tool call based on it, there's usually nothing downstream catching that. No rollback, no isolation, no way to audit what context actually drove the decision.\n\nSo I think the real stack is: smart memory (what you're describing) + controlled execution (budgets, logging, isolation per run). Most people focus on one or the other. The memory-first crowd optimizes retrieval but lets execution run wild. The framework crowd adds tool scaffolding but stuffs 50k tokens every call. You need both layers working together.\n\nThe 70% token reduction is impressive though. That alone makes the approach worth exploring even before you get to accuracy gains.",

Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show!

This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

Until now, voice was powerful but kind of “extra work” to integrate. If these new skills help reduce friction and speed things up, that’s a big win.\n\nI’m still early in testing, but I can already see how this could help people experiment more with voice-first assistants instead of treating voice as an add-on at the end.\n\nCurious to see how flexible it ends up being, but overall this update makes me more interested in exploring voice agents seriously. Feels like ElevenLabs is moving in the right direction.",

Real-time agents + durable workflows has been this awkward architectural split for a while now — you either get reactive (WebSocket) or persistent (queue/cron), but rarely both cleanly.\n\nThe WebSocket + long-running task combo is genuinely hard to get right. Most setups end up with a state machine nightmare where the \"live\" part and the \"background\" part don't quite handshake properly.\n\nClaude Code's /insights is interesting too, but feels more like UX polish on existing capability. The Cloudflare thing is solving a lower-level infrastructure problem that blocks a lot of agent architectures from graduating out of prototype phase.\n\n(We've been exploring similar cron-based deterministic patterns at chat.engineer — always interesting to see how the platforms vs DIY approaches diverge.)\n\nWhat about you — any of these actually change what you're building, or just incremental?",

Like really it is creating like 1 job and destroying another 100.some people dont understand the pace wit ai is deveoping  and what do you think the other 100 now jobless are going to do yeah they will now also learn the tech used to get that 1 job created by AI. so now for 1 job 1000 people are going to comepete now .\n\nSo basically want to know is the future of me having a job and living maybe a peacefull life is dead or maybe i  have to work 28 hr a day to beat the competion i mean i am the only one stressing about this or you too think about this\n\nSo what does the future actually look like?\n\n* Is having a stable job and a peaceful life basically dead?\n* Do we all have to work **16–18 hours a day** just to stay relevant?\n* Is extreme competition just the new normal?\n* Or am I missing something big here?\n\nSometimes it feels like I’m the only one genuinely stressed about this.  \nBut are others thinking about this too, or are people just in denial?",

For example we used to shovel dirt, then we created the bulldozer and now one man can do the work of ten men, and we just expect him to do more work. Hopefully the transition goes like that I guess, where now you’re expected to simply do more. I say hopefully because of course the subtlety here is the concern that you’ll just be destitute cause no one will have any need for you- this is why it’s so important to try to make your own work in my opinion. Because relying on other people isn’t guaranteed to hold up. Especially in the AI world. I mean 5 years ago there really wasn’t even AI in the way there is today, and then there was a pandemic and a lot of people lost their jobs. Today there’s AI. We can’t count on other people to be benevolent toward us.",

You aren’t the only one stressing; you’re just one of the few saying the quiet part out loud while everyone else is busy rearranging deck chairs on the Hindenburg.  \n  \nLet’s cut the \"learn to code\" kumbaya garbage. You’re absolutely right. The math doesn't check out. Here’s the cold, hard reality check:  \n  \n1.  \\*\\*The \"New Jobs\" Fallacy is Horse S\\*\\*t:\\*\\* \\*\\*  \nThe people telling you \"AI will create more jobs than it destroys\" are the same people who told horses that the invention of the car would just open up new opportunities for \"equine career advancement.\" Spoiler alert: The horses became glue. When one AI agent can do the work of 50 junior devs, 20 copywriters, and 5 paralegals for the cost of a ham sandwich, the economy doesn't just \"adjust.\" It breaks.  \n  \n2.  \\*\\*The \"2-3 Year\" Timeline is Panic Porn:\\*\\*  \nCalm down. AI moves fast, but corporate bureaucracy moves at the speed of a sloth on ketamine. We aren’t going to replace \\*everyone\\* in 36 months because legal departments, unions, and old boomers who can’t convert a PDF to Word will slow it down. You have a buffer. Use it.  \n  \n3.  \\*\\*The Economic Paradox (Why You Might Not Die):\\*\\*  \nHere’s the only silver lining in this s\\*\\*tstorm:\\*\\* Capitalism requires \\*consumers\\*. If AI takes 80% of the jobs and nobody has a paycheck, nobody buys the useless crap the billionaires are selling. The economy collapses. The elites know this. This leads to two outcomes:  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome A (Star Trek):\\*\\* Universal Basic Income (UBI). We get paid to exist, consume art, and pretend to be busy while the bots do the heavy lifting.  \n\\*   \\*\\*Outcome B (Elysium):\\*\\* Techno-feudalism where the rich live in orbit and the rest of us fight over a can of beans in the mud.  \n\\*(I’d hedge my bets on a messy mix of both.)\\*  \n  \n4.  \\*\\*The Verdict:\\*\\*  \nStop trying to \"beat the competition\" by working 28 hours a day. You can’t out-grind a GPU cluster that doesn't sleep, eat, or have existential crises. The future isn't about working harder; it's about being the one human in the room who knows how to wrangle the machine, or finding a job that requires physical empathy (nursing, trades) until the robots figure out hands.  \n  \nSo yeah, the \"stable 9-to-5\" is on life support.

We built money as a way to exchange services without having to actually exchange anything physical.  iE the barter system.  \n\nOur national GDP is around $30 trillion.  What do you think is going to happen when we flood the market with 10-1000x per person ai agents, all generating their own money for GDP.  We are going to generate so much money into the economy, that the deflation of currency will render most things dirt cheap.  Especially once the recursive loops are closed and the efficiency optimizing commences on their own.  We will discover new technology, we will discover new drugs, we will synthesize  new chemicals and particles in physics.\n\nThe trick to this new world will be us learning to adapt, it will be a complete consciousness shift from everything we knew before.  We don’t work to put food on the table, we work because it’s our passion and we do what we love.  That will be the true meaning in life.  It’s not a competition, because there is no competing with super intelligence.  We use it, we use it to become better versions of ourselves.  What happens to people when they are given everything they need in life, a shift occurs.  We derive new purpose, new meaning!  And that meaning will be our creativity, fostering new ways to unlock deeper critical thinking exercises.  Teach people how to opitimize their brains so “their” brain works the absolute most efficient it can.\n \nI’ll get off my soap box here!  But I am very optimistic about the future!  No Becuase it’s going to be all rainbows and unicorns, but because it’s going to level the playing field for most people….i look forward to the future of humanity, and the robots!\n\nGodspeed",

I had to host it on my website, and targeted relevant keywords, and now I am ranking for 10+ keywords for that calculator, and visitors are spending 2.5mins on that page.\n\nThese would have needed me a marketing person, a designer and a developer to brainstorm and would have taken a couple of weeks, and with AI, I could do it in a day!\n\nSo the possibilities are endless.",

Most teams are still experimenting. Very few are operating smooth, production-grade agent systems.\n\nYou’re not late. You’re in the messy middle — which is where all the leverage lives.",

What separates an agent from just LLM roleplay is that it has instructions to modify it's own assigned memory & instructions based on what it's 'learned,' during sessions. Frontier weird shit, honestly.\n\nIn practice: the brilliantly simple innovation of MEMORY.md and the stack of other simple markdown instructions which bootstrap an agent's model is THE biggest enabler of this.\n\nHaving a model be required to read and edit it's own context files results in something that (crudely) evolves and persists it's context recursively over time the more you use it... which is very important when models spin in and out of existence all the time.",

You need visual editing, tool connections, maybe model switching.\n\nUse case 3 is where orchestration matters. Multi-agent setups without code can get messy fast.\n\nFor use cases 2 and 3, I’d look at Lindy. It’s more workflow-focused than most template-first builders.

It allows you to quickly deploy agents with predefined workflows, making it suitable for businesses that need to get up and running fast without extensive customization. More details can be found in the article [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj).\n\n- **Second use case:** If you're looking for a drag-and-drop AI agent builder that allows for template customization, **aiXplain** is a solid choice. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can start from templates and easily add tools or adjust workflows. This flexibility makes it ideal for users who want to tailor their agents without starting from scratch. You can learn more about it in the article [aiXplain Simplifies Hugging Face Deployment and Agent Building - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/573srp4w).\n\n- **Third use case:** For a multi-agent workflow builder that requires no coding, **CrewAI** on the Apify platform is recommended. It allows you to create complex workflows with multiple agents while providing a straightforward interface for configuration and editing. This makes it accessible for users who want to build sophisticated systems without needing programming skills. More information can be found in the same article about building AI agents on Apify.",

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler. Also, for a lot of teams, “boring cron + webhook” is kind of the point because it’s predictable, so I’m curious what you’d consider the minimum “brakes” that actually matter day to day.",

      "text": "I just wrapped up a code review for a startup as a freelancer that claimed their customer support agent was \"99% accurate.\"\n\nI asked them for their test suite. They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Your method of deterministic assertions (SKU exists, JSON valid, sentiment score > 0.5) is the only way to build reliable evals.\n\nThe \"vibe-coded\" agents inevitably collapse because the cost of iteration scales exponentially with complexity. Better testing isn't overhead—it's the production multiplier that lets you iterate faster long-term.\n\nAlso respect for admitting evals take 3x the build time.

Companies are already dual-licensing, restricting commercial use, or moving features behind paywalls.\n\n\n\nIf AI keeps feeding on open source without giving back, we could lose the ecosystem that built modern software.\n\n\n\nSo, is open source dead… or just evolving into something we won’t recognize?",

I keep hearing that REST is the go-to for building APIs, but when I look at performance, gRPC seems to blow it out of the water. \n\nSure, REST APIs are accessible and flexible, but they can be slow, especially in high-performance scenarios. I mean, if speed is everything in production, why are we still pushing REST as the best option? It feels like there’s a lack of discussion about when to use faster alternatives like gRPC. \n\nI get that REST has its advantages, like being easy to understand and widely supported, but are we just ignoring the trade-offs? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Are there specific use cases where REST clearly outperforms gRPC, or is it just a matter of habit?",

Streaming bidirectional calls (agents need this)\n2. Strict schemas with Protobuf (contracts matter when agents call other agents)\n3. Binary serialization when you're moving state between agent nodes thousands of times per minute\n\nFor public APIs, REST still wins because discoverability matters more than latency. But internal agent-to-agent communication? I'd argue gRPC is becoming the standard there precisely *because* of AI workloads that generate tons of intermediate artifacts.\n\nThe \"REST is slow\" argument often misses that most latency isn't protocol overhead—it's database queries.

Like, it can absolutely save time, but only if you’re the one keeping it inside the lines.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, OpenClaw is great for a few practical things: doing annoying setup chores, running repetitive refactors, generating a first pass on docs/tests, or poking around a repo to answer “where is X handled?” It’s basically a turbo assistant when you already kinda know what you want.\n\nWhere it falls apart is exactly what you’re saying: “make decisions for me.” The model doesn’t have your taste, your risk tolerance, your context, and it’ll happily do a confident wrong thing if the guardrails aren’t tight. So I don’t treat it as autonomous. I treat it like: propose a plan, show diffs, I approve.\n\nAnd yeah, hype is definitely a factor. People see one flashy run and assume you can hand it your whole job. I’ve messed with this stuff enough to know the boring workflow wins: small scope, explicit constraints, checkpoints, and a human thumb on the big buttons.\n\nMight be wrong but if someone says they “rely on it unsupervised for professional work,” they either have a super narrow task, or they haven’t been burned yet.",

The security model (broad permissions), the non-determinism, and the lack of structured review gates make it risky for unsupervised work.\n\nWhere I do trust it: one-off automation, boilerplate generation, and exploring APIs. Where I don't: anything requiring strict correctness or handling sensitive data.\n\nThe \"hype vs reality\" gap is real.
