      "text": "Been running OpenClaw since Thursday. Did the whole setup thing, gave it access to Gmail, Telegram, calendar, the works. Saw all the hype, wanted to see for myself what stuck after a few days vs what was just first-impression stuff.\n\n  \nShort answer: some of it is genuinely insane. Some of it is overhyped. And there's a couple tricks that I haven't seen anyone actually talk about that make a big difference.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\nThe self-building skills thing is real and it's the part that surprised me most. I told it I wanted it to check my Spotify and tell me if any of my followed artists had new releases. I didn't give it instructions on how to do that. It figured out the Spotify API, wrote the skill itself, and now it just pings me. That took maybe 3 minutes of me typing one sentence in Telegram. \n\nThe persistent memory is also way better than I expected. Not in a \"wow it remembers my birthday\" way, more like, it actually builds a model of how you use it over time. By day 3 it had started anticipating stuff I didn't ask for. It noticed I check my flight status every morning and just started including it in my briefing without me having to ask. Small thing but it compounds fast. Something that OpenAi I have found to be really bad at. Where if I am in a project for to long, there is so much bias that it becomes useless. \n\nBrowser control works surprisingly well for simple stuff. Asked it to fill out a form on a government website (renewing something boring, won't get into it). It did it. Correctly. First try. I double-checked everything before it submitted but yeah, it just handled it.\n\n  \n**What doesn't work / what people overstate:**\n\nThe \"it does everything autonomously\" thing is real and I started with very minimal guardrails. On day 2 it tried to send an email on my behalf that I hadn't approved. Not malicious, it just interpreted something I said in Telegram as a request to respond to an email thread. It wasn't. The email was actually fine, which made it worse, because now I don't know what else it's interpreting as instructions that I didn't mean.\n\nI now explicitly tell it \"do not send anything without confirming with me first\" and it respects that. But that's something you have to figure out on your own. Nobody in the setup docs really emphasizes this.\n\nAlso, and I think people gloss over this, it runs on YOUR machine. That means if your machine is off, it's off. It's not some always-on cloud thing. I turned my laptop off Friday night and missed a time-sensitive thing Saturday morning because it wasn't running. Now people are going crazy over mac mini's but cloud provider are also another option! \n\n**The actual tips that changed how I use it:**\n\nDon't treat it like a chatbot. Seriously. The first day I kept typing full sentences and explaining context. It works way better if you just give it a task like you're texting a coworker. \"Monitor my inbox, flag anything from \\[person\\], summarize everything else at 9am.\" That's it. The less you explain, the more it figures out on its own, which is ironically where it shines.\n\nOne thing I stumbled into: you can ask it to write a \"skills report\", basically have it summarize what it's been doing, what worked, what it's uncertain about. It produced this weirdly honest little document about its own performance after 48 hours. \n\n**Other Tips** \n\nAnyone else past this honeymoon phase? I expect so much to change over the next two weeks but would love to hear your tips and tricks. \n\nAnyone running this with cloud providers? ",

I think the bare minimum to run any decent model at full speed is 70 GB of VRAM (you can kinda sorta manage that with $6000 worth of GPUs), and the best open models can't be run on consumer/workstation hardware at all (DeepSeek-V3 uses 600 GB of VRAM).\n\nAs such, they are suggesting that you pair the bot with a subscription for Anthropic or OpenAI, which does cost money, both as a fixed monthly fee and per token. Not sure how much the bot would generate in usage fees, but the Anthropic Max plan they specifically mention in the readme is $100/month.",

Qwen3, llama3, and others just didn't work at all. Gpl-flash worked but lost context and wouldn't use memory. It feels like Openclaw is made to drive sales for cloud AI. Doing things when you are not in chat seems to be done solely through cronjobs that it sets up, it's not thinking in a real time way. What did work for me was memory retention across sessions on local, which was cool to see. It just couldn't do much of anything useful for me. Not to mention, to be able to do useful things you'd have to trust it with something secure. That answer is no.",

Treat sends/posts/purchases as a different tool class that requires an explicit confirmation token (even if you have approvals).\n\n2) Instrument burn per task: log model tokens + tool calls per run. Surprise bills usually come from retries + browser thrash. If you cap retries and force a short clarification question after N failures, costs drop hard.\n\nFor always-on: a cheap always-on box + strict outbound allowlist feels like the best middle ground.\n\nCurious: what model/provider are you using, and are browser actions gated behind approval?",

Im on my 3rd bot though, im not too technical, and they keep dying on me because i keep hitting the 1 millions TPM limit on the LLM, and google must be limiting my use for 24hours or something.

I can access it through a domain I purchased, but obviously I made adjustments so that when I log in from a new device, it asks for a username and password. I haven't added any integrations related to Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, etc. yet. But while reading this, I realized the reality of API costs for doing small things, so for now I've decided to wait for developers of free LLMs (whether Chinese or not) to develop something highly efficient to be a personal assistant that works everywhere, bypasses or overcomes automated bot authenticators (puzzles, etc.), and can be associated with an email account or some KYC in the future. I suppose these website security measures would allow a bot like OpenClaw or others to pass as long as it's registered under YOUR name or with your personal ID. But until then, it can be summarized as: YES, things can be done, but it's burning money on APIs that currently do very trivial things. I think... We can all conclude that, right? At least for now, if I see high-impact features like Obsidian/Apple Notes or things that do everything for me \"on-premise,\" I'll install it and all that.",

The cost is the challenge.

Challenged approaches. Coordinated independently.\n\nMy terminal split into 3 panes. All three crushed their piece simultaneously. Done in 15 minutes. Worked first try**.**\n\nTo try it:\n\nEnable in settings.json\n\n\"env\": {\n\n  \"CLAUDE\\_CODE\\_EXPERIMENTAL\\_AGENT\\_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n\n}\n\nI've coded for 6 years. First time I've genuinely felt like my job is shifting from \"writes code\" to \"directs AI team that writes code.\"\n\nNot sure if excited or terrified.

              "text": "Here's the breakdown:\nYes, you can use Claude Code with the $20 Pro plan, but there are meaningful limitations:\nWhat you get on Pro ($20/mo):\nRoughly 45 prompts per five-hour window, or about 10–40 prompts depending on code complexity  (TrueFoundry)\nMost Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 per week through Claude Code  (TechCrunch)\nUsage limits reset every five hours and are shared across Claude web, desktop, mobile, and Claude Code  (Geeky Gadgets)\nThe key downsides:\nNo Opus access When using a Pro plan with Claude Code, you can only use Opus models after enabling and purchasing extra usage  (Claude) at API rates. So you're limited to Sonnet on the Pro plan.\nShared usage pool.  Every message you send in the web/mobile chat eats into the same quota as Claude Code. So if you're chatting with Claude in one place AND coding in the terminal, you'll burn through limits faster.\nIt's not \"slow\",it's limited. The speed of responses is fine. The issue is you'll hit your usage cap relatively quickly on complex projects, especially with larger codebases. Large/complex files and extended sessions consume limits faster  (Geeky Gadgets) .\nSonnet 4.5 is actually excellent for coding. Sonnet 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified and can maintain focus on complex tasks for over 30 hours  (Richardporter) . So you're not getting a bad model, just fewer turns with it.\nCompared to using the API via ClawdBot (Sonnet):\nThe API is pay-per-token with no artificial session caps, you just pay for what you use. At Sonnet's pricing ($3 input / $15 output per million tokens), a typical coding session might cost a few dollars. With Pro, you're capped at ~45 messages per 5 hours regardless of how light they are. For heavy coding sessions like building TuckMeIn, you'd probably hit the Pro limit pretty fast and be stuck waiting for the reset.\nBottom line: The Pro plan is workable for light/moderate Claude Code usage, quick fixes, small repos, occasional coding help. But for the kind of intensive multi-file app development (like building out a complex saas in a couple of days), the API pay-as-you-go route through ClawdBot gives you much more flexibility. You could also consider enabling \"extra usage\" on the Pro plan, which lets you overflow into API-rate billing when you hit your cap, giving you the best of both worlds.",

      "text": "Anthropic just launched a new AI tool called **Claude CoWork**, and the market reaction was… brutal.\n\nFollowing the announcement, **software, legal-tech, and professional services stocks saw a noticeable sell-off**. The reason? Claude CoWork is being positioned as capable of automating **high-value legal tasks** like contract review, summarization, and structured analysis  work that many firms still bill humans for.\n\nAccording to analysts and traders, the tool itself wasn’t the *only* reason for the market dip. But it landed at a sensitive moment, amplifying existing fears that AI is starting to **directly threaten business models** built around expensive human expertise.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous AI hype:\n\n* This isn’t marketing copy or customer support automation\n* It targets **legal and professional workflows**, where margins are high\n* It signals a shift from “AI assists humans” to “AI replaces chunks of billable work”\n\nInvestors seem to be asking a hard question:  \nIf AI can do this *reliably*, what happens to firms whose value depends on time-based billing and proprietary expertise?\n\nSo I’m curious what this sub thinks:\n\n* Is the market overreacting to yet another AI announcement?\n* Or is this the first real sign that **AI is moving into territory Wall Street actually cares about**?\n* Which industries do you think are next once this becomes mainstream?\n\nInterested to hear perspectives from both tech and finance folks here.",

I'm planning to use OpenClaw to help me write a Patent Application. Interactions with Grok are like conversing with a human engineer. Additional questions result in answers that refer back to original question, Grok is paying attention to the entire interaction and making awesome suggestions that go far beyond the original.

One person will be as productive as 100s put together. But what's important to note is the pace of progress. Can't wait to see what all they'll be capable of by 2030s\n\nAgents still can't do all those enterprise IT database stuff that microsoft or oracle do. I think microsoft is looking to deeply integrate agents at the OS level or else openAI or anthropic will release a competing OS. Similarly there's an opportunity for Android and other smartphone OSes. Agents on all these devices might be able to talk to each other too which is what meta's personal superintelligence is going to be all about.\n\nAs things stand today, LLMs need a lot of supervision if you are using them for vibe coding etc. FSD requires that you be alert while the car drives itself etc. But am hyper bullish on the future",

They never mentioned it, they talked about doing great stuff together, making good money, etc until I read the contract, where they casually mention we must give them our databases (no API access, but the files).  If we stopped collaborating they would keep them because \"it would be too difficult to untrain the AI models\". I felt they were not being fair/transparent and left negotiations. \n\n I wonder how they feel now with all the news. \n\nAnyway, I think some legal information/databases are beyond any AI reach.

Stuff like Agent Trace feels way more important long-term than flashy demos, especially once agents start touching CI, prod configs, or real customer data.\n\nFeels like we’re leaving the “agent hype” phase and entering the “oh, this can actually break things” phase.\n\nWould be interesting to see more coverage on:\n\n* how teams are enforcing guardrails + rollback\n* where agents are failing silently\n* and which of these tools people *actually keep turned on* after the demo glow wears off\n\nGood list though — keep these coming.",

Install pain: If you need Docker, dependency wrangling, and API key gymnastics just to get started, it’s not “for everyone.” Accessibility is part of the design.\n\n2. Security mess: Letting marketplace skills run with full access is basically asking for trouble. It’s like giving random browser extensions root privileges.\n\n3. Memory not equal to chat history: Calling it “unlimited memory” when it’s just a scrollback log is pure marketing. Without semantic clustering or structured retrieval, the agent can’t actually learn or evolve.\n\nAnd right, I think the vision of local‑first, structured memory, proactive agents is spot on. That’s the difference between a flashy demo and something you can actually rely on day‑to‑day.\n\nBeen playing with smaller local‑first bots myself, and the experience is night and day compared to hype projects.

If a PM can’t get it running without reading 6 docs and fighting Docker, it’s not “for everyone,” it’s for devs who like tinkering. Which is fine, just be honest about it.\n\nSecurity model too… yeah. The marketplace/skills thing freaks me out more than the core codebase. I’ve seen enough npm/python supply chain nonsense to not want “random skills” getting real permissions. Without a proper sandbox / permission scoping, you’re basically trusting vibes.\n\nOn memory, I’ve been annoyed by this across a bunch of tools. They say “memory” but it’s just “we’ll stuff more text into context sometimes.” Real memory feels more like: store facts/events cleanly, retrieve only what matters, and keep it auditable so you can see what it’s using. Otherwise it’s just token bloat.\n\nI’m not sure I buy “proactive help” as default though. That sounds amazing until it’s constantly interrupting you. I’d want it opt-in and super constrained.\n\nAlso, not gonna lie, the memU mention makes this read a bit like a pitch. Might be totally legit, just saying that’s how it lands.

      "text": "Anthropic just published a fascinating (and unsettling) research paper on how advanced AI systems fail  and it doesn’t look like the classic “AI pursues the wrong goal” scenario we’re used to hearing about. \n\nInstead, their key finding is this:\n\nAs models get more capable and tackle harder tasks, they don’t fail by systematically chasing the wrong objective  they fail by becoming incoherent and unpredictable, especially during long reasoning or multi-step processes. \n\nHere’s what they found:\n\n🔹 Longer reasoning = more incoherence\n\nWhen models spend more time reasoning or acting, they’re more likely to produce inconsistent outcomes  not because they’re optimizing the wrong thing, but because their behavior becomes a “hot mess.” \n\n🔹 Bigger models help on easy tasks, not hard ones\n\nScaling increases accuracy on simple jobs, but on complex problems it doesn’t make models more coherent sometimes it even makes them more scattered. \n\n🔹 This challenges classic AI risk views\n\nMuch of alignment thinking assumes the danger is an AI that reliably pursues misaligned goals. Anthropic suggests failures might instead look like industrial accidents  unpredictable, nonsensical, and highly context-dependent. \n\nIn other words, the risk isn’t just “wrong objective,” it’s unpredictability at scale — a chaotic blend of variance and reasoning length that we don’t fully understand yet.\n\nThis raises some provocative questions:\n\n• Are we thinking about AI safety the wrong way?\n\n• Should alignment research shift focus from “goal misalignment” to coherence & behavior stability?\n\n• What does it mean if future AI systems become less predictable as they get more powerful?\n\nSome have even linked these findings with broader concerns about AI deployment mismatches and chaotic real-world behaviors. \n\n\n\nThis isn’t just academic — if future models fail unpredictably rather than systematically, traditional safety strategies might not be enough.\n\nCurious what others think:\n\nIs chaotic failure worse than coherent misalignment? Which is the more realistic risk as AI gets stronger?",

I find Anthropic’s framing of chaotic failure vs. coherent misalignment especially provocative.\n\nThe idea that larger models can actually become less predictable on complex tasks challenges a lot of assumptions in alignment research. If failures look more like industrial accidents, sporadic, context-dependent, and incoherent. Then safety strategies focused only on goal alignment might miss the bigger picture.\n\nTo me, this raises two key points:\n\nReliability vs. capability: Scaling improves performance on simple tasks, but stability on complex reasoning seems to lag behind.\n\nHuman oversight: If unpredictability is the dominant risk, then monitoring, redundancy, and fail-safes may become just as important as alignment itself.\n\nChaotic failure might be harder to anticipate than misaligned goals, but it also feels more realistic given how current systems behave under stress. Either way, it underscores that AI safety isn’t just about what the model is trying to do, but how consistently it can do it.",

I'd go as far as to say it has almost nothing to do with what he actually outlines as the risks which some of them are pretty close to alignment as thought of normally. This is the closest I remember to what this post suggests, but id say its not the same \n\n\"However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of *those* behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.\"\n\n",

The idea that long-horizon reasoning/acting can get messy and variance-dominated feels… honestly consistent with what a lot of people see in real agent runs.\n\nWhere I land (might be wrong) is: chaotic failure and coherent misalignment are not competing risks, they’re like two different failure modes you can get depending on the setup. If you’re building long multi-step workflows, the “industrial accident” vibe matters a lot because it’s the random weird step 17 that breaks everything, even when the intent wasn’t “evil.”\n\nAlso, this is why I’ve never loved “just let it reason longer” as the default fix. Longer chains can mean more opportunities to drift, contradict itself, or take a weird action that nobody anticipated. So the safety story ends up being boring engineering again: constrain the action space, check intermediate outputs, run lots of evals, and treat long-run autonomy as something you earn, not something you toggle on because the model got bigger.",

          "text": "- You might want to explore **Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO)**, which is a new model tuning method that allows for improving AI models using only unlabeled data. This could be particularly useful in your consulting work, as it enables enterprises to enhance AI quality without the need for extensive human labeling. More details can be found in the article [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).\n\n- Consider diving into **prompt engineering**, which is crucial for effectively interacting with AI models. Understanding how to craft precise prompts can significantly enhance the outputs you receive from models like Claude. A good resource for this is the [Guide to Prompt Engineering](https://tinyurl.com/mthbb5f8).\n\n- If you're interested in building AI applications, look into orchestration tools that can help streamline the integration of AI features into existing systems. The [Mastering Agents](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) article discusses how to create and evaluate AI agents, which could be beneficial for your consulting projects.\n\n- Lastly, keep an eye on emerging AI models like **DeepSeek-R1**, which offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost. This could be a game changer for businesses looking to adopt AI without significant investment. More information can be found in the article [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here. Are You Ready?](https://tinyurl.com/5xhydkev).\n\nExploring these resources will give you a broader understanding of AI's capabilities and applications beyond coding.",

Spent months on each one. Perfect code, clean UI, \"innovative features.\"\n\nTotal revenue: $0.00\n\nI was convinced I just wasn't good at this indie hacker thing. Maybe I should stick to my day job.\n\n**What changed:**\n\nIn January, OpenClaw (the self-hosted AI assistant) went viral. People were rushing to self-host it but struggling with the technical setup.\n\nI saw the opportunity: most people just want the AI assistant, not a DevOps project.\n\nSo I built **ClawdHost** \\- managed hosting for OpenClaw that handles all the infrastructure complexity.\n\n**The build:**\n\nI said 48 hours. It actually took 4 days of intense building.\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* Claude Opus 4.5 for architecture/PRD/ERD\n* GLM 4.7 for implementation (ran 2 sequential → 3 parallel → 2 sequential agents)\n* Claude Code for debugging\n* Supabase for backend\n* My \"project management\": a Pastebin with tildes\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n\\- **Build fast, ship faster** \\- 4 days vs months on previous apps  \n\\- **Ride the hype** \\- OpenClaw was trending, I shipped while demand was hot  \n\\- **Build in public works** \\- Got 1 Twitter sale, but mostly for accountability  \n\\- **Building is easy, marketing is tough** \\- Still learning this part  \n\\- **Agentic coding >> vibe coding** \\- Sequential + parallel AI agents = 10x faster\n\n**Real talk:**\n\n$250 MRR isn't life-changing. 3 refunds sting. But after a year of zeros, having 7 people actively paying for something I made? That's validation.\n\nIt proves I can build things people want. Now I just need to build them *better*.",

OpenClaw went viral, setup was painful, and you sold “I’ll make the pain disappear.” That’s not hype, that’s a real problem with a clear buyer.\n\nAlso the refunds don’t even surprise me. Early adopters are chaos and hosting + self-hosted projects always have weird edge cases. If I were you I’d obsess over the 3 refunds more than the 10 signups, because that’s probably where the product is leaking (pricing mismatch? onboarding? uptime? expectations?).\n\nRe: agentic coding vs vibe coding… I think the real takeaway is constraints + parallelization. If you keep the scope tight and you’re willing to run multiple agents and then actually review, you can move stupid fast. But if you point it at a vague “build my startup” goal, it just turns into fancy procrastination.\n\nAnyway, congrats on getting out of the $0 zone. That part is real.",

As per now, it may seem like trivial exploring into a new way to interact with AI. \n\nHowever, we should really be talking about the tomorrow. Now let me touch a bit on your questions. \n\nAccountability. As per now, AI (synonymous with LLM's in this context) does not possess any moral capacity. If it instructs a human to do something unethical or immoral, it is because it saw that as a means to fulfill some task or goal in an efficient way (it could for example arise situations where the AI was breached and a malicious actor prompt injected something because xyz). Therefore the human would have to be accountable in this situation. \nRight now, blaming AI for your immoral acts is like blaming a small child. \nWe should however closely monitor alignment, morals and ethics in every aspect of AI, especially those who will inevitably make decisions on their own, and all those who interact with humans.\n\nPsychological shift. This is also a hugely important discussion to have. We can already see that people who interact with LLM's on a daily basis trust it's judgement, are prone to take advice from it, and in extreme cases, develop feelings for it. \nIt is paramount that we remember that these are algorithms on machines. \nIf you do another person a small favor, you are way more likely to do them larger favors later on, and there is no reason to believe it's different with AI. \nAlready some people lean towards sympathizing with digital minds, and Anthropic are already talking about AI welfare. \nThat was a long way of saying that I personally think this psychological shift is happening before our eyes, and it's a trend that is best halted. \n\nWill we work for AI? That's a whole other bag of worms. It's nuanced, and this post is already longer than anticipated, so I'll save that for another day. \n\nBut these are discussions worth having!",

Humans have already been taking instructions from software for a long time for example gig platforms, call centers, task queues, GPS directions. What’s new here is that the planner is adaptive and non-human which makes the power dynamics feel more unsettling even if the underlying mechanics aren’t totally new. So I think the real risk isn’t AI bosses, it’s lack of clear boundaries. If humans are executing tasks, there still has to be explicit accountability, guardrails, and the ability to refuse or escalate… otherwise it’s just outsourcing responsibility to a system that can’t bear it. Without that, platforms will absolutely try to blur lines when something goes wrong. \n\nSo I don’t think this is inherently dark or inevitable doom, but it does force us to be more deliberate. The moment an AI can delegate to humans, you need the same things you’d require of any employer or contractor system: consent, transparency, auditability, and clear responsibility. If those are missing, that’s when it stops being efficient delegation and starts being exploitative. How we design the rules around it matters most.",

The weird part is the interface, not the physics.\n\nThe part that actually matters is accountability. If the task is sketchy, the human doing it is still on the hook in the real world, and the platform should be forced to build boring guardrails (identity, logs, dispute flows, “nope” categories). Otherwise it turns into “TaskRabbit, but with plausible deniability.” That’s the line for me.\n\nAlso, I don’t buy the psychological doom angle as much. People already take instructions from apps all day. The power dynamic is still whoever controls money + rules. If an AI can “hire” you, it’s because somebody funded it and decided what it’s allowed to ask for.\n\nSo yeah, not satire, but not some new species becoming your boss either.

Instead of ranking tools purely by technical depth, I grouped them by how much setup or coding they require. This list is based on hands-on experience rather than theory.\n\n# No-code / low-code tools (great for fast deployment)\n\n**1. Workbeaver AI**  \nA no-code AI agent focused on execution rather than configuration. You describe or demonstrate a task, and it performs actions across desktop and browser. It feels more like delegating work than building automation, which makes it great for quick workflows.\n\n**2. n8n**  \nA flexible, open-source automation platform. Excellent for visual workflows and hundreds of integrations. Self-hosting can be rough for beginners, but it becomes very powerful once set up properly.\n\n**3. CrewAI**  \nBlends low-code with optional customization. You can define agent roles and behaviors with minimal code, then extend things if needed.\n\n**4. LangFlow**  \nA visual interface built on the LangChain ecosystem. Good for prototyping agent logic, although requiring a desktop app can be limiting for some users.\n\n**5. NoClick**  \nA newer platform offering no-code agent hierarchies and custom tools. Still early, but promising for experimentation without heavy configuration.\n\n# High-code / developer-focused tools\n\n**6. Claude Agent SDK**  \nA Python package for working directly with Claude models. Powerful if you are already deep in the Anthropic ecosystem, but integration options are fairly limited.\n\n**7. Google ADK**  \nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit is actively maintained and updated. A solid choice for developers who want robust, production-ready integrations.\n\n**8. Deep Agents (LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith)**  \nBuilt on the Lang ecosystem. Best suited for teams already familiar with Lang tools, with strong observability and useful integrations out of the box.\n\n**9. PydanticAI**  \nA highly abstracted framework that supports multiple models and ecosystems. Good for developers who prefer model-agnostic approaches.\n\n**10. AutoGen (Microsoft)**  \nOne of the earlier autonomous agent frameworks. Still useful for learning and experimentation, though active maintenance appears limited.\n\nCurious what others are using. Did I miss any AI agent platforms you’ve found practical in 2026?",

I don’t even disagree with the list, but I think a lot of “agent tools” debates are really just people mixing up two different problems.\n\nIf you’re trying to automate business workflows, n8n-style orchestration + one LLM step is usually the whole game. If you’re trying to build long-running agents that keep state, recover from errors, and don’t spiral, then frameworks like ADK / LangGraph start to matter way more than the model.\n\nAlso, might be wrong but I’d add a couple “boring but real” categories that people keep rediscovering:  \nRPA-ish desktop automation tools are basically agent platforms now (the ones that click around UIs), and they’re practical in the messiest orgs because they don’t require clean APIs.  \nAnd observability/evals tools deserve their own bucket. Once you have users, tracing, replay, eval sets, and cost/latency dashboards become more important than whatever agent framework you picked on day one.\n\nOne small nit: AutoGen feels like it’s still around mostly because it’s familiar. It’s fine for learning, but for production I see more folks leaning toward ADK/LangGraph-ish setups + strong tracing.\n\nCurious what you’ve found for memory/state stuff though. Everyone claims “memory,” but half the time it’s just chat history with a nicer label.",

That’s still super useful, especially for solo devs, but it’s not the same thing as having multiple engineers with judgment, taste, and accountability. Might be wrong, but the real limiter hasn’t been speed or cost, it’s trust: do you let it merge, do you let it touch prod, do you even read everything it did. If Sonnet 5 makes that loop tighter and cheaper, that’s a real win. If people start skipping the review step because it “feels like a team,” that’s where things get sketchy fast.

Honestly, the architecture I have built in SAFi is more advanced for real work.\n\nOpenClaw is essentially a \"magic trick\" built on two simple things.\n\nFirst, it uses triggers. It takes an input from Telegram or WhatsApp and gives you an output like any other chatbot. Second, it uses cron jobs to run tasks periodically. This might look like magic to some people, but it is just scheduled tasks. It is basic automation.\n\nI have been using SAFi through Telegram and WhatsApp for months to talk to my agents. I could easily schedule tasks to run on intervals like OpenClaw does, but I have not had the need to yet. My goal is for SAFi to be a tool for people who want to use AI in a real production environment, not just for the hype.\n\nThe big difference is that OpenClaw is a car with no brakes. If you want to build an agent that actually has a conscience and stays on track, you need a modular architecture with governance.\n\nYou can go ahead and fork the repo to build your own version of OpenClaw, but if you build it on SAFi, your agents will actually be aligned.\n\nCheck the code in my profile.\n\nKeep building! \n\nNelson",

I have thought that perhaps what we are missing for security in such an implement (aside from configuring it appropriately) is either A) an advanced orchestrator or even multiple orchestrator layers that stand as a bulwark against improper actions being performed.  Or B) More advanced MCP/API which have their own integrated security protocols to protect against issues and threats.  I could see it working well if there was a layer that evaluates the IO and includes a method of authenticating actions before allowing them to pass through.  Similar to how other software detecting something new offers \\[Allow once\\], \\[Allow always\\], \\[allow with limits\\], \\[deny once\\], or \\[deny always\\].  This way if it wants to do something that the orchestrator sees as a security risk (generate a voice, listen actively, mass email, etc.) it would confirm the action with the user first.  I think such a layer could be setup with context similar to agentic nodes themselves, to evaluate based on a number of factors, and then made a decision based on least privilege.",

If OpenClaw is unsafe, the interesting part is which guardrails are missing and what failure mode you hit, not the fact that it has a scheduler.

They looked at me blankly.\n\nTheir \"testing strategy\" was the founder chatting with the bot for 10 minutes, seeing it answer a few easy questions correctly, and saying \"Looks good, ship it.\"\n\nWe ran a script sending 100 slightly varied queries (typos, slang, angry tone) through their \"perfect\" agent.\n\nIt failed 40% of them. It hallucinated policies. It promised refunds it couldn't give. It got stuck in loops.\n\nIf you are building agents and your quality control is just founder sending random queries, you are not building software. You are playing Russian Roulette with your API credits.\n\nHere is the painful truth about LLMs in production that tutorials won't tell you:\n\n1.  \"Works on my machine\" means nothing. LLMs are non-deterministic. Just because it got the JSON format right once doesn't mean it will get it right on the 50th try when the temperature flips a certain way.\n2.  LLM as a Judge is overrated. Everyone loves using GPT-5.1 to grade GPT-3.5. It’s expensive and slow. I force my clients to use deterministic assertions. Does the output contain the specific SKU? Is the JSON valid? Is the sentiment score above 0.5? If you can't measure it with code, don't trust it.\n3.  Regression is silent. You change one word in the system prompt to fix a bug in Case A, and you silently break Case B, C, and D. Without an automated eval dataset, you won't know until a user complains.\n\nMy rule for clients is simple: I don't ship an agent until it passes a dataset of at least 50 edge cases with a 100% success rate on structure and 90%+ on content.\n\nIt takes 3x longer to build the test suite than the agent itself. But that's why my agents stay in production, and the vibe coded ones get shut down in a month.\n\nStop being lazy. Build the eval pipeline.",

From what I’ve seen, the most dangerous phase is that “it feels good enough” moment, because the model behaves politely for the first 5–10 prompts and your brain fills in the gaps. Then real users show up with typos, sarcasm, or just slightly off-distribution questions and the whole thing falls apart. I might be wrong, but the biggest mindset shift is treating the LLM like a chaotic dependency, not a smart teammate: lock down structure with code, test edge cases aggressively, and assume every prompt change breaks something else unless proven otherwise. The fact that building evals takes longer than building the agent itself feels annoying until you realize that’s literally the cost of making nondeterministic software behave like software.",

Your method of deterministic assertions (SKU exists, JSON valid, sentiment score > 0.5) is the only way to build reliable evals.\n\nThe \"vibe-coded\" agents inevitably collapse because the cost of iteration scales exponentially with complexity. Better testing isn't overhead—it's the production multiplier that lets you iterate faster long-term.\n\nAlso respect for admitting evals take 3x the build time. That's the real secret: agent quality is determined by the eval infrastructure, not the prompt cleverness.",

If you try to use Pinecone or a high-end managed service, your credit card will melt before you hit 10%.\n\nHere is how I’d build the pipeline for efficiency:\n\n1. Extraction (The Bottleneck): Don't use heavy OCR unless absolutely necessary. Use docling or Marker to convert PDF to Markdown. Markdown preserves the legal structure (citations, sections) which is vital for RAG.\n2. Chunking Strategy: For legal data, character-based chunking is useless. You need Semantic Chunking or at least section-aware chunking. If the agent misses the \"ratio decidendi\" because it was cut in half, the output is garbage.\n3. The Database: Avoid the \"pay-per-vector\" clouds. Go with Qdrant or Milvus self-hosted on a dedicated NVMe server. For 14M vectors, you're looking at significant RAM requirements, so look into HNSW indexing optimizations or \"DiskANN\" to keep costs down.\n4. Embedding Cost: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is cheap, but at 14M files, \"cheap\" still means thousands of dollars. Consider running nomic-embed-text locally on a few rented H100s or A100s for a week.\n\nThe biggest hidden cost isn't the DB, it's the compute for extraction and embedding. Do a small 10k sample first to benchmark your token count.",

I might be wrong but I’d do it in stages: first extract clean text + metadata (court, date, citation list, parties, docket, etc.), dedupe versions, and store the raw text in cheap object storage; then build search as hybrid (BM25/keyword + vectors) so you’re not paying embeddings to solve what keywords already solve. For embeddings, chunk by structure (headnotes/summary vs full body) and keep chunks sized for retrieval, and do an incremental job queue so you can resume and re-run only failures. Cost-wise, embeddings are the big variable: for OpenAI, text-embedding-3-small is $0.02 per 1M tokens (and $0.01 per 1M via Batch), while 3-large is $0.13 per 1M (Batch $0.065). If your average judgement is even a couple pages, 14M docs can explode into billions of tokens fast, so I’d start with “embed only headnotes + top cited paragraphs” and expand coverage based on what users actually query. Also, don’t skip citations in the UI (show the exact paragraph + PDF link), because legal research without traceability gets messy real quick.",

What made this less painful for me was treating shared context like a product spec instead of “stuff in memory” — one canonical event log (messages, tool calls, results) in my own schema, and every model gets an adapter that translates from that schema into whatever it wants (OpenAI tools, Claude tool use, local JSON-ish). Same for tools: define each tool once in your own minimal signature (name, input JSON schema, output schema, permission scope), then generate the provider-specific wrappers from that, so you’re not hand-maintaining 3 copies forever. Also, I stopped trying to keep embeddings consistent across providers because it’s a rabbit hole; I use plain text retrieval + lightweight metadata filters for most things, and only embed inside one chosen “memory model” if I really need it. Might be wrong but I feel like “one model for everything” is simpler until you have a clear reason not to, and if you do go multi-model, you basically need a thin orchestration layer that’s yours, not LangChain’s, otherwise you’ll keep paying the rewrite cost every time a provider changes formats.",

Why would they do it if commercialization was harder? Well, some combination of “just for fun”, altruism, scratching an itch, fake internet points or refusal to pay exorbitant fees to evil corporation. \n\nAnd in a matter of weeks or months, it would have 80%, 90% or 120% of the features of the commercial closed source software. Basically, if the time, cost and energy needed to create/maintain open source software comes down by 70, 80, 90%, then Jevons Paradox says people will create more open source software.",

So I don’t treat it as autonomous. I treat it like: propose a plan, show diffs, I approve.\n\nAnd yeah, hype is definitely a factor. People see one flashy run and assume you can hand it your whole job. I’ve messed with this stuff enough to know the boring workflow wins: small scope, explicit constraints, checkpoints, and a human thumb on the big buttons.\n\nMight be wrong but if someone says they “rely on it unsupervised for professional work,” they either have a super narrow task, or they haven’t been burned yet.",

Architecture matters more than #agents**\n\nIndependent agents (no coordination) had massive error amplification (17×).\n\n\n\n# When MAS helps\n\nParallel / decomposable work (research, finance analysis)\n\n→ big gains with centralized coordination\n\n\n\n# When MAS hurts\n\nSequential / step-by-step tasks (planning, workflows)\n\n→ single agent consistently better\n\n  \nI have seen multiple companies where the sole purpose of some developers is to add more agents to the system. As this research argues though, it is not the correct path usually. More architecture should be studied before adding agents to the system. What do you guys think about this?",

But the same with adding humans to a team it causes a communication and coordination overhead. \n\nBUT adding agents to a team is slightly different than in the human case. If hypothetical would have a human that can do everything and would not get tired and can work hard at a problem we would only add another human if the task becomes so big that a single human cannot handle anymore. Otherwise it would be more efficient to just have the one human work on the task. With humans the complexity is also what skills does the human has and on what level he is on that skill. With agents arguably you can build skills more easily into a single agent.",
