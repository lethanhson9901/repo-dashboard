      "text": "Over the holiday break, like a lot of other devs, I sat around and started building stuff. One of them was a personal assistant agent that I call MARVIN (yes, that Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). MARVIN runs on Claude Code as the harness.\n\nAt first I just wanted him to help me keep up with my emails, both personal and work. Then I added calendars. Then Jira. Then Confluence, Attio, Granola, and more. Before I realized it, I'd built 15+ integrations and MCP servers into a system that actually knows how I work.\n\nBut it was just a pet project. I didn't expect it to leave my laptop.\n\nA few weeks ago, I showed a colleague on our marketing team what MARVIN could do. She asked if she could use him too. I onboarded her, and 30  minutes later she messaged me: \"I just got something done in 30 minutes that normally would've taken me 4+ hours. He's my new bestie.\"\n\nShe started telling other colleagues. Yesterday I onboarded two more. Last night, another. One of them messaged me almost immediately: \"Holy shit. I forgot to paste a Confluence link I was referring to and MARVIN beat me to it.\" MARVIN had inferred from context what doc he needed, pulled it from Confluence, and updated his local files before he even asked.\n\nFour people in two weeks, all from word of mouth. That's when I realized this thing might actually be useful beyond my laptop.\n\n**Here's what I've learned about building agents:**\n\n**1. Real agents are** ***messy***\\*\\*. They have to be customizable.\\*\\*\n\nIt's not one size fits all. MARVIN knows my writing style, my goals, my family's schedule, my boss's name. He knows I hate sycophantic AI responses. He knows not to use em dashes in my writing. That context makes him useful. Without it, he'd just be another chatbot.\n\n**2. Personality matters more than I expected.**\n\nMARVIN is named after the Paranoid Android for a reason. He's sardonic. He sighs dramatically before checking my email. When something breaks, he says \"Well, that's exactly what I expected to happen.\" This sounds like a gimmick, but it actually makes the interaction feel less like using a tool and more like working with a (slightly pessimistic) colleague. I find myself actually wanting to work with him, which means I use him more, which means he gets better.\n\n**3. Persistent memory is hard. Context rot is real.**\n\nMARVIN uses a bookend approach to the day. `/marvin` starts the session by reading `state/current.md` to see what happened yesterday, including all tasks and context. `/end` closes the session by breaking everything into commits, generating an end-of-day report, and updating `current.md` for tomorrow. Throughout the day, `/update` checkpoints progress so context isn't lost when Claude compacts or I start another session.\n\n**4. Markdown is the new coding language for agents.**\n\nStructured formatting helps MARVIN stay organized. Skills live in markdown files. State lives in markdown. Session logs are markdown. Since there's no fancy UI, my marketing colleagues can open any .md file in Cursor and see exactly what's happening. Low overhead, high visibility.\n\n**5. You have to train your agent. You won't one-shot it.**\n\nIf I hired a human assistant, I'd give them 3 months before expecting them to be truly helpful. They'd need to learn processes, find information, understand context. Agents are the same. I didn't hand MARVIN my email and say \"go.\" I started with one email I needed to respond to. We drafted a response together. When it was good, I gave MARVIN feedback and had him update his skills. Then we did it again. After 30 minutes of iteration, I had confidence that MARVIN could respond in my voice to emails that needed attention.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nI've been training and using MARVIN for 3 weeks. I've done more in a week than I used to do in a month. In the last 3 weeks I've:\n\n* 3 CFPs submitted\n* 2 personal blogs published + 5 in draft\n* 2 work blogs published + 3 in draft\n* 6+ meetups created with full speaker lineups\n* 4 colleagues onboarded\n* 15+ integrations built or enhanced\n* 25 skills operational\n\nI went from \"I want to triage my email\" to \"I have a replicable AI chief of staff that non-technical marketers are setting up themselves\" in 3 weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'm stepping away from work earlier to spend time with my kids. I'm not checking slack or email during dinner. I turn them off. I know that MARVIN will help me stay on top of things tomorrow. I'm taking time for myself, which hasn't happened in a long time. I've always felt underwater with my job, but now I've got it in hand.",

They get updated regularly as I work with Marvin.\n\nOne skill that I love is the writing skill that I've added. It has samples of my writing, the tone I typically use, and patterns that I follow. \n\nmy ideology around skill creation is to create tons of skills and then analyze how often I'm using them at the end of the week, and then either combine, delete, or update them.",

Built something similar back in 2019 for Slack workflows and yeah, everyone loved it until the first breaking change hit and suddenly I became unpaid IT support.\n\nThat said... the markdown-as-state thing is actually smart, and if non-technical marketers can onboard themselves you've solved the real problem. Just don't be shocked when one of them asks you to add \"just one more integration.\"",

Using a markdown file for state is good, and that's how I operated until I wrote clio.  It has cross-session context recall (recall history from earlier sessions), long-term memory (pattern memory learned from code), short-term memory with YaRN and automatic importance weighting, and you can even resume any session.  Since it's stateful, it doesn't really suffer the typical context rot problems that stateless agents have.",

          "text": "Love the write-up. It nails a bunch of things that get lost in most agent implementations. What really stands out is that MARVIN isn’t “smart” because of the model… he’s useful because you treated him like a long-term system and a teammate, not a chatbot. The bookend workflow, explicit state, markdown-as-infrastructure, and gradual training loop are exactly the patterns people only discover after things break in production.\n\nA couple of things you surfaced that feel especially important (and under-talked-about):\n- Personalization beats general intelligence. Knowing your style, constraints, and annoyances is way more valuable than another benchmark point.\n- Personality isn’t fluff. It changes adoption. If people enjoy interacting with the agent, they’ll use it more, and usage is what actually makes agents better.\n- Memory is operational, not magical. The start/update/end pattern is a very pragmatic way to fight context rot without pretending vector search is “memory.”\n- Training agents looks like onboarding humans. That analogy is dead-on and something most people underestimate.\n\nAlso, the fact that non-technical colleagues are onboarding themselves is the strongest signal in the whole post. That’s usually where “cool demo” turns into “this might actually be a product.”\n\nIf you ever write a follow-up, I’d be really curious about:\n- What you refuse to let MARVIN do autonomously\n- Where he still fails in annoying ways\n- How much of this you think is transferable vs inherently personal\n\nThis feels like one of the clearest examples I’ve seen of what “agents that actually help” look like in practice, not theory.",

I see decks all the time promising \"autonomous employees\" that run your business while you sleep.\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nI build these things for a living. And there is a massive difference between an **Agent** and a **Workflow**.\n\nMost of you are building Workflows.\n*   **Step 1:** Get email.\n*   **Step 2:** Summarize with GPT-4.\n*   **Step 3:** Save to Notion.\n*   **Step 4:** Slack me.\n\nThat is not an agent. That is a linear script. It’s a recipe. If Step 2 fails, the whole thing dies. It’s rigid. It’s predictable. It’s safe.\n\nA real **Agent** is messy.\nAn agent doesn't have a list of steps. It has a **Goal** and a **Toolkit**.\n*   **Goal:** \"Find me a lead in the healthcare space.\"\n*   **Toolkit:** Google Search, LinkedIn scraper, Email verifier.\n\nThe agent decides *on its own* what to do first. Maybe it searches Google. If that fails, it tries LinkedIn. If the email bounces, it tries a different verification tool. It loops. It thinks. It hallucinates (sometimes).\n\nThe smartest agent I ever built wasn't the one with the best prompt; it was the one that knew when to stop and ask a human for help because it realized it was stuck.\n\nIf you want to build real agents, stop focusing on the \"AI\" part and start focusing on the \"guardrails\" part. Because unlike a workflow, an agent can and will go off the rails if you let it.\n\nThat’s the difference between a toy and a tool. And trust me, you want to be building tools.",

              "text": "So i asked the chatbot on your site how your own bot works\n\n\"Sure! Here’s a quick overview of how AINIRO’s AI chatbot technology works.\n\nWhen you create a chatbot with us, we **scrape and crawl your website** to gather all your public content — pages, articles, FAQs, etc. That data is then transformed into a **VSS and RAG-based knowledge base**, which becomes the chatbot’s “context.”\n\nWhen a user asks a question, the chatbot uses **semantic AI search** to find the most relevant snippets from your data. These snippets are sent to **OpenAI’s GPT model** (like GPT‑4), which uses them to generate an accurate, context‑aware answer.\n\nIf the chatbot needs to perform a task — for example, search the web, scrape a site, or fetch a database record — it can trigger **AI functions** (Hyperlambda workflows). These functions are executed automatically, and the results are fed back into the conversation.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1. User asks a question.\n2. Chatbot finds relevant data from your knowledge base.\n3. If needed, it executes a function (like a web search or database query).\n4. GPT generates a natural, human‑like answer using your data.\n\nThis combination of **your data + AI reasoning + automation** is what makes our chatbots so powerful — they can answer questions, integrate with your systems, and even take actions automatically.\"\n\nIs this accurate? If so it doesn't sound like you spent exactly 12 years creating this. I don't remember GPT 4 being around 10+ years ago.\n\nAlso there's this thing called botpress. I think they do what you do better. They beat you to market lmao. \n\nI'm kind of sad I hated on your comment. i agreed with you in the first half until I realized this project is alot like most other start ups.",

Long story made short, I threw *\"everything\"* in at AI chatbot, and put Magic Cloud *\"on hold\"* for a while. Of course, building said chatbots **\\*inside\\*** of Magic Cloud, synergistically continuing progression of the platform.\n\nThis created a very comfortable *\"economic breathing room\"* for me, due to the stuff you find on the *\"/buy\"* link of the above website. But in 2025, I have (almost to the point of dangerously) spent all my resources and going *\"all in\"* on doing what I set out to do already arguably back in 2006 with *\"Gaia Ajax\"*, which is to simplify the art of creating software down to absurdity.\n\nNow in a weird way, some *\"Swedish company\"* beat me to the finish line, but that doesn't mean the party's over. They're a closed system, my shit is 100% open sauce (MIT license). In fact, the only *\"moat\"* I've been holding back on, is the training files for the Hyperlambda Generator (my LLM, 40,000+ training files, super high quality), and probably on pair with Gemini and Claude!\n\nHowever, for now, due to low bandwidth, I'm giving away free usage here too - Implying, at the moment, it's the only platform on earth you can use for free, as long as you're paying for your own OpenAI tokens (GPT5.2), and once I start charging for access to the Hyperlambda LLM, you can still fork my shit from GitHub, install it on your server, and have everything you built so far fully functioning ...\n\nQuality? On frontend it's probably miles behind Lovable and Bolt42. Backend it's easily way ahead, on everything you've literally seen. Don't believe me? Check out the *\"natural language API\"* thing ...!! ;)\n\nAnd the reasons I can do that, and give away *\"free tokens\"*, even though I'm literally a single person, with probably no more *\"means\"* than most of those reading this, is simply because my Hyperlambda Generator consumes 0.00000000001% of the resources that the crappy garbage code most people use LLMs for ...\n\nHint; Check out *\"Hyperlambda\"* ... ;)\n\nInterpret the last sentence from above as you wish ...",

That was frustrating at first. But also sparked a different kind of curiosity.\n\nSo over the past 48 hours, together with Claude Code, we built a fully open-source project: Kuse Cowork.\n\n**Native Rust, Zero-Wrappers:** This isn't just another agent wrapper. It’s a ground-up implementation in Rust. No heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on OpenCode/AgentSDK. Just raw performance and a tiny binary.  \nDocker Sandboxing: Since agents execute code, security is paramount. Open Cowork runs commands inside a transient Docker container.\n\n**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or run entirely offline with Ollama/Local LLMs. You own the keys and the privacy.\n\n**Skills, and MCPs:** It can already handle complex document tasks (PDF, Excel, etc.) out of the box.\n\n**The Development Story:** The most interesting part is that the builder fellow had zero Rust experience before this weekend. It was a surreal experience: an AI agent (Claude Code) helping me build a faster, secure, and open-source version of \"itself.\"\n\nIt's still very early, and there's a long roadmap ahead.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Docker sandboxing helps with blast radius, but operators still need clear logs, versioning, and a way to reconstruct what the agent saw and decided at the time. That is usually where escalations come from.\n\nI would be curious how you are thinking about audit trails and recovery. Not just “it failed,” but which prompt, tool call, file state, and assumption led to that outcome. Speed matters, but explainability is what makes these safe to run outside of a demo.",

JS heavy sites that load half the content late. Random layout changes. Logins expiring. Cloudflare or basic bot checks suddenly blocking requests that worked yesterday. Even when it works, it feels fragile. One small site update and the whole pipeline falls over.\n\nI have tried the usual stack. Requests + BeautifulSoup is fine until it isn’t. Playwright and Puppeteer work but feel heavy and sometimes unpredictable at scale. Headless browsers behave differently from real users. And once you add agents on top, debugging becomes painful because failures are not always reproducible.\n\nLately I have been experimenting with more “agent friendly” approaches where the browser layer is treated as infrastructure instead of glue code. I have seen tools like hyperbrowser mentioned in this context, basically giving agents a more stable way to interact with real websites instead of brittle scraping scripts. Still early for me, so not claiming it solves everything.\n\nI am genuinely curious what people here are using in production. Are you sticking with traditional scraping and just accepting breakage? Using full browser automation everywhere? Paying for third party APIs? Or building some custom hybrid setup?\n\nWould love to hear what has actually held up over time, not just what works in demos.",

That helped more than the specific library choice.\n\nPlaywright has been the least painful for us long term, but only once we accepted the overhead and built guardrails around it. Where it really falls down is when people expect agents to just handle breakage automatically. In practice, you still need someone owning selectors, login flows, and change detection. Paying for APIs made sense in a few narrow cases, mostly because the cost of babysitting scrapers was worse.

That is to use the internet search tools/agent via API.\n\nIt can get quite expensive if you need to do a lot of searches, but depending what you benefit from it, it might be worth it.\n\nScraping works better if you need to get contents of a lot of websites and it not mattering too much if some websites cant be scraped or if what you scraped is exactly up to date. But LLM agent searchig is better if you need precise information of some exact stuff that needs to be up to date and it not being blocked as much.\n\nFor example the tool i made with gemini, which gathers a lot of data and thus needs to make multiple searches to gather data from one company costs like 2€ per 100 companies searched. Also this is quite slow with 100 company informations taking like 1.5 hours to do (but wouod be possible to run multiple at the same time, but they might search duplicate information as one agent does not know what the other is doing at the same time). Which is definitely tons more than what scraping and searching from scraped stuff would cost, but easily justifiable cost for many use cases. But searching stuff you dont actually need with those prices would be bit stupid waste of money.",

When they do scrape, they treat it like an integration with monitoring, contract tests on key pages, alerting on extraction deltas, and a fast rollback path, not a script you set and forget. For JS sites, Playwright tends to be the least bad option, but the real win is designing your extractor around stable anchors, like IDs, data attributes, and page semantics, plus accepting you will need ongoing maintenance. The best setups I’ve seen are hybrid, API where possible, browser automation for a small subset, and a clear policy that “blocked by anti bot” is a product constraint, not a debugging challenge.",

That statement was clearly about human readers, but what we are seeing now is that the same principles also benefit machine readers.\n\nClean Code was never just about aesthetics. It is about intent, structure, and reducing cognitive load. If code is understandable for humans, LLMs benefit almost automatically, because they rely on the same signals such as naming, cohesion, separation of concerns, and local reasoning.\n\nWhat has changed is the value of inline context. Not heavy Javadoc-style documentation everywhere, but short explanations of why something is done the way it is. Whether that is a method comment, a block comment, or a small inline note does not really matter.\n\nThe key point is simple. Code should be written to be read. First by humans, and now increasingly by AI as well. If your codebase is readable, structured, and explicit about intent, AI tooling does not feel bolted on. It just works better.\n\nSo I agree with the observation in this thread. The success is not accidental. It is the natural result of long established software engineering principles paying off in a new context.",

From my own experience studying how teams adopt tools in high-governance environments, this model seems like an excellent way to ensure knowledge isn't just stored, but actively accessible and useful across different roles.\n\nIn a lot of regulated environments, where workflows often cross over complex approval chains and require extensive documentation, this kind of living documentation system can help cut through a lot of friction. As teams handle handoffs between departments or roles, ensuring your codebase and your documentation are maintained with equal care is crucial for preventing miscommunication.\n\nAlso, I can see this having a huge impact on onboarding time, a self-service model powered by AI means new hires can get up to speed faster while also allowing existing team members to easily maintain and update knowledge.\n\nI’m curious if you’ve noticed any friction in how your team interacts with this system when it comes to more complex, cross-functional workflows.

We design defensively from day one now, because leadership always asks what happens when it’s wrong, not how impressive it looked in testing. Treating human input as adversarial forces clearer boundaries between reasoning, execution, and validation, which is the only way to make these systems survivable under real volume.

      "text": "NVIDIA’s research made it clear that the real cost problem in AI agents isn’t model quality, its orchestration teams keep using massive frontier models for tiny, deterministic tasks that small models can handle faster and far cheaper. In real production systems, most agent steps are boring, repetitive and rule-bound, yet people still pay frontier-model prices for them, which kills margins as usage grows. The insight from these papers is that intelligence comes from routing work correctly, not throwing a giant model at everything and that’s why orchestrating specialized SLMs and only escalating to heavyweight reasoning when uncertainty is high leads to systems that are both cheaper and more reliable. This approach turns AI from a flashy demo into something you can actually run in production without panic over costs and if anyone here wants to explore how to apply this setup to their own agents, I’m happy to guide.",

          "text": "It sounds like you're encountering some common challenges with AI agents when they move beyond structured environments. Here are a few thoughts on the topic:\n\n- **Brittleness in Dynamic Environments**: Many agents struggle with dynamic web pages due to issues like changing DOM structures, authentication flows, and inconsistent UI states. This can lead to failures that are hard to debug.\n\n- **Execution vs. Reasoning**: As you've noted, the problems often stem from execution rather than reasoning. Agents may be capable of understanding tasks but falter when it comes to interacting with unpredictable web interfaces.\n\n- **Infrastructure Perspective**: Treating the browser or execution environment as infrastructure is an interesting approach. By providing a stable environment for agents to operate, you can potentially reduce the number of failures and make debugging easier.\n\n- **Guardrails and Specialized Environments**: Some developers opt for heavy guardrails to manage interactions with UI elements, while others may use specialized environments or tools designed to handle the complexities of web automation more effectively.\n\nIf you're looking for more insights or specific frameworks that address these issues, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "I get it, AI has made it easier to build software, but it’s not as if you can magically do months worth of coding in days or even weeks.\n\nHere’s the pattern I’ve discovered:\n\nThere are a bunch of creators who have hyped people up, saying you do not need to have coding knowledge to build AI systems. Is it true? No.\n\nUnless your job is to build small demos/MVPs or content on AI.\n\nYou might be able to sell your “product” by showing your leads the automation you built on n8n but when it’s time to deploy it into the real world, it’ll fail on day 1.\n\nHere’s a recent case study from one of my leads:\n\nThey needed a WhatsApp reservation and admin system for a network of \\~9000 restaurants.\n\nSo they did what most people feel is the logical solution, hire developers.\n\nThe developers that they had, built a WhatsApp bot using n8n. They showed it to the client, it worked fine. Because obviously it’s a simple chatbot so you can’t really do much with it except talk.\n\nCan you jailbreak it? Piece of cake.\n\nDoes it have any logical awareness? No.\n\nIs it anywhere close to a usable demo? Not at all.\n\nSo they start reaching out to people who can actually build the system. That’s where I come into picture.\n\nThey tell me, they already have a system built “halfway” and need me to finish it in the next 3 days (that too for free lmfao, I’ll get to this part later).\n\nMy CTO sits with their developer and sees the system they had.\n\nSurprise! The system is just an n8n template copy pasted with vibe coding done all over (the guy didn’t even remove the ChatGPT comments in the code).\n\nSo I tell them, that this cannot be done within 3 days. Your system is pretty much useless, we’ll have to build everything from scratch. We can give you a small demo in the next 12 days, but that requires a certain upfront payment so that we can start working.\n\nThat’s where he paused and told “he’ll talk to his partners”.\n\nApparently all of their budget was already allocated to marketing, they hired a lot of sales people and could only allocate the budget for “API Token costs”.\n\nSo yeah, we’re not going forward with them.\n\nP.S. they would’ve paid us once 4-5 restaurants would’ve found the system useful, then they’d recommend it to the 6th restaurant and this time charge money.\n\nNow here comes the issue: People have learned how to put together different blocks on no code tools and call it a day. But someone who had actual coding knowledge knows that it’s only the start.\n\nHere’s the things which were missing from the WhatsApp n8n automation they had:\n\n1. Edge cases.\n\nNobody tested how the system would reply if there were unwanted inputs, which is like the 90% of human input. The automation kept talking rubbish when things went out of context.\n\n2. No guard rails.\n\nIt was extremely easy to jailbreak the system. Few fishy prompts and it would give away every single internal data to the user.\n\n3. Sky high costs.\n\nThe workflow had no structure. The vibecoded schema would have cost about 10-20$ on an average per user. Rest you can calculate how costly the operation would be if they even got 10,000 users :) (Apparently they kept pushing every single thing through LLM and the tokens would’ve kept compounding overtime, not gonna go into details).\n\n4. No GDPR knowledge.\n\nBeing a bad developer is one thing, but when it comes to WhatsApp, how come people don’t think about the GDPR rules??? Unless you’re asking for trouble.\n\n5. Overpromises.\n\nAI can do everything! Add unlimited features and make revenue based promises to the clients!\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause people are underestimating how hard it is to really create a scalable and usable AI system.\n\nThere are thousands of people selling themselves as one man dev team who can apparently build saas level systems on his own that too for free.\n\nWhy for free? Because no one hires them, I mean why should they? When your services are pretty much useless.\n\nBut when new business owners enter this market, they get a feeling that AI has made software development very easy, cheap and almost free. So they have sky high expectations. Every single guy out there is legit selling his “business changing automation” for free. Is that how software industry works? NO.\n\nThese no code tools have only added more to the noise. I see so many people who have made absurd promises to their clients which apparently AI can magically solve. They promise to give a demo + result for free. Then they start building using no code tools, fail miserably, try to find builders, get faced by the fact that even demos need some capital to be built, ultimately they are simply unable to deliver.\n\nConclusion? AI has not made the market cheap, but more complex. People who do not have good software development knowledge CANNOT build scalable AI systems just because they are good at operating no code tools.\n\nSo if you’re a business owner, watch out. It’s hard to find the right people for the job when there’s so much noise.\n\nPro tip: if someone is providing you something for free, chances are. It was worth the same.",

Most of these glued together systems have no visibility or brakes, so the first failure turns into a customer trust problem, not a technical one.\n\nAI did not make systems cheaper, it moved the cost into design, guardrails, and accountability.

I just finished a deep dive into how **Small Language Models (SLMs)** are actually powering the next generation of **Autonomous Agents**.\n\nHere are a few things I found fascinating:\n\n* **Zero Latency:** Running AI locally on your NPU means no more waiting for cloud responses.\n* **Privacy:** Since the data stays on your phone, it’s finally safe to use AI for sensitive work.\n* **Specialization:** These tiny \"Specialists\" are now outperforming massive \"Generalist\" models in specific tasks like coding and medical diagnostics.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of how this tech is changing the game for autonomous agents this year and what we can expect next. If you're interested in the technical side or just want to know how to keep your AI data private, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.\n\n**I’ll leave the link to the full breakdown in the comments if anyone wants to dive deeper!** 🚀\n\nWhat do you think? Are you moving your workflows to local SLMs yet, or are you still relying on the cloud?",

Over long-running tasks, they usually have no plan, lose context and their execution gets messy.\n\nMore capable agents like Claude Code and Manus get around this by following a common pattern: they plan first, externalize working context (files) and break work into isolated sub-tasks.\n\nDeep Agents from LangChain are really the next level, which essentially package this pattern into a reusable runtime. you call `create_deep_agent(...)` and get a StateGraph that:\n\n* plans explicitly\n* delegates work to sub-agents\n* keeps its state in files instead of bloating the prompt\n\nEach piece is implemented as middleware (To-do list middleware, Filesystem middleware, Subagent middleware).\n\nConceptually it looks like this:\n\n    User goal\n      ↓\n    Deep Agent (LangGraph StateGraph)\n      ├─ Plan: write_todos → updates \"todos\" in state\n      ├─ Delegate: task(...) → runs a subagent with its own tool loop\n      ├─ Context: ls/read_file/write_file/edit_file → persists working notes/artifacts\n      ↓\n    Final answer\n\nIt push key parts into explicit state (e.g. `todos` \\+ files + messages), but the main thing I noticed was visibility over frontend.\n\nI wired it up with CopilotKit - Infrastructure for building AI copilots into any app.\n\nIt keeps the frontend in sync with what the agent is doing by streaming events and state updates in real time (using AG-UI protocol under the hood).\n\nDeep Agents is really good at multi-step workflows & CopilotKit as the orchestration + UI layer.

And wiring it up with CopilotKit for real‑time visibility makes a lot of sense, especially for multi‑step tasks where you want transparency. Definitely going to check out that job search demo.",

          "text": "It's common to feel overwhelmed when diving into building agents, especially with the plethora of tools and frameworks available. Here are some thoughts that might resonate:\n\n- **Start Small**: Instead of aiming for a complex agent, consider a simple use case. For example, automating a repetitive task you do daily, like summarizing emails or gathering data from a website. This can help build confidence without the pressure of perfection.\n\n- **Use Existing Templates**: Platforms like Apify offer templates that can jumpstart your projects. For instance, the [CrewAI](https://tinyurl.com/jc5bza4w) framework provides a structured way to define agents and integrate them with tools, which might lower the barrier for you.\n\n- **Focus on a Specific Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in your daily routine. This could be anything from social media analysis to automating data entry. When you have a clear problem to solve, it can guide your development process.\n\n- **Set Time Limits**: Allocate a specific amount of time to work on your agent. This can help combat perfectionism and keep you moving forward. Even if you don't finish, you'll have made progress.\n\n- **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities can provide motivation and inspiration. Sharing your struggles might lead to suggestions or collaboration opportunities that can help you overcome hurdles.\n\n- **Iterate and Improve**: Remember that your first agent doesn't have to be perfect. Build something functional, then iterate on it. Each version can improve based on feedback and your own experiences.\n\nIf you're looking for a starting point, consider checking out the [AI agent workflow](https://tinyurl.com/3rppepvb) for insights on building agents that query datasets. It might spark some ideas for your own projects.",

          "text": "- It sounds like you've encountered a common challenge in AI agent development. Many developers find that as they refine their agents' reasoning capabilities, the real hurdles often arise from the execution environment rather than the logic itself.\n- Issues like inconsistent web app behavior, changing page structures, and authentication problems can significantly impact an agent's performance, even if its reasoning is sound.\n- This realization often leads to a shift in focus from purely improving cognitive aspects to enhancing the stability and reliability of the execution environment.\n- Treating execution as infrastructure can help isolate problems and streamline debugging, allowing for a clearer distinction between cognitive failures and environmental issues.\n- Many in the community have shared similar experiences, noting that as they improve their prompts and logic, they increasingly face challenges related to system boundaries and real-world interactions.\n\nFor further insights on building and orchestrating AI agents, you might find the following resource helpful: [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3).",

      "text": "**The use case:** \n\nYou want a small model fine-tuned on a specific task (text classification, SQL generation, tool calling, etc.) but don't want to deal with data formatting, training infrastructure, or deployment configs.\n\n**What the agent does:**\n\nInstead of running CLI commands yourself, you describe the task in natural language. Claude figures out:\n\n1. Which task type fits your problem (QA, classification, tool calling, RAG)\n2. How to convert your messy input data into proper training format\n3. Whether the task is even learnable (runs teacher evaluation first)\n4. Training orchestration and progress monitoring\n5. How to package and deploy the result\n\nThe skill wraps our distil-cli and reads the docs to figure out the right commands and parameters.\n\n**Example conversation:**\n\n```bash\nMe: I have conversation logs in ./data where I asked for SQL queries. \n    Train a model that can do this locally.\n\nClaude: → Analyzes the data format\n        → Creates job_description.json, config.yaml, train.jsonl, test.jsonl\n        → Runs teacher eval (DeepSeek-V3 scores 80%)\n        → Kicks off distillation training\n        → Downloads 2.2GB GGUF when done\n        → Writes deployment script for Ollama\n```\n\nTotal hands-on time: maybe 10 minutes of chatting. Training runs in the background.\n\n**What makes it agentic:**\n\n- Reads documentation to understand available commands\n- Makes decisions about task type and data format based on your description\n- Interprets evaluation metrics and recommends whether to proceed\n- Handles errors and retries\n- Can write follow-up code (deployment scripts, test apps) using the trained model\n\n**Results from a Text2SQL test:**\n\n| Model | Accuracy (LLM-as-a-Judge) |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| Base Qwen3 0.6B | 36% |\n| Teacher (DeepSeek-V3) | 80% |\n| Agent-trained 0.6B | 74% |\n\nThe agent got a 0.6B model to nearly match a state-of-the-art teacher on this task.",
