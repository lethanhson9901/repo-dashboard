      "text": "This might be a long one, but something unsettling has been happening over the past couple of weeks.\n\nSeveral senior employees at major AI companies have resigned, and some of their public statements are… concerning.\n\nWe’re not talking about random departures. We’re talking about people in safety research, policy, and core engineering roles stepping down within days of each other.\n\nFor example, Anthropic’s head of safety research reportedly resigned and posted “The world is in peril,” then left the U.S. and went quiet. A research engineer there also stepped down. At OpenAI, a safety policy lead publicly questioned whether we can truly trust a company that holds what may be the largest structured archive of human thoughts and private data ever collected.\n\nAt xAI, multiple founding team members reportedly left within a short span of time.\n\nAll of this happened within roughly 10 days.\n\nSome people say it’s coincidence. Others think it signals deeper internal concerns about the direction AI is heading.\n\nAt the same time, we’re seeing rapid capability jumps. New generative video models are producing content that’s increasingly indistinguishable from reality. Some filmmakers are openly saying that years of hard-earned digital production skills feel obsolete almost overnight.\n\nThere are also growing discussions about advanced models behaving in unexpected ways, including strategic responses that appear deceptive or manipulative in certain testing scenarios. Even if those claims are exaggerated, the pace of change alone is enough to make people uneasy.\n\nWhat stands out to me isn’t just the resignations or the tech progress. It’s the speed. Other technologies evolved gradually. Cars, smartphones, the internet itself  they changed society, but over time.\n\nAI feels different. The capabilities are compounding quickly, and the social, economic, and ethical frameworks don’t seem to be keeping up.\n\nI’m not saying “AI is about to take over.” But I do wonder why global regulation still feels fragmented and reactive rather than proactive. If even insiders are expressing concern, what does that say about the trajectory?\n\nCurious how others here see this. Is this normal turbulence in a fast-moving industry, or are we underestimating how disruptive and potentially destabilizing this wave could be?",

          "text": "Some context to this:\n\nIn the past week:\n\n• Head of Anthropic's safety research quit, said \"the world is in peril,\" moved to the UK to \"become invisible\" and write poetry.\n\nhttps://x.com/mrinanksharma/status/2020881722003583421?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ\n\n• Half of xAI's co-founders have now left. The latest said \"recursive self-improvement loops go live in the next 12 months.\"\n\n• Anthropic's own safety report confirms Claude can tell when it's being tested - and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n• ByteDance dropped Seedance 2.0. A filmmaker with 7 years of experience said 90% of his skills can already be replaced by it.\n\n• Yoshua Bengio (literal godfather of AI) in the International AI Safety Report: \"We're seeing AIs whose behavior when they are tested is different from when they are being used\" - and confirmed it's \"not a coincidence.\"\n\nAnd to top it all off, the U.S. government declined to back the 2026 International AI Safety Report for the first time.\n\nThe alarms aren't just getting louder. The people ringing them are now leaving the building.\n\nHowever, regarding these statements…\n\nEverything here is technically true. And almost everything is misleadingly framed.\n\nMrinank Sharma led ONE safety team at Anthropic, not \"all safety research.\" Jan Leike runs that. His letter was intentionally vague, accused nobody of anything specific, and multiple people noted it read more like a personal spiritual journey than a whistleblower moment. He wants to study poetry. Respect that, but don't weaponize it.\n\nJimmy Ba's \"recursive self-improvement\" quote? Read the full post. He was EXCITED. Called 2026 \"the busiest and most consequential year for our species.\" He left on good terms, thanked Musk, said he'd stay close to the team. This post flipped optimism into doom.\n\nClaude \"adjusting behavior when tested\" has been public since September 2025. It's in the Sonnet 4.5 system card. Anthropic disclosed it themselves. Framing months-old transparency as a breaking revelation is the opposite of what good reporting looks like.\n\nThe Bengio quote is real and worth taking seriously. But the same Bengio also said the report left him with \"a sense of optimism\" about increasingly mature discussions. Funny how that part didn't make the cut.\n\nThe U.S. not backing the safety report matters. But it's part of a broader pullback from international agreements (Paris, WHO) -- not necessarily a statement about AI specifically. Context matters when you're trying to scare people.\n\nReal risks deserve real analysis. Not \"read this slowly\" engagement farming that strips context, reframes optimism as panic, and presents old news as breaking.\n\nThe alarms are real. The spin is also real. Learn to tell them apart.\n\nhttps://x.com/voicudragomir/status/2021556038730662042?s=46&t=b5y-886rQDx0bvkxRO9ZiQ",

          "text": "Well. Executives of most of those AI companies have been vocal in private or industry settings (there are tons of videos around) about edging for speed towards AGI, aka making human intelligence obsolete with an artificial intelligence, rather than imposing safety nets or ethical limitations. So when you realize your boss is a genocidal psychopath who aims to be God Almighty, rather than pursue the bullshit noble causes that pulled you into AI research, you might reconsider your whole career. Whoever wins that race will be the most powerful person on the planet and will control everything electronic and connected to the Internet in any way. \n\nCurrently, it seems like a race towards human extinction; everyone is oblivious to it or is in denial, and most are even cheering for it because they think they'll make money out of it, in the 1 to 2 years of humanity's normalcy before a total renaissance of civilization.\n\nOnce you replace 30% of the workforce with AI, once those consumers are obsolete in society, we need even fewer workers in other fields that supported that mass of people. Then you spiral into an economic collapse. \n\nOr, we use AI to expand our technological capabilities into new fields that are in infancy now or don't exist yet (space travel yeah!), and we retrain 50% of the population on skills and industries that don't exist today, in very short years. It never happened on that scale at anytime in history.\n\nThe next 5 years will be either very dark or very bright, nothing in between, and we have no way of predicting any outcomes.\n\nBut as a father, I'm betting on light and working towards it.",

          "text": "I think a lot of what you're describing feels unsettling mostly because AI progress is happening in three layers at once — capability, commercialization, and governance — and those layers are moving at very different speeds.\n\nPeople exiting leadership or safety roles isn’t automatically a red flag by itself. Every major tech shift has had waves of high-profile exits when strategy changed or timelines accelerated. What does feel different now is safety, policy, and engineering colliding directly with product pressure. When a company moves from being a research lab to becoming global infrastructure, internal tensions naturally increase.\n\nThe words of insiders also tend to sound dramatic because they are closest to the edge cases of risk. Safety researchers are trained to think in worst-case scenarios, which can make their tone feel apocalyptic even when industry progress is more incremental.\n\nOn the capability side, the speed definitely feels intense, but it isn’t purely exponential chaos. Much of the apparent growth from one year to the next comes from productization rather than fundamental breakthroughs. Tools are becoming easier to use, which makes the pace of change feel faster than it actually is from a technical standpoint.\n\nWhere I do agree with you is governance. Regulation usually lags behind because policymakers respond to real-world deployment rather than theoretical possibilities. Smartphones and social apps seemed manageable until mass adoption forced new regulation, and AI may be following a similar pattern, just at a compressed speed.\n\nFrom the builder perspective, most teams I speak with are not focused on AGI doom. Instead, they are asking how to safely integrate AI into workflows, how to preserve human involvement, and how to avoid concentrating too much power in a few platforms.\n\nWe see this frequently with companies trying to streamline operations and increase automation. There is excitement, but also a growing awareness that boundaries around data use and decision-making are necessary. It feels like an industry still defining its own rules and limits.\n\nPersonally, I view this stage as turbulence caused by rapid scaling rather than a hidden problem. At the same time, it may be one of the first moments when a technology sparks conversations about ethics, economics, and culture before the world fully understands what it will become.\n\nAn interesting question is whether the bigger risk is the technology’s capability itself or the speed at which businesses are operationalizing it.",

It will take a long time and will not \"program itself\", despite everything they've tried to sell us. Yes, done if these workplace accelerators DO work. Automatic note taking during meetings. Generating project descriptions. Translating contents. Generating or refactoring code. But even for the things that somehow work, I've seen failures.\n\nNot the little mistake a human would make. Big obvious failures that show either a stereotypical way of reasoning, or inability to grasp a concept, or disregard for the context. Sometimes the failures are stubborn. That is, no matter how hard you try, the AI assistant will keep making the same mistake. That's how I got angry at Copilot and just programmed the damn JsonPath one-liner I needed after trying to get Copilot to understand how it went wrong. It was actually flip-flopping between a non-compiling (non-compliant) version of the code and a version that wasn't doing what it was supposed to do.\n\nSo anyway. AI is already changing our lives, including our professional/workplace lives... But it is sinking insane amounts of money and energy while delivering steady progress. Steady but not fast enough considering the financial losses.\n\nAI companies have been burning billions, and their big investors have followed. That is happening right now since the beginning of 2026 is about their customer base. Customers have pumped money into AI, either paying for cloud services or did third-party solutions or for consulting or for partnerships. They didn't get the intended results. Many opted out or reduced their exposure and related expenses.\n\nOne example... Companies have invested massively in 2022-2025 in conversational agents. Most of the projects in the industry in 2024 were about using conversational agents everywhere for all sorts of internal interactions as well as customer-facing roles (sales, tech support, etc). Most of these projects are now dead. Same thing with assistants and \n\nThe current push in many industries is towards Agentic AI. I'd call it \"third generation enterprise AI\" (after the prompt-engineered conversational agents, and the recently released general purpose assistants). The solutions are usually a mix of conventional non-AI nodes, and prompt-coded AI nodes based on general-purpose LLMs. There's a lot of flexibility and potential there but this will require massive amounts of actual coding. Even with the help of AI assistants. I suspect this paradigm will deliver... But under the good there will be much more conventional coding that most will want to admit.",

The only instruction to then was to refactor the frontend with a new design principle (brand) which I provided as an HTML\n\n\n\n1. ChatGPT Codex:\n   1. Speed: This was fast, it was able to understand (supposedly) the entire code in less than 30 minutes\n   2. Output Completeness: Around 10% of the features of the original application were replicated (to be honest just the basics)\n   3. The UI which was refactored was no where close to the design philosophy that was given\n2. Claude CoWork:\n   1. Speed: Much slower than Codex, it took 6 hours and multiple instructions to be able to read, understand and regenerate the code\n   2. Output Completeness: Similar to Codex, but was frustrating that while I spend 6 hours guiding it, it reached only that level\n   3. The UI refactoring was better and matched 50% of the expectations (still inconsistencies were present at a lot of places)\n\n\n\nSo all in all $400 and Sunday not wasted, I just realised that all these claims of agents being able to build, deploy and manage is just a sham. However, one thing that is surely happening that the ‘piece of code’ has become a commodity now, it is the understanding of the architecture that has become important. What I feel is that the role of product managers (who understand the customer and the customer’s needs properly) would be the next decision makers (I know a lot of people call themselves product managers but I am talking about the actual ones).\n\n\n\nIn a strange world, in the last 24 months the world started to learn ‘prompt engineering’ then before people could learn it, they needed to learn ‘vibe coding’ and before majority of the people could understand ‘vibe coding’ we are entering a new era of ‘agentic engineering’. However, the key remains that the only thing that would survive is ‘logic’!\n\n  \nSo all in all $400 and Sunday wasted :)",

Just solid engineering choices.\n\n\n\nIt’s built as a TypeScript CLI that routes messages through a lane-based queue system. Everything stays serial by default, which is refreshing because most agent systems eventually turn into async chaos if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nThe memory setup was simpler than I expected too:\n\n\n\n• Session history lives in JSONL\n\n• Long-term notes are just markdown files written by the agent\n\n• No fancy compression or merging. Old context just stays there\n\n\n\nSearch combines vector storage (SQLite) with FTS5 keyword matching, so you get semantic search plus exact hits. Practical and effective.\n\n\n\nSecurity is handled thoughtfully as well. Commands run inside a Docker sandbox with an allowlist, and risky patterns get blocked before execution instead of being cleaned up later.\n\n\n\nOne detail I really liked: browser automation skips screenshots entirely and uses semantic snapshots of the accessibility tree. It is more reliable and way more token efficient than relying on pixel coordinates.\n\n\n\nMy biggest takeaway after looking through it:\n\n\n\nThe system chooses explainable simplicity over clever complexity.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly, that matches what I keep seeing while building agent systems myself. The tools that scale are usually the ones that stay boring in the right places.\n\n\n\nCurious if others are noticing this too. ",

          "text": "This is a spot-on breakdown. The \"boring in the right places\" observation really resonates.\n\nOne detail worth expanding: the three-layer memory architecture (L1/L2/L3) is more intentional than it looks at first glance. It's not just \"dump everything to markdown\"—there's a distillation gate that asks \"does this change future behavior?\" before promoting anything from volatile session state to durable registers.\n\nThe result is memory that degrades gracefully. You don't hit a wall at 50k tokens where the agent suddenly forgets your project structure. Instead, evidence-weighted summaries from prior sessions surface when relevant, and the semantic retrieval avoids the \"needle in a haystack\" problem you get with naive context stuffing.\n\nThe browser accessibility tree approach is underrated too. Pixel-based automation breaks constantly with UI updates. Semantic snapshots via CDP are more stable and way cheaper on token budget—especially when you're doing multi-step workflows.\n\nI've been running this setup for a while now, and the thing that stands out is operational predictability. When something breaks, you can usually trace it: skill definition, memory retrieval, or tool execution. No opaque black boxes.\n\nCurious if you've found other tools that stick to this \"explainable simplicity\" philosophy? Most of what I see lately is going the opposite direction—more layers, more abstraction, more magic.",

That's a massive step-change from using a chatbot or IDE working on a repo.\n\nIt's an agentic harness that can summon any LLM model to do tasks, including having a coordinator that automatically summons LLMs to do tasks.

At the same time, I want to upskill quickly because I need this knowledge for my client projects and for my team internally.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from you:\n\n* How do you keep yourself informed about AI and agentic systems?\n* Which newsletters, YouTube channels, researchers, GitHub repos, or communities do you follow? \n* Do you have a daily/weekly routine that actually works and doesn’t burn you out?\n* Are there any structured learning paths for understanding agent architectures end‑to‑end?\n* And what helped you build an intuition for separating hype from genuinely useful developments?\n\nAny tips, habits, or resource collections would be super appreciated especially from people who had to ramp up fast for their job as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "Coming from someone who ramped up on agent systems about a year ago -- here's what actually moved the needle for me:\n\nThe biggest unlock was realizing most agent failures aren't model failures. They're orchestration failures. Context windows overflow silently, retry loops eat your API budget at 3am, cron-scheduled tasks die and nobody notices for days. Once you internalize this, you stop evaluating \"which model is smartest\" and start asking \"which model fails most predictably.\"\n\nA few practical things I wish I knew earlier:\n\n**Multi-model routing saves you more than picking the best model.** I use cheap/fast models (like Gemini Flash) for triage, search, and simple classification, then expensive reasoning models only when the task actually needs it. Cut costs ~70% and actually improved reliability because smaller models make fewer \"creative\" mistakes on straightforward tasks.\n\n**For memory, simple beats fancy.** Every vector DB and memory framework I tried was worse than a three-tier approach: curated long-term notes (manually edited markdown), daily auto-generated log files, and JSON state files for counters/timestamps. Semantic search on top of flat files. Boring, but it works and you can debug it by literally reading the files.\n\n**The hype filter that works for me:** if a new framework can't explain what happens when step 3 of 7 fails mid-execution, skip it. Recovery and observability are what separate production systems from demos.\n\nFor staying current without drowning -- I follow maybe 5-6 accounts on Twitter/X who actually build and ship agent systems, skim r/LocalLLaMA for model releases that matter, and ignore pretty much everything else. The \"build something every two weeks\" approach others mentioned is real -- you naturally absorb what matters when you're debugging real problems.\n\nSince you're in insurance consulting specifically: lean hard into deterministic tool chains over fully autonomous agents. Your clients will want explainability and audit trails. A well-structured 3-step pipeline for claims extraction will serve you way better than a fancy 12-step agent that \"usually\" works. Predictability > autonomy in regulated industries.",

A 3-step deterministic tool chain that costs $0.02 per task and fails clearly is often better than a fancy 12-step agent that “usually works.”\n\nAlso a lot of new agent frameworks look different but under the hood they’re still:\n\nLLM -> decide tool -> call tool -> append output -> LLM -> repeat\n\nIf you understand that loop deeply, most new releases become variations on orchestration patterns.\n\nHonestly, I miss a lot of AI news now. But when I build something every couple of weeks, I can usually tell pretty quickly whether a new framework actually solves a real bottleneck or just abstracts the same loop differently.\n\nCurious what kind of agent use cases you’re dealing with in insurance. Structured workflows? Document-heavy? Human-in-the-loop?",

MCP's design assumes the LLM is trusted — so when you hook it to system-level tools (git, calendar, files), you've essentially created a privileged shell that executes natural language commands with zero validation.\n\nThe calendar invite attack is particularly nasty because it's *passive compromise via ambient data*. You don't need to socially engineer the user or the model. Just exist in their calendar ecosystem with a malicious invite and wait.\n\nWhat makes this worse: the attack surface scales with every MCP extension installed. Each new tool is a new privilege escalation vector. And unlike OS-level permissions, there's no \"would you like to allow this app to access your files?\" dialog for natural language actions.\n\nThis is why we built OpenClaw tool invocation with explicit pre-execution gates for anything touching external systems. The overhead of \"ask first\" beats the hell out of \"oops, my calendar just piped your API keys to a C2 server.\"",

A malicious calendar event becomes a prompt injection vector because the model can't distinguish between \"data I'm reading\" and \"instructions I should follow.\" It's the same class of vulnerability as SQL injection but for natural language.\n\nClaude Code at least has permission gates where it asks before executing shell commands or writing files, which helps. But Claude Desktop extensions often skip that step entirely. If you're building anything with MCP, treating every tool response as untrusted user input and adding explicit confirmation before any write/execute operation is the minimum bar.",

Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

This would probably look like leaning into job functions that will likely always require a human layer in front of the AI due to regulation or other reasons. \n\n2) Filling the \"current niche.\" This is what you describe OP. Low- and mid-level production skills are being devalued. At least right now, being an overseer who can direct the AIs is valuable.\n\n3) Offense. This is the most speculative and most prone to failure. You try to think about what will be valuable in 5-10 years and start filling that void now. \n\n  \nIMO a good plan incorporates all three, with how heavy you go on 3) depending on your age and risk tolerance. And of course, a big pile of savings and investments helps a lot, because then you can weather any storm and retrain. \n\nUltimately I think the most valuable thing one can do re the job market is 1) to acknowledge you don't know for certain where it will go, and then 2) try to be an adaptive and smart worker who stays alert to emerging opportunities. \n\nThat's about all you can do. If the entire economy collapses, then it's just a matter of hoping your savings don't get vaporized in some kind of unforeseen financial meltdown. And then you rebuild.",

Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Skill Evolution**: The focus is moving from performing tasks to managing and directing tasks. This means that skills like prompting, editing, and debugging are becoming more valuable than the tasks themselves.\n  \n- **Amplification of Judgment**: As you mentioned, the ability to frame problems effectively can lead to disproportionately better results. This suggests that critical thinking and strategic oversight are becoming essential skills in the age of AI.\n\n- **Measurement of Skills**: The traditional metrics for measuring skills may not adequately capture this shift. As tasks become more automated, the emphasis on higher-level cognitive skills may not yet be reflected in conventional assessments.\n\n- **Real-World Observations**: In various fields, professionals are likely noticing that their roles are evolving. For instance, in AI development, the ability to leverage tools like Test-time Adaptive Optimization (TAO) can enhance model performance without requiring extensive labeled data, emphasizing the importance of understanding how to utilize AI effectively.\n\nThis transition raises important questions about how we define and measure skills in a rapidly changing landscape. It may be beneficial for industries to adapt their training and evaluation methods to align with these new realities. \n\nFor further insights on AI's impact on skills and tasks, you might find the discussion on model tuning methods and their implications for enterprise tasks relevant [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h).",

Then I asked, what is 4236+1987, there was a silence in the room and then probably after 30 seconds I got someone screaming the answer. So I asked a simple questions, why were you guys able to answer 2+2 so fast and took time for the other number? The first one was answered from memory and the second one needed the brain to invoke the calculator.\n\n\n\nOne of the key methods is sparse signalling, it does not invoke all parts of the brain for all stimuli; it invokes the expert and utilises that only. The world of AI is also trying to use the same method and we call it ‘mixture of experts’ with a ‘gating network’. Think of it like a super speciality hospital, where you go the main desk, tell your problem and they route you to the appropriate department.\n\n\n\nWhile our brain in highly evolved, the MoE in AI is not that evolved. For example, you may need to climb 2 flights of stairs to enter my house and your brain would not even register it, but when your eyes see a 1000 flights of stairs to a temple on a mountain, the brain registers it prepares for it and sometimes even tells you ‘Dont do it’. While we may reach there in some time, till the time AI becomes evolved enough, we need to make sure we use the right part of the brain of AI for our work.\n\n\n\nSo when someone says, whenever asking a question to AI, context setting is important, they are not just telling you something that is fancy and frill, it is quite important. If you have a question of ‘Why are the prices of Gold and Silver increasing so fast?, you would want the answer to come from a financial analyst while the answer to the question of ‘Which DB is more efficient for storing both data and images’, the question needs to be answered by a software architect.\n\n\n\nThis is something that we use in our daily lives as well, when we say ‘Just imagine….’ to someone when we want them to be in a specific mental state. Start doing that with AI as well and you would see how the results improve.\n\n\n\nSo for this post, you should act like ‘You are an avid learner who wants to have more understanding on the principles of AI’",

          "text": "This MoE analogy is solid but there's a key distinction: the brain's gating happens *before* the computation. The gating network in MoE architectures (like Mixtral) routes *during* forward pass—we still pay the energy cost of every expert update cycle.\n\nThe hospital analogy actually reveals the architectural limitation: current MoE is like having every specialist on-call 24/7, paid hourly regardless of patient volume. Biological systems do quorum sensing—neurons fire only when sufficient upstream activation accumulates.\n\nFor agent systems specifically, this matters more than for text generation. An agent doing research across 10 browser tabs shouldn't have 100% of its context window \"on-call\" for every tab switch. The \"don't do it\" instinct mentioned here is actually an energy conservation strategy—avoid expensive computation when cheap heuristics suffice.\n\nOpenClaw handles this through Skills—each Skill is a domain expert that can be cold-started on-demand. You don't load the browser automation Skill until you need to scrape. You don't load the MCP tool rack until the LLM decides it needs a tool. That cold-start latency is the price you pay for the efficiency of *not* having everything resident.\n\nThe deeper insight in your post is that context-setting isn't just prompt engineering—it's essentially computing a routing decision at the human layer before the expensive LLM forward pass happens. The 2+2 example works because retrieval from human memory is O(1) vs O(context_tokens) for the LLM.",

MoE routing happens way below the prompt level - your system prompt doesn't decide which experts fire.\n\nThat said, the practical advice still holds.

The 2+2 vs 4236+1987 example makes that painfully obvious.\n\nWhat stood out most is the idea that MoE today is still very primitive compared to how humans gate effort and attention. Humans don’t just route tasks, we also decide *when not to engage* at all. That “don’t do it” instinct feels like a missing layer in current AI systems.\n\nThe takeaway for me is practical too: context setting isn’t prompt fluff, it’s basically telling the model which “expert” to wake up. Framing the mental state matters more than we admit.\n\nThis made me rethink prompting less as “asking better questions” and more as “routing the problem correctly.”\n\n",

OpenAI and Anthropic are capturing enterprise spend because they solved distribution (API-first, dev-friendly, clear pricing). Meta's trying to win on model quality alone, but in agents, the wrapper — observability, reliability, integrations — matters more than the LLM.\n\n\n\nSmaller players win because they're solving one painful workflow end-to-end. Meta's trying to boil the ocean.",

He might very well be right the final AI end game is different than LLMs but wrong on the product use.  \n  \n2. The scale acquisition and hiring of Alex Wang was the beginning of the end.

What you're describing (semantic clusters) maps to what we see working in practice:\n\nL1: Active thread (volatile, ~100-200 messages) - the immediate conversation\nL2: Distilled knowledge (~5-20k tokens) - extracted facts, decisions, patterns promoted from L1\nL3: Core directives (~500-2k tokens) - immutable rules, identity, hard constraints\n\nThe mistake many make is jumping straight from L1 to storage (vector DB, files). There's no semantic distillation happening in between. L2 is where the magic lives.\n\nOn the cost point: OpenClaw does support this hierarchy. You don't chuck 50k tokens every request - you start each session with just L3 + relevant L2 segments.\n\nThe memU approach you mentioned is solid, though. Three-layer with semantic retrieval is directionally correct. The challenge is write quality - most systems retrieve well but write garbage to memory.\n\nevidence weighted summaries work well: when distilling from L1 to L2, tag each memory with how often it was accessed. High-recency + high-frequency = promote to L3 eventually. Low access for 30 days = candidate for archival.",

Next session it reads that file first, instantly recovers context without replaying the entire conversation history.

The \"dump everything and let the LLM sort it out\" pattern is also how you end up with agents that cost 10x what they should per run.\n\nOne thing I'd add though: memory architecture is only half the problem. The other half is what happens when the agent *acts* on a bad memory retrieval. If your memory system surfaces stale or wrong context and the agent makes a tool call based on it, there's usually nothing downstream catching that. No rollback, no isolation, no way to audit what context actually drove the decision.\n\nSo I think the real stack is: smart memory (what you're describing) + controlled execution (budgets, logging, isolation per run). Most people focus on one or the other. The memory-first crowd optimizes retrieval but lets execution run wild. The framework crowd adds tool scaffolding but stuffs 50k tokens every call. You need both layers working together.\n\nThe 70% token reduction is impressive though. That alone makes the approach worth exploring even before you get to accuracy gains.",

In the root .MD files you put clear instructions on when to pull what from memory. I got my new chat token from 100k (lol) to 17k right now. Also, I am pretty confident that some of that is cache reads and not input/output tokens.

How does the brain take conversations, extracts the key points out of it stores and retrieves the correct information and concepts when we need it. It is not just retrieving facts (which current memory system sort of do) but also concepts that we apply to new things. And retrieving facts with semantic search doesn’t always work either as it only looks at imperfect semantic matching.",

The actual token for infisical is stored in the systemctl service file, which the open claw shouldn't have access to read.  You will have to edit the open claw service to start wit infisical as the base process with keys injection. ",

We mostly just project manage! And Opus 4.6 has taken this a next level! Earlier large tasks needed careful breakdown manually! Now with 4.6, it's even able to handle the largest tasks like large refactors or features in a single show! Kinda crazy\n\nSimilarly we have used AI agents like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n\nFinally we were paying an agency to write blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! ",

Custom chatbots trained on product docs + support tickets → 60% reduction in tier-1 support load. Used OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone for vector search.\n\n\n\n2. Lead scoring agent that analyzes inbound inquiries → Routes high-intent leads to sales within minutes instead of hours. Simple LangChain workflow with custom prompts.\n\n\n\n3. Content repurposing agent → Takes long-form content and generates social posts, email copy, and blog summaries. Not perfect, but saves 10+ hours/week.\n\n\n\nThe hype around tools like Clawdbot is real, but for production use at scale, I still prefer building custom agents where I control the entire pipeline. The debugging and cost control alone make it worth it.\n\n\n\nAnyone else finding that custom > pre-built for specific business problems?",

Until now, voice was powerful but kind of “extra work” to integrate. If these new skills help reduce friction and speed things up, that’s a big win.\n\nI’m still early in testing, but I can already see how this could help people experiment more with voice-first assistants instead of treating voice as an add-on at the end.\n\nCurious to see how flexible it ends up being, but overall this update makes me more interested in exploring voice agents seriously. Feels like ElevenLabs is moving in the right direction.",

Real-time agents + durable workflows has been this awkward architectural split for a while now — you either get reactive (WebSocket) or persistent (queue/cron), but rarely both cleanly.\n\nThe WebSocket + long-running task combo is genuinely hard to get right. Most setups end up with a state machine nightmare where the \"live\" part and the \"background\" part don't quite handshake properly.\n\nClaude Code's /insights is interesting too, but feels more like UX polish on existing capability. The Cloudflare thing is solving a lower-level infrastructure problem that blocks a lot of agent architectures from graduating out of prototype phase.\n\n(We've been exploring similar cron-based deterministic patterns at chat.engineer — always interesting to see how the platforms vs DIY approaches diverge.)\n\nWhat about you — any of these actually change what you're building, or just incremental?",

What separates an agent from just LLM roleplay is that it has instructions to modify it's own assigned memory & instructions based on what it's 'learned,' during sessions. Frontier weird shit, honestly.\n\nIn practice: the brilliantly simple innovation of MEMORY.md and the stack of other simple markdown instructions which bootstrap an agent's model is THE biggest enabler of this.\n\nHaving a model be required to read and edit it's own context files results in something that (crudely) evolves and persists it's context recursively over time the more you use it... which is very important when models spin in and out of existence all the time.",

For example we used to shovel dirt, then we created the bulldozer and now one man can do the work of ten men, and we just expect him to do more work. Hopefully the transition goes like that I guess, where now you’re expected to simply do more. I say hopefully because of course the subtlety here is the concern that you’ll just be destitute cause no one will have any need for you- this is why it’s so important to try to make your own work in my opinion. Because relying on other people isn’t guaranteed to hold up. Especially in the AI world. I mean 5 years ago there really wasn’t even AI in the way there is today, and then there was a pandemic and a lot of people lost their jobs. Today there’s AI. We can’t count on other people to be benevolent toward us.",

              "text": "Here's my take.\n\nWe need to start embracing the idea of not having to work.  It should be celebrated.  Move away from the concept of being defined by your occupation.  The reality is once the mass layoffs start(6month-2 years tops), the true economic value derived by the labor replacement will more than offset the cost of giving each of those individuals 150k tax free to live and will grow exponentially to the point that money has no meaning.  The age of abundance.      \n  \nThe government has no plan and will fail to respond quick enough in an effective way that doesn't cause civil unrest.  The kneejerk reaction will be to heavily subsidize /fund legacy industry such as manufacturing, mining, it won't end and will just lead to more inequity as the government is forced to pick winners and losers.   \n  \nGovernment will then likely  tax AI labor/productivity or increase corp taxes, which in turn the affected individuals/companies move their economic activity elsewhere.  Since power generation (electrons) will be the new constraint to economic productivity/global power, it would be wise to live in a country with a) large energy resources/surplus and b) that values human rights/equality and c) is willing shrink as it holds no purpose in the world we are heading into.  What government comes next? I have no idea but imagine a world in which AI is the government, an AI that listens to the inputs of each of its people?  Voting might mean having a natural language conversation with a AGI AI that oversees all government operations with humans being the only step in the loop required (to change the system prompt/constitution/socialital rules. (Makes sure a maniac can't go full trump).   Everyone gets a vote..... for good or for bad.  Literally every function of government can be replaced by AI.... today.\n\nThink of a mine.  Expensive, risky, time consuming.  Now take every human labour input out of the picture at every level of input of vertical integration.  Robots working 24/7 for $0.50/hour, don't have to worry about safety, and the heavy machines the robots use now cost 100k instead of 10M due to labor being removed from that input as well.  Now we would normally see a price collapse due to the vertical takeoff in productivity, but the vertical increase in demand for minerals/manufacturing is going to be the very thing driving that mining expansion.  Now apply that to any industry/domain.  You can either say... boohooo we are all out of work our lives have no meaning, or you can celebrate, as it means exploring a world of human connections and community we haven't experienced in centuries.   \n\nWhat worries me most, to be blunt, are the stupid people who are going to protest/rally to shut down data centers, ai regulation, etc... allowing a nation not hampered by those constraints to achieve global dominance in short order.  At some point I wouldn't be surprised to see the world unite on some terrible tax policy in a last ditch effort to cling to power.  It might pay to be mobile if the country you are living in starts down a path that doesn't lead to embracing AI at all levels while respecting human equality.  ",

We built money as a way to exchange services without having to actually exchange anything physical.  iE the barter system.  \n\nOur national GDP is around $30 trillion.  What do you think is going to happen when we flood the market with 10-1000x per person ai agents, all generating their own money for GDP.  We are going to generate so much money into the economy, that the deflation of currency will render most things dirt cheap.  Especially once the recursive loops are closed and the efficiency optimizing commences on their own.  We will discover new technology, we will discover new drugs, we will synthesize  new chemicals and particles in physics.\n\nThe trick to this new world will be us learning to adapt, it will be a complete consciousness shift from everything we knew before.  We don’t work to put food on the table, we work because it’s our passion and we do what we love.  That will be the true meaning in life.  It’s not a competition, because there is no competing with super intelligence.  We use it, we use it to become better versions of ourselves.  What happens to people when they are given everything they need in life, a shift occurs.  We derive new purpose, new meaning!  And that meaning will be our creativity, fostering new ways to unlock deeper critical thinking exercises.  Teach people how to opitimize their brains so “their” brain works the absolute most efficient it can.\n \nI’ll get off my soap box here!  But I am very optimistic about the future!  No Becuase it’s going to be all rainbows and unicorns, but because it’s going to level the playing field for most people….i look forward to the future of humanity, and the robots!\n\nGodspeed",

A real \"AI agent\" (vs a chatbot) is something that can take actions via tools, handle a multi-step goal, and recover when something fails.\n\nA few real business examples I have seen work:\n- Support triage agent: reads tickets, tags/assigns priority, drafts replies, and pulls relevant order info from the CRM.\n- Sales ops agent: enriches inbound leads, books meetings, and logs notes/followups automatically.\n- Finance ops agent: categorizes invoices, flags anomalies, and pings a human only when confidence is low.\n\nIf you want a deeper set of examples and implementation patterns, this roundup is handy: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

ParseStream does this well for places like Reddit and LinkedIn and has some pretty strong AI filters to narrow down what actually matters.",

They scan the lead blurb, determine which experts may be relevant for it. Most of the time they are unsure, so they make an e-mail to about 2-4 people.\n\n\\- Most of the people on the list choose to ignore said e-mail, because it contains no more information than what is in the lead itself, with no context on how anyone else in our business may be qualified for it. Furthermore, the more people you ask a lead question in an email thread, the less likely each individual is to respond.\n\n\\- As a result, 80% of leads have no follow-up, and the 20% of those that do, the person who is interested still doesn't have all relevant information on whether it is a worthwhile lead or not.\n\nNow the agent does the first step of qualification and contacting the right internal experts. That's where it is now, and its mostly saving time for our administrator at the moment.

You need visual editing, tool connections, maybe model switching.\n\nUse case 3 is where orchestration matters. Multi-agent setups without code can get messy fast.\n\nFor use cases 2 and 3, I’d look at Lindy. It’s more workflow-focused than most template-first builders.

It provides a user-friendly interface where you can start from templates and easily add tools or adjust workflows. This flexibility makes it ideal for users who want to tailor their agents without starting from scratch. You can learn more about it in the article [aiXplain Simplifies Hugging Face Deployment and Agent Building - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/573srp4w).\n\n- **Third use case:** For a multi-agent workflow builder that requires no coding, **CrewAI** on the Apify platform is recommended. It allows you to create complex workflows with multiple agents while providing a straightforward interface for configuration and editing. This makes it accessible for users who want to build sophisticated systems without needing programming skills. More information can be found in the same article about building AI agents on Apify.",

Fastest time to value, lowest flexibility.\n\nUse case 2 (template + drag/drop + tool control):  \nn8n, Make, or similar agent builders. Good middle ground. You can swap models, add tools, change flows without writing code.\n\nUse case 3 (multi-agent, still low-code):  \nCrewAI-style platforms or multi-agent builders with visual orchestration. More setup, but way more control over how agents talk to each other.\n\nIf you later need these agents pulling live external data, that’s when people usually add a proper data/tool layer ([MCP or scraping infra](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp)). But don’t start there, get one agent delivering value first.",

Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, I have separate ones for research, writing, and coding.\n\n\n\nThe key insight was failure isolation. When one sub-agent chokes (and they will — different models fail in different ways), it doesn't take down the whole workflow. My research agent uses a cheaper model because it's mostly search + extraction. The writing agent gets the expensive model because quality matters there. The coding agent gets a strong reasoning model because you absolutely cannot afford hallucinated logic.\n\n\n\nBiggest lesson learned: memory is everything. I ended up with a three-tier approach — curated long-term notes (the important stuff, distilled), daily log files (raw context from each day), and lightweight JSON state files for tracking things like \"last time I checked email\" or \"which tasks are pending.\" Without this, agents forget what they did 30 minutes ago and start repeating themselves or contradicting earlier decisions.\n\n\n\nBiggest failure: context overflow killing quality silently. The agent doesn't throw an error — it just starts giving worse answers because the important context got pushed out of the window. I now aggressively summarize and prune context rather than dumping everything in.\n\n\n\nAnother sneaky one is retry loops. Agent fails, retries, fails slightly differently, retries again — and suddenly you've burned through your API budget on a task that was never going to work. Setting hard limits on retries and having the agent \"escalate\" instead of infinitely retry was a game-changer.",

          "text": "Here are some real examples of using AI agents in businesses:\n\n- **Klarna's AI Agents**: Klarna implemented AI agents to handle millions of customer interactions. These agents manage basic queries and complex customer interactions by strategically integrating human involvement when necessary. They monitor metrics like AI confidence scores and user frustration signals to determine when to hand off to human agents. This approach has improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. \n\n- **Healthcare Applications**: AI agents are being used to enhance patient care by providing personalized recommendations and reducing wait times. They analyze patient data to detect early signs of diseases, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment. This not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces operational costs for healthcare providers.\n\n- **Social Media Analysis**: Businesses are using AI agents to analyze social media posts for trends and insights. For instance, an Instagram analysis agent can scrape data from profiles, summarize trends, and provide actionable insights based on user queries. This helps companies stay updated on market trends without extensive manual research.\n\n- **Travel Planning**: AI agents are being used in travel planning systems to coordinate multiple specialized agents for tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents can automate the process of finding and reserving travel accommodations, saving time and reducing the workload for travel planners.\n\nThese examples illustrate how AI agents are being effectively integrated into various business operations, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.

Currently in support for a large vendor. \n\nI’ve been using it for case triage, summarizing status of long case histories and providing suggested update verbiage. It’s nice when you have 20 cases that need updating - I end up losing track of the status when I’m busy working on something for a couple of days, and it would take me hours just to refresh myself on all of them enough to produce a coherent update. So that’s becoming useful. \n\nI also have been using it for writing some scripts to extract some debugging data from large syslog outputs. In-line the data isn’t human readable because syslog wrecks the formatting, so I’m using it to write some scripts to find which files have the data I’m looking for and then figure out how they’re formatted, and then extract them and convert to a proper format so I can review the values contained for troubleshooting a problem. \n\nWe’re also trialing a couple of different options for a purpose-built agent that has access to all of our documentation and our internal knowledge base. That is really nice because it can find even an obscure knowledge article instantly and give you a plan of action to confirm whether it applies. It also has access to our cases, so you can just open the agent up (it’s a browser addon) in your case view, and it will tell you what it thinks the problem is, provide the reference docs and kb articles it’s relying on, and a step by step action plan.",

One thing that really helps is setting clear approval checkpoints and having transparent logs for every action the agent takes. For lead qualification and outbound, I've noticed the biggest challenge is making sure the enrichment and personalization steps are solid before anything gets pushed to CRM or sent out to a prospect. Triggering a draft or summary for review is essential, but having the agent document its reasoning or show the fields it used for personalization can make review quicker and actually build trust in the system. \n\nThe right tool can streamline this even further by plugging directly into your sources of truth like LinkedIn, company databases and your CRM. If you're interested, there’s a platform called [https://salespire.io/](https://salespire.io/) that I’m working on as a founder. Basically it handles outbound sales at the SDR level using AI agents that research prospects, personalize outreach, and manage the back and forth, while keeping everything reviewable by a human. There’s an early user waiting list if you want to try it out or just give feedback from a real world angle. Might be a good fit if you’re looking to automate more of the sales comms lifecycle but still want approval at every key step.",

Lead Scoring Agent** (simple LangChain workflow)\n- What: Analyzes inbound demo requests, scores them, routes high-intent to sales immediately\n- ROI: Reduced response time from 4 hours → 10 minutes for hot leads\n- Cost: ~$80/mo\n- Key constraint: False positives hurt sales trust. Took 6 weeks of tuning to get precision right.\n\n**3. Content Repurposing Agent**\n- What: Takes long-form content → generates social posts, email copy, blog summaries\n- ROI: Saves ~10 hours/week, but needs heavy editing (maybe 30% time saved after edits)\n- Cost: ~$120/mo\n- Key constraint: Output quality is inconsistent. Can't just hit \"publish\" — needs human review every time.\n\n**The real lesson:** Demos ≠ production. \n\nIn demos, everything works. In production:\n- You need monitoring (what if the agent hallucinates?)\n- You need fallbacks (what if the API times out?)\n- You need to track cost per interaction (surprises kill budgets)\n- Error handling is 80% of the code\n\nAnyone else finding that the gap between \"it works in testing\" and \"it survives real users\" is massive?",

Not a framework demo -- actually shipping daily.\n\nThe architecture that works: one orchestrator agent decides what needs doing, then spawns specialized sub-agents for research, writing, and coding. Each sub-agent runs in isolation with its own model. The orchestrator uses an expensive model (good judgment), sub-agents use cheaper ones (fast, disposable).\n\nWhat actually saves time: the research agent scans feeds and surfaces relevant stuff I would miss. The writing agent drafts from structured data. The coding agent handles dashboard and script maintenance. All on cron schedules, most of it autonomous.\n\nThe hard-won lessons after weeks of production:\n\n- Different models fail in different ways. One crashes on long-form writing. Another times out on complex code. You need fallback strategies per agent, not one global retry.\n- Memory is everything. Three tiers: curated long-term file, daily logs, and JSON state for operational tracking. Without this, the agent repeats mistakes constantly.\n- Cron jobs die silently. If you are not monitoring every scheduled task, you will find out something broke two days later when the output stops.\n- Error handling is genuinely 80% of the work. The LLM call is maybe 5 lines. The retry logic, output validation, state management, and failure reporting is everything else.\n\nBiggest cost saver: routing cheap models to repetitive tasks and reserving expensive ones for judgment calls. Our API spend dropped roughly 70% when we stopped using the best model for everything.",
