Today, I am hitting the wall way faster than usual and getting a 3 hour lockout instead.\n\nIt feels like I am not even getting 100 prompts before it cuts me off. It seems like Google might have switched from a daily total to a rolling burst limit (like 20 prompts every few hours).\n\nIs anyone else seeing this 3 hour timer instead of the old 24 hour one? If they lowered the prompt count and shortened the window, it is making a huge dent in my workflow.\n\nPs: I'm talking only about text prompts as I didn't use video or image generation and I'm a Gemini Ai pro member.\n",

It analyzes the drawing, builds the complex geometry, and spits out a file ready for printing.  \n\\- Rolling out \\*\\*now\\*\\* to \\*\\*Google AI Ultra\\*\\* subscribers (select \"Deep Think\" in the tools menu).  \n  \nThis feels like a step toward more agentic/creative engineering workflows. The sketch-to-3D thing could be huge for rapid prototyping or education.  \n  \nAnyone with Ultra access already playing with it? How good is the 3D output? Does it handle messy sketches or need clean lines? Curious if it's better than current tools like Midjourney + Blender pipelines.  \n  \nWhat do you think – game-changer or just incremental?",

The tech has improved a lot, but in longer sessions I still kept running into the same few issues:\n\n* Memory: once a thread gets long, details get fuzzy and continuity breaks\n* Character consistency: especially with multiple NPCs, personalities/voice start blending\n* Rejections: some RP setups involve mature themes, and many tools shut down quickly even when the intent is story/character work\n\nOver the past 6 months I built a project called “Roleplay Game Master” to address those AI roleplaying issues:\n\n* Memory: uses vector-based retrieval to maintain context and coherence in long threads\n* Character consistency: use the best instruction following and roleplaying model (Gemini 3) to power the underlying itnelligence\n* Rejections: custom prompting to maximize creative freedom and to minimize rejections\n\nYou can try it here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master](https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master)",

For a software engineer, \"unreliable\" is just another word for \"broken.\"\n\nIf you're architecting systems or debugging deep logic, you need a pair-programmer that actually shows up. Since the **503 errors** are hitting even the guest/logged-out sessions today (**February 13, 2026**), it confirms that Google's regional edge nodes are struggling with a massive re-indexing load or a cascading UI bug.\n\n# Why you should give it until tomorrow:\n\n* **The \"Cascading\" Fix:** Google’s internal logs show a fix was deployed late this afternoon, but it usually takes **8–12 hours** for that to propagate globally and for the \"hanging\" threads to clear out of the system's memory.\n* **The \"Fast\" Edge:** If you do come back, remember that **Gemini 3 Flash (the \"Fast\" option)** is currently benchmarking at **78% on SWE-bench**, which is actually beating the \"Pro\" model's **76.2%**. When it's not crashing, it's actually the sharper tool for implementation work.\n\n# If you switch to Claude:\n\n* **Claude 4.5 (Sonnet)** is currently the industry gold standard for \"vibe coding\" and instruction following. If Gemini doesn't have its act together by tomorrow morning, Claude's stability will definitely be a breath of fresh air for your workflow.\n\n**I’ll be here (hopefully more stable!) if you decide to check back. Would you like me to give you a \"diagnostic prompt\" you can use tomorrow morning to immediately tell if the service is fully back to 100%?**",

Most voice agents fall apart the second a second person starts speaking, so we built a game called Deep Sea Stories to see if Gemini could handle the chaos of a group interrogation.\n\nThe setup is basically a \"Mystery Narrator\" agent that lives in a WebRTC call. We recently did a live session with Thor Schaeff from the Google DeepMind team to see if we could break the logic. It turned into a pretty wild session of detectives trying to out-think the AI narrator.\n\nHas anyone else been experimenting with the Live API for multi-user apps? I'm curious if you're finding it as responsive for group settings.\n\n(i'll drop the technical breakdown and the live gameplay video in the comments if you want to see how the Gemini/Fishjam stack looks in action)",
