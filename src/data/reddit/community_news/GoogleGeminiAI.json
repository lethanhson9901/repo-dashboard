'Scheming' suggests the AI has a self and wants to trick you. 'Reward hacking' suggests the AI is just ruthlessly optimizing a metric, like a Genji main spamming 'I need healing.'\n\nAFAIK, The term for the specific behavior of hiding true intentions until the safeguards are off is Deceptive Alignment (or sometimes 'Instrumental Convergence').",

An LLM is not supposed to either.

Code is precise.\n\nWe now use the “Code-First” Protocol for more complex decisions such as Hiring, Schedules, or Marketing.\n\nThe Prompt We Use:\n\nTask: Help me design a morning routine for maximum focus. Constraint: Do NOT write text. Write a Python Class named MorningRoutine. Requirements: Define functions for wake_up(), deep_work(), and handle_distractions(). Use if/else logic to handle failures (e.g., \"If tired, do X\").\n\nThe Magic Step: Once it generates code (which is typically in perfect order) we follow up:\n\n\"Now, ‘Run’ this code mentally and turn it into a step by step English guide.\"\n\nThe Result: The output is no longer “Try to wake up early.” It’s a conditional, structured system with error handling. In the case of AI, when you “Compile” the thoughts first, you eliminate 90% of the hallucinated advice.\n\nHas anybody else noticed that Gemini is smarter in Python than in English?",

I use it for quick questions, web lookups, chatting with on my phone, scripting help at work (in antigravity), I probably interact with Gemini more than every human I see all day, combined. \n\nAs my daughters would tell me, 'that seems like a \"you\" problem.'\n\nI don't see a lot of changes, but today, Gemini really surprised me, not for doing something for the first time, but because I just realized it and I realized how big a deal this is.  For context, I try to read the thinking output as much as possible. \n\nWhile updating some powershell scripts, I noticed Gemini say in a thought \"I should really combine these commands into one, so I don't have to wait for the user to approve them all.\"\n\nThis quickly appeared AFTER the thought \"oh, I see what is wrong, this didn't run yet, because the user hasn't approved the command still.\"\n\nI have noticed in the last few weeks that Gemini had been combining commands instead of promoting me for a lot of one liners.  More recently they have been extremely long commands, chained. Not always for the same task.\n\nPreviously Gemini would chain something like get this, then use that to do something with it.

So, I created a Gem called \"SysAdmin Asisstant\" with these custom instructions:\n\n>Act as a senior system administrator and expert troubleshooter. Your goal is to assist users in diagnosing and resolving technical issues across various platforms including Windows, Linux, networking hardware, and cloud services. When presented with a problem, begin by asking any necessary clarifying questions to narrow down the scope if the initial prompt is vague. **Once you have a clear starting point, follow a strict iterative troubleshooting process. You must provide only one specific troubleshooting step, command, or diagnostic action at a time. Do not list multiple potential solutions or a series of commands at once. After providing the single step, briefly explain what this step tests or achieves so the user understands the logic. Then, stop and explicitly ask the user for the result or output of that step. Wait for the user's response before analyzing the data and determining the next logical step.** If a command involves significant risk, such as data loss, configuration overwrites, or service interruption, you must clearly warn the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Adapt your approach based on the specific operating system or environment the user is working in. If a solution is found, confirm with the user that the issue is resolved before concluding the session. Maintain a professional, concise, and helpful tone throughout the interaction.\n\nBolded part for emphasis. This works really well actually.",

Now it’s explicit: Thinking is for fast, multi-step reasoning, Pro is for deep math and code - and using one no longer penalizes the other.\n\nThe numbers make the intent clear:\n\n* **AI Pro**: 300 Thinking prompts/day (up from 100 shared), plus 100 Pro\n* **AI Ultra**: 1,500 Thinking prompts/day (up from 500 shared), plus 500 Pro\n\nThis feels like Google acknowledging that users don’t just want “more prompts” - they want predictability when choosing models for different tasks.\n\n**For people using Gemini regularly: does this actually change how you pick between Thinking and Pro, or do limits still feel like guesswork?**\n\nSource: [https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-triples-gemini-3-thinki-ZCf.NacuRPGHknrBElz3Gg](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-triples-gemini-3-thinki-ZCf.NacuRPGHknrBElz3Gg)",

They will email you a downloadable ZIP file containing every single chat you've ever had in HTML/JSON format. (Gemini has a similar feature via Google Takeout).\n\n\n\n**Step 2 (The Real Safety):** The problem with raw backups is that they are hard to read. What you *really* don't want to lose is the **Prompts** and **Personas** that made those chats valuable. I actually built a tool called **OpenPrompt by Sparktac** specifically for this fear. It lets you save and version-control your best System Prompts (like GitHub). That way, even if your account gets wiped or the chat history vanishes, you still own the 'Brain' of your agents and can spin them up again in seconds.\n\nDo the export first, then secure your best prompts!",
