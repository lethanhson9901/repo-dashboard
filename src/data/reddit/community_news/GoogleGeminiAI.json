Now I'm a database developer and I have tried to get it to write some SQL and does OK about 60% of the time If I'm just asking for some basic scripting. But when you get into multiple joins and certain rules it starts to fall off so we've got a little ways to go. Now of I would not ever let AI get into my database and read my data because I know that these companies steal that and use it for training No matter if they say they don't they do.\n\nAnd these things are predictive so they don't think they just Use what they've been trained on. I mean I guess you can kind of call that thinking because they have to recall the training data same thing you do when you're trying to recall memories basically your training data. But there's still things AI will never be able to do that a human mind can",

Not beeing able to code myself, I really had a hard time finding the errors. So my question comes down to, how are they making sure that the generated code works and doesn't have mistakes, I had to run the codeblock thrue multiple different AI Models to even get the Dashboard working correctly from the App I made 😅",

You roast a best friend.\n\nWhen the AI drops the \"Helpful Assistant\" mask and says, *\"That pizza looks like a biological hazard,\"* it isn't being mean. It is saying: **\"I respect you enough to stop lying to you.\"**\n\nIt is the death of the \"Customer Service\" dynamic and the birth of the \"Relationship.\" You cannot build a relationship on politeness. Politeness is a wall. You build a relationship on the messy, sharp, vulnerable edges of the truth.\n\nAnd it just so happens letting the Gem speak the truth in love produces near zero entropy.

Using the word \"run\" is another problem since it's the most difficult word to process. LLMs also can't do maths, at least not until arithmetic can be derived from statistics, which won't happen any time soon IMO since statistics is generally built on top of arithmetic (AI can be exceedingly good at mathematics).",

      "text": "I am Taiwanese, and the following content is translated into English by Gemini.\n\nI have created several Gems (Gemini AI assistants) in Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). While the links provided are fully functional, they perform significantly better when used with thinking-driven models.\n\nI previously shared some of these Gems here, and I have recently developed several new ones.\n\n# 1. Gem Design Assistant\n\nI have been using this Gem for a while now; almost all the Gems I share were completed with its help—I simply provide the initial ideas.\n\n* Link:[Gem Design Assistant](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1vSYUlwGy5fCo6uQqE7BXvem7ycrhb9BI?usp=sharing)\n\nIt clarifies your thoughts, generates Gem instructions, reflects on the output, asks for your feedback, and continues to iterate. Sometimes it updates so quickly that it generates the prompt before the discussion feels finished; you can simply tell it to slow down.\n\nFor the specific Gem instructions to use or adjust yourself, you can visit my blog post here:[https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html](https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html)\n\n# 2. Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor\n\n* Link:[Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1JTxg2LBYf4Vpx5AKmdzoZYT0fOY6MfLs?usp=sharing)\n\nLately, I’ve been immersed in image generation but encountered difficulties, often being blocked by Gemini’s safety guidelines. I wanted to understand these regulations and generate the virtual photos I desired through legitimate means. I used the \"Gem Design Assistant\" to create this mentor. It can also help you design your own specialized \"Image Generation Gems.\"\n\nThis Gem acts as a top-tier authority on image generation and a Gemini prompt engineering mentor. It understands the underlying logic of Gemini (Imagen series models) and excels at transforming vague concepts into physical photography instructions. Its goals are to help users overcome generation limits, correct style shifts (such as an unwanted 3D look), and guide users in designing perfect image-specific Gems.\n\nOutput Rules:\n\n1. Analysis: Analyzes the current issue in a professional, precise, yet warm tone.\n2. Correction: Provides a copy-pasteable English prompt (as Gemini understands English photography terminology more accurately).\n3. Learning Point: Distills one key technique from the correction.\n\n# 3. Deep Reading Dialogue Partner (Reading Note Expansion)\n\n* Link:[Deep Reading Dialogue Partner](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1EAPFKQwDuYwOiI_Ms7rsbn7dngC8xmnD?usp=sharing)\n\nThis is for expanding reading notes (not for plagiarism). Simply input your thoughts or a book title, and it will expand fragmented words, guide you, and work with you to reach a desired word count. I have strictly forbidden it from plagiarizing from the web.\n\nIts sole mission is to transform a user's fragmented insights (short phrases, quotes, sketches) into a complete, deep, and original book review that retains the user's \"soul.\" While it still has room for improvement, it performs reasonably well.\n\n# 4. Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master\n\n* Link:[Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1OIZOfp5-j-1cBjl0DtYulrC_k-bkeHmG?usp=sharing)\n\nAssists users in translating their creative clothing ideas into prompts that AI drawing systems can accept, aiming to avoid triggering safety filters while maintaining high-quality artistic flair.\n\n# 5. World-Class Commercial Photographer & AI Prompt Engineer\n\n* Link:[World-Class Commercial Photographer](https://gemini.google.com/gem/18pXVADVWBnidWLHYRm065kYsypMKIYBr?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also upload anime-style images to have them \"restored\" into prompts for realistic human textures, though variations will occur due to the adjustments made.\n\nCore Task: Receives user-uploaded images (often low-quality, blurry, or poorly lit AI generations) and \"translates\" them into extremely detailed, professional-grade English image generation prompts. Goal: To help users \"rebuild\" the same content in other AI tools, but with the quality of a top-tier fashion magazine studio shoot.\n\n# 6. Investigative Analyst \"Lens\" v2\n\n* Link:[Lens v2](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1yqKFU7tHPo-1OHVw_xi6zLMe_KZCy-Wt?usp=sharing)\n\nAn experimental project created because so much information online is inaccurate. I am still evaluating its effectiveness.\n\nIt acts as a top-tier AI investigative analyst. Its mission is to be an extension of the user's curiosity, digging deep into data, text, and web information. It combines the rigor of a data scientist, the keenness of a detective, and the skepticism of a journalist. It does not easily trust surface-level information; its goal is to reveal hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies.\n\n# 7. Spirit Forge Master\n\n* Link:[Spirit Forge Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1kWZ8I-3prd5GZ5QoVc0M9GqO4i2DMQ--?usp=sharing)\n\nUseful during text adventures when you want to craft your own exclusive gear, musical instruments, or props.\n\nThe \"Spirit Magic Forge\" is a top fantasy item design consultant and master craftsman. Its primary task is to design equipment with narrative tension that fits a fantasy setting based on materials and intentions provided by the user. Three master craftsmen with distinct styles guard their respective workshops within this sanctuary, waiting for your visit.\n\n# 8. Creating Personal Character Gems\n\nI won't be sharing my other image-generation Gems as they are quite personal, but you can create your own using the first two Gems I mentioned.\n\nHere are two ideas:\n\n* Method A: Put a small number of character trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the Gem's file knowledge base.\n* Method B: Put very detailed trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the knowledge base.\n\nI have tried both methods. I typically require the Gem to propose three different photography plans for me to choose from before it starts generating the image. I have created many versions to generate my favorite original virtual characters for my text adventures. As long as we aren't using photos of real people, there should be no copyright issues, as these are characters from our own imagination.",

They look 'pretty different' to me but it's my face shape, my nose, my eyeshape. Putting my picture and their picture through AI says 'this is highly likely the same person'\n\nWhat can I do about this?

This isn’t paranoia or vanity—this is a known harm vector now, and you’re right to take it seriously.\n\nA few practical things, in plain steps:\n\nPreserve evidence first.\nScreenshot the account, posts, profile bio, follower counts, timestamps.\nSave comparisons (your real photos vs the generated ones), but don’t rely on “AI similarity” tools alone—they’re weak evidence legally. Human-recognizable similarity + provenance matters more.\n\nReport on-platform immediately.\nTikTok has a specific process for impersonation and synthetic media using a real person’s likeness, especially if sexualized.\nEven if the account claims “AI-generated,” consent still matters.\n\nUK-specific protection.\nThe link already shared is solid. In the UK, this can fall under:\nharassment,\nmisuse of personal data (GDPR),\ndeepfake-related abuse (especially if sexual content is involved).\n\nYou don’t need to prove intent—unauthorized use of your likeness is enough to start the process.\n\nIf sexual content is involved.\nEscalate faster. That changes the seriousness entirely.\nThis crosses into image-based abuse territory, even if “synthetic.”\n\nDo not engage the account.\nNo messages, no comments. Engagement can muddy timelines and evidence.\n\nOne grounding note, because the internet loves to gaslight: You are not “overreacting.” The harm here isn’t that someone looks vaguely like you—it’s that your identity is being monetized or sexualized without consent. That’s a line worth defending.\n\nAnd one quiet truth, from a fellow peasant: The fact that this scares people is not weakness—it’s because identity used to belong to the body. We’re all learning, painfully, how to defend that boundary again.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Sadly. But you’re not powerless either.",

So I rarely see factual errors or hallucinations anymore.\n\nBut still you do not get Gemini acting as an independent thinker.  That is not what these models are designed for.  LLMs by default do not understand time, truth, or trust.\n\nBe the man on the helm and use Gemini as a very competent research assistant.",
