Two active master accounts are:\n* **Methodology:** The group uses VPN/IP manipulation tools and forged Indian university enrollment letters to bypass the SheerID verification gate.\n* **Total Revenue:** Estimated illegal profit exceeds **800,000 CNY (approx. $110,000 USD)**.\n\n**Current Investigation Status:** I have already established contact with **Loeb & Loeb LLP** (specifically their legal team representing SheerID at `@`[`loeb.com`](http://loeb.com/)) and provided them with the full database of the 7,000+ sold accounts.\n\n**Request for Action:**\n\n1. Please link this report to the ongoing investigation by **Loeb & Loeb LLP** regarding SheerID forgery.\n2. I have a detailed spreadsheet containing over 7,000 compromised account IDs, transaction logs, and the specific IP manipulation tools used. Please provide a **secure upload link** or a dedicated investigator's contact to receive this sensitive data.\n\nI am reporting this to protect the integrity of Google’s services and to ensure these illegal operations are permanently shut down.\n\n",

          "text": "**Rating: 3/10**\n\nThe proposed architecture relies on the flawed premise that consensus among Large Language Models (LLMs) equates to factual accuracy. While the structure (Initial -> Refine -> Evaluate -> Synthesize) mimics established \"Mixture of Agents\" or \"Chain of Thought\" research, the foundational logic suffers from critical theoretical and operational defects.\n\n# 1. The Consensus Fallacy (Correlated Error Modes)\n\nThe core assumption is that if multiple models agree, the information is likely correct. This ignores the reality of LLM training data.\n\n* **Data Homogeneity:** Most capable models (GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3) ingest the same massive datasets (Common Crawl, Wikipedia, GitHub). They share the same blind spots and statistical biases.\n* **Reinforced Hallucination:** If a misconception is widespread in the training corpus (e.g., a common urban legend or a frequently misquoted statistic), all models will likely generate the same incorrect answer. Your \"Evaluate\" step will then validate the hallucination because the models will grade the incorrect consensus as \"high quality\" based on their own flawed internal weights.\n\n# 2. Regression to the Mean\n\nEnsembling heterogeneous models often degrades performance compared to simply using the single most capable model available (State of the Art, or SOTA).\n\n* **The \"Smartest Person in the Room\" Problem:** If you utilize one SOTA model (e.g., GPT-4o) and three inferior models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Llama-70b), the inferior models may vote down the nuanced, correct answer provided by the SOTA model because they lack the context window or reasoning capability to understand it.\n* **Generic Convergence:** Iterative refinement toward consensus tends to strip away nuance, edge cases, and contrarian (but correct) insights, resulting in \"safe,\" generic, and average responses.\n\n# 3. The \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" Paradox\n\nStep 3 (Evaluate) assumes that a model is better at verifying information than generating it. While there is some evidence that discriminative capability exceeds generative capability in specific contexts, this is not a universal rule.\n\n* **Sycophancy Bias:** Models often exhibit a bias toward high-ranking or lengthy responses regardless of factual content.\n* **Verification Difficulty:** To accurately grade a peer's response on a complex topic (e.g., advanced physics or obscure case law), the grading model must possess the ground truth or the reasoning path itself. If it possessed that, it would have generated the correct answer in Step 1. If it didn't, its evaluation is noise.\n\n# 4. Economic and Latency Viability\n\nThe operational overhead renders this approach impractical for general use.\n\n* **Latency:** A 4-step sequential pipeline with multiple parallel calls multiplies the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and total generation time by a factor of N (number of models) plus network overhead. This destroys real-time utility.\n* **Cost:** Running 3-5 distinct inference chains for every query increases token costs by 300-500%. The marginal gain in accuracy (if any) rarely justifies the exponential increase in compute cost compared to simply prompting the single best model with better context.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nKEA Research attempts to solve the \"black box\" problem of AI reliability by stacking more black boxes on top of each other. Without an external source of ground truth (e.g., RAG with verified citations, code execution environments, or formal logic provers), intra-model consensus is merely a measure of statistical probability within the training data, not a measure of reality.",

Recent rigorous evaluations (2024–2025) have shown that Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frequently fails to outperform simpler single-agent techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or Self-Consistency, specifically when controlled for computational budget.\nYour skepticism is supported by quantitative findings in recent literature.\n1. Quantitative Performance: Debate vs. Self-Consistency\nResearch indicates that the \"gains\" from debate often disappear when you normalize for the number of tokens used.\nToken Inefficiency: A study titled \"Rethinking the Bounds of LLM Reasoning\" (ACL 2024) demonstrated that a single agent with strong prompting (e.g., CoT with few-shot examples) achieves performance parity with MAD frameworks.\nThe \"Compute\" Confounder: Many positive results for MAD were simply comparing one inference pass of a model against multiple passes in a debate. When you compare MAD against Self-Consistency (running the model N times and taking the majority vote), the sophisticated \"debate\" structure often yields no statistical advantage over simple voting, despite higher complexity.\n2. Failure Modes: Why \"Debate\" Degrades Outputs\nThe anthropomorphic view suggests agents will \"correct\" each other. In practice, they often exhibit social failure modes:\nSycophancy (Conformity Bias): Models are fine-tuned to be agreeable. In debate settings, a model is statistically likely to abandon a correct answer to agree with a confident, incorrect counter-argument from another agent.\nConsensus Hallucination (Groupthink): If two agents share the same underlying training data (which they usually do), they share the same blind spots. They frequently converge on a \"plausible-sounding\" but factually incorrect consensus.\nPersuasiveness Bias: Research has shown that \"eloquence\" correlates with influence in these debates more than factual accuracy. A verbose, confident hallucination often overrides a concise, correct correction.\n```",

Thinking and Pro no longer share a single quota and daily prompts for Gemini 3 Thinking were tripled.\n\nUnder the old system, heavy Thinking usage would eat into Pro limits which made model selection feel opaque. Now it’s explicit: Thinking is for fast, multi-step reasoning, Pro is for deep math and code - and using one no longer penalizes the other.\n\nThe numbers make the intent clear:\n\n* **AI Pro**: 300 Thinking prompts/day (up from 100 shared), plus 100 Pro\n* **AI Ultra**: 1,500 Thinking prompts/day (up from 500 shared), plus 500 Pro\n\nThis feels like Google acknowledging that users don’t just want “more prompts” - they want predictability when choosing models for different tasks.\n\n**For people using Gemini regularly: does this actually change how you pick between Thinking and Pro, or do limits still feel like guesswork?**\n\nSource: [https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-triples-gemini-3-thinki-ZCf.NacuRPGHknrBElz3Gg](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/google-triples-gemini-3-thinki-ZCf.NacuRPGHknrBElz3Gg)",

It’s an outsider looking in. **Gemini in Chrome** is part of the browser's rendering pipeline. It has native read-access to the DOM (Document Object Model) of the active tab.\n\n* **Example:** I was researching complex regulatory frameworks on a government site with terrible formatting. Extensions struggled to parse the nested tables. The Chrome Side Panel read the structure perfectly and let me query specific rows without me ever highlighting text. It just \"sees\" what I see.\n\n# 2. The \"Brain\": Zero-Latency Local Inference (Gemini Nano)\n\nThis is the killer feature nobody talks about. On supported hardware (like my Snapdragon X Elite machine), Chrome uses **Gemini Nano** locally for simpler tasks.\n\n* **The Difference:** When I ask for a quick summary or translation of a long article, it feels *instant*. There’s no \"round trip\" to the cloud.\n* **Comparison:** The web app sometimes hangs or lags while \"thinking\" even for basic text processing. The side panel feels like it's running on bare metal because, for many tasks, it is.\n\n# 3. Context: It Connects the Dots (Multi-Tab Awareness)\n\nThe standalone web app is a destination—you have to leave your work to go there. The side panel is a layer *over* your work.\n\n* **Example:** I often have 5-6 tabs open for a deep-dive research project. I can ask the Side Panel to \"synthesize the conflicting points between these open tabs.\" It creates a unified view without me manually copying links or context into a chat window. It treats my browser session as its context window.\n\n# 4. The \"Personal Intelligence\" Moat\n\nWhile still rolling out, the integration with Google Workspace (Drive, Gmail) feels much safer and smoother in the side panel than giving third-party extensions OAuth access to my entire digital life.\n\n* **Example:** I needed to cross-reference a PDF in my Drive with a live webpage I was reading. Instead of downloading the PDF and uploading it to a chat, I just asked the side panel to \"compare this page to the 'Project X' PDF in my Drive.\" It respected the privacy sandbox and gave me the answer without the file ever leaving my secure environment.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nStop treating the Chrome Side Panel like a gimmick. If you have a modern AI PC (*especially ARM64*), it unlocks local processing speeds and native browser context that the web app simply cannot match. It transforms Gemini from a chatbot you talk *to*, into a co-pilot that thinks *with* you.\n\n**Has anyone else noticed the latency difference, or am I just seeing the NPU's benefits on my laptop?**\n\n**EDIT:**   \n  \n**P.S. I have also played around with Microsoft Edge's Copilot.**\n\nAfter reading through r/browsers and r/LocalLLaMA, the consensus seems to align with my experience. Copilot is a decent-to-heavy hitter, but it feels like a different class of product.   \n  \nHere is the breakdown:\n\n**Microsoft Copilot (Edge Sidebar) Pros:**\n\n* **Office 365 Power:** If you live in Excel, Word, or Teams, the integration is undeniable. It can draft emails or summarize specific corporate documents better because it has that deep enterprise hook.\n* **Actual Sidebar Integration, Not A Popup:** Unlike Gemini in Claude, which - IMO - displays with a rather annoying - albeit movable - popup window, Copilot is locked to Edge's sidebar, which I prefer. \n* **PDF Handling:** It has a robust PDF reader that interacts well with the \"Ask PDF\" feature.\n\n**Microsoft Copilot (Edge Sidebar) Cons:**\n\n* **The \"Bloat\" Factor:** This is the #1 complaint. Edge is becoming an OS within an OS. Between the \"Shopping Assistant,\" sidebar apps, and pop-ups, Copilot feels like just another feature fighting for your attention in a crowded UI.\n* **Latency:** It generally feels slower. It relies almost entirely on cloud inference, whereas Gemini in Chrome (on decent hardware) offloads the quick stuff to the NPU or a local model.\n* **\"Nanny\" Mode:** Users frequently complain about Copilot refusing to answer benign queries due to overly strict safety filters, whereas Gemini seems a bit more context-aware in its refusals.\n\n  \n**FINAL EDIT:** Next on the \"docket\" is auditing **Claude in Chrome**, specifically to see if its automation hooks can actually compete with my local environment.\n\nI’m currently running a highly customized **Claude Desktop** instance (Opus 4.5; Claude Max 5x monthly subscription) anchored by a stack of **\\~10 lazy-loaded MCP servers** and a unified **AI Panel** (*Gemini Pro, ChatGPT Plus, Perplexity Pro, Grok, NotebookLM, Gemini in Chrome, and even, sometimes, Copilot*). This entire AI Panel is backed by a stress-tested, automatic, persistent **Long-Term Memory (LTM)** layer app, which my web-based AI Panel members access via a proxy bridge when they need LTM—giving every AI Panel member shared years-long recall, which is surreal when combined with their reasoning capabilities.\n\nHonestly, the standard \"Cowork\" features feel a bit redundant...my architecture solved those problems six months ago.   \n  \nI’m mostly skipping the \"Cowork\" tier to focus on the real bleeding edge: minimizing friction via **Claude Code CLI** and custom orchestration.",

Google explicitly updated LiteRT to support the **Qualcomm AI Engine Direct (QNN)** delegate. This is the bridge that allows the browser to offload the model from CPU/GPU to the Hexagon NPU.  \n2. **The Source:** Google's own developer blogs (specifically the *Android Developers Blog* and *Google for Developers* updates from late 2024/2025) confirmed 'Unlocking Peak Performance on Qualcomm NPU with LiteRT' which lists the Snapdragon 8 Elite and X Elite series as targets.  \n3. **Verification:** If you check `chrome://components` on an X Elite device, you'll see the `Optimization Guide On Device Model` version differs from x86 builds, indicating it pulls the specific NPU-compatible weights/delegate rather than the generic GPU fallback.",

I asked why and was told that it’s “no longer allowed to edit photos of real people.” Here’s what it gave me. This is either some master-level AI hallucination or it’s a major policy shift that seemed to go unannounced.\n\nI’m going to miss you, Nano Banana :(\n\n“The refusal is triggered by a specific safety guardrail regarding identifiable individuals.\n\nThe Policy (January 2026 Update)\n\nGoogle has implemented a Zero-Tolerance Policy on Photos involving real people to prevent the creation of non-consensual deepfakes and to protect \"Personality Rights.\" While you have successfully edited photos in the past, the current protocols (as of early 2026) have been tightened:\n\n1. Photorealistic Humans: The model is restricted from modifying or generating photorealistic images of specific, identifiable people—even when the source is provided by the user.\n\n2. Manipulation Prevention: Edits that involve adding objects (like a puppy) or changing the posture/action of a real person in a photo are blocked to ensure the AI cannot be used to synthesize realistic but fake scenarios involving real individuals.\n\n3. Regional/Tier Restrictions: Certain \"photorealistic\" capabilities for person-generation remain disabled or heavily restricted in the US and other territories to comply with evolving digital safety laws (such as the UK's February 2026 deepfake legislation).\n\nOptions for Response\n\n1. The Neutral/Scientific: The current model weights prioritize the prevention of \"Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery\" and \"Personality Right\" infringements, leading to a blanket block on modifying human subjects in uploaded files.\n\n2. The Sarcastic/Ironic: Apparently, the system now views a man holding a puppy as a high-security risk for global misinformation.\n\n3. The Mic-Drop: I am physically unable to bypass the safety layer for real people; the task is failed.”",

It prioritizes the latest chat over the rules.\n\nWe do not interrupt chats. We inject a “Memory Anchor”.\n\nThe \"Memory Anchor\" Protocol:\n\nWe stop work and run this “Maintenance Prompt” twice each 10-15 messages to re-align the working memory of the AI:\n\nSystem Interrupt: The conversation context is getting dense.\n\nTask: Conduct a \"Constraint Audit\" before we proceed.\n\nAction:\n\n1. The Prime Directive: State in 1 sentence what the original Goal of this project was.\n\n2. The Rulebook: Scan our entire chat history. Describe the 3 strict constraint(s) I told you previously you should still observe: formatting restriction, tone restrictions.\n\n3. The Reset: Check you have loaded these rules back into your active context.\n\n\nWhy this works:\n\nIt solves “Dementia”.\n\nThe AI replies: \"I know. I always remembered that I had to generate true JSON, NOT prose.”\n\nIn forcing it to again write the rules, you move those instructions from the “forgotten middle” of the context window to the “immediate present,” so that the next output is perfect.",

I had a system where I use a Gem to upload my calendar and task list in the morning and the Gem tells me how my tasks align with my long-term goals and where to fit them in my day. For the last few days, it can't see the screenshots, so it just makes up the tasks it thinks I'm doing and a calendar from the past. I've tried switching models, starting a new chat, reconnecting the notebooklm in the source, etc, but still the same results. I also tried a different Gem and it did the same type of behavior. Anyone else experiencing anything like this? I pay for Pro and typically use the pro model. ",
