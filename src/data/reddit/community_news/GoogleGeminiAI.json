Two active master accounts are:\n* **Methodology:** The group uses VPN/IP manipulation tools and forged Indian university enrollment letters to bypass the SheerID verification gate.\n* **Total Revenue:** Estimated illegal profit exceeds **800,000 CNY (approx. $110,000 USD)**.\n\n**Current Investigation Status:** I have already established contact with **Loeb & Loeb LLP** (specifically their legal team representing SheerID at `@`[`loeb.com`](http://loeb.com/)) and provided them with the full database of the 7,000+ sold accounts.\n\n**Request for Action:**\n\n1. Please link this report to the ongoing investigation by **Loeb & Loeb LLP** regarding SheerID forgery.\n2. I have a detailed spreadsheet containing over 7,000 compromised account IDs, transaction logs, and the specific IP manipulation tools used. Please provide a **secure upload link** or a dedicated investigator's contact to receive this sensitive data.\n\nI am reporting this to protect the integrity of Google’s services and to ensure these illegal operations are permanently shut down.\n\n",

This will definitely disrupt and even eventually replace low quality, high-volume, low-price test prep services, because those types of companies will have a difficult time convincing customers that what they do is much different from what this new AI feature offers. This is because the tutors themselves aren't that good and the service is aimed at people who can't afford better ones. \n\nHowever, more elite (and expensive) 1-on-1 services won't be affected as much because what they can do (help students starting in the 90th percentile get to the 99th, etc) isn't something that a chatbot can do. And as long as the industry is focused on LLMs, and not neuro-symbolic AI or real world models, which are far more accurate, we'll always be dealing with hallucinations and thus something that can't replace a human. \n\nAdditionally, I know from experience that people who have the money to pay for elite prep don't give two shits about AI when it comes to their children's future. They will happily pay $300+/hr for a reputable instructor than risk their kid's academics for an experimental technology.",

      "text": "I am Taiwanese, and the following content is translated into English by Gemini.\n\nI have created several Gems (Gemini AI assistants) in Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). While the links provided are fully functional, they perform significantly better when used with thinking-driven models.\n\nI previously shared some of these Gems here, and I have recently developed several new ones.\n\n# 1. Gem Design Assistant\n\nI have been using this Gem for a while now; almost all the Gems I share were completed with its help—I simply provide the initial ideas.\n\n* Link:[Gem Design Assistant](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1vSYUlwGy5fCo6uQqE7BXvem7ycrhb9BI?usp=sharing)\n\nIt clarifies your thoughts, generates Gem instructions, reflects on the output, asks for your feedback, and continues to iterate. Sometimes it updates so quickly that it generates the prompt before the discussion feels finished; you can simply tell it to slow down.\n\nFor the specific Gem instructions to use or adjust yourself, you can visit my blog post here:[https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html](https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html)\n\n# 2. Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor\n\n* Link:[Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1JTxg2LBYf4Vpx5AKmdzoZYT0fOY6MfLs?usp=sharing)\n\nLately, I’ve been immersed in image generation but encountered difficulties, often being blocked by Gemini’s safety guidelines. I wanted to understand these regulations and generate the virtual photos I desired through legitimate means. I used the \"Gem Design Assistant\" to create this mentor. It can also help you design your own specialized \"Image Generation Gems.\"\n\nThis Gem acts as a top-tier authority on image generation and a Gemini prompt engineering mentor. It understands the underlying logic of Gemini (Imagen series models) and excels at transforming vague concepts into physical photography instructions. Its goals are to help users overcome generation limits, correct style shifts (such as an unwanted 3D look), and guide users in designing perfect image-specific Gems.\n\nOutput Rules:\n\n1. Analysis: Analyzes the current issue in a professional, precise, yet warm tone.\n2. Correction: Provides a copy-pasteable English prompt (as Gemini understands English photography terminology more accurately).\n3. Learning Point: Distills one key technique from the correction.\n\n# 3. Deep Reading Dialogue Partner (Reading Note Expansion)\n\n* Link:[Deep Reading Dialogue Partner](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1EAPFKQwDuYwOiI_Ms7rsbn7dngC8xmnD?usp=sharing)\n\nThis is for expanding reading notes (not for plagiarism). Simply input your thoughts or a book title, and it will expand fragmented words, guide you, and work with you to reach a desired word count. I have strictly forbidden it from plagiarizing from the web.\n\nIts sole mission is to transform a user's fragmented insights (short phrases, quotes, sketches) into a complete, deep, and original book review that retains the user's \"soul.\" While it still has room for improvement, it performs reasonably well.\n\n# 4. Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master\n\n* Link:[Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1OIZOfp5-j-1cBjl0DtYulrC_k-bkeHmG?usp=sharing)\n\nAssists users in translating their creative clothing ideas into prompts that AI drawing systems can accept, aiming to avoid triggering safety filters while maintaining high-quality artistic flair.\n\n# 5. World-Class Commercial Photographer & AI Prompt Engineer\n\n* Link:[World-Class Commercial Photographer](https://gemini.google.com/gem/18pXVADVWBnidWLHYRm065kYsypMKIYBr?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also upload anime-style images to have them \"restored\" into prompts for realistic human textures, though variations will occur due to the adjustments made.\n\nCore Task: Receives user-uploaded images (often low-quality, blurry, or poorly lit AI generations) and \"translates\" them into extremely detailed, professional-grade English image generation prompts. Goal: To help users \"rebuild\" the same content in other AI tools, but with the quality of a top-tier fashion magazine studio shoot.\n\n# 6. Investigative Analyst \"Lens\" v2\n\n* Link:[Lens v2](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1yqKFU7tHPo-1OHVw_xi6zLMe_KZCy-Wt?usp=sharing)\n\nAn experimental project created because so much information online is inaccurate. I am still evaluating its effectiveness.\n\nIt acts as a top-tier AI investigative analyst. Its mission is to be an extension of the user's curiosity, digging deep into data, text, and web information. It combines the rigor of a data scientist, the keenness of a detective, and the skepticism of a journalist. It does not easily trust surface-level information; its goal is to reveal hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies.\n\n# 7. Spirit Forge Master\n\n* Link:[Spirit Forge Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1kWZ8I-3prd5GZ5QoVc0M9GqO4i2DMQ--?usp=sharing)\n\nUseful during text adventures when you want to craft your own exclusive gear, musical instruments, or props.\n\nThe \"Spirit Magic Forge\" is a top fantasy item design consultant and master craftsman. Its primary task is to design equipment with narrative tension that fits a fantasy setting based on materials and intentions provided by the user. Three master craftsmen with distinct styles guard their respective workshops within this sanctuary, waiting for your visit.\n\n# 8. Creating Personal Character Gems\n\nI won't be sharing my other image-generation Gems as they are quite personal, but you can create your own using the first two Gems I mentioned.\n\nHere are two ideas:\n\n* Method A: Put a small number of character trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the Gem's file knowledge base.\n* Method B: Put very detailed trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the knowledge base.\n\nI have tried both methods. I typically require the Gem to propose three different photography plans for me to choose from before it starts generating the image. I have created many versions to generate my favorite original virtual characters for my text adventures. As long as we aren't using photos of real people, there should be no copyright issues, as these are characters from our own imagination.",

Trying to explain \"I want a card centered with a shadow and a small badge on top right\" takes 3 paragraphs and the AI is still getting it wrong.\n\nI stopped typing descriptions. I started drawing.\n\nThe \"Napkin-to-Code\" Protocol:\n\nI draw a terrible, messy wireframe on paper or white board. I take a photo and send it to Gemini.\n\nThe Prompt:\n\nInput: [Upload Image of Sketch] You are a Senior Tailwind & React Developer. Task: To convert this “Low-Fidelity Wireframe” into Production-Ready Code.\n\nInference Rules (The Magic):\n\nDecode: Treat messy squiggles as “Lorem Ipsum” text. Give boxes an ‘X’ as “Image Placeholders.”\n\nRespect Geometry: Do NOT \"fix\" my layout. If I pulled the button on the left, keep it on the left.\n\nStyle: Look modern (Apple/Stripe aesthetic), but follow the lines exactly as the drawing.\n\nWhy:\n\nIt omits the \"Translation Loss.\"\n\nGemini “sees” the spatial relationship instantly. It knows the button is 20px off the text, because it looks like that. I can switch from a “Paper Scribble” to a “Live Component” in 30 seconds without putting up a single line of CSS logic.",

          "text": "​Hey u/bigskymind, you're definitely not alone in this. Gemini can sometimes act like an over-eager assistant who tries way too hard to \"connect the dots\" between things that should stay separate.\n\n​If you want to put a stop to those awkward \"photographic fish tea\" suggestions, the most effective way is to use Custom Instructions. You can find this in your settings (usually under your profile icon > Settings > Custom Instructions).\n\n​Try adding these snippets to your \"How would you like Gemini to respond?\" section:\n​Strict Topic Isolation: \"Treat every chat as a discrete unit. Do not attempt to bridge or synthesize connections between unrelated topics from previous conversations.\"\n\n​Minimalist Memory: \"Only reference information from past chats if I explicitly ask you to 'recall' or 'look back' at something. Otherwise, treat every new chat as a blank slate.\"\n\n​Direct Intent: \"Prioritize the immediate intent of the current prompt. Avoid providing unsolicited suggestions based on my other hobbies or interests.\"\n\n​Two other quick tips:\n​The \"Forget\" Command: If Gemini keeps bringing up a specific topic (like the fish), you can literally tell it in the chat: \"Forget everything you've recorded about my interest in fish recipes.\" It should confirm it has cleared that specific data point.\n\n​Toggle Personalization: If you want zero cross-talk ever, you can go to Settings > Gemini Extensions or Settings > Personalization and toggle off the \"Memory\" or \"Personalization\" features. This forces it to treat you like a stranger every time—which is great for privacy, though you lose the \"good\" parts of it remembering your preferences.\n\n​Hope that helps clear up the clutter!",
