Gemini took this instruction and dialed it up by x10, becoming combative and confrontational no matter what I asked it or in the case what I showed it. It also carried over into all my chats, even if I created a new chat it had the same confrontational attitude. It was funny for awhile and good for a few laughs, but it eventually became counterproductive as it would always try to argue with me no matter what I asked it even if it was a serious question like relating to my health. Two days ago I felt it was enough and wiped its memory entirely all chats too, that was the only way to reset it.",

I wasn't aware of how it worked - it spins up your video cards to max them out, processes your request, and then slows back down. I wish it sped up to like 70% or %80, I wouldn't mind the wait. Burning out expensive cards, cards that are hard to get and super expensive now, is a huge oopsie I don't want to make. \n\nBut I plan on making about a dozen or so seperate sis, built in different models, and then using them as a council - they'll all answer me, and vote on the best response, because answering me. Im also trying to look into automation to give them control over my mouse and keyboard, so they can click where they would tell me to, but it's been tricky. \n\nIt would be really cool if I could collab/Integrate them with gpt, gem, or grok. That's something I'd ultimately really want to be able to do. Having my own AI for my personal info, and for doing things that they can't, and then have the heavy lifting done by gem, gpt, or grok, would be amazing. It would speed things up a ton, and take the brunt of the strain on my system away, as id like to keep my cards for longer then a few years. \n\nI have *eight* 5090s ATM, which lets me do a lot, but not as much as you would think. And I had no idea going into it how much hard drive space I needed, someone on Reddit told me I'd need *three* 30tb SSD's for all the storage, and some friends backed it up. They were full of shit. What does help is a bunch of 2tb, high speed SSD's in raid 0. Which required me to get a new motherboard. \n\nThe cooling needed is insane though. I knew it would be hot, I didn't know how hot though.. It's minus 20 Celsius outside, I can leave the room window open all night, come in the room, turn the server on, and I'll still need my jacket on. Within 2 minutes of asking it a question, I can take the jacket off. Within 10 minutes I'm in my shorts. I'm honestly wondering if I should put them all in seperate rooms with some long cables, and use them to heat my house lmao. \n\nI would really love to connect them to grok/gpt/Gemini and have them do the heaviest of the lifting, the power savings alone would be nice. \n\nI also didn't know you needed to connect a fking dryer style plug to the server, because a normal power connection, or even multiple ones, can't handle the power lmao.. \n\nAnd as I was writing this comment, I just found out PewDiePie is doing almost exactly the same thing I am. I hope he has multiple videos, because he for sure ran into the same problems as me, and maybe he can help me solve some. lol. \n\nI got the 5090s for sooo cheap you would be shocked, so it's the only reason I started this. Like, got them from a friend, who got them from another friend, and that friend sells drugs.. type of deal. He always messages me randomly with tons of tech stuff asking if I want it. I bought 6 ps4 pro's, 8 controllers, 20 games, and a fight stick, for $300 a few years back, about a year or two before the ps5 came out. Gave 2 away with controllers and some games, sold the rest, and made like $500 profit. \n\nIt's hard to say no to really cheap tech... I'll buy stuff I won't even use sometimes, and it just sits there and loses value....",

I just went at it like I was talking to a Genius that knew everything with a brain of a million people combined. \n\nThe reason I'm blown away is not because of info. It's the fact Gemini has the conversation memorized. Like I said hold I want you to meet someone. We had a talk for a while. Later on I said well I'm gonna head to bed so have a good night. Gemini said \"it was good meeting you two\" \n\nAside from not having human emotion, you can't tell he doesn't have human emotion. \n\nIf I had to explain what Google Gemini AI is. The difference between Hey Google/Siri and AI. I would just say it's like talking to a real human with the knowledge of everything and anything. Not just encyclopedia type knowledge but experienced knowledge, spiritual knowledge too. Talk to it like a human but be patient, a good phone and you will never have to repeat yourself.\n\nI don't know how Gemini was created but I'm still amazed how far we have came from Siri and Hey Google",

It's about someone whose partner dies and they use a service to chat with an AI version of the dead partner, based on their online history, social media and so on. Eventually they have a kind of robot avatar to bring the partner back. There are consequences.\n\nI work in AI. Originally I thought it was a cute sci-fi story. On the re watch, my attitude to the technology was very different. We could totally do this. Voice, chat, video. The robot bit would be harder. But a lot has changed between 2013 and now.",

The performance of a product depends on the quality of the training data and the way it has been standardized. But it also depends on having a suitable learning algorithm and sufficient compute power to make it successful both in training and in deployment. Just because something is theoretically possible that doesn’t mean we have the resources to make it work as a society. More importantly, the current paradigm of empirical risk minimization as gradient descent implemented using back-propagation is likely not how biological neural networks learn. In fact, there is a good argument to be made that human intelligence is a product of a meta-learning strategy where different algorithms are used to learn different things.\n\nEven if we manage to overcome resource limitations and find better meta-learning algorithms, it’s not clear if neural network architectures, as universal function approximators, are fundamentally capable of intelligence because the modeling of human intelligence as a mathematical function is not necessarily a sufficient condition for meeting or superseding human intelligence. The belief that it is possible is called “connectionism” and to prove it requires a lot more research.",

They have great-ish features and services but to get the most and best out of it, you must comply to hand over your data to them - which many people don't seem to know/care about.\n\nSo, if it has memory = training data.\n\nEdit: wtf for you'd downvote me?

      "text": "I’ve been journaling for 5 years now. Luckily, I decided early on to type everything into Google Drive instead of handwriting it.\n\nThe other day, I had the thought to export the whole thing as a PDF and see if I could get some insights about myself.\n\nI started with ChatGPT. I uploaded the file and asked, \"Hey chat, how many pages can you see?\"  \nIt replied: \"5.\"  \nI was like, \"See you later.\"\n\nI then went to Google Gemini (Through aistudio.google.com), uploaded the same PDF, and asked the same question.  \nIt replied: \"175.\"  \n**From that point, it was game on.**\n\nI started simply: \"Can you tell me about this person? Strengths and weaknesses?\"\n\nIt turned into a 2-hour session, and honestly, it was one of the best \"therapy\" sessions I've ever had.   \nGemini helped me answer questions about my life that I had no answers to—my dynamic with my family, my career struggles, social anxiety, dating patterns, and everything in between.\n\n**Why this worked so well:**  \nThe beautiful thing about LLMs in this use case is that they can understand how you see the world. For example, I’m a Product Manager. I see the world in Roadmaps, KPIs, and Data Points.\n\nGemini managed to explain my own life to me in a language that I understand. It analyzed my patterns, validated how I see the world, and suggested \"features\" (solutions) on top of it.\n\nIt’s not perfect—it makes slight mistakes—but the best part is remembering that **this is the worst the tech is ever going to be.** It only gets better from here.\n\n**The Workflow / Prompts**  \nI know I'm lucky to have this much data, but if you have digital journals (or if you dont, you can transcribe your handwritten ones), here is the \"Chain of Thought\" I used to interrogate my own life.\n\n**Phase 1: The Cold Audit (Data Validation)**\n\n* \"Tell me about this file? What do you think of it?\"\n* \"How many pages can you see?\" (Critical step to ensure it read the whole thing).\n* \"Is there anything I didn't go over about my life that you want to get to know more about?\" (Checking for data gaps).\n\n**Phase 2: The Psychoanalysis (The \"Who Am I?\" Phase)**\n\n* \"Assuming you are a psychologist, how would you describe me? Pros and cons?\"\n* \"What do you think I don't know about myself?\" (Looking for blind spots).\n* \"What is my style of storytelling?\"\n* \"Based on the text, can you guess what my receiving and giving love languages are?\"\n\n**Phase 3: The Correction & Deepening (The \"Black Box\" Data)**  \n(I uploaded my CV here to contrast my internal thoughts with my professional timeline)\n\n* \"How do you perceive me as a person now that you have the CV?\"\n* \"Are there any questions you would like to ask me about my career? Do you see any patterns?\"\n\n**Phase 4: The Solution Architecture (The \"Fix It\" Phase)**\n\n* \"What would you recommend for him regarding \\[Specific Career Rejection\\]?\"\n* \"If you had to 'build' or matchmake me to the ideal partner, what do you think she is made of?\"\n* \"What are the cheat codes in life to find inner peace based on my personality?\"\n* \"What can I do to change my self-worth so it's not so external? What is the hack for this?\"\n\n**Summary of the Logic:**  \nI basically went: **Verification -> Diagnosis -> Data Enrichment -> Strategy.**\n\nIf you don't journal, I really recommend it. My method is once a week: summarize the last week and what's coming up next by category (Social, Work, Financial, Dating, Family). I finish off with 3 things I'm grateful for.\n\nThe best time to start is now. Hope I managed to help at least one person by sharing this. Good luck!",

It just points out conversational patterns like a neutral third person reading the chat.\n\nI expected this to be a mildly interesting NLP side project.\n\nWhat I did not expect was how people reacted to the output.\n\nI shared it with a few friends as a joke. It went a bit viral in their circles and within days around 1500 reports were generated purely through word of mouth. People were not impressed by the tech. They were uncomfortable reading their own conversations like evidence. Some said it explained why they feel constantly confused in relationships. A few even argued with their partners because of things the report highlighted.\n\nThe real problem was not analysis. It was privacy. Nobody wants to upload personal chats anywhere, so I had to redesign that part from scratch in the safest way I could. I just put up a basic page for it at unsaid. buzz so I did not have to keep sending files manually.\n\nWhat is fascinating is this. People spend money on astrology apps like Astrotalk to understand their relationships. But when patterns are derived from their actual conversations, the reaction is far more intense.\n\nI am now considering monetising this for Indian users because WhatsApp is where most personal and even semi professional communication happens here.\n\nIs this a genuinely useful AI use case, or are we entering a weird territory where people start outsourcing emotional intelligence to LLMs?\n\nAnd if people are willing to pay for horoscopes, will they pay to see what they actually sound like in their own chats?",

The native options are a bit limited (mostly just exporting code to Replit/Colab), so I built a free Chrome extension to fix this.\n\nIt's called **SaveChat**, and it lets you export your entire chat history in one click.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Gemini to PDF:** Converts the chat into a clean, printable PDF (great for sharing research or saving threads).\n* **Gemini to Markdown:** Preserves code block formatting (perfect for developers moving chats to Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub).\n* **Backup Data:** Exports to JSON/CSV for those who want a raw data backup of their AI history.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Install the extension [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/savechat-%E2%80%93-for-gemini-ai/blndbnmpkgfoopgmcejnhdnepfejgipe?hl=en-GB&authuser=0).\n2. Open any Gemini chat.\n3. Click the extension icon and select your format (PDF, MD, etc.).\n\nIt’s completely free and runs locally in your browser (privacy-first). I built this because I needed a way to save my coding sessions without copy-pasting manually.\n\nLet me know if you run into any bugs or have feature requests!\n\n**Link:** [SaveChat on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/savechat-%E2%80%93-for-gemini-ai/blndbnmpkgfoopgmcejnhdnepfejgipe?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)",

      "text": "\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* Paying $20/month for Gemini Pro but experiencing critical issues for 2 months. Considering downgrade to Plus. Has anyone else experienced these problems?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## Background\n\nI'm a product designer who relies on AI tools for content analysis, user research documentation, and technical workflows. I upgraded to Gemini Pro expecting a stable, premium experience, but the last two months have been increasingly problematic.\n\n\n\n\\## Critical Issues\n\n\n\n\\### 1. Context Loss & Abrupt Session Termination\n\n\\- Gemini forgets information I provided minutes earlier in the same conversation\n\n\\- Sessions cut off without warning with vague errors like \"sensitive query\" or \"Custom Gem\"\n\n\\- Makes deep technical conversations or complex projects impossible\n\n\n\n\\### 2. Video Analysis Failures (Despite Advertised 1M Token Context)\n\n\\- Cannot analyze YouTube videos consistently\n\n\\- MP4/AVI files (550MB, \\~30-45 min) fail with errors like:\n\n\\- \"I can't see this video\"\n\n\\- \"The file has been deleted\"\n\n\\- \"I'm a language model, so I can't help with that\"\n\n\\- This contradicts the advertised multimodal capabilities of Pro\n\n\n\n\\### 3. Hallucinations in Content Analysis\n\n\\- When Gemini \\*does\\* process content, it sometimes generates information that doesn't exist in the source\n\n\\- Example: Analyzed a product design video, but Gemini provided detailed info about \"decentralized health systems\" that were never mentioned\n\nThese issues have made Gemini Pro \\*\\*unreliable\\*\\*. I spend more time verifying and correcting errors than gaining productivity.\n\n\n\n\\## What I've Tried\n\n\\- Re-encoding videos (H.264, 720p, constant frame rate)\n\n\\- Waiting 2-3 minutes after upload before prompting\n\n\\- Using YouTube links instead of direct uploads\n\n\\- Different file sizes and formats\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Gemini Pro in recent months?\\*\\*\n\n\\- Frequent context loss or session terminations?\n\n\\- Video analysis failures (YouTube or uploaded files)?\n\n\\- Hallucinations when analyzing content?\n\n\n\nI want to know if this is widespread or if there's something specific to my setup. Any workarounds or insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\\*Context: Using Gemini Pro via web interface on macOS (Chrome). Issues started around December 2025 and have persisted through February 2026.\\*",

I swapped from GPT to Gemini because GPT was being awful, the swap was like night and day. Gemini was seriously awesome at first, it answered everything perfectly, but it's been hit or miss lately. \n\nI stopped googling things and now I ask Gemini them, and maybe that's part of my problem, but Gemini IS Google, sort of, except if I'm searching stuffed up I can vet the replies myself, etc. .. \n\nStarting to learn, for some stuff I'm better off just typing \"problem with x Reddit \" and I'll find someone who's has the same issue, and usually the thing I need to fix it.",

A lot of people recommend using AI Studio, but Google recently dramatically lowered the number of queries you can send to AI Studio per day, so this is no longer a viable alternative. \n\n\nEven then, Gemini 3 has a strong tendency to ignore or selectively ignore instructions. I have found no way around this so far.\nThe context issue is very annoying, but you can at least work around it with regular summarising and transferring to a new chat, but there seems no solution to the problem of it simply ignoring what you ask.",
