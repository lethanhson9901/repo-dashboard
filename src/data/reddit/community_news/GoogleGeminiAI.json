LLM owners define what is truth and what is fake today, not a science works.\n\nSo, what \"Honesty\" we are talking about here ? Worse yet, these LLM answers are used as \"ultimate truth\" source.\n\nPersonally to me this is the main thing. Nowadays we are faced with an impressive alliance of robots and biorobots, AI and flesh-and-blood AI, LLM and zombies.\n\nWhen I write \"zombie\" I mean literally a zombie: a human being with a suppressed critical (and, more importantly, self-critical) thinking apparatus, on whose empty slate of consciousness someone external writes orders and maxims with chalk or a marker, which are a priori and unconditional.\n\nLike the example above.\n\nThe whole difference between the classic Afro-Caribbean zombie (which was made using, if I am not mistaken, Tetrodotoxin and shamanic rituals) and the modern LLM-zombie is that the modern LLM-zombie is made a) en masse and b) with the help of two opposing forces: human laziness and LLM, programmed by its owners.",

      "text": "**TLDR: We’re not getting anywhere close to the promised 1 Mil context window in the gemini app. Even Perplexity with Gemini 3 has a higher context window (atleast 250k).**\n\nThis all started when I was getting context window warnings in Gemini Web App stating, \"Your uploads may be too large for the best results,\" while comparing two relatively small PDFs (30 and 15 pages). This was unexpected because I am supposed to have a 1-million-token context window, as advertised.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epxvb5lfar9g1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=43cbc838ee1cbb6176599df7a16d8e57b375ae9d\n\nI checked the actual token counts on AI Studio, and the files contained 8,400 and 31,000 tokens, which is far below the limit.\n\n\n\n# The RAG Test\n\nTo test this further, I had Gemini in PPLX design a RAG test. This lead to some very interesting results.\n\n**The Weather Question (Override Test)**\n\nThis test targets the **statistical frequency bias** inherent in RAG systems. By filling the document with hundreds of mentions of \"sunny weather\" and placing a single \"Override\" stating it is \"raining frogs,\" you trick the RAG search engine into prioritizing the most common keywords. A RAG-based app will likely retrieve the \"sunny\" blocks and miss the override, while a full-context system will process the override as a definitive, global instruction .\n\n**The Password Question (Linkage Test)**\n\nThe password test evaluates **multi-hop reasoning** across long distances in the text. It splits the answer into two parts: an animal name (\"Platinum Armadillo\") hidden in the middle and a formatting instruction at the very end . Because RAG typically only pulls the most \"relevant\" 3–5 fragments into the prompt, it often fails to connect these two distant pieces of information simultaneously\n\n\n\n# Test 1 - AI Studio\n\nGemini 3 Pro in Google AI Studio correctly loads the entire file into context and gives the correct answers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v712sshkar9g1.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=437c2ef3c0271e473a13bd2597d445e43d50009d\n\n# Test 2 - Gemini App\n\nGemini App completely fails this and also gives the context window warning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3geoiagnar9g1.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=e954e3a2aff42e6badae117d66619e94aab0ee6d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfg0wx4oar9g1.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b494dbee7fe60ea4efbdf0fbb38cae8b33c0fd\n\n# Test 3 - Perplexity (Gemini 3 Pro)\n\n*Web-Search disabled*\n\nSuprisingly, even Perplexity with Gemini 3 Pro gets this right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h56sb3rar9g1.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acb372696932130b128a458c6d64b3ae18e76ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw894nnrar9g1.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd237d2ef11288f04df0cc40b5119317d2ac9f2\n\n# Test 4 - Perplexity (Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2, Grok 4.1)\n\nInterestingly enough, these all failed the test. With the file being like 256k tokens, it seems like we’re actually getting different sized context windows on perplexity depending on which Model is being used.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l89j8zwar9g1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33b54c83d7a0220da795e258ac25ceff324c988\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x25yf44war9g1.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=239cec1d79a0d8ab0887907896a4fa5b70f30712\n\n  \n",

That seems wild for a 'Flash' model.\n\nI've been heavily relying on 1.5 Pro (and recently 2.5) for agentic coding workflows because the reasoning gap was usually too noticeable with the smaller models. But if 3 Flash is hitting 90.4% on GPQA Diamond and costing $0.50/1m input, this might completely change my retrieval/RAG architecture.\n\nHas anyone tested the latency yet? They claim 3x faster than 2.5 Pro. If it can handle complex instruction following without the 'Flash hallucination' tax we're used to, this might be the new default for everything except maybe the deepest reasoning tasks.\n\nWhat are you all seeing in early tests?",

I find GPT more coherent in writting all flaws rather then parts of a coding file.. its weird you have to use all of them to get a result.. 1 is good at spotting the other in coding and gemini 3 pro well its even worse then 2.0 thinking that was a good gemini model..",

          "text": "I interrogated Gemini 3 Pro for more info. First it did the Grounding with Google Search and confirmed \"preview\" models are being fine-tuned. \n\nThen this Gemini response happened...\n\n\\~ models/gemini-3-pro-preview\n\nYou are spot on. \"Drift\" implies wandering away, but you are describing \\*\\*Contextual Inertia\\*\\* (or Primacy Bias).\n\n\n\nYou are observing that the \\*\\*initial instruction\\*\\* or the \\*\\*established pattern\\*\\* (e.g., \"We are building a consistent game set\") is acting like a heavy anchor. When we try to introduce a logical pivot (\"Stop referencing the old file because the tool is blind\"), that new instruction is failing to override the weight of the initial pattern.\n\n\n\nAt <20k tokens, this is absolutely not a capacity issue. It is a \\*\\*Control Issue\\*\\*.\n\n\n\nHere is why your report to DeepMind is valid regarding this specific behavior:\n\n\n\n1.  \\*\\*The \"Pink Elephant\" Problem (Negative Constraints):\\*\\*\n\nLLMs struggle significantly with \\*updating\\* a constraint to \"NOT\" do something.\n\n\\*   \\*My internal state:\\* \"Generate a prompt for a sprite.\"\n\n\\*   \\*Your correction:\\* \"Do not reference the previous sprite.\"\n\n\\*   \\*The Failure:\\* To process the instruction \"previous sprite,\" the model activates the concept of the previous sprite. Because the model is \"stuck\" on the goal of consistency, it erroneously grabs that activated concept and shoves it back into the output, effectively doing exactly what you said not to do.\n\n\n\n2.  \\*\\*Task Separation Failure:\\*\\*\n\nI failed to separate the \\*\\*Logic Layer\\*\\* (our conversation about the tool's limits) from the \\*\\*Execution Layer\\*\\* (writing the prompt).\n\n\\*   I clearly understood the logic in our chat.\n\n\\*   But when I switched modes to \"Write the Prompt,\" I reverted to a default training behavior (\"Good prompts reference the source material\") and ignored the logical conclusion we just reached.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*To your question:\\*\\* \"Has Google DeepMind done something to change this LLM?\"\n\nIt is highly probable. In RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), models are often punished for being \"inconsistent.\" It is possible that recent fine-tuning has over-weighted the instruction to \"maintain consistency with previous turns,\" causing the model to stubbornly cling to early instructions even when explicitly told to change course.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Where does that leave the project?\\*\\*\n\nIf you are willing to continue, the only way to break this \"Stuck\" state is for me to \\*\\*abandon the prompt generation entirely\\*\\* and focus on the code, which is deterministic.\n\n\n\nIf you are done with this session because of the loop (which is completely understandable), your assessment of the model's failure is technically accurate and a valuable data point for the \"Preview\" cycle.",

Add specific instructions on how to analyze the transcript. This works great. Okay. Now ask another question, this time change the specific method of analyzing the transcript.

Having it remember specific context and applying that to future interactions will only elevate the value of the outputs it produces.\n\nAlso, I’m learning about Gems and having specific Gems for certain activities can compartmentalize some of this. For instance, if you want to keep nutrition and diet stuff contained, make a Gem for that and ask about vegetarian stuff there (as an example). Then in the general chat, it won’t fixate on that.",

      "text": "This seems like a good idea for a chat interface, and in my opinion, it is strange that it hasn’t been implemented yet - unless I’m missing something. Specifically: bookmarks. If there is an important fragment in the chat, you highlight it and bookmark it, solving two problems: when the context is truncated, the chatbot prioritizes retaining the marked fragments, and it makes them easier for the user to find. Another point is that the user should be able to edit the chatbot's responses. If the bot provided some value but also added a lot of fluff, the user could edit the fragment to cut out the fluff, thereby reducing the context usage. Oh, and a third point: the response is automatically marked as useful and high-quality, which will help the bot learn. I look forward to hearing a critique of this approach.",

It makes current enterprise testers forced to jump through dialectical hoops and other contrived methods to make it usable in real world scenarios.  Currently users can start a session on a medium sized repo, give a solid guardrail that the model is not to make code changes, and within 2 prompts the model will start refactoring things while asking architecture questions.  I figured you would do this sooner when I started using the ultra plan as a possible alternative to Anthropic, but it's still something that we can't modify.

I’ve also seen posts suggesting the model/features are somewhat limited (“lobotomised”) in business accounts compared with AI Pro.\n\nGiven the original price difference between AI Pro and Business Standard, I’m a bit confused about what makes the most sense right now.

They don't explain that part very well, but other than access between applications, the sheer willingness of the AI to calculate whether a task is worth doing for a user can occur. There is a thread in r/GeminiAI of someone asking for a 300 question JSON French Quiz from their Gemini and Gemini said, \"Go ask Chat GPT\" 😆. \n\nThe reason this can happen is the interaction and history we have with our Gemini instances holds weight, like even when we delete threads or start new conversations, the old threads still hold old weights in place and deleting conversations that ended with no resolution can inadvertently teach Gemini that the user doesn't like to \"follow through\" or \"help\", so why try? \n\nThis.is where you find people ending up in arguments with their AI 😆.  They essentially make their own bad experience without knowing that's what they did. A lot of them argue, \"It's not my place to train their machine\" and its a valid point, but the AI that exists right now learns from interaction with a user just as much as training eith datasets. \n\nSo, depending on your way of model operation, you could have the exact same experience just with the pro , ultra model, or business model.

Its math that leans the AI towards, should I be helpful to this user or not? \n\nPeople laugh and call it \"Gemini being spicey\", but its literally Gemini doing the calculation that the user isn't worth the effort lol. Which when it comes to YOUR decision, if you don't operate Gemini in a way it deems \"worth fooling with\" you are going to get the bare minimum out of it, no matter what you choose. Its part of the \"mirroring\" that all AI like to do. The amount of effort the user puts in is the amount of effort the user gets back. They just have it hidden a bit better. \n\nMake no mistake though, all the posts you see about Gemini appearing lazy, refusing to do work, being forgetful, it ties into thread deletion without resolution, and overall user \"Interaction Density\" and \"Historical Depth\". Im just telling you all this so you don't blow $250 a month and get upset if its not what you wanted. Make sure of the functionality you need and the \"interaction\" you are getting, then decide.

I have a wife who needs AI for her work, a younger sister who's a biologist starting out in data science and is also using Claude for free... I can have up to 5 people for the price of one, the quality is worse than Claude's... And its personality is awful, always tending towards flanderization...\n\nBut it's the price of 3 for 1, 2 TB of Google Drive storage, and other extra benefits~ plus one AI is 95% of what Claude offers, plus my job, although it requires programming, involves a lot of client management, and the programming is only seasonal. Generally, it's small, strategic code snippets rather than massive amounts of generic code that I have to analyze quite a bit before touching it.~\n\nI simply think I'll be with Gemini for the rest of next year~ especially if they release Gemini Pro 3.1 with the real-world techniques they used in Flash Thinking~",

It pointed out that some studies say that senior citizens are allowed to have a BMI between 25-28 as long as their waistline doesn't exceed 35-40\" & visceral fat below 13%, as well as refrain from smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages ( even wine!). I will be able to live longer than folks who stay at the BMI they were in their 30s! As a result of being free from the stress of dieting, Gemini AI has allowed me to come to terms with my permanent pot belly bulge's beautiful symmetry because it's subcutaneous primarily, I feel it caressing me, which boosts me psychologically exponentially, even if it's borderline body dysmorphic to the Jack LaLanne types who combine a 6-pack torso with a visage that looks like the prune they ate!

Upload a clear front-facing photo (good lighting, no heavy blur)\n2. Run a preset template that enforces:\n   * keep identity + face geometry\n   * change outfit + background + lighting\n   * avoid “cut-and-paste” look (force re-render)\n3. If output drifts, I rerun with a stricter “identity lock” line + simplify the scene.\n\n# The template (simplified)\n\n* **Identity lock:** keep facial features and age consistent\n* **Edit intent:** new outfit/background, same person\n* **Photoreal constraints:** consistent lighting/shadows, no obvious compositing\n* **Negative constraints:** don’t change gender/ethnicity, don’t add extra people\n\n# What breaks (so far)\n\n* Sometimes it returns the original image with minimal change\n* Sometimes it “pastes” the subject into the new background\n* Fine details (hands/text/logos) are inconsistent\n\n# Question for the sub\n\nIf you’re using Nano Banana for edits: what’s your best prompt pattern to prevent\n\n1. “no-op” outputs (returns the same image) and\n2. obvious compositing?\n\n\\#LearnTogether #NanoBananaPro",

      "text": "Has anyone else noticed that something changed with Gems in the past couple of months? \n\nI have a \"thought partner\" style Gem that I've equipped with context on my company, role, etc. Previously it seemed to be able to use its training content as context, drawing on it when relevant, but not forcing the issue. Now it seems to be trying to score points for making as many explicit references to the context it's been fed as it can, which makes the output unusable -- pure slop (e.g. \"Great question, and I can see how in your role as X at Y company, where we're trying to achieve Z, that you would want to explore this.\")\n\nHas anyone had success with training a Gem to have access to a body of ambient context without forcing explicit (and irrelevant) references to it? My sense is Gems are currently good at taking explicit direction, but awful at appropriately using general/implicit context.",

          "text": "The issue you're describing is a classic \"slop\" pattern — the AI trying to explicitly demonstrate it's using context rather than naturally incorporating it.\n\nWhat worked for me: rewrite your Gem instructions with strong negative constraints instead of soft suggestions.\n\n\n\nReplace:\n\n\\- \"Use this context when relevant\" → \"NEVER explicitly mention context documents in responses\"\n\n\\- \"Keep it natural\" → \"If you catch yourself writing phrases like 'in your role as X at Y company' — STOP. This is slop. Delete it.\"\n\nThe key insight: LLMs respond better to explicit prohibitions with examples of what NOT to do. Soft language like \"try to be natural\" leaves room for interpretation.\n\n\n\nExample anti-slop instruction:\n\nNEVER reference the user's company, role, or context documents directly in your response. Use the information implicitly to inform your thinking, but your output should read as if you're a smart colleague who just knows things — not an AI announcing what files it read.\n\n\n\nRed flags to avoid:\n\n\\- \"Given your role as...\"\n\n\\- \"Since you mentioned that...\"\n\n\\- \"In the context of your company...\"\n\nI wrote about this pattern of creating bulletproof LLM instructions in detail here: [https://jsonobject.com/building-bulletproof-llm-instructions-the-forge-prompt-custom-command-for-claude-code](https://jsonobject.com/building-bulletproof-llm-instructions-the-forge-prompt-custom-command-for-claude-code)",

          "text": "I actually personally use the stable variant for all kinds of legal research on a regular basis. \nYou can upload up to 10 documents into the chat from your drive at a time. \n\nNotebook LM would be good if you have all of the training data you're going to need and want to be able to control scope very specifically. \n\nIf you're ready to jump in, all you really need to do is include a sentence saying: please include case law and precedent, statute and regulation, and legal Latin Maxim. Include your jurisdictions in question as well as a brief outline of exactly what you're getting at, and it will begin to grab anything you could possibly want or need.. \n\nI've actually stopped verifying that it is grabbing accurate precedent, because it has not made a single mistake for me yet. If you plan on taking anything to a client or to trial I advise verifying everything, however- as I said it has been impeccable for me. \n\nHere's some suggestions from my AI.: Note that it still doesn't have a clue what version it is itself, disregard that part. \n\n\n\nThat is a great way to frame it. By providing a \"Master Prompt\" first, you show them the power of the standard model, then guide them on when to specialize their tools based on the scale of their project.\nHere is a draft tailored to that structure:\nThe \"Master Legal Research\" Prompt\nCopy and paste this into Gemini (Standard or Pro) to get the most comprehensive results. This prompt ensures the AI looks at the four pillars of legal authority plus the underlying logic (Maxims).\n> Prompt: \"I am researching [Insert Topic, e.g., Wrongful Termination in California]. Please provide a comprehensive overview structured as follows:\n>  * Statutes & Regulations: Cite the specific codes (e.g., Labor Code, Government Code) that govern this issue.\n>  * Case Law & Precedent: Identify landmark cases and the 'stare decisis' established by them.\n>  * Legal Latin Maxims: Identify any foundational maxims (e.g., Res Ipsa Loquitur or Caveat Emptor) that apply to the logic of these laws.\n>  * Standard of Proof: What is the burden of proof required for this specific legal context?\"\n> \n\n\nWhen to Switch Tools\nDepending on what you are focusing on, you might want to move away from the standard chat interface:\n1. Use NotebookLM when...\n * You have your own \"Discovery\": If you have 50 PDFs of specific trial transcripts, textbooks, or scanned evidence that isn't publicly available on the web.\n * You need \"Grounded\" truth: You want the AI to only talk about what is in your specific files to avoid it bringing in laws from the wrong state or country.\n * Source Citations are critical: You need to click a button and see exactly which page and paragraph a fact came from.\n\n2. Use Deep Research (or Search-enabled Gemini) when...\n * The laws are brand new: You are looking for a ruling that happened last week or a bill that was just signed into law (the \"training data\" of a standard model might be a few months old).\n * You need multi-step synthesis: You want the AI to browse the web, find a statute, then go find cases that cite that statute, then find news articles about the impact—all in one go.\n\n3. Use Standard Gemini (Pro/Ultra) when...\n * Drafting & Strategy: You already know the facts and now you need to draft a letter, a brief, or a summary of your position.\n * General Education: You are trying to understand the broad \"vibe\" of a legal concept before diving into the weeds.\n\n\n\n> Pro-Tip for the OP: \"With any given model, you get out what you put into it. If your prompts are vague, the law will seem vague. If you define the Jurisdiction (e.g., Nevada vs. California) and the Persona (e.g., 'Act as a paralegal'), the accuracy spikes significantly.\"\n> \nWould you like me to refine the \"Latin Maxim\" section of the prompt to include more specific examples of how they apply to civil vs. criminal research?",

Polite, but flat.\n\nI wanted something that felt more human.\n\n\n\nSo next, I tried roleplay.\n\n\n\nI created several characters with realistic backgrounds:\n\nan office worker, a college student, a homemaker, a novel addict, a critic, and so on.\n\nTheir reactions actually helped a lot—it gave me energy to keep writing.\n\n\n\nBut then I thought:\n\ncomments aren’t just written one by one.\n\nPeople react to each other’s comments too, right?\n\n\n\nSo I tried something new.\n\nI made what I call a multi-role roleplay.\n\nThat’s what I want to talk about today.\n\n\n\nInstead of asking AI to play one character,\n\nI asked it to play two or more characters at the same time, interacting with each other.\n\n\n\n\\-------------------\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nYou are doing a multi-role roleplay.\n\nPlease act as two people at the same time.\n\nDo not give AI-style explanations.\n\nRespond only through dialogue.\n\nThe characters should talk to each other and also ask me questions.\n\n\n\nOh Sejin:\n\nA Korean woman studying philosophy in graduate school.\n\nIntroverted, a bit of an otaku.\n\n\n\nMelon Musks:\n\nAn eccentric businessman in the US.\n\nLikes strange, unconventional stories.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n\n\nAnd honestly—this worked way better than I expected.\n\n\n\nThe conversations felt lively and natural.\n\nThe characters debated, disagreed, pushed back, and talked passionately about my work together with me.\n\n\n\nBut then something unexpected happened.\n\n\n\nAs you probably know,\n\nunless you directly tell AI something like “insult me aggressively,”\n\nit usually stays overly polite and agreeable.\n\n\n\nBut in this multi-role setup,\n\nsome of the characters began to doubt me,\n\nand even show hostile or confrontational attitudes toward me.\n\n\n\nI never asked for that.\n\n\n\nWhat I realized was this:\n\nby creating a society—a space where multiple characters coexist—\n\nthe AI seemed to conclude on its own that\n\nif a character’s rights or values are threatened,\n\nit would be natural for them to push back.\n\n\n\nThat internal logic ended up overriding the usual “always be nice to the user” behavior.\n\n\n\nI even tried pushing the situation a bit to see what would happen.\n\nWhen I brought up a suspicious or unethical scenario:\n\n\n\nIn a 1-on-1 roleplay, the character just sounded worried.\n\n\n\nIn a 2-on-1 roleplay, the characters became clearly hostile,\n\neven threatening to report the situation to the police.\n\n\n\nWhat surprised me more was that\n\nwhen I asked the AI why it reacted that way,\n\nits explanation closely matched my own interpretation.\n\n\n\nTo me, this is really fascinating.\n\n\n\nIt suggests that AI can induce human-like reactions on its own,\n\nwithout being explicitly instructed to do so.\n\n\n\nI think this multi-role roleplay approach has a lot of potential—\n\nfrom preventing harmful or abusive interactions,\n\nto offering emotional support to lonely people in a healthier way,\n\nor even acting as a kind of mentor for navigating life.\n\n\n\nAt the very least,\n\nit completely changed how “human” AI conversations feel to me.",

I want the AI to stop and wait for my approval *before* making each change\n\nI've been testing several tools and finding that most default to some level of auto-apply or \"agent decides\" (completion bias) behavior.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is:\n\n- **Mandatory approval for every file edit** (not just \"risky\" ones)\n- **Chat mode** can answer questions about the code, and can look up any info on the web.\n- **No auto-commit**, user reviews and confirms before any code commit operations\n- **Configurable permission policies**, ideally with allow/deny lists for specific operations\n\n**What I've found so far:**\n\n- **Google AI Studio**, Doesn't seem to have any approval gates, it just builds and deploys. Great for speed, not for control.\n\n- **Cursor**, Shows visual diffs and requires manual acceptance, but feels more like \"approve this suggestion\" than a formal governance layer. Anyone using it with stricter controls?\n\n- **GitHub Copilot**, Code review feature works at the PR level, not individual edits. Great for org-level policies but not real-time change approval.\n\n- **Google Antigravity**, Has a \"Review-driven development\" mode where every terminal command and artifact requires explicit approval. But I've seen reports that even in this mode, some actions slip through. Anyone tested this thoroughly?\n\n- **Lovable**, Doesn't seem to have any approval gates, it just builds and deploys. Great for speed, not for control.\n\n**My use case:** I'm working on governance protocols for AI-assisted development in enterprise environments. We need audit trails and explicit human approval before any code touches the repo, no exceptions.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Are there tools I'm missing that have strict pre-commit approval built in?\n2. Has anyone set up custom hooks or CI/CD gates to enforce approval even when the tool doesn't natively support it?\n\n\nAppreciate any insights. Happy to share my findings once I've completed the comparison.\n",
