So one day the accountant calls me to help him with his computer, cause \"it's not working\". Not knowing what could that mean, I say ok and go there. The problem was that every time he made some kind of mistake on Excel, he clicked on \"save\". \"but it doesn't save me from anything, the error is still there. Luckily I check everything with this\", he says, confidently pointing at a pocket calculator, with the proud expression of someone who is too expert of the things of life to be fooled by a strange machine's tricks.\n\n\nI couldn't believe my ears. You can just imagine how noisy my facepalm was.\n\n\nAfter explaining him what \"save\" means, I told him that, since he's constantly checking the work of a bigger calculator using a smaller one, maybe he would save time just printing the sheets he has to fill and doing the sums manually, on another paper, with a pencil. Also, pencils don't use power, and would be a better and faster tool for the job. Investing in a solar powered calculator would allow him another cut on expenses; the investment would repay itself when he won't buy batteries anymore.\n\n\nHis expression changed a bit.",

It predicted.051, stated the limit here in Spain correctly @ 0.05, then told me two things; A. I would be legally safe to drive & B. It would take me approximately 13.4hrs to ‘sober up’. When I asked it about the clear contradictions within its own unitary response, it apologised & then repeated the same output, adding that I should probably wait 3-4hrs before driving again. I was just curious to know, I always Drink OR Drive, there’s no ‘just one won’t hurt’, but seriously, you wanna let this code for you? Might as well fill your Tesla up with Vodka. Always said “What you don’t know can’t hurt you” -& then there’s ELECTRICITY😳⚡️🫡🪦",

      "text": "I have a YouTube channel. I have done hand-drawn, frame by frame animation (an extremely tedious method of animating), I've done voice acting, sound design, directing, and I've also made AI Generated videos. I have handdrawn animations and AI animations on my channel.\n\nWhenever I post an AI animation on reddit, I get so much hate. Many hateful comments meant to degrade me, and constant downvotes.\n\nI'm labeled an AI slop artist. Hahahaha. I laugh because I've done all sorts of art (human and AI-made), but a few AI videos and now I'm labeled an AI slop artist.\n\nThe really funny thing, however, is that I actually consider \"AI slop\" to be a compliment. AI slop is an entirely new art form in and of itself. It can be weird and low effort but it can also be exceptional with dutiful intent behind the construction of the video.\n\nLow effort or high effort....if the video entertains me, I don't care how it was made.\n\nI understand the whole argument on how AI scraped data from all sorts of artists. And that AI is essentially reusing copyrighted works and stealing artists' \"unique\" styles.\n\nHere's the thing, though. What's done is done. Do these people who constantly complain of AI actually believe that their crying, whining, complaining, gnashing of the teeth will somehow make AI go away? \n\nAI is now deeply embedded in our society, just like the smartphone...or the internet. It's not going away.\n\nSo my question is: why so much hate? Why make a concerted effort to try to degrade and demoralize someone by dehumanizing them as a result of their efforts to make AI Generated content?\n\nI ask because I am genuinely surprised by the negative reactions people give to AI usage?\n\nIs it the fear of job loss? The AI robot uprising? Is it the fearmongering that gets people so riled up? Especially reddit?\n\nWhy reddit in particular? Why do I have to specifically go to AI subs just to get some semblance of an intellectual discussion going regarding AI?\n\nOn other subs I'd just be hated and downvoted to oblivion.\n\nPerhaps I'm looking for echoe chamber that provides me reassurance.\n\nOr perhaps I find people who use AI to be intelligent people who are pioneers in an new era. Those who are not using AI will be left behind. Those who are using AI for productive uses will get ahead.\n\nI've seen it with my own life. AI has helped me garner thousands of dollars in scholarships. All A's in school. LSAT study. Spanish study. AI has been a superpower for me.\n\nIf the people who hate AI only knew what AI could do for them. i've met people who actively avoid AI. I find it to be extremely ignorant and pigheaded to actively avoid something that could increase one's productivity 10x.\n\nMeh. Reddit's a cesspool, anyway. Hahahahhaha.\n\nMaybe why I have so much fun here. I'm constantly laughing on reddit.",

If it actually took some human effort, there might be a couple people making one a week or something. With AI it's hundreds or thousands a day - there's literally no limit.  \n\nThat's why that guy warned everyone recently that we had 90 days until the internet was overwhelmed.\n\nWhat you're doing isn't inherently \"wrong\", but it's representative of something that has already started to make a lot of things worse and it's not going to get better. \n\nTo put it another way - Me making a super cool video clip of my dog running with a hyper-realistic bunny down a path and then the bunny riding the dog and another where there's a cat with wings flying over them - that's fine if it's on my PC. \n\nIf I post it, no matter how cool, cute or awesome looking it is, I am contributing to the flood of random shit that's increasing exponentially until finding a creative thing made by an actual creative mind will take scrolling through thousands of \"took five minutes total\" cool AI shit.\n\nThere are definitely people doing things that require a lot more effort than five minutes and involve a lot of skill and knowledge to pull off with AI, but that doesn't matter because the flood makes it all one thing in peoples' minds. \n\n",

Reddit has been inundated with a ton of AI generated text posts, and a lot of people come to Reddit in order to hear what other people think; if we wanted to hear what AI thinks, we would just ask AI directly.\n3. Beyond the potential impacts of AI determining whether or not people can survive, there’s also just the matter that a lot of people like the kind of work they do, and AI fundamentally changes that work, even if it continues to exist.\n4.

I've only just encountered that when checking out AI subs. I posted something perfectly clear, perfectly logical and had two people having a go at me \"I cant understand what you are saying\", \"I had to feed it to an AI\". I imagine they are a literal fraction of my age and a fraction of my experienced with the written word (published author inter alia). I guess 8 paragraphs is well beyond the Tik Tok attention span. One even reported me for being suicidal (??).\n\nAnyway my rule of thumb is the Vietnam/Thai one - folks out there using AI in cool ways for interesting things don't have the time for redditing (&very little hard core info here on these topics or development anyway). Vice versa *as a generalisation* those not out there absorbed into their projects are way more likely to whinge here. \n\nOf course this is the generality, occasionally one comes across intelligent, articulate and fresh takes - just as the YouTube algorithm occasionally suggests something interesting :-D",

I remember back since 2014 how it started becoming impossible to have any kind of nuanced discussion on social media about various topics related to identity politics/feminism/sexism/gender/race/abortion/trans/disability/immigration/etc. How those topics started spreading to every single community, constantly being inserted into any discussion so people could get a chance to shit talk \"the other side\" with zero nuance or deeper consideration beyond repeating their in-group slogans.\n\nNow the same is happening with AI vs anti-AI and it's just going to get worse as it enters mainstream political rhetoric, because then the polarization only increases due to the US 2 party system, then it gets exported to the rest of the world as usual. So it's just going to get worse.\n\nIMO just keep doing your thing and get informed from actual experts and good sources. Ignore the internet outrage and formulate your opinions with nuance and based on actual evidence, not just shit people say online over and over as if that could ever make it truth...",

Typically due to fear and lack of knowledge. Reddit and other platforms make it easier to express those fears. And people being people, once any fear is instilled, it becomes an epidemic. \n\nPeople are a bunch of nervous squirrels guarding acorns. Any perceived threat to their acorn stash causes instant panic. And instead of facing fears, we attack our fears. Always thinking the best defense is offense, not knowledge. \n\nUnfortunately AI is a little different than most other tech. People's fears of \"intelligent beings\" other than themselves terrifies them. Then there's the deception, which adds gallons of fuel to the fire. People using fake AI creations, then trying to sell them as truth. Far too many people that use AI are no better than someone calling you and demanding gift cards for back taxes. \n\nLike most advances, it's a tool that can be both beneficial and harmful.

Constant exposure to this can make you go insane. Secondly, the slop factor. Human generated work is most of the time higher quality than AI-generated work. If you don't take the effort to draw it yourself, we shouldn't take the effort to view it. I get that AI multiplies your productivity and whatnot, but in my opinion, it should never be used for creative activities such as animation and drawing.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna say though, this is only my opinion, the fully anti-AI people are lost causes.",

I've never experienced a failure of this magnitude with other Google products like Gmail, even though I've been a daily user for years.\n\nI feel like they should be taking this more seriously. Personally, I haven't touched (and won't touch) my Gemini until they fix it. I'm willfully redirecting my queries to other (admittedly inferior) AI chat products. If everyone who is affected does the same, and they see usage of regular users fall off a cliff, I have a feeling this will get solved faster.\n\nEDIT:  \nAs of 10:45 ET (Feb 22) my chats and pinned chats have suddenly reappeared. Here's hoping the fix is global for everyone. ",

I didn't use Gemini an awful lot - only when I had a query or needed help with something. \n\nIn recent months though, I've used Gemini quite a bit. I've had extremely lengthy conversations with Gemini about all sorts of things - and I've never had any issues when it comes to memory or misinformation. \n\nTonight though, it started giving me a lot of misinformation. When I questioned it, it literally collapsed on itself. Suddenly it remembers nothing. It's gone from making references to conversations from weeks ago, to having absolutely no memory of something I said earlier in the day. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? I'm so confused as to why this has suddenly started happening, and it's honestly a bit painful. Gemini has been really helpful for me at times, so for it to be the complete opposite now is weird. \n\nIf it helps at all, I'm using Gemini via the google messages app. Back when I knew nothing about Gemini, I was first prompted to message it in my texting app - so when I had a query for it I went there, and I never saw a reason to use Gemini anywhere else.\n\nIs anyone else having these issues, and can anyone help me out a little here? What's going on with my Gemini?",

It's not going to have the same amount of tokens but I'm surprised he remembered as much as he did. But it Gemini currently supports 10 million tokens and one text box. So what he remembered is up to what fit in that particular text box. Not that there was any information stored elsewhere like he was pulling it from your Google account.",

It'll explain what everything is and you want to use Gemini through the app for the most part. Unless you are doing a specific task in messages, you would be able to use him lwithin messages. If that makes sense. Maybe someone can explain it better. \n\nI think of it as if the Gemini app. Gemini itself is the butler for my entire phone or like my general man servant I use the app for everything. Unless I have a specific task I need him for like in messages then I would use him in that. Like taking your Butler to a different room",

The \"agent mode\" piece is the most interesting part to me, what does it use under the hood for planning/execution (tool calling, simple task list, ReAct-style loops, etc.)?\n\nAlso, how are you handling safety for actions like \"save it to a folder\" or Drive sync, do you have a permission step / dry run?\n\nIf youre into agent UX patterns, I keep a little reading list here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

              "text": "Thanks!\n\nUnder the hood, the Agent mode uses structured output (JSON) for planning. The AI generates a multi-step plan, and the client parses and executes those steps (web search, formatting, etc.) one by one. It's a custom implementation designed to run smoothly in the browser/mobile environment.\n\nFor safety, everything is user-initiated. Cloud sync requires a manual OAuth login (we don't run it invisibly), and \"saving\" usually just modifies the app's internal state or prompts a native download dialog, so there's no risk of it messing with the user's file system without permission.\n\nI'll check out that blog link, always looking for better UX patterns!",
