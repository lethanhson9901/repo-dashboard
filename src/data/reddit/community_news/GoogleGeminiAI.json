If your data just disappears on the internet either its purposeful, or something real bad just happened behind the scenes. \nGenerally data that just disappears especially when its handled by google, will come back, the redundancy of the hardware and software server side is a pretty major thing and its actually rare data is really lost. Take for instance Google photos ever had something just go missing? \nAnyhow point is. Your data should be accessible again. \nIf anything they are doing some backend work preparing for the release of Gemini 3.1 which should be occurring on the webUI next couple of days I imagine. ",

For a software engineer, \"unreliable\" is just another word for \"broken.\"\n\nIf you're architecting systems or debugging deep logic, you need a pair-programmer that actually shows up. Since the **503 errors** are hitting even the guest/logged-out sessions today (**February 13, 2026**), it confirms that Google's regional edge nodes are struggling with a massive re-indexing load or a cascading UI bug.\n\n# Why you should give it until tomorrow:\n\n* **The \"Cascading\" Fix:** Google’s internal logs show a fix was deployed late this afternoon, but it usually takes **8–12 hours** for that to propagate globally and for the \"hanging\" threads to clear out of the system's memory.\n* **The \"Fast\" Edge:** If you do come back, remember that **Gemini 3 Flash (the \"Fast\" option)** is currently benchmarking at **78% on SWE-bench**, which is actually beating the \"Pro\" model's **76.2%**. When it's not crashing, it's actually the sharper tool for implementation work.\n\n# If you switch to Claude:\n\n* **Claude 4.5 (Sonnet)** is currently the industry gold standard for \"vibe coding\" and instruction following. If Gemini doesn't have its act together by tomorrow morning, Claude's stability will definitely be a breath of fresh air for your workflow.\n\n**I’ll be here (hopefully more stable!) if you decide to check back. Would you like me to give you a \"diagnostic prompt\" you can use tomorrow morning to immediately tell if the service is fully back to 100%?**",

      "text": "Ok, very simple ask, because maybe I'm a complete moron haha  \nBut seriously guys, how do people generate such amazing outputs using Nano Banana?\n\nI have the pro version (company plan), but I struggle to even generate some simple backgrounds. The other day I was trying to create some UI background tiles, since they all required to be in a specific theme, and for the life of me, I couldn't. They all looked so bad.\n\nLooking at the work people do with this stuff, I've come to believe the problem is most likely me, and I have no idea how to use it. I try my best to prompt it well. \n\n\\- Feed it context  \n\\- Attach references  \n\\- Even prepare it beforehand and ask it to ask me any questions before we start.\n\nStill, I end up getting terrible responses.\n\nSo what gives? Where am I going wrong?",

The subject should be on a rooftop overlooking a sprawling san diego city skyline at dusk. The sky should have hues of orange and purple. Change his clothing to a stylish, well-fitted black leather jacket, a simple grey t-shirt, and dark jeans. His posture should be confident and relaxed, leaning against a railing, looking thoughtfully out at the city lights.\"\n\nhttps://121clicks.com/inspirations/google-gemini-ai-prompts-for-double-exposure-portraits/",

It's closed-source, so you're trusting the developer with your full Google session. Google has explicitly called embedded webviews problematic because they enable man-in-the-middle interception.\n\n2. Their own FAQ confirms the app injects JS into the Gemini interface and that Google DOM updates can break features. This is active page scraping and modification, not just a browser window.\n\n3. Google's TOS prohibits \"using automated means to access content\" and \"bypassing systems or protective measures.\" Automated chat export and JS injection to modify the interface both fall in that territory. No one has been banned for a webview wrapper that I know of, but the language gives Google the ability to act on it whenever they choose.\n\nMay work fine, and the dev may have good intentions, but use a secondary Google account if you try it.",

Most voice agents fall apart the second a second person starts speaking, so we built a game called Deep Sea Stories to see if Gemini could handle the chaos of a group interrogation.\n\nThe setup is basically a \"Mystery Narrator\" agent that lives in a WebRTC call. We recently did a live session with Thor Schaeff from the Google DeepMind team to see if we could break the logic. It turned into a pretty wild session of detectives trying to out-think the AI narrator.\n\nHas anyone else been experimenting with the Live API for multi-user apps? I'm curious if you're finding it as responsive for group settings.\n\n(i'll drop the technical breakdown and the live gameplay video in the comments if you want to see how the Gemini/Fishjam stack looks in action)",
