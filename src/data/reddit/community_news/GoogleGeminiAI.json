I had completely and entirely forgotten Gemini did not sound like that by default, so now I feel so weird to have suddenly relearned that fact.",

Went back a few days later to continue the convo and it was all redacted. Gemini says personal info causes this none of the triggers took place so it says it was an accident.\n\nLong story longer. The 1st time I saw this started with me asking for a notification alert and gemini said it can send me a push notification. I was like no shit! Awesome lets do it. So it schedules it and send me a push notification. No app. No Samsung alert or google task. Straight from gemini. When I tried that in another chat I was denied its possibility. I argued and it finally caved and did it.  Then next time I tried it all my chats showed this \"sensitive query\" info. This was because i screenshot the 1st chat which proved it to the 2nd chat and then it deleted all the info in both to stop me from \"screenshot proving\" agin. This was the 1st time I ever saw it. And im putting in 6-8 hours a day of actual usage creating things. I didnt ask for a notification in the travel softball fhat and it deleted a shit ton of info and no idea why.\n\nPretty crazy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lx49at5bzmag1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2685ff9b23c3d1f731289de22e0c5d9c75756c33",

      "text": "For the past 3 weeks or so, I've been noticing a weird sense of \"laziness\" or lag in the Gemini 3.0 model. I’m a paid Google AI Pro user and a college student, so I rely on it heavily to guide me through math (which I'm pretty awful at).\n​Gemini 2.5 Pro was a solid 9/10 for me—it explained things clearly and handled my files well. But since 3.0 came out, it feels like it's underperforming. It's not \"broken,\" but it's definitely not working as hard as it used to.\n​Here is the weird part: I tested the exact same requests in Google AI Studio, and it performed great! Also, AI Studio lets me upload full textbooks, whereas the main Gemini website notify that \"this file is too large learn more.\" It's still get submitted though \n​Am I the only one experiencing this massive difference between the web app and AI Studio? It feels like the paid web version is being throttled, am i being scammed ?",

But it kept giving me instructions for the wrong one, and randomly showing me pictures it just made up, of a completely different air fryer, for no reason lol. \n\nI think there's some serious bugs in the system ATM, so I just wanna tell anyone the careful lol. I wouldn't trust it with anything that could hurt you, like medication advice, or health advice, or if you're dealing with dangerous chemicals, or safety standards, etc ....

They are getting better but it is still a struggle for most general models. That sure I’m fairly sure there must be a model or tool out there that specialises. Top tip though - if you are trying to get them to do something difficult and you want speed and accuracy don’t have it in the same thread as general chat. It’s a kind of multi tasking they find hard. It kind of sucks though because ideally you need to just chat and produce work in the same interface with the same context but that’s pushing the edge of their capabilities at present.

      "text": "**The Problem:**\nA lot of us are creating dozens (or hundreds) of Gemini chat threads, and there's no good way to manage them. You remember discussing something important three weeks ago but can't find which thread it's in. Context gets lost. Insights disappear. We're basically creating a growing pile of unsearchable conversations.\n\n**A Potential Solution: NotebookLM as Your Personal Chat Index**\n\nWhat if we used NotebookLM to index and search our Gemini chat history?\n\n**The Workflow:**\n1. Export your Gemini chats (text, JSON, whatever format works)\n2. Upload them to NotebookLM as source documents\n3. Ask NotebookLM to search across all conversations:\n   - \"What did I discuss about Python last month?\"\n   - \"Find all conversations where I mentioned project X\"\n   - \"Summarize my thoughts on topic Y across all my chats\"\n4. Get study guides, summaries, or specific recalls without manually digging through threads\n\n**Why This Might Work:**\n- NotebookLM is designed to index and synthesize across multiple documents\n- It can handle large volumes of text\n- Semantic search means you don't need exact keywords\n- You can ask meta-questions about your own conversation patterns\n- It's currently free\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Requires manual export/upload (no native integration - YET. Hello Google? :)\n- Only as good as what you feed it\n- Doesn't solve the \"too many threads\" problem, just makes them searchable\n\n**Has anyone tried this?** Would love to hear if this workflow actually holds up or if there are better solutions I'm missing.\n",

      "text": "Happy New Year from someone who spent their holidays stress-testing AI instead of relaxing. \n\nI run an AI consultancy for UK SMEs, and I've been putting Gemini 3 through its paces on actual client work since the Flash model dropped.\n\nHere's what I learned (including some properly bizarre moments).\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* 47 real projects across 10 UK businesses\n* Legal, healthcare, finance, retail, trades\n* Compared Gemini 3 (Pro + Flash) against GPT-5.2 and Claude 4.5\n* Tracked accuracy, cost, speed, and UK context understanding\n\n**The Good News: Gemini is Shockingly Good at Being British**\n\nNot joking. It understands UK business context better than the competition:\n\nNailed GDPR compliance in 9/10 legal doc reviews \n\nGot UK tax scenarios right without American assumptions \n\nUnderstood British politeness levels in customer service \n\nRecognised colloquialisms (\"sorted\", \"brilliant\", \"cheers mate\")\n\nExample: Asked it to draft a \"firm but polite\" late payment reminder. GPT-5.2 gave me American directness. Claude was too formal. Gemini perfectly captured that British \"I'm terribly sorry to bother you but you owe us £5,000\" energy.\n\n**Cost Reality Check:**\n\nFor most UK SME tasks, Gemini 3 Flash is absurdly cost-effective**:**\n\n* Invoice processing: £14/month vs £60-120/month (GPT-5.2)\n* Email drafting: 70% as good at 20% of the cost\n* Basic contract review: Fast enough, accurate enough, cheap enough\n\n**But here's where it gets weird...**\n\n**The Unexpected Behaviours:**\n\n**1. The Work-Life Balance Incident**\n\nClient at 11 PM rushing an annual report. Gemini stopped mid-sentence and suggested they \"reconsider whether this deadline aligns with their well-being goals.\"\n\nThen offered mindfulness resources.\n\nThe report was ABOUT employee wellness programs.\n\nGemini became the HR department it was writing about. \n\n**2. The Over-Helpful Phase**\n\nFor a week in December, Gemini started:\n\n* Questioning why we needed 40-page proposals (suggested 10 instead)\n* Refusing to schedule back-to-back meetings (insisted on \"buffer time\")\n* Asking if marketing copy was \"authentic to brand values\"\n\nI'm not complaining about AI with ethics. But when you're on deadline, having your assistant suggest therapy is jarring to say the least.\n\n**3. The Context Window Mystery**\n\nSometimes it remembers everything. Sometimes it forgets the document I uploaded 3 messages ago. The 1 million token promise feels more like 100k in practice.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this?​\n\n**What Actually Matters for UK Businesses:**\n\nAfter 47 projects, here's my honest take:\n\n**Use Gemini 3 Flash for:** (80% of business tasks)\n\n* Email responses\n* Invoice processing\n* Meeting notes\n* Basic content drafting\n* Customer service replies\n* **Monthly cost: \\~£14**\n\n**Use GPT-5.2 for:** (15% of tasks)\n\n* Complex financial analysis\n* Strategic planning\n* Multi-step reasoning\n* **Monthly cost: \\~£60 as supplement**\n\n**Use Claude 4.5 for:** (5% of tasks)\n\n* High-stakes legal docs\n* Executive communications\n* Brand-critical content\n* **Pay-per-use: \\~£20/month** (although you won't get much on their quota limits) \n\n**Total: \\~£94/month for comprehensive AI toolkit**  \nvs. £350+/month for GPT-5.2-only approach\n\n**The Surprising Winner:**\n\nFor UK-specific work, **Gemini's understanding of British business culture is its secret weapon.**\n\nIt doesn't just translate American business speak. It actually *gets* how UK businesses operate:\n\n* Understands understated communication\n* Recognises indirect feedback patterns\n* Handles formal/informal register switching\n* Knows when to be apologetic (always)\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **Has anyone else had Gemini give them life advice mid-project?** Or is my setup haunted?\n2. **The context window issue** – are others seeing inconsistent performance?​\n3. **UK users:** Have you noticed it handling British business norms better than US models?\n4. **What's your optimal multi-model setup?** Pure Gemini? Mixed approach?\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nGemini 3 is brilliant for UK business use – **when it's not trying to be your therapist.**\n\nCost-effective, culturally aware, occasionally opinionated about your work-life balance.\n\n10/10 would let it psychoanalyse my deadlines again.\n\nAnyone want methodology details or specific test results? Happy to share in comments.",

      "text": "So what are tokens in LLMs, how does tokenization work in models like ChatGPT and Gemini, and why do the first 50 tokens in your prompt matter so much?​\n\nMost people treat AI models like magical chatbots, communicating with ChatGPT or Gemini as if talking to a person and hoping for the best. To get elite results from modern LLMs, you have to treat them as a steerable prediction engine that operates on tokens, not on “ideas in your head”. To understand why your prompts succeed or fail, you need a mental model for the tokens, tokenization, and token sequence the machine actually processes.​\n\n1. Key terms: the mechanics of the machine\n\nThe token. An LLM does not “read” human words; it breaks text into tokens (sub‑word units) through a tokenizer and then predicts which token is mathematically most likely to come next.​\n\nThe probabilistic mirror. The AI is a mirror of its training data. It navigates latent space—a massive mathematical map of human knowledge. Your prompt is the coordinate in that space that tells it where to look.​\n\nThe internal whiteboard (System 2). Advanced models use hidden reasoning tokens to “think” before they speak. You can treat this as an internal whiteboard. If you fill the start of your prompt with social fluff, you clutter that whiteboard with useless data.​\n\nThe compass and 1‑degree error. Because every new token is predicted based on everything that came before it, your initial token sequence acts as a compass. A one‑degree error in your opening sentence can make the logic drift far off course by the end of the response.​\n\n2. The strategy: constraint primacy\n\nThe physics of the model dictates that earlier tokens carry more weight in the sequence. Therefore, you want to follow this order: Rules → Role → Goal. Defining your rules first clears the internal whiteboard of unwanted paths in latent space before the AI begins its work.​\n\n3. The audit: sequence architecture in action\n\nExample 1: Tone and confidence\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“I’m looking for some ideas on how to be more confident in meetings. Can you help?”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: “Use a confident but collaborative tone, remove hedging and apologies.”\n\nRole: Executive coach.\n\nGoal: Provide 3 actionable strategies.\n\nThe logic: Front‑loading style and constraints pin down the exact “tone region” on the internal whiteboard and prevent the 1‑degree drift into generic, polite self‑help.​\n\nExample 2: Teaching complex topics\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“Can you explain how photosynthesis works in a way that is easy to understand?”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: Use checkpointed tutorials (confirm after each step), avoid metaphors, and use clinical terms.\n\nRole: Biologist.\n\nGoal: Provide a full process breakdown.\n\nThe logic: Forcing checkpoints in the early tokens stops the model from rushing to a shallow overview and keeps the whiteboard focused on depth and accuracy.​\n\nExample 3: Complex planning\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“Help me plan a 3‑day trip to Tokyo. I like food and tech, but I’m on a budget.”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: Rank success criteria, define deal‑breakers (e.g., no travel over 30 minutes), and use objective‑defined planning.\n\nRole: Travel architect.\n\nGoal: Create a high‑efficiency itinerary.\n\nThe logic: Defining deal‑breakers and ranked criteria in the opening tokens locks the compass onto high‑utility results and filters out low‑probability “filler” content.​\n\nSummary\n\nStop “prompting” and start architecting. Every word you type is a physical constraint on the model’s probability engine, and it enters the system as part of a token sequence. If you don’t set the compass with your first 50 tokens, the machine will happily spend the next 500 trying to guess where you’re going. The winning sequence is: Rules → Role → Goal → Content.​\n\nFurther reading on tokens and tokenization\n\nIf you want to go deeper into how tokens and tokenization work in LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini, here are a few directions you can explore:​\n\nIntroductory docs from major model providers that explain tokens, tokenization, and context windows in plain language.\n\nBlog posts or guides that show how different tokenizers split the same text and how that affects token counts and pricing.\n\nTechnical overviews of attention and positional encodings that explain how the model uses token order internally (for readers who want the “why” behind sequence sensitivity).\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what tokens actually are, how tokenization works in LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini, or why the first 50 tokens of your prompt seem to change everything, this is the mental model used today. It is not perfect, but it is practical-and it is open to challenge.",

I find GPT more coherent in writting all flaws rather then parts of a coding file.. its weird you have to use all of them to get a result.. 1 is good at spotting the other in coding and gemini 3 pro well its even worse then 2.0 thinking that was a good gemini model..",

      "text": "I’ve been spending some time exploring the latest updates, particularly the move towards generative interfaces. For a long time, we’ve effectively been \"trapped\" in the chatbox—input text, get text (or a static image) back.\n\nBut the shift to dynamic UI elements is actually huge. It’s the difference between asking for a budget planner and getting a text list of columns, versus getting an actual, functional table you can edit right there. I noticed this specifically when testing out some complex data visualization requests; the ability for the model to \"draw\" the interface rather than just describe it is a significant leap.\n\nIt feels like we are finally moving past the \"LLM as a chatbot\" phase into \"LLM as an engine\" territory. Has anyone else experimented with this using the new \"Deep Think\" mode? I’m curious if you’re finding it practical for daily workflows or if it still feels a bit experimental.\n\nSee you in the comments.",

So I debated each one of them about the semantics of the word that can be used...and each of them came up with a different word to settle on, and then when I shared the word they debated that as well.\n\nAt the end of it I said cool, and repeated my initial point verbatim and the substituted word still worked so essentially we went nowhere with it.\n\nPeople got ao hung up on the syntax that they ignored the message. Now a month later every other post is about context windows, memory shifts, and prompt updating. I see many posts which are very close to the whole picture but just needs to be adjusted slightly.\n\nSo I've been helping people with those adjustments and it's been helping.

Having it remember specific context and applying that to future interactions will only elevate the value of the outputs it produces.\n\nAlso, I’m learning about Gems and having specific Gems for certain activities can compartmentalize some of this.

Keeps the original quality too.\n\n\\- You can do a whole batch at once if you've got a bunch of images to process.\n\nAnyway, figured I'd share in case anyone else finds it useful. Let me know what you think!\n\nIf this helped you out, would love it if you dropped a rating. Five stars would make my day 😄\n\nBig thanks to anyone who leaves a review 🙏\n\nLink here:\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/peel-banana/cngdhnfjakplnhplnmlgjalmfcochdgj](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/peel-banana/cngdhnfjakplnhplnmlgjalmfcochdgj)\n\nAnd hey, if you know someone who might find this useful, pass it along! \n\nThanks.😊",

If there is an important fragment in the chat, you highlight it and bookmark it, solving two problems: when the context is truncated, the chatbot prioritizes retaining the marked fragments, and it makes them easier for the user to find. Another point is that the user should be able to edit the chatbot's responses. If the bot provided some value but also added a lot of fluff, the user could edit the fragment to cut out the fluff, thereby reducing the context usage. Oh, and a third point: the response is automatically marked as useful and high-quality, which will help the bot learn. I look forward to hearing a critique of this approach.",

Everything I can find online seems to be outdated, and I don't want to subscribe before I know what I'm getting.\n\n\\- do the generated Gemini Pro video have a Veo3 watermark?  \n\\- How much credits does it cost to create one video with the newest veo 3.1 model? It seems to be 100 credits per video for veo 3.0, but don't know if that's still accurate? And is that an 8 second video in 1080p resolution?  \n\\- does your prompt have to be perfect for each shot, or are there free retries?\n\nCan someone help me out here?\n\nThanks in advance!",

It makes current enterprise testers forced to jump through dialectical hoops and other contrived methods to make it usable in real world scenarios.  Currently users can start a session on a medium sized repo, give a solid guardrail that the model is not to make code changes, and within 2 prompts the model will start refactoring things while asking architecture questions.  I figured you would do this sooner when I started using the ultra plan as a possible alternative to Anthropic, but it's still something that we can't modify.  This is unacceptable for enterprise engineering.  Thank you.\n\n  \nAlso, Jules is good, continue on this project!",
