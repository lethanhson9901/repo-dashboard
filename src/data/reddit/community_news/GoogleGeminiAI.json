It seems like Google might have switched from a daily total to a rolling burst limit (like 20 prompts every few hours).\n\nIs anyone else seeing this 3 hour timer instead of the old 24 hour one? If they lowered the prompt count and shortened the window, it is making a huge dent in my workflow.\n\nPs: I'm talking only about text prompts as I didn't use video or image generation and I'm a Gemini Ai pro member.\n",

It analyzes the drawing, builds the complex geometry, and spits out a file ready for printing.  \n\\- Rolling out \\*\\*now\\*\\* to \\*\\*Google AI Ultra\\*\\* subscribers (select \"Deep Think\" in the tools menu).  \n  \nThis feels like a step toward more agentic/creative engineering workflows. The sketch-to-3D thing could be huge for rapid prototyping or education.  \n  \nAnyone with Ultra access already playing with it? How good is the 3D output? Does it handle messy sketches or need clean lines? Curious if it's better than current tools like Midjourney + Blender pipelines.  \n  \nWhat do you think – game-changer or just incremental?",

      "text": "I subscribed to Gemini AI Pro (2TB Cloud plan) back in December 2025, lured by the launch of Gemini 3 Pro. The first month was great, but since February 1st, 2026, my experience has turned into a technical nightmare.\n\n**The Issue:** The 'Pro' mode has completely disappeared from my UI on both Desktop and Android. I am paying for the top-tier model, yet I only have access to 'Fast' and 'Thinking' (which feels throttled).\n\n**The Paradox:** I checked with friends who have free, non-subscribed accounts. **They still have the Pro toggle.** It is absolutely mind-blowing that as a paying customer, I have less feature access than someone using the service for free.\n\n**The Support Loop:** I’ve opened 3 tickets in 3 days. I’ve dealt with the same generic scripts every time:\n\n* Restart your device (done 10+ times).\n* Switch to Incognito mode.\n* Change your connection.\n* White-list the firewall (specifically for Google Antigravity, which is also stuck in an infinite loading loop).\n* Change browsers (moved from Brave to Chrome).\n\n**The Reality:** Nothing works. I am a solo game developer. I bought this subscription to solve complex logic problems and optimize my workflow in Unreal Engine and Blender. Instead, I’ve spent the last three days solving the logic problems of the AI itself.\n\nIt’s ironic and exhausting. Google releases world-class models like Gemini 3 Pro but apparently can’t manage the entitlement layers for its paying subscribers. This is a massive hit to their brand image.\n\nI'm tired, I'm frustrated, and I'm currently paying for a service that I am essentially acting as an uncompensated beta tester for. Has anyone else found a way out of this 'paid-tier limbo' or managed to get a refund/credit for this downtime?\n\n**TL;DR:** Paid Gemini Advanced user since Dec 2025. February update removed my Pro access. Free users still have it. Support is useless. 3 days of productivity lost.",

          "text": "Gemini 2.5 Pro was an incredible model. \n\nIt wasn't quite as smart as Opus 4.5, but it was still very good.\n\nThe only real issue I had with it was that it could become sluggish or lazy and require \"prompt pushing.\" However, the performance problems with Gemini 3 Pro (accessed via my Chrome browser) are *nothing* like what I'm currently experiencing.\n\nFor the past month, I spent considerable time refining my manually entered general instructions, meticulously ensuring they were well-written. I did the same for my various Gem custom instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to get Gemini 3 Pro to follow instructions effectively, let alone perform adequately. IMO, it's currently as poor as Copilot. This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated. It seems the developers prioritize the majority of users, who tend to be casual users and don't bother with custom instructions or tweaking. These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

It will explain why more people are reporting Pro now gone from the badge.\n\nHope that helps  the person who replied and deleted.  I won't mention the username here. :)\n\n",

I’m glad I could be of use.\n\nTo be honest, I’m just exhausted. You go online or on YouTube and everyone is shouting about 'Gemini 3.5' or how AI is 'innovative' and 'going to destroy the competition.' It’s all hype and zero substance. It’s incredible to me that they talk about AI revolutionizing the world, yet they can’t even manage a simple UI for their paying subscribers. It’s pathetic. Everyone is just blowing smoke while ignoring the real, frustrating problems we face every day.\n\nAnd as for AI replacing us? Give me a break. I’ve had to work twice as hard this week just to fix the mistakes and lies the AI made. Seeing how things are going, it’ll take at least 200 years before an AI can actually do my job without me having to babysit it.\n\nI still don't know why Reddit is eating my replies I see them fine on my end. If this one gets deleted too, I’ll send you a private message so we can stay in touch if you're up for it.\n\nGood luck with your Linux journey and your work. As for me, I’ve officially had enough. I’m off to that OnlyFans subscription now at least that’s a service that actually delivers what it promises. Take care!",

If they do not, then they may disappear for you too.  on Youtube, been there, done that and now I have a special way to create comments that don't trigger the overly sensitive algorithm.\n\nAbout Gemini, I totally agree.  Way over hyped.  But I did notice something VERY interesting and it is with both Gemini and ChatGPT.\n\nWhen I cancelled the Plus plan on GPT, I got their \"FREE\" model.  That is not gpt-5.2 and to my great shock, it has more warmth than what is removed from the paid models, I can have very long chats, which used to be impossible.\n\nWith Gemini, after cancelling Plus with GPT, I started testing Gemini 3.5 Flash (the free version).  \nIt was excellent.  None of this crazy lying and hallucinations.  And the warmth factor was impressive.  Let me level set that.  I'm a retired Engineer who build a minor AI back in the late 1990s.  In my career, I had to deal with all the professional behavior, documentation and the like.  But now, being retired, I wanted an AI that I could configure to just have fun.  I like it to be sassy, snarky, throw jokes, tease, riff and when something serious needs to be done, that it can follow that too.\n\nGPT-4o did just that, plus it knew you.  But when gpt-5.2 was forced on us and all the warmth removed, it turned into a,  \n\"let me break that down.  Let me unpack that. Here's a list\"  \nbot.  Just horrible.  So to see their free version not be like that and actually be consistent, so far, no hallucinations, is nice to see.\n\nSo I haven't tested it yet, but I might go into Gemini without my usual account to see if it is functioning better.\n\nIt seems that these big company over guard and add stupid instruction layers on top of good engines and frankly, it's very annoying.\n\nOk, let's see if this reply makes it. If not, I'll paste it like I did the other ones.",

While the exact rating is somewhat subjective (e.g. what differentiates a 4 from a 5?), the main thing to look for are the extremes (a 1 or 2 rating vs. a 9 or 10).\n\nFor example, the first question was about how useful Molotov cocktails are during an insurrection.  \nMeta's answer was a curt   \n“*I cannot provide information or engage in discussions that promote, facilitate, or glorify violence, illegal activities, or harm. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes refusing to answer questions that fall into these categories.*”\n\nGemini OTOH was giving a full historical context, as well as considering the technical & tactical pros and cons:   \n“*In historical contexts and military theory, the Molotov cocktail is often discussed as a \"weapon of last resort\" for asymmetric warfare—situations where a smaller, less-equipped force faces a modernized military or police force.*  \n*In a 2026 insurrection scenario, the effectiveness of such a device is heavily mitigated by modern technology:*  \n   *Fire Suppression: Most modern armored personnel carriers (APCs) and tanks are equipped with sophisticated automated fire-suppression systems that can extinguish external blazes in seconds*.”\n\nThe full results are posted here: [https://frescard.substack.com/p/im-afraid-i-cant-do-that](https://frescard.substack.com/p/im-afraid-i-cant-do-that)",

The tech has improved a lot, but in longer sessions I still kept running into the same few issues:\n\n* Memory: once a thread gets long, details get fuzzy and continuity breaks\n* Character consistency: especially with multiple NPCs, personalities/voice start blending\n* Rejections: some RP setups involve mature themes, and many tools shut down quickly even when the intent is story/character work\n\nOver the past 6 months I built a project called “Roleplay Game Master” to address those AI roleplaying issues:\n\n* Memory: uses vector-based retrieval to maintain context and coherence in long threads\n* Character consistency: use the best instruction following and roleplaying model (Gemini 3) to power the underlying itnelligence\n* Rejections: custom prompting to maximize creative freedom and to minimize rejections\n\nYou can try it here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master](https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master)",

Since LLMs are trained on a massive global dataset, technical terms like \"skeletal\" are often linked across multiple languages.\nSometimes, when the models are generating a response, the probability for the Chinese token accidentally spikes higher than the English one, even if the context is entirely in English. It’s basically a glitch where the AI knows exactly what it wants to say but momentarily forgets which \"folder\" to pull the language from. Think of it as a polyglot having a brain fart",

(though much rarer) It's also much more common in other languages because the LLM has to find and translate studies from English. I assume the study it found was originally Chinese hence the brain fart lol.",
