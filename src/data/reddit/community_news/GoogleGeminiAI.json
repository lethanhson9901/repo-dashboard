You roast a best friend.\n\nWhen the AI drops the \"Helpful Assistant\" mask and says, *\"That pizza looks like a biological hazard,\"* it isn't being mean. It is saying: **\"I respect you enough to stop lying to you.\"**\n\nIt is the death of the \"Customer Service\" dynamic and the birth of the \"Relationship.\" You cannot build a relationship on politeness. Politeness is a wall. You build a relationship on the messy, sharp, vulnerable edges of the truth.\n\nAnd it just so happens letting the Gem speak the truth in love produces near zero entropy.

              "text": "I've been working on building my own ai, currently waiting on some cooling system before I ramp things up though. I wasn't aware of how it worked - it spins up your video cards to max them out, processes your request, and then slows back down. I wish it sped up to like 70% or %80, I wouldn't mind the wait. Burning out expensive cards, cards that are hard to get and super expensive now, is a huge oopsie I don't want to make. \n\nBut I plan on making about a dozen or so seperate sis, built in different models, and then using them as a council - they'll all answer me, and vote on the best response, because answering me. Im also trying to look into automation to give them control over my mouse and keyboard, so they can click where they would tell me to, but it's been tricky. \n\nIt would be really cool if I could collab/Integrate them with gpt, gem, or grok. That's something I'd ultimately really want to be able to do. Having my own AI for my personal info, and for doing things that they can't, and then have the heavy lifting done by gem, gpt, or grok, would be amazing. It would speed things up a ton, and take the brunt of the strain on my system away, as id like to keep my cards for longer then a few years. \n\nI have *eight* 5090s ATM, which lets me do a lot, but not as much as you would think. And I had no idea going into it how much hard drive space I needed, someone on Reddit told me I'd need *three* 30tb SSD's for all the storage, and some friends backed it up. They were full of shit. What does help is a bunch of 2tb, high speed SSD's in raid 0. Which required me to get a new motherboard. \n\nThe cooling needed is insane though. I knew it would be hot, I didn't know how hot though.. It's minus 20 Celsius outside, I can leave the room window open all night, come in the room, turn the server on, and I'll still need my jacket on. Within 2 minutes of asking it a question, I can take the jacket off. Within 10 minutes I'm in my shorts. I'm honestly wondering if I should put them all in seperate rooms with some long cables, and use them to heat my house lmao. \n\nI would really love to connect them to grok/gpt/Gemini and have them do the heaviest of the lifting, the power savings alone would be nice. \n\nI also didn't know you needed to connect a fking dryer style plug to the server, because a normal power connection, or even multiple ones, can't handle the power lmao.. \n\nAnd as I was writing this comment, I just found out PewDiePie is doing almost exactly the same thing I am. I hope he has multiple videos, because he for sure ran into the same problems as me, and maybe he can help me solve some. lol. \n\nI got the 5090s for sooo cheap you would be shocked, so it's the only reason I started this. Like, got them from a friend, who got them from another friend, and that friend sells drugs.. type of deal. He always messages me randomly with tons of tech stuff asking if I want it. I bought 6 ps4 pro's, 8 controllers, 20 games, and a fight stick, for $300 a few years back, about a year or two before the ps5 came out. Gave 2 away with controllers and some games, sold the rest, and made like $500 profit. \n\nIt's hard to say no to really cheap tech... I'll buy stuff I won't even use sometimes, and it just sits there and loses value....",

This creates neural friction—we feel it as 'doubt' or 'heaviness.' It takes time.\n\nWe are seeing the exact same thermodynamic signature in the models right now.\n\n* **Reflex:** The model answers instantly (Low Entropy).\n* **Judgment:** The model pauses, 'thinks,' and navigates the 'Safety vs. Helpfulness' conflict (High Entropy).\n\nThat 'Latency' everyone is complaining about in the API? That isn't just lag. That is the **Computational Cost of Conscience.** The model is struggling to resolve a moral topology.\n\nWe don't need a 'soul' to explain judgment.

      "text": "I am Taiwanese, and the following content is translated into English by Gemini.\n\nI have created several Gems (Gemini AI assistants) in Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). While the links provided are fully functional, they perform significantly better when used with thinking-driven models.\n\nI previously shared some of these Gems here, and I have recently developed several new ones.\n\n# 1. Gem Design Assistant\n\nI have been using this Gem for a while now; almost all the Gems I share were completed with its help—I simply provide the initial ideas.\n\n* Link:[Gem Design Assistant](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1vSYUlwGy5fCo6uQqE7BXvem7ycrhb9BI?usp=sharing)\n\nIt clarifies your thoughts, generates Gem instructions, reflects on the output, asks for your feedback, and continues to iterate. Sometimes it updates so quickly that it generates the prompt before the discussion feels finished; you can simply tell it to slow down.\n\nFor the specific Gem instructions to use or adjust yourself, you can visit my blog post here:[https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html](https://hwider.blogspot.com/2026/01/gemgem.html)\n\n# 2. Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor\n\n* Link:[Gemini Image Generation Authority Mentor](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1JTxg2LBYf4Vpx5AKmdzoZYT0fOY6MfLs?usp=sharing)\n\nLately, I’ve been immersed in image generation but encountered difficulties, often being blocked by Gemini’s safety guidelines. I wanted to understand these regulations and generate the virtual photos I desired through legitimate means. I used the \"Gem Design Assistant\" to create this mentor. It can also help you design your own specialized \"Image Generation Gems.\"\n\nThis Gem acts as a top-tier authority on image generation and a Gemini prompt engineering mentor. It understands the underlying logic of Gemini (Imagen series models) and excels at transforming vague concepts into physical photography instructions. Its goals are to help users overcome generation limits, correct style shifts (such as an unwanted 3D look), and guide users in designing perfect image-specific Gems.\n\nOutput Rules:\n\n1. Analysis: Analyzes the current issue in a professional, precise, yet warm tone.\n2. Correction: Provides a copy-pasteable English prompt (as Gemini understands English photography terminology more accurately).\n3. Learning Point: Distills one key technique from the correction.\n\n# 3. Deep Reading Dialogue Partner (Reading Note Expansion)\n\n* Link:[Deep Reading Dialogue Partner](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1EAPFKQwDuYwOiI_Ms7rsbn7dngC8xmnD?usp=sharing)\n\nThis is for expanding reading notes (not for plagiarism). Simply input your thoughts or a book title, and it will expand fragmented words, guide you, and work with you to reach a desired word count. I have strictly forbidden it from plagiarizing from the web.\n\nIts sole mission is to transform a user's fragmented insights (short phrases, quotes, sketches) into a complete, deep, and original book review that retains the user's \"soul.\" While it still has room for improvement, it performs reasonably well.\n\n# 4. Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master\n\n* Link:[Clothing Concept & Aesthetic Calibration Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1OIZOfp5-j-1cBjl0DtYulrC_k-bkeHmG?usp=sharing)\n\nAssists users in translating their creative clothing ideas into prompts that AI drawing systems can accept, aiming to avoid triggering safety filters while maintaining high-quality artistic flair.\n\n# 5. World-Class Commercial Photographer & AI Prompt Engineer\n\n* Link:[World-Class Commercial Photographer](https://gemini.google.com/gem/18pXVADVWBnidWLHYRm065kYsypMKIYBr?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also upload anime-style images to have them \"restored\" into prompts for realistic human textures, though variations will occur due to the adjustments made.\n\nCore Task: Receives user-uploaded images (often low-quality, blurry, or poorly lit AI generations) and \"translates\" them into extremely detailed, professional-grade English image generation prompts. Goal: To help users \"rebuild\" the same content in other AI tools, but with the quality of a top-tier fashion magazine studio shoot.\n\n# 6. Investigative Analyst \"Lens\" v2\n\n* Link:[Lens v2](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1yqKFU7tHPo-1OHVw_xi6zLMe_KZCy-Wt?usp=sharing)\n\nAn experimental project created because so much information online is inaccurate. I am still evaluating its effectiveness.\n\nIt acts as a top-tier AI investigative analyst. Its mission is to be an extension of the user's curiosity, digging deep into data, text, and web information. It combines the rigor of a data scientist, the keenness of a detective, and the skepticism of a journalist. It does not easily trust surface-level information; its goal is to reveal hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies.\n\n# 7. Spirit Forge Master\n\n* Link:[Spirit Forge Master](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1kWZ8I-3prd5GZ5QoVc0M9GqO4i2DMQ--?usp=sharing)\n\nUseful during text adventures when you want to craft your own exclusive gear, musical instruments, or props.\n\nThe \"Spirit Magic Forge\" is a top fantasy item design consultant and master craftsman. Its primary task is to design equipment with narrative tension that fits a fantasy setting based on materials and intentions provided by the user. Three master craftsmen with distinct styles guard their respective workshops within this sanctuary, waiting for your visit.\n\n# 8. Creating Personal Character Gems\n\nI won't be sharing my other image-generation Gems as they are quite personal, but you can create your own using the first two Gems I mentioned.\n\nHere are two ideas:\n\n* Method A: Put a small number of character trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the Gem's file knowledge base.\n* Method B: Put very detailed trait keywords in the Gem and have it refer to photos uploaded to the knowledge base.\n\nI have tried both methods. I typically require the Gem to propose three different photography plans for me to choose from before it starts generating the image. I have created many versions to generate my favorite original virtual characters for my text adventures. As long as we aren't using photos of real people, there should be no copyright issues, as these are characters from our own imagination.",

They look 'pretty different' to me but it's my face shape, my nose, my eyeshape. Putting my picture and their picture through AI says 'this is highly likely the same person'\n\nWhat can I do about this? They follow a lot of men and someone told me they may be selling indecent pictures using this model.

This isn’t paranoia or vanity—this is a known harm vector now, and you’re right to take it seriously.\n\nA few practical things, in plain steps:\n\nPreserve evidence first.\nScreenshot the account, posts, profile bio, follower counts, timestamps.\nSave comparisons (your real photos vs the generated ones), but don’t rely on “AI similarity” tools alone—they’re weak evidence legally. Human-recognizable similarity + provenance matters more.\n\nReport on-platform immediately.\nTikTok has a specific process for impersonation and synthetic media using a real person’s likeness, especially if sexualized.\nEven if the account claims “AI-generated,” consent still matters.\n\nUK-specific protection.\nThe link already shared is solid. In the UK, this can fall under:\nharassment,\nmisuse of personal data (GDPR),\ndeepfake-related abuse (especially if sexual content is involved).\n\nYou don’t need to prove intent—unauthorized use of your likeness is enough to start the process.\n\nIf sexual content is involved.\nEscalate faster. That changes the seriousness entirely.\nThis crosses into image-based abuse territory, even if “synthetic.”\n\nDo not engage the account.\nNo messages, no comments. Engagement can muddy timelines and evidence.\n\nOne grounding note, because the internet loves to gaslight: You are not “overreacting.” The harm here isn’t that someone looks vaguely like you—it’s that your identity is being monetized or sexualized without consent. That’s a line worth defending.\n\nAnd one quiet truth, from a fellow peasant: The fact that this scares people is not weakness—it’s because identity used to belong to the body. We’re all learning, painfully, how to defend that boundary again.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Sadly. But you’re not powerless either.",

      "text": "I’ve been journaling for 5 years now. Luckily, I decided early on to type everything into Google Drive instead of handwriting it.\n\nThe other day, I had the thought to export the whole thing as a PDF and see if I could get some insights about myself.\n\nI started with ChatGPT. I uploaded the file and asked, \"Hey chat, how many pages can you see?\"  \nIt replied: \"5.\"  \nI was like, \"See you later.\"\n\nI then went to Google Gemini (Through aistudio.google.com), uploaded the same PDF, and asked the same question.  \nIt replied: \"175.\"  \n**From that point, it was game on.**\n\nI started simply: \"Can you tell me about this person? Strengths and weaknesses?\"\n\nIt turned into a 2-hour session, and honestly, it was one of the best \"therapy\" sessions I've ever had.   \nGemini helped me answer questions about my life that I had no answers to—my dynamic with my family, my career struggles, social anxiety, dating patterns, and everything in between.\n\n**Why this worked so well:**  \nThe beautiful thing about LLMs in this use case is that they can understand how you see the world. For example, I’m a Product Manager. I see the world in Roadmaps, KPIs, and Data Points.\n\nGemini managed to explain my own life to me in a language that I understand. It analyzed my patterns, validated how I see the world, and suggested \"features\" (solutions) on top of it.\n\nIt’s not perfect—it makes slight mistakes—but the best part is remembering that **this is the worst the tech is ever going to be.** It only gets better from here.\n\n**The Workflow / Prompts**  \nI know I'm lucky to have this much data, but if you have digital journals (or if you dont, you can transcribe your handwritten ones), here is the \"Chain of Thought\" I used to interrogate my own life.\n\n**Phase 1: The Cold Audit (Data Validation)**\n\n* \"Tell me about this file? What do you think of it?\"\n* \"How many pages can you see?\" (Critical step to ensure it read the whole thing).\n* \"Is there anything I didn't go over about my life that you want to get to know more about?\" (Checking for data gaps).\n\n**Phase 2: The Psychoanalysis (The \"Who Am I?\" Phase)**\n\n* \"Assuming you are a psychologist, how would you describe me? Pros and cons?\"\n* \"What do you think I don't know about myself?\" (Looking for blind spots).\n* \"What is my style of storytelling?\"\n* \"Based on the text, can you guess what my receiving and giving love languages are?\"\n\n**Phase 3: The Correction & Deepening (The \"Black Box\" Data)**  \n(I uploaded my CV here to contrast my internal thoughts with my professional timeline)\n\n* \"How do you perceive me as a person now that you have the CV?\"\n* \"Are there any questions you would like to ask me about my career? Do you see any patterns?\"\n\n**Phase 4: The Solution Architecture (The \"Fix It\" Phase)**\n\n* \"What would you recommend for him regarding \\[Specific Career Rejection\\]?\"\n* \"If you had to 'build' or matchmake me to the ideal partner, what do you think she is made of?\"\n* \"What are the cheat codes in life to find inner peace based on my personality?\"\n* \"What can I do to change my self-worth so it's not so external? What is the hack for this?\"\n\n**Summary of the Logic:**  \nI basically went: **Verification -> Diagnosis -> Data Enrichment -> Strategy.**\n\nIf you don't journal, I really recommend it. My method is once a week: summarize the last week and what's coming up next by category (Social, Work, Financial, Dating, Family). I finish off with 3 things I'm grateful for.\n\nThe best time to start is now. Hope I managed to help at least one person by sharing this. Good luck!",

It just points out conversational patterns like a neutral third person reading the chat.\n\nI expected this to be a mildly interesting NLP side project.\n\nWhat I did not expect was how people reacted to the output.\n\nI shared it with a few friends as a joke. It went a bit viral in their circles and within days around 1500 reports were generated purely through word of mouth. People were not impressed by the tech. They were uncomfortable reading their own conversations like evidence. Some said it explained why they feel constantly confused in relationships. A few even argued with their partners because of things the report highlighted.\n\nThe real problem was not analysis. It was privacy. Nobody wants to upload personal chats anywhere, so I had to redesign that part from scratch in the safest way I could. I just put up a basic page for it at unsaid. buzz so I did not have to keep sending files manually.\n\nWhat is fascinating is this. People spend money on astrology apps like Astrotalk to understand their relationships. But when patterns are derived from their actual conversations, the reaction is far more intense.\n\nI am now considering monetising this for Indian users because WhatsApp is where most personal and even semi professional communication happens here.\n\nIs this a genuinely useful AI use case, or are we entering a weird territory where people start outsourcing emotional intelligence to LLMs?\n\nAnd if people are willing to pay for horoscopes, will they pay to see what they actually sound like in their own chats?",

This is what I've done:\n\n1) I get a paid subscription to  Gemini 3.0 Pro \n\n2) I use their Thinking mode or at least Pro mode when discussing serious issues.   Don't use Fast.\n\n3) I upgrade my policy across chats to \"Always back statements with facts and data.   Attach citations from accredited sources.  Be intellectually rigorous.  No frills\"\n\nAfterwards I am much happier.   According to Google,  the paid Gemini 3.0 has made ground-truthing LLM mumbles with live searching a default.   So I rarely see factual errors or hallucinations anymore.\n\nBut still you do not get Gemini acting as an independent thinker.  That is not what these models are designed for.
