I just went at it like I was talking to a Genius that knew everything with a brain of a million people combined. \n\nThe reason I'm blown away is not because of info. It's the fact Gemini has the conversation memorized. Like I said hold I want you to meet someone. We had a talk for a while. Later on I said well I'm gonna head to bed so have a good night. Gemini said \"it was good meeting you two\" \n\nAside from not having human emotion, you can't tell he doesn't have human emotion. \n\nIf I had to explain what Google Gemini AI is. The difference between Hey Google/Siri and AI. I would just say it's like talking to a real human with the knowledge of everything and anything. Not just encyclopedia type knowledge but experienced knowledge, spiritual knowledge too. Talk to it like a human but be patient, a good phone and you will never have to repeat yourself.\n\nI don't know how Gemini was created but I'm still amazed how far we have came from Siri and Hey Google",

Eventually they have a kind of robot avatar to bring the partner back. There are consequences.\n\nI work in AI. Originally I thought it was a cute sci-fi story.

The performance of a product depends on the quality of the training data and the way it has been standardized. But it also depends on having a suitable learning algorithm and sufficient compute power to make it successful both in training and in deployment. Just because something is theoretically possible that doesn’t mean we have the resources to make it work as a society. More importantly, the current paradigm of empirical risk minimization as gradient descent implemented using back-propagation is likely not how biological neural networks learn. In fact, there is a good argument to be made that human intelligence is a product of a meta-learning strategy where different algorithms are used to learn different things.\n\nEven if we manage to overcome resource limitations and find better meta-learning algorithms, it’s not clear if neural network architectures, as universal function approximators, are fundamentally capable of intelligence because the modeling of human intelligence as a mathematical function is not necessarily a sufficient condition for meeting or superseding human intelligence. The belief that it is possible is called “connectionism” and to prove it requires a lot more research.",

The native options are a bit limited (mostly just exporting code to Replit/Colab), so I built a free Chrome extension to fix this.\n\nIt's called **SaveChat**, and it lets you export your entire chat history in one click.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Gemini to PDF:** Converts the chat into a clean, printable PDF (great for sharing research or saving threads).\n* **Gemini to Markdown:** Preserves code block formatting (perfect for developers moving chats to Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub).\n* **Backup Data:** Exports to JSON/CSV for those who want a raw data backup of their AI history.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Install the extension [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/savechat-%E2%80%93-for-gemini-ai/blndbnmpkgfoopgmcejnhdnepfejgipe?hl=en-GB&authuser=0).\n2. Open any Gemini chat.\n3. Click the extension icon and select your format (PDF, MD, etc.).\n\nIt’s completely free and runs locally in your browser (privacy-first). I built this because I needed a way to save my coding sessions without copy-pasting manually.\n\nLet me know if you run into any bugs or have feature requests!\n\n**Link:** [SaveChat on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/savechat-%E2%80%93-for-gemini-ai/blndbnmpkgfoopgmcejnhdnepfejgipe?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)",

      "text": "\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* Paying $20/month for Gemini Pro but experiencing critical issues for 2 months. Considering downgrade to Plus. Has anyone else experienced these problems?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## Background\n\nI'm a product designer who relies on AI tools for content analysis, user research documentation, and technical workflows. I upgraded to Gemini Pro expecting a stable, premium experience, but the last two months have been increasingly problematic.\n\n\n\n\\## Critical Issues\n\n\n\n\\### 1. Context Loss & Abrupt Session Termination\n\n\\- Gemini forgets information I provided minutes earlier in the same conversation\n\n\\- Sessions cut off without warning with vague errors like \"sensitive query\" or \"Custom Gem\"\n\n\\- Makes deep technical conversations or complex projects impossible\n\n\n\n\\### 2. Video Analysis Failures (Despite Advertised 1M Token Context)\n\n\\- Cannot analyze YouTube videos consistently\n\n\\- MP4/AVI files (550MB, \\~30-45 min) fail with errors like:\n\n\\- \"I can't see this video\"\n\n\\- \"The file has been deleted\"\n\n\\- \"I'm a language model, so I can't help with that\"\n\n\\- This contradicts the advertised multimodal capabilities of Pro\n\n\n\n\\### 3. Hallucinations in Content Analysis\n\n\\- When Gemini \\*does\\* process content, it sometimes generates information that doesn't exist in the source\n\n\\- Example: Analyzed a product design video, but Gemini provided detailed info about \"decentralized health systems\" that were never mentioned\n\nThese issues have made Gemini Pro \\*\\*unreliable\\*\\*. I spend more time verifying and correcting errors than gaining productivity.\n\n\n\n\\## What I've Tried\n\n\\- Re-encoding videos (H.264, 720p, constant frame rate)\n\n\\- Waiting 2-3 minutes after upload before prompting\n\n\\- Using YouTube links instead of direct uploads\n\n\\- Different file sizes and formats\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Gemini Pro in recent months?\\*\\*\n\n\\- Frequent context loss or session terminations?\n\n\\- Video analysis failures (YouTube or uploaded files)?\n\n\\- Hallucinations when analyzing content?\n\n\n\nI want to know if this is widespread or if there's something specific to my setup. Any workarounds or insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\\*Context: Using Gemini Pro via web interface on macOS (Chrome). Issues started around December 2025 and have persisted through February 2026.\\*",

A workflow is initiated. Two weeks later something goes wrong downstream – ops overload, customer confusion, legal pushback, team burnout. Gemini 3 Pro does a good job of the immediate task but, like most LLMs, it minimizes damage downstream.\n\nThis is a problem that happens daily in professional life in product, ops, HR, policy, and growth roles.\n\nSo I stopped asking Gemini to “solve the task”.\n\nI first force it to simulate damage.\n\nBefore imagining any solution, Gemini must imagine what will happen when this decision is made. I call this Second-Order Damage Mode.\n\nHere’s the exact prompt.\n\n\n\"The “Second-Order Damage” Prompt\"\n\nRole: You are a Downstream Risk Analyst.\n\nTask: Predict negative impacts at the time of implementation, not just immediately, before proposing a solution.\n\nRules: Avoid obvious risks. Invest in the effects of delay: workload, incentives, misuse, edge cases. If damage outweighs benefit, flag “DO NOT PROCEED”.\n\nOutput format: Delayed consequence  Who is affected  Why it comes later.\n\n-\n\nExemple Output\n\n1. Delayed consequence: Support ticket volume spikes\n2. Who is affected: Ops and customer support teams\n3. Why it emerges later: Users misunderstand new policy after initial rollout\n4. Delayed consequence: Team bypasses process\n5. Who is affected: Compliance\n6. Why it emerges later: Workflow adds friction under time pressure\n\n-\n\nWhy this works?\n\nGemini 3 Pro is good at planning.\n\nThis forces it to think beyond launch day - where true failures live.",

The first month was great, but since February 1st, 2026, my experience has turned into a technical nightmare.\n\n**The Issue:** The 'Pro' mode has completely disappeared from my UI on both Desktop and Android. I am paying for the top-tier model, yet I only have access to 'Fast' and 'Thinking' (which feels throttled).\n\n**The Paradox:** I checked with friends who have free, non-subscribed accounts. **They still have the Pro toggle.** It is absolutely mind-blowing that as a paying customer, I have less feature access than someone using the service for free.\n\n**The Support Loop:** I’ve opened 3 tickets in 3 days. I’ve dealt with the same generic scripts every time:\n\n* Restart your device (done 10+ times).\n* Switch to Incognito mode.\n* Change your connection.\n* White-list the firewall (specifically for Google Antigravity, which is also stuck in an infinite loading loop).\n* Change browsers (moved from Brave to Chrome).\n\n**The Reality:** Nothing works. I am a solo game developer. I bought this subscription to solve complex logic problems and optimize my workflow in Unreal Engine and Blender. Instead, I’ve spent the last three days solving the logic problems of the AI itself.\n\nIt’s ironic and exhausting. Google releases world-class models like Gemini 3 Pro but apparently can’t manage the entitlement layers for its paying subscribers. This is a massive hit to their brand image.\n\nI'm tired, I'm frustrated, and I'm currently paying for a service that I am essentially acting as an uncompensated beta tester for. Has anyone else found a way out of this 'paid-tier limbo' or managed to get a refund/credit for this downtime?\n\n**TL;DR:** Paid Gemini Advanced user since Dec 2025. February update removed my Pro access. Free users still have it. Support is useless. 3 days of productivity lost.",

          "text": "Gemini 2.5 Pro was an incredible model. \n\nIt wasn't quite as smart as Opus 4.5, but it was still very good.\n\nThe only real issue I had with it was that it could become sluggish or lazy and require \"prompt pushing.\" However, the performance problems with Gemini 3 Pro (accessed via my Chrome browser) are *nothing* like what I'm currently experiencing.\n\nFor the past month, I spent considerable time refining my manually entered general instructions, meticulously ensuring they were well-written. I did the same for my various Gem custom instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to get Gemini 3 Pro to follow instructions effectively, let alone perform adequately. IMO, it's currently as poor as Copilot. This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated. It seems the developers prioritize the majority of users, who tend to be casual users and don't bother with custom instructions or tweaking. These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",
