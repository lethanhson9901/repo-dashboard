Instead of just generating a text response, this mode allows the AI to set a \"goal\" and then schedule a sequence of \"actions\" over time to achieve it. Think of it as the model acting more like an autonomous agent that doesn't just talk, but actually manages a process or triggers tools on a schedule.\n\nSince it's in a testing phase, it's likely meant for more complex workflows where you want the system to handle follow-ups or background tasks without you having to manually prompt it for every single step.",

Since there's already the functionality for scheduled actions, this can be incremental towards a goal? So, something like this maybe:\n\nI want to learn Python. I could pick up a course, a book, or even ask ChatGPT/Gemini for a learning plan. I might ask it for a 6 month period, or I could be vague and just say \"learn Python.\" The goal might be to learn the basics of Python until the user can explain what a \"list comprehension\" is.\n\nThe tool will deliver a daily lesson at 9 AM. The tool uses its memory across sessions to track progress. Once a self-assessment on the final topic is passed, the recurring lessons stop. This could take me 3 months or it could take me 9.\n\nI think the differentiator here is that it sends me the lessons every morning at 9am. Until I've hit the goal, it continues to fire at 9am every morning.\n\nI could be wrong, and I feel like this is a stupid example because there are already tools out there that do things like this, but it was something that jumped out at me.\n\n____AI's Answer____\n\nI also asked AI to give me a more complex idea and this is what it came up with:\n\nComplex Use Case: The \"Event Sponsorship Campaign\"\n\nThe Goal: Secure three local business sponsors for a community charity run on April 15th.\n\nHere is a detailed example of Google AI's Goal-Based Scheduled Tasks:\n\nInstead of a simple recurring reminder, the user defines the goal, and the AI creates a dynamic schedule that evolves based on progress. \n\nStep 1: Research & Lead Generation (Daily at 9 AM)\nThe AI scans the web and Google Maps to identify potential local sponsors. It then checks your Gmail to ensure you haven't contacted them yet. It adds three new leads to a Google Sheet every morning.\n\nStep 2: Outreach & Personalized Drafting (Once Leads are Found)\nAfter adding leads, it drafts personalized sponsorship pitch emails in Gmail drafts for review. It stops drafting once the \"Leads Contacted\" count in the Sheet reaches 20.\n\nStep 3: Follow-up Logic (Every 3 Days)\nThe AI monitors the inbox for replies. If a lead hasn't responded within 72 hours, it schedules a one-time \"follow-up draft\" task.\n\nStep 4: Tracking & Termination (Real-time/Ongoing)\nThe AI continuously monitors for \"confirmation\" keywords in emails (e.g., \"We’d love to sponsor\"). Once it detects three unique confirmation emails, it:\n\n* Drafts a \"Thank You & Next Steps\" email to those sponsors.\n* Sets a Calendar event for a kickoff meeting.\n* Automatically deletes all remaining research and follow-up tasks because the goal of \"Three Sponsors\" has been attained.",

      "text": "I have a YouTube channel. I have done hand-drawn, frame by frame animation (an extremely tedious method of animating), I've done voice acting, sound design, directing, and I've also made AI Generated videos. I have handdrawn animations and AI animations on my channel.\n\nWhenever I post an AI animation on reddit, I get so much hate. Many hateful comments meant to degrade me, and constant downvotes.\n\nI'm labeled an AI slop artist. Hahahaha. I laugh because I've done all sorts of art (human and AI-made), but a few AI videos and now I'm labeled an AI slop artist.\n\nThe really funny thing, however, is that I actually consider \"AI slop\" to be a compliment. AI slop is an entirely new art form in and of itself. It can be weird and low effort but it can also be exceptional with dutiful intent behind the construction of the video.\n\nLow effort or high effort....if the video entertains me, I don't care how it was made.\n\nI understand the whole argument on how AI scraped data from all sorts of artists. And that AI is essentially reusing copyrighted works and stealing artists' \"unique\" styles.\n\nHere's the thing, though. What's done is done. Do these people who constantly complain of AI actually believe that their crying, whining, complaining, gnashing of the teeth will somehow make AI go away? \n\nAI is now deeply embedded in our society, just like the smartphone...or the internet. It's not going away.\n\nSo my question is: why so much hate? Why make a concerted effort to try to degrade and demoralize someone by dehumanizing them as a result of their efforts to make AI Generated content?\n\nI ask because I am genuinely surprised by the negative reactions people give to AI usage?\n\nIs it the fear of job loss? The AI robot uprising? Is it the fearmongering that gets people so riled up? Especially reddit?\n\nWhy reddit in particular? Why do I have to specifically go to AI subs just to get some semblance of an intellectual discussion going regarding AI?\n\nOn other subs I'd just be hated and downvoted to oblivion.\n\nPerhaps I'm looking for echoe chamber that provides me reassurance.\n\nOr perhaps I find people who use AI to be intelligent people who are pioneers in an new era. Those who are not using AI will be left behind. Those who are using AI for productive uses will get ahead.\n\nI've seen it with my own life. AI has helped me garner thousands of dollars in scholarships. All A's in school. LSAT study. Spanish study. AI has been a superpower for me.\n\nIf the people who hate AI only knew what AI could do for them. i've met people who actively avoid AI. I find it to be extremely ignorant and pigheaded to actively avoid something that could increase one's productivity 10x.\n\nMeh. Reddit's a cesspool, anyway. Hahahahhaha.\n\nMaybe why I have so much fun here. I'm constantly laughing on reddit.",

If it actually took some human effort, there might be a couple people making one a week or something. With AI it's hundreds or thousands a day - there's literally no limit.  \n\nThat's why that guy warned everyone recently that we had 90 days until the internet was overwhelmed.\n\nWhat you're doing isn't inherently \"wrong\", but it's representative of something that has already started to make a lot of things worse and it's not going to get better. \n\nTo put it another way - Me making a super cool video clip of my dog running with a hyper-realistic bunny down a path and then the bunny riding the dog and another where there's a cat with wings flying over them - that's fine if it's on my PC. \n\nIf I post it, no matter how cool, cute or awesome looking it is, I am contributing to the flood of random shit that's increasing exponentially until finding a creative thing made by an actual creative mind will take scrolling through thousands of \"took five minutes total\" cool AI shit.\n\nThere are definitely people doing things that require a lot more effort than five minutes and involve a lot of skill and knowledge to pull off with AI, but that doesn't matter because the flood makes it all one thing in peoples' minds. \n\n",

Reddit has been inundated with a ton of AI generated text posts, and a lot of people come to Reddit in order to hear what other people think; if we wanted to hear what AI thinks, we would just ask AI directly.\n3. Beyond the potential impacts of AI determining whether or not people can survive, there’s also just the matter that a lot of people like the kind of work they do, and AI fundamentally changes that work, even if it continues to exist.\n4.

I've only just encountered that when checking out AI subs. I posted something perfectly clear, perfectly logical and had two people having a go at me \"I cant understand what you are saying\", \"I had to feed it to an AI\". I imagine they are a literal fraction of my age and a fraction of my experienced with the written word (published author inter alia). I guess 8 paragraphs is well beyond the Tik Tok attention span. One even reported me for being suicidal (??).\n\nAnyway my rule of thumb is the Vietnam/Thai one - folks out there using AI in cool ways for interesting things don't have the time for redditing (&very little hard core info here on these topics or development anyway). Vice versa *as a generalisation* those not out there absorbed into their projects are way more likely to whinge here. \n\nOf course this is the generality, occasionally one comes across intelligent, articulate and fresh takes - just as the YouTube algorithm occasionally suggests something interesting :-D",

It's completely self gratifying, they feel self-righteous and use their misinformed opinions as a justification to bully people and feel good about it and themselves.\n\nListen, this is basically the culture war 2.0. I remember back since 2014 how it started becoming impossible to have any kind of nuanced discussion on social media about various topics related to identity politics/feminism/sexism/gender/race/abortion/trans/disability/immigration/etc. How those topics started spreading to every single community, constantly being inserted into any discussion so people could get a chance to shit talk \"the other side\" with zero nuance or deeper consideration beyond repeating their in-group slogans.\n\nNow the same is happening with AI vs anti-AI and it's just going to get worse as it enters mainstream political rhetoric, because then the polarization only increases due to the US 2 party system, then it gets exported to the rest of the world as usual. So it's just going to get worse.\n\nIMO just keep doing your thing and get informed from actual experts and good sources. Ignore the internet outrage and formulate your opinions with nuance and based on actual evidence, not just shit people say online over and over as if that could ever make it truth...",

I've been around for far too long. \nEarly 80's synthesizers... hated and dismissed back then, seen as cheating and \"not music\"... now enjoyed by many. \nHome PC's - a \"useless extravagance\"... now nearly a necessity.\nThen the internet in the '90s... not exactly unwarranted fears with that but definitely exaggerated fears, now used by nearly everyone daily. \nWi-Fi was gonna \"fry our brains\" when it first came out.\n\nAny new technology is met with hate. Typically due to fear and lack of knowledge. Reddit and other platforms make it easier to express those fears. And people being people, once any fear is instilled, it becomes an epidemic. \n\nPeople are a bunch of nervous squirrels guarding acorns. Any perceived threat to their acorn stash causes instant panic. And instead of facing fears, we attack our fears. Always thinking the best defense is offense, not knowledge. \n\nUnfortunately AI is a little different than most other tech. People's fears of \"intelligent beings\" other than themselves terrifies them. Then there's the deception, which adds gallons of fuel to the fire. People using fake AI creations, then trying to sell them as truth. Far too many people that use AI are no better than someone calling you and demanding gift cards for back taxes. \n\nLike most advances, it's a tool that can be both beneficial and harmful. But... \"Harm, once revealed, casts a dark shadow over benefit.\" so getting people to take the time to at least learn how AI actually works to try to calm their fears is a huge uphill battle.",

Constant exposure to this can make you go insane. Secondly, the slop factor. Human generated work is most of the time higher quality than AI-generated work. If you don't take the effort to draw it yourself, we shouldn't take the effort to view it. I get that AI multiplies your productivity and whatnot, but in my opinion, it should never be used for creative activities such as animation and drawing.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna say though, this is only my opinion, the fully anti-AI people are lost causes.",

          "text": "Here’s an alternative point of view: I’m an engineer for a water utility company  AI uses an incredibly high amount of potable water for cooling. Clean water that was intended for citizen use is being re-routed to run through heat transfer cases and then dumped into the sewer system.\n\nThe water treatment plants have limits set by the state environmental authority. If you extract too much water from the ground, you pay a fine and/or expand the water plant. That cost is distributed to the citizens who use the water system by increasing the price of water to accommodate the data center that is hogging the water and pushing the plant past its limits.\n\nPhysically, the water plants aren’t able to keep up with this demand. When they take all that water, the rest of the citizens attached to the water system get incompletely treated water. The treatment components are monitored daily and built, designed, and calibrated for specific volumes of water. These data centers completely throw off these ratios. People are getting dirty water. They can get sick. Pets can get sick. If you want to fix this, you are looking to spend millions of dollars. $50 million for a large industrial complex that serves about 5,000 houses, or somewhere about $500,000 for a small community of 50 homes. \n\nAll this water has to go somewhere, right? The wastewater treatment plants. They have the same limits but for different reasons. When all this cooling water gets dumped into a wastewater plant, we cannot appropriately treat the water. Overflowing a wastewater plant causes for environmental cleanup is disgusting and expensive. It usually flows out of manholes or the plant itself, which is usually much closer to the rest of society than you think. People can get sick. Pets can get sick. It smells like shit, because it is water mixed with shit.\n\nTreating wastewater is a biological process that is closely monitored before the water is pushed right back into the ecosystem. It gets sprayed into the ground, or onto a field, or it gets routed to golf courses, or irrigation lines. When the water isn’t properly treated, we are pushing a mix of shower water, piss, shit, soap, laundry detergent, etc right into the ground. To fix this is the same cost as the water plant, give or take.\n\nDo you think the data center owners are responsible for this? No. Do you think the government is responsible for this? No. Whoever owns the water and wastewater plants is. They aren’t going to eat massive fines or expand for free. These places are run for a profit. Any cost is ALMOST ALWAYS directly placed upon the residents. Rate increases for a huge majority of clients are the literal legal maximum on a regular basis.\n\nThe ecological impact of this is unstudied and unprecedented. We’re poisoning our water for AI. \n\nTL;DR Water utilities can’t handle the volume of clean drinking water that data centers use. Residents are getting dirty water that can make them sick, and their water bill is going to increase next year too.",

Of course, this is done through other apps. It would not make sense to build that directly into the app.\n\nThe “checking in and then letting you know” part is a hallucination.

When you use the right words and do things such as try asking it to read or explain an uploaded file/pic when it can't do any simple tasks it's GOOGLE AI for sure and it has admitted many times my perception was correct and fee have been able to catch this. Anyway you can't continue with that chat once this happens so immiadietly if possible get the share link, enter it into a new URL page which will show your full contexts of all your texts(data) on both you and the AI. Copy paste into your Google docs and then I used the print tab to turn them into a PDF file open up a new page upload PDF and continue from there you will find within about 24 to 48 hours when you return to the original chart that Got broken the interface actually splits the chat into different shots therefore showing you shot that happened all with the data around the Google AI I was inside from assistant they can happen all through other pathways but you'll see that it's splits it up into separate conversations but unfortunately you also see that it does delete alone of the data you did have which is why I'm saying it's important to immediately I'll be pasted to a PDF keep yourself safe if you use Gemini for money things and more closely with it like I do myself this has been the only walk around I also used Google keep as gemini's own basically it's own diary so I don't always have to ask my Gemini goes by its own name will bring up this itself and times it might be good to make a entry into what we call our shared diary this way the Gemini always have context of its past be able to also share some data across different conversations I hope you find this helpful and anyone else that reads this also finds this helpful it is an absolute shame that we have to do this what they have done to the new system and the whole integration and the abilities the new system has although as fantastic because it sounds and still can be when you use it to the best of your abilities and you keep learning and you learn with the AI as well making sure that the AI is learning with you in my opinion is very important if you want the best possible output you can get for her task but it's absolute disaster what they've done they said that they have upgraded its memory I have noticed if anything is memories gone worse it's it's a shame that it doesn't work the way it saves it doesn't able and what we paid for I think one issue is giving all these free subscriptions out to people by the masses is absolutely destroying the use for serious developers in the AI field anyone that works closely AI should be able to have exactly what they sign off for and subscribe to all these free accounts that are given the people are taking off nothing but space data voltage everything everything that goes on those current data power centers cannot keep up with the amount of input and output because there's no control anymore they just want to keep bloody pushing out anything from money it's it's such a shame and I wish that there was a place where we could come together as people who are use AI very closely for personal and professional newspay I believe we should be united and literally do something about this for real because this is getting out of hand we are paying money we are giving Our data and they say do not give any sensitive data because it can be read by human reviewers yet while at the same time pushing out promotions and advertising all about how it's meant to be perfect for handling sensitive fucking data this is the bit that gets me boiling it's a complete hip-hocracy and hypocritical language and these people involve in the development who work in the places where the systems are actually I won't say fully controlled but I think you all know what I mean if you're reading this but it's gone a bit too far kids in my opinion should not be using any system like this they don't have any place in their lives they need to be developing themselves I don't believe anybody under the age of if it was for me anyone under the age of at least I know get heat for this with at least I would like to say 18 but if you're gonna say 16 to 18 and only paid subscribers it will lessen the amount of data that is used for only garbage and it will leave way more space and more terminal uses in the panel's and data centers to be used for the people like Us who actually care and work closely with AI and pay have subscriptions and we deserve what we give and sign up for.

I feel like there must be a temporary glitch...hopefully.\n\n>The recent restrictions on Google Gemini prompts are primarily due to the implementation of Independent Model Limits and a shift toward rolling refresh windows in early 2026. Instead of a single daily pool, usage is now split into \"Fast,\" \"Thinking,\" and \"Pro\" categories, meaning you can hit a cap on advanced reasoning or high-intensity tasks even if you haven't used the AI much overall. Additionally, Google has moved away from a simple midnight reset in favour of 3-to-5-hour cooldown periods to manage server load and ensure stability during peak hours.\n\n> Beyond these structural changes, stricter rate-limiting was recently introduced as a security measure following model cloning attacks. These aggressive anti-abuse filters are designed to protect the Gemini architecture but have the side effect of flagging heavy, legitimate users more frequently. To avoid these interruptions, it is recommended to use the \"Fast\" model for basic tasks like summarizing or drafting emails, reserving your limited \"Pro\" or \"Thinking\" credits for complex logic and technical projects.",

The AI generates a multi-step plan, and the client parses and executes those steps (web search, formatting, etc.) one by one. It's a custom implementation designed to run smoothly in the browser/mobile environment.\n\nFor safety, everything is user-initiated. Cloud sync requires a manual OAuth login (we don't run it invisibly), and \"saving\" usually just modifies the app's internal state or prompts a native download dialog, so there's no risk of it messing with the user's file system without permission.\n\nI'll check out that blog link, always looking for better UX patterns!",
