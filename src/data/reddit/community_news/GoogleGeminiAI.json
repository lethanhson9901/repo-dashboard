If your data just disappears on the internet either its purposeful, or something real bad just happened behind the scenes. \nGenerally data that just disappears especially when its handled by google, will come back, the redundancy of the hardware and software server side is a pretty major thing and its actually rare data is really lost. Take for instance Google photos ever had something just go missing? \nAnyhow point is. Your data should be accessible again. \nIf anything they are doing some backend work preparing for the release of Gemini 3.1 which should be occurring on the webUI next couple of days I imagine. ",

So one day the accountant calls me to help him with his computer, cause \"it's not working\". Not knowing what could that mean, I say ok and go there. The problem was that every time he made some kind of mistake on Excel, he clicked on \"save\". \"but it doesn't save me from anything, the error is still there. Luckily I check everything with this\", he says, confidently pointing at a pocket calculator, with the proud expression of someone who is too expert of the things of life to be fooled by a strange machine's tricks.\n\n\nI couldn't believe my ears. You can just imagine how noisy my facepalm was.\n\n\nAfter explaining him what \"save\" means, I told him that, since he's constantly checking the work of a bigger calculator using a smaller one, maybe he would save time just printing the sheets he has to fill and doing the sums manually, on another paper, with a pencil. Also, pencils don't use power, and would be a better and faster tool for the job. Investing in a solar powered calculator would allow him another cut on expenses; the investment would repay itself when he won't buy batteries anymore.\n\n\nHis expression changed a bit.",

I've never experienced a failure of this magnitude with other Google products like Gmail, even though I've been a daily user for years.\n\nI feel like they should be taking this more seriously. Personally, I haven't touched (and won't touch) my Gemini until they fix it. I'm willfully redirecting my queries to other (admittedly inferior) AI chat products. If everyone who is affected does the same, and they see usage of regular users fall off a cliff, I have a feeling this will get solved faster.\n\nEDIT:  \nAs of 10:45 ET (Feb 22) my chats and pinned chats have suddenly reappeared.

The other day I was trying to create some UI background tiles, since they all required to be in a specific theme, and for the life of me, I couldn't. They all looked so bad.\n\nLooking at the work people do with this stuff, I've come to believe the problem is most likely me, and I have no idea how to use it. I try my best to prompt it well. \n\n\\- Feed it context  \n\\- Attach references  \n\\- Even prepare it beforehand and ask it to ask me any questions before we start.\n\nStill, I end up getting terrible responses.\n\nSo what gives?
