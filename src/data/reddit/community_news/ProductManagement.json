If it's too much, or too much of a blocker -- move on to another company with a different flavor of dysfunction.   But there is no magical company that doesn't have any.     \n  \nI have used this in interviews with companies i'm talking to --  i literally ask this question: \"every company has some dysfunctionally - what is the flavor here?\", when you ask various folks from same company it can be fascinating to hear the variety and/or consistency of answers.",

The first thing I've noticed as a night and day difference is that I need to plan way ahead, with a much more broader picture in mind than as a delivery manager. The first time I saw the offering development cycles I honestly got overwhelmed, because my default is to solve everything at once and asap. What strategy would you recommend to get over that, what is a healthy and effective mindset for a PM, what would you say I should research or do to avoid mistakes, what common traps should I expect and what did you do to avoid these? Also, any tips and tricks from your experience would be great.",

By that I mean learn about how the product is used, what problems it solves, why it is priced the way it is, how successful it is and with whom, what the macro and micro environment is i.e political, environmental, regulatory, usage data, sales data. Literally anything and everything. The more you know, the more right you'll be when you have an idea. BUT, just because you have a good idea, doesn't mean it will work so you need to be a master of tearing your ideas to shreds and validating it as best as you can, by speaking to customers, stakeholders, sales people, engineers, users etc. Engineers are critical because they'll tell you if it's even possible and affordable to build. Once you've done all that, you'll have the best possible arguments and you'll have confidence.",

Independence/Leadership -- Staff/Principal level can run the ship and guide all decisions pretty independently -- the best ones don't act this way necessarily, but if there was no VP, CPO, or CEO -- the staff/principal would keep on trucking, making the tough calls, tradeoffs, and taking the hit when it doesn't work, re-chart new course, etc.   A lot of this stems from the foundation of #1.\n3. Presence -- the combination of #1 and #2 create a strong personality inside the company.  If there is ever a question about anything related to the product space -- this person's name should first on everyone's tongue.  So act like a leader, act like a Staff before you get promoted, establish the relationships, establish your expertise while still being 100% collaborative and authentically interested in other peoples ideas and contributions.\n\nIf this all sounds nutty -- yep that's PM -- being the strong expert independent leader while also authentically including everyone else.

So it's difficult to say what one should be doing over another in any particular company because they are all different. The one thing I will say though, is that Product Managers are very very rarely responsible and accountable for the success of an actual product, despite the name. Usually it's the Head of Product who claims responsibility. In my view, someone should own a product when they are the most knowledgeable person to take active responsibility for a product's success. Sometimes products are the whole company. So, to me, the title \"Product Manager\" should mean exactly that, but the corporate world broke this.",

Some metrics are not in the purview so the hypothesis needs to be created in order to discover it. \n\nEssentially I see data as glowing lines illuminated from an idea you have about what's going on.

I've done product management for 10+ years now across many industries, built many product 0>1 and I often feel like I want to get out of the field altogether. Every manager or company I've worked at/with has a different definition of what \"good\" product management actually is. I wrote about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does\\_anyone\\_think\\_that\\_the\\_expectations\\_for\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does_anyone_think_that_the_expectations_for_what/)\n\nWhat would be your mental model for determining whether someone (1) is good at product, but just not in the right company/industry; or (2) needs to move to a different function entirely? And how do you handle the fact that often, your job satisfaction as a PM relies quite heavily on the environment you're in?",

How do they add the most value?  (even ask folks for input) Then figure out how to excel at it.   A mentor can help, but not required.

Not good though.\n\nSo all we hear is: AI is going to create a new utopia and everyone needs to come on the journey or be left behind.\n\nWhilst I agree that everyone needs to learn AI, I don't believe it will save their jobs. It's specifically designed as a cognitive and administrative replacement. All jobs will be impacted eventually.\n\nThe question is, how much of the \"middle\" ground can the economy tolerate before we reach this utopia. I'm very negative about this. I see a middle ground where most roles gradually diminish in numbers. Not completely go away, but just go down. I mean, if it drops by only 10% we've got an economic crisis with indebted governments.\n\nSo, I think the redundancies will work up the experience chain until the most experienced are left running the show, doing more with less human support. As a consultant I'm already seeing this in real-time.\n\nOr, AI will be unsafe and unsecure and an event forces a pause. In which case, business as usual :)",

The type 1 startup I just joined is a night and day difference in all aspects, but I am having so much fun and loving it so far. Both companies were great but I think type 1 is where it’s at if you can find the right fit and growth stage and have the energy for it. You can always retire at a type 2 company.

My only framework has been my experience that I use to handle differing scenarios.\n\nFrameworks are good for things that are truly difficult to do without. How many of those can you name?

I know the answer, but my brain just skips right past the answer as it's \"common sense\" or \"they wouldn't ask this basic of a question\" , i give an answer later to find it's not what they were asking and I knew the answer they were looking for I just didn't say it out loud as it was too basic\n\n\nLike I'm have trained myself for speed and efficiency, as in dodging basic stuff to get to the core...\n\nHow do I unlearn this or rather how do I learn the basic stuff?

I didn't know anything about Marketing so I did a Masters in digital marketing. From there I was able to get into owning digital propositions which eventually led to product management, which I then did for 17 years. Each role I was in I was looking at how my skills could transfer to something else. Every move had a logical connection, but the key was moving and taking risks",

We would teach them, check their understanding and then a week or two later they would fall back into their original habit. There were 3 things at play here. The first was memory. We needed to ensure we were champions everyday and checking everyone remembered to do what they were supposed to. The second was gaps. When someone learns something and then goes back to their original work they sometimes encounter an edge case. They don't yet know how that edge case is solved in the new system and rather than check, they just do what they know using the old system. The third was command. If the leadership didn't understand fully or buy into it well enough they wouldn't hold their staff to account. We needed to ensure the management were mandating the new process otherwise people just do what they want.\nSounds like you're doing your best with 1 and 2, so maybe see if you can influence leadership to get some bossing",

You must have some element that is transferrable to another business of a similar type. \n\nIn terms of building domain knowledge, I don't think it's really possible to do it fully in the business sense because a lot of it will be about how they operate internally. But I have managed to go into a domain where I had no experience but I did have a personal interest. For example I love cars (My Dad was a car salesman) and I love mountain biking, and I ended up working for the first online car sales company and the largest cycle retailer.

This often means talking to engineers (feasibility) and and customers (desirability) to see if it's something that CAN be built and SHOULD be built. I then craft the findings into a playback so that the risks or opportunities can be understood. If you think it's a bad idea you want to play back the evidence to cover your ass. If the validation proves it's a good idea, then fine, it's just about how you break it down to delivery.

When you learn to play golf, you put your ball on the tee, aim down the fairway (basically anywhere where there's smooth grass) and thwack. The problem is, your aim is as wide as the fairway is and more often than not it goes 10% out to the left or right and ends in the rough. The trick is to very specifically aim at the flag. Nowhere else, just the flag (or similar tiny spot). That helps you focus your target area down and you're more likely to hit it.\nAnyways, when I apply this to somewhere I want to get to I look for the flag. In a Product sense, to me this is the Product itself. If I became an expert in the product and its experience, either by researching it or getting as much exposure as I could, then I'll already be talking the talk. It's no guarantee, and researching the iPhone isn't going to get you a job at Apple. But you'd be surprised how many people apply for jobs but provide absolutely no connection to the product at all. It's a standout thing to me. Shows passion too.\nOn the AI question, it's going to reduce the number of product roles I think. I don't believe there will be more jobs because more companies would just make business too competitive.\nAll you can do is your best. I wish you the best of luck. We all need it",

      "text": "I see a lot of advice on how to prep ahead of a meeting, but not a lot of discussion on how to recover when the meeting inevitably doesn't go as planned.\n\nThe moment when you’re in the room, and...\n\nAn exec cuts you off with a dumb in the weeds unrelated question.  \nTwo stakeholders start debating each other.  \nSomeone says the timeline is impossible.  \nSuddenly, you’re managing people, not presenting.\n\nI've learned that trying to argue or defend myself usually ended badly, so here's how I adopted my strategy over time. Let me know if you have anything to add or disagree with.\n\n1. Pause the conversation. Get people to shut up and regain control for just a second.\n\nI use something like:\n\n“Hold on, let’s pause for a second.”  \n“I want to make sure I’m understanding the concern.”\n\n  \n2. I try to function like a PM and actually define the problem publicly\n\nI don't defend anything or try to explain, I just try to name the concern.\n\nSomething like:  \n  \n\"So to confirm, it sounds like the concern is related to delivery risk more than strategy risk, is that correct?\"\n\nIf it's not, I let them clarify and then try to repeat back by further defining it. Often, the most heated moments are messy because nobody’s named the problem cleanly. Once it’s stated in a sentence, the energy usually drops a notch. People relax when they feel heard.\n\n  \n3. I try to steer the conversation back in a product direction.\n\ne.g. if you say, \"thoughts?\", a meeting with fall apart.   \n  \nInstead, now that I've named the problem, I say somethin glike: \"ok, let's stay on the delivery risk for a moment.\"  \n  \n My goal here is to regain control and point the group in 1 constructive direction. People can still disagree, but at least it's within the confines of the topic (e.g. delivery risk) instead of all over the place.\n\n4. Lastly, it's on me as the PM to land the plane  \nAt some point, as the meeting get's closer to the close, I'll say:\n\n\"Here are the options I see...\"\n\nI'll then walk through options as presented in the meeting (intentionally giving credit to any stakeholders that brought them up. (e.g. As steve mentioned...\"XYZ path\"). This helps them feel like they contributed to the successful alignment.\n\nThen I'll make a hard recommendation:  \n\"Given the constraints, this is what I recommend\"\n\nAnd stop talking.\n\nThe silence feels long. Let it be long. That pause forces decisions. If you rush to fill it, the meeting drifts again.\n\nThis is the hardest part, but it works.\n\n  \nThese are usually the meetings where people have come back to me later and said that they were \"well run\"\n\nI'd love to hear you approach and if you'd add or take anything away from this.\n\n\n\n",

The more I read and The more I've experience it seems like you need to really have everybody on board before the actual alignment meeting happens. There may be many steps to getting there and it might require several different cycles of shifting governance, but this is the way to do it. Everyone should already be on board and essentially the meeting is a rubber stamp. Really seasoned product managers but also engagement managers have found ways to Ace this process. Everyone might not truly be aligned in the presessions since you can't have everybody together at the same time but you certainly have already captured all the concerns and at that point you are just triangulating and bringing the recommendation based on all the concerns. ",

Then link the discussion to the business goal. If an executive has created this ruckus they will be put on the backfoot immediately. The benefit of bringing/highlighting business objective is that everyone can start to visualize the outcome. If you are dealing with smart people with no ego then that would be the end of the discussion. They will either agree with you and let you continue or bring something that you may have missed.

What has helped me get promoted on multiple teams is communicating that I want to be promoted and building a plan together with my manager.  Then, I frequently report my progress. Typically I have this conversation about a year out. During the year I am aiming to get promoted, I make the items on this plan my top priorities. This helps with “doing less” to get promoted. Know your organization’s promotion cycles so you can plan well ahead. \n\nAlso, you mentioned visibility. This is a huge factor for promotions in large organizations. Take every opportunity to show off your work, especially to people outside of your team. \n\nLastly, ask around to better understand the promotion process in your organization. Ask what your colleagues did to earn their promotions. You are making some assumptions about what they are doing, but go ask them! Also tell them that you want to be promoted. It never hurts to have advocates!",

          "text": "Here are the tactical moves to make. They're simple, but not easy.\n\n1. Stop being the safety net for everything and replace your \"yes\" with tradeoffs\n\nStop saying yes to random stuff. If it's not helping build your narrative or drive impact, so no with tradeoff framing.\n\nInstead of “I’ll try to fit it in,” you say,  \n“If we take this on, which initiative should slow down?”\n\nWrite down the last 10 things you handled. Circle the ones that could have been owned by someone else with clear expectations. Delegate them! The next time someone asks for something, respond with a priority tradeoff question instead of an automatic yes.\n\n  \n2. Pick the 2 highest visibility/leverage bets and let the rest be average\n\nYou can't be amazing at 10 things. Narrow your focus and drop, delegate, put in maintenance, the non visibile non high impact work.\n\nTry picking the 2 projects that would matter most in your next promo packet. Ask yourself honestly if your calendar reflects that priority. If not, fix the calendar.\n\n  \n3. Stop doing invisible work  \nA PM is basically invisible to leadership. 90% of what you do is with xfn teams that have no say in your promo. YOU have to drive your promo narrative.  \n\n\nDo this: once a week communicate at least 1 win to your boss (framed in terms of business outcomes)\n\n  \n4. Start declining meetings.   \nDo an audit and ask if this is helping or hurting your narrative and then start exiting them. \n\n\n\n5. Turn your narrative into sponsorship.\n\nPromotions are sponsor-driven. After you build the narrative, you have to deliberately align leaders around it ahead of the cycle. Most PMs skip this and hope impact speaks for itself. It doesn’t.\n\nThe mechanics of how to build sponsors and prep them is a bigger topic than fits in a comment. Happy to explain the mechanics if anyone wants it, just DM.  \n\n\n",

My flaw was trying to be a perfectionist. \n\nYou need to learn the art of delegation. You also need to determine how best to prioritize and to focus your efforts so you deliver the meaningful contributions. Don't manage tasks, manage the broader strategy and showcase the strategic efforts. This is important - you have to learn how to tell your story. Not the details and granular info but the strategic story of impact.\n\nOften PMs have cross functional teams - be sure to leverage their expertise and delegate to them. There are tools you can find online - frameworks- that help you tactically work on delegating so you build that muscle strength.\n\nI had a boss recommend this book (what got you here won't get you there). It was so important for me to realize that being a good worker did not mean being a good leader.\n\nI enjoy coaching so let me know if you have any questions.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/0cGyhQ6D",

They get handed one or two initiatives that are already framed as company priorities and have exec attention. If it goes well, it is automatically visible and it maps cleanly to a promo story. From the outside it looks like deliberate restraint and strategy. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is just better positioning.\n\nIf you are not getting those opportunities, you compensate. You say yes to more things, you cover more surface area, you deliver in multiple less highlighted areas so your value is undeniable. That can be real impact, but it also brands you as the reliable workhorse who keeps everything moving. Promotions tend to go to the person who is seen as driving direction, not the person who is seen as catching everything.\n\nSo when someone says “work smarter, not harder,” what they usually mean in practice is “make sure your impact is tied to a top priority and is obvious to the people who decide promos.” If your wins are spread across a bunch of smaller lanes, you can end up doing more and getting less credit.",

That's basically it. Saying no was their default. Not in a dick way but \"let me check priorities\" then come back with \"can't take this right now but maybe Q3.\" Made it look like resource constraint not laziness.\n\nThey picked maybe 2-3 big things per quarter max. Everything else they found ways to dump or let die. The big things were stuff execs actually cared about not just stuff that needed doing.\n\nThey made sure execs heard about wins directly. Quick slack updates, casual mentions in meetings, asking for exec input. Not brown nosing just making sure the right people knew what they owned.\n\nStopped being in every meeting. Way more selective. Sent updates async instead of showing up. Only went when it actually mattered.\n\nHere's what hurts people like you:\n\nBeing everywhere makes you look like a coordinator not a strategist. Saying yes to everything signals you can't prioritize. Doing good work nobody upstream sees doesn't help you at all.\n\nYour reputation will take a hit when you start saying no. Some people will think you're slacking. But the people who matter for your promo won't if you do it right.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nBe explicit about priorities. \"I'm focused on X and Y because leadership flagged them. Happy to help with Z after those ship.\" Now you're strategic not lazy.\n\nDrop anything execs don't care about. Drop meetings where you're not deciding anything. Stop being the person who answers every Slack question instantly.\n\nDouble down on things with exec visibility and clear numbers. Cost savings with dollar amounts. Revenue. User growth. Vague \"launched initiative\" doesn't cut it.\n\nReal example from banking - two PMs, similar projects. PM A in every meeting, helped everyone with everything, shipped fine. PM B way more selective, made sure CTO knew every blocker they removed.\n\nPM B got promoted. PM A got told they needed more strategic thinking.\n\nThat sucks but it's reality. Being everywhere makes you look necessary but not promotable. Being selective makes you look ready for next level even if you're doing less.\n\nYou'll feel like you're slacking at first. But if you make the right 2-3 things visible to the right people you'll be way better positioned than drowning in everything.\n\nLast thing - PM who does everything can't be promoted because if they leave everything breaks. You're too valuable where you are. That's the trap.",

It is reasonable for a product manager to be a generalist but unrealistic to ask of them to take over the roles that requires a specialist.\n\n2.

Block off time on your calendar in which you cannot be scheduled or interrupted to get your work done, and if you get requests for meetings that will not measurably contribute to your job or the project, ask to schedule later, or ask if you can get an email summary or agenda prior to scheduling a meeting.  If its a useless meeting, chances are the person requesting it will not even be able to do either one, or at the very least this will push it out for you.  \n\n(3) Stop being reactionary where you feel the pain alone.  If someone schedules something last minute, use the \"if-then\" acceptance, which sounds like, *\"I can take that meeting, if I can slide a 1/2 day on X deliverable.\"* Or, *\"I can do that research for you, but I will need to push off this project delivery to X date.\"*",

Figuring out what you want is the half of the journey - it also changes with you along the way. \n\nOne rule is never to stop improving yourself, rest you will figure out in time.

It's nothing personal, mind you, it's just different standards which apply to \"make something that looks like this\" vs. \"if this fails partway through treatment someone might be severely injured or worse\". \n\nWe just don't have a high confidence level in the generative coding to leave even snippets in our finished products without it being completely rewritten by pro devs. \n\n*But the time savings and gap between design document and finished product* my word, it really helps close the gap.",

My friends have found this helpful because it is structured and repeatable.  \n\nHappy to share an invite if anyone is interested.  I could be benefit from an outsiders perspective as well. ",

          "text": "Communication = Alignment. It goes both ways \n\nUntil it comes more naturally, it might be helpful to write down your talking points. It sounds pretty basic but you need to be really clear to identify what are your goals that you plan to communicate. That usually comes in the form of thoughtful planning, supporting data and ultimately a talk track. Take some time to write down your core goal and work backwards how you can get there - AI can help get you started or unstuck here. This is the same for nearly all kinds of communication. \n\nNow it gets different depending on who your audience is:\nThe number 1 communication skill I’ve learned is knowing your audience. Who are they, what do they care about and how you can add value. Sometimes your message is inspirational, strategy based (resource/output management) or performance (KPI, engagement or financial). Don’t be afraid to ask what they think is important or what their goals are. \n\nThe life hack here is to strategically meet with each of your stakeholders 1-1 before your group meeting. Ask them what their needs are, hesitations with your plan. Share your ideas on how everyone could win. Hear them out. Get their feedback solo, and then you have time to message based on everyone’s core input. \n\nAlso…Many times, a PM is a moderator. State the goal of your communication- hold that as a North Star if someone derails. There was a great post here recently on how to manage moderation while you’re trying to communicate. I’ll look up the post and post a reply.",

I discovered I say \"um\" way more than I thought and bury my main point 3 minutes in.\n\ncoming from QA/BA/dev you probably already have the technical vocabulary. the PM shift is more about adapting your style to different audiences - engineers want different info than execs want different info than customers.\n\nwhat specific situations are tripping you up? async vs sync? presentations vs 1:1s? stakeholder updates?",

After the layoffs, the market is flooded with experienced PMs, so firms can buy impact immediately instead of training from scratch. When that happens, junior seats get squeezed first. That’s basic supply and demand.\n\nAI isn’t the root cause, but it’s speeding things up. Teams are running leaner, expectations are higher, and there’s less patience for long ramp times.\n\nAnd this isn’t just a junior PM thing. It’s the whole market. Companies want people who already proved outcomes in the exact area they’re hiring for. Junior PMs just feel it harder because they have less history to point to.

A small team where the founder has a strong business vision used to hire one or two PMs just to do all the grunt work.  That is no longer happening.  PM first hire seems to be getting later than before AI.\n\n2) Larger companies are still hiring PMs and if anything they have MORE PM roles.  It used to be common to be up to 20-1 (20 Eng to each PM).  That is changing.  Engineering teams are getting smaller and PM teams are remaining the same size or growing.  \n\n3) Teams becoming more tightly integrated.  The old hard break between PM and eng is starting to fade a bit.  Not everywhere, but we are seeing teams that have both PM and eng reporting to the same leader.  Same with design.  This isn't necessarily a direct result of AI, but it becomes more reasonable as feature teams get smaller.\n\n  \nShort answer:  PM doesn't seem to be going anywhere but the overall structure of the product team is changing.  \n\n",

Currently a Senior PM in a startup, with limited short-term salary growth and a very high-pressure environment. Planning to have my first child this or next year, but unsure about pausing my career now and the long-term consequences.\nMy current contract offers 4 months of paid parental leave and I am the main income provider at home. However, all women in my current company were let go after returning from maternity leave (around 6–7 months later), which gives me very low confidence about my future there.\nI have the option to try to land a better job first, earn more to save, but potentially lose the paid parental leave depending on the contract, or take the opportunity now and use the rights I currently have. I also feel that taking the leave after more time in the company might make me less vulnerable to a future layoff, so starting over in a new company also feels risky.\nAny advice from PM mothers? There are so many complexities in becoming a mom while trying to stay valued, financially safe, and mentally healthy, anything would help!",

If every woman at your company who took maternity leave ended up being let go 6 to 7 months later, that’s NOT a coincidence. That’s your company's BAD culture expressing itself.\n\nThere’s an old saying that \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\". Companies are the same. You don’t have to assign intent or argue whether it’s fair. You just look at repeated behavior and treat it as data.\n\nFrom a pure career risk standpoint, staying somewhere that has already shown how it handles returning mothers seems like a bigger gamble than starting fresh somewhere that hasn’t. At least in a new company, you’re evaluating a clean slate instead of walking into a pattern that already exists. That being said, the job market is tough, so this isn't an easy decision either way.\n\nI can’t speak to the emotional side of becoming a mother while managing a career. But from an organizational perspective, I’d treat this less as a motherhood timing question and more as a company quality question. The environment you’re in has already told you how they will likely respond... and that sucks... and I'm sorry.",

If that is a pattern and it happens to you — have a paper trail that shows you were not let go for cause, an employment attorney can help you navigate getting better terms from a severance package. If it’s a pattern, it’s an even better case.

But I’d only apply to and accept offers from companies where the work-life balance is good and maternity leave policy is better (or at least as good) than the one you’re in right now. If you can’t find a more secure and flexible job before getting pregnant, you’ll just continue in your current company and take the 4 months while still continuing the job search. \n\n(Not sure how you can ask about the  policies during the interview process without raising red flags though… Maybe start with general life-work balance questions and maybe try using Google/Reddit/LinkedIn to dig up additional info?) \n\nThe first few years with a new baby is going to be pretty crazy. Unless you have a very good support system and can be somewhat hands-off parent, you just won’t have the physical and mental energy to pull off good work in high-pressure environments at the same time. And this should be completely fine. We work jobs for 40-50 years, why should we feel bad if few of those years are going to be a little “slower” or “less productive” so we can raise those cute tiny people well.",

As per the framework, the team is the \"guide\" and the user/customer the hero. Therefore, you need to extend the framework by \"what is the personal reward for the guide?\" aspect. \n\nAlso: Get kids :-). You become an amazing storyteller if you try an \"opt-in\" approach with activities; the huge benefit: difficulty scales automatically. It is simple to get a 3 year old to be excited, however the final boss is a 14 year person who is slightly addicted to social media with a raging hormonal imbalance.... Also, you can rent kids from family members for free or even better: they might pay you for your service. You are welcome.\n\n",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

I still own the decisions and narrative, but it helps me get to a solid first draft way faster.\n\nSometimes I’ll use it to draft Jira/Linear tickets so they’re actually readable and not missing context.\n\nOn the coding side, it’s very light touch — mostly to understand unfamiliar code or help with small, low-risk refactors. No big architectural decisions or “ship this for me.”\n\nBiggest win for me isn’t speed, it’s clarity.

Claude Code CLI makes this seamless, without any copy paste, if you want it can read from web, sharepoint, confluence, your PC... write to Jira, using a template created automatically. It can read codebase of your product, without you reading a line of code, and answer questions about features as detailed as you want. It can find bad user experience or usability issues, just from reading frontend and backend code.\nIt is literally a PM's magic wand.

I think of it as “soloware” and some of it has broader team potential (I’m a senior product leader) and some may have product future potential. That’s not my goal and I’m not building production grade software (yet) because we have incredible engineers. But they do help me think through distribution and access for some of my higher value solo projects. \n\nSo far I’ve built probably 100 small tools and use maybe 5-10 regularly and 2-3 have potential for my team. I build new ones or iterate on them daily. \n\nExamples of small tools I get a lot of mileage out of are roadmap visualizers that connect to my issue trackers, calculators for specific pricing I do, PRD generators in my preferred format and linked to my documentation tool (this is broadly accessed by my PM team), and I’m getting really into building interactive slide decks. Just for some ideas! Hope that helps.",

Our packaged offering includes:\n\n\\- Data warehouse\n\n\\- Data administration application\n\n\\- Reporting tool\n\nThe company’s strategic direction is to move analytical workloads and customer reporting off the warehouse and instead bet on a Lakehouse offering (Amazon S3 Tables (Iceberg) + Athena to be precise). In this new model, there would be no traditional data warehouse - all analytical data would live on S3 tables and be queried directly.\n\nCustomer use cases today:\n\n\\- Customers ingest data from multiple sources into the platform\n\n\\- We provide out-of-the-box data products (enriched tables, views, dashboards, etc.)\n\n\\- Customers can build their own transformations, reports, and dashboards on top of this delivered content\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this shift primarily through a product lens, not just an infrastructure or cost lens.\n\nFor PMs who’ve been involved in similar transitions:\n\n\\- Have you built or owned a data platform without a traditional data warehouse?\n\n\\- What worked well, and what didn’t?\n\n\\- Where did this show up for customers (performance, flexibility, trust, usability)?\n\n\\- Any things PMs tend to underestimate in “warehouse-less” architectures?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences and lessons learned from a Product perspective.",

Hosted in our cloud or theirs (hyper scalers) which made all of this so much fun. \n\nFor the customers we hosted in our cloud (AWS)\n\nI started with a data warehouse. We had several sources (relational and non relational DBs, runtime resources logs, server logs, etc) for a complex solution that was generating up to 1 TB of data from the largest customer and it needed proper ETL pipelines to give us all the Parquet format files in S3 and queried internally using Athena at the start. \n\nI had up to 2k customers. Think of every bank in the world, health providers, governments, logistics and even defence companies. They all used our previous solution (client server self hosted) and had developed a myriad of dashboards tailored to their business. \n\nI had pressure from my stakeholders to provide dashboards for customers to view their data but I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to find a one size fits all solution and I didn’t want to be a PowerBI PM. My approach was to prioritize solutions to give customers access to data via APIs so they could all do what they want. I eventually added UIs to manage the data they had in our cloud (set retention periods, create archives, etc)\n\nCustomers were fine with this approach. I had to put some effort on defining rules to manage costs. External data transfers of the volumes we run are expensive so I had to put cooldowns on some of the endpoints. \n\nAt this stage I’m working on a solution to stream/share some of the operational data we get in AWS for monitoring customer runtime resources health, status, etc We use this internally just for a health dashboard but customers need this too (we already have a UI they can check but they want real time data to be consumed by applications they developed to track and alert)\n\nMy advice. Have a warehouse, build customer facing dashboards only if you know they’ll be usable for all and keep customisation to a minimum or you’ll be building a BI platform. Implement and enforce retention periods to manage costs (if the volumes will make even S3 a burden). Consider giving access to customers via APIs for specific use cases. ",

          "text": "To answer 1:\nI was a data engineer when I built a data lake (Cloudera directly on HDFS with Hive as DB engine to load these parquets/avro files as external tables). At some point I migrated them to Azure HDInsight (ugh, top-down decision bc of “networking”).\n\nAs a PM I have managed a few “data warehouse” like redshift.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts on it, but keep it mind that I wasn’t a PM during data lake period.\n\n2. For data lake, as you might have already know, it “can” be cheaper, and powerful as in you can make decisions on low level things. This is a double edge sword because it’s shifting the cost from infrastructure to operation/maintenance.\n\nFor an instance, schema evolution can be quite complicated. Altering a table shape involves modifying the data files which is a very expensive operation. It might as well be creating a new external table. This is very different from redshift where the DB engine manages these things for you. Modern tool like Iceberg solves this issue, but it means it’s another tool and complexity you need to deal with.\n\nAnother example, you get to decide a storage format specifically optimized for  your own use case. Like parquet vs avro for an example. Redshift does have its own read optimization which most of the time probably is more efficient. But for some specific cases parquet can be more efficient.\n\nThere are some other advantages for data-lake for its file-based storage like, exporting is a lot easier since the file format is universally accepted and can be directly sent, while redshift requires you to query and export.\n\nIf I want to summarize into one thing, it would be the cost advantage as long as you are aware that the cost is shifted to operations & maintenance, not magically disappeared.\n\nAnd operations and maintenance is something you can control based on how much you want to optimize the performance and efficiency. Which leads to your next question.\n\n3. Where did this show up for customers:\nPerformance, can be as good or better in niche cases, based on how much effort your team put to optimize these. (Again, cost)\n\nFlexibility, depends on what you meant by this, like can your customers easily modify a table? Not as easy as redshift (but, should they even?). To ingest the data? Probably easier and more flexible as I mentioned above.\n\nTrust, the governance will be more on your team to integrate and maintain a tool to manage the governance, again, pushing cost to operation and maintenance. But if you meant trust as in compute accuracy, that probably be the same. Usability, if it’s UI dashboard tooling, the same if you are able to manage the data catalog underlying it. If you are talking about ingestion, probably easier and more efficient “technically”. If they export the results from a UI tool or a query then the same.\n\n\n4. Underestimates.\nHmm, this is where I’m not sure I can answer. I wasn’t a PM when I built data lake. But it’s gonna be the same thing I mentioned (again): cost doesn’t magically disappear, you shift it to operation and maintenance which you can control.\n\n- governance: now you have to built or integrate a tool for governance layer by yourself. \n- performance now is more on you.\n- your team will get exposed to much more complexity than redshift. I hope my examples can give you some ideas, but there will be a lot more. Many unknown unknowns. It will be a long term project where your team will discovers more issues and improvements to do.\n\nI kept all these on high level, feel free to shoot any follow up questions. I’ll answer if I know.",

          "text": "My biggest recommendation is immediately identifying your scalability and latency requirements then partnering with your architect on a structured evaluation. I’ve inherited transformations like this where those details werent factored in, which ultimately led to a rewrite the entire product.\n\nYou mentioned Athena, but you need to be sure this choice is validated by meeting your requirements at scale under the particular conditions of your customers while meeting both your SLAS and staying at an effective cost. This is where the real tradeoffs really show up and can lead to more complex solutions or leveraging technologies like redshift spectrum or snowflake. Ex. \nDo you have interactive workloads for online users or scheduled workloads? Maybe a mix where you can request to run now or schedule for a specific time?\nAre these able to be lazily delivered just in time, or are they required for automated data pipelines on the customer side and always need to be generated exactly on time based on data that may only arrive x minutes before the schedule.\nHow does late arriving data get handled? Does it regenerate previous reports and notify the customer or require requery? \nIs there a latency sla where you may need to autoscale within x minutes/seconds to handle workloads scheduled to run at 4am after a batch job uploads data at 3am but before their business starts at 7am?\nDo you have controls in place to cost manage customer queries? When you ran these workloads in postgres you had a fixed cost in the size of your db, with serverless/on-demand you are often charged based on data scanned not returned. a customer could query 1000s of columns over years of data to aggregate their top 5 most sold products and every time they load this table cost you $20, while adding a 30 day lookback or aggregations at the monthly level for historical data could cut that cost to pennies.\n\nIn cloud the usual gotchas are a lack of real world cost controls on the queries and service scalability limits by cloud providers where you can only run X jobs per cloud account/region. You can mitigate these by 1. Partner early with architecture and make sure you have a pressure tested plan on resource scalability, latency, cost tradeoffs that doesnt open up existential vulnerabilities 2. Work with your cloud service provider so that they can help you cost out the solution and raise/work around various service limits. There are entire PS teams of people that your aws account exec can give you free credits to support this analysis if requested. They’ll throw free expert support at you because they’re ultimately motived by influenced revenue + potential to use you as a customer reference after your migration.",

I have a PM I partner with regularly (a couple times a week) to help validate and prioritize the problems to work on. This always involve technical feasibility and sequencing on my part. I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. Being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

When i try to turn those into wireframes, everything feels disconnected. The devs want something structured. The marketer wants to see user journeys. I just want one place where I can brain dump ideas and slowly turn them into real screens.\n\nThe problem is that most tools ive tried either feel too designer only or too basic. I’ll create a wireframe, but then feedback comes in like:  \n Where does the user go after this?  \n What happens if they click this?  \n How does this connect to the onboarding flow?\n\nAnd suddenly im remaking everything from scratch. What i really need is a way to visually map the idea, user flow,  wireframe, rough prototype, without switching between five tools and losing context every time. Right now it feels like my product is clear in my head, but the second i try to show it, everything becomes confusing.\n\n",

The difference between chaos and clarity is how you externalize and test assumptions early, before you commit to execution.\n\nHere’s what actually helps in practice:\n\n1) Get real about the problem  not the solution\n\nDon’t start with features. Start with questions like:\n\nWhat outcome are we trying to affect?\n\nWho feels the pain now?\n\nWhat would success look like in measurable terms?\n\nThis moves you from ideas to problems worth solving.\n\n2) Write a one-sentence hypothesis\n\nSomething like:\n\n“We believe improving X will help Y because of Z.”\n\nSimple. Testable. Keeps your focus on the why before the how.\n\nWhen teams skip this, they end up with feature laundry lists instead of a coherent goal.\n\n3) Break it into incremental experiments\n\nInstead of “build the whole thing,” plan small steps that validate assumptions:\n\nTalk to real users\n\nPrototype a slice of the journey\n\nMeasure behavior before and after\n\nIn engineering, we call this vertical slices: the smallest bit that provides usable feedback. Product people need the same mindset.\n\n4) Get shared understanding early\n\nWrite it down. Whiteboard it. Share it with others. Misalignment is usually a sign things live only in your head.\n\nOnce your assumptions are externalized, stakeholders can agree, push back, or refine  and that’s when ideas start becoming real.\n\nIn short: messy ideas become clear not by force, but by iteration, hypothesis framing, and early feedback loops, the same patterns that make high-performing engineering teams reliable.",

Without it, it will spit out general garbage. So, when I start a new project, I always start with the following prompt to ChatGPT: \n\n*\"Imagine you're a CPO at a Fortune 500 company. As a CPO, I want you to fully understand my product and help me improve it. With every new detail you learn about my product, I want you to update your context so it always stays aligned with the latest information. To get a deeper understanding, you can ask me the following questions: \"What is the product's purpose?\", \"What problem is it solving?\", \"How is it solving the problem?\", \"Who are the ICP?s and what are their personas?\", and \"What do these ICPs TRULY desire?\". \"*\n\nWhen you press Enter, it'll ask the questions above. Try to answer all of them, even if they are vague. With your answers, give Chat more information about your product by including all your attachments (note that ChatGPT supports up to 10 attachments per message), and ask it to thoroughly upgrade your answers. It looks something like this:\n\n*\"Here are my answers: 1) ... , 2) ... , etc. However, I want to really ensure my answers are concrete and align well with the product. For more context about my product, please review every attachment thoroughly. Remember to focus on even the smallest details, and enrich my answers by covering everything from what I've missed to what I can add.\"* <-- dump in your files here.\n\nIf it is more than 10 files, just send another message afterwards telling them to update the context even further.\n\nAfter this, I ask it to write a perfect MASTER prompt I can copy and paste into an AI mockup generator, and I'll paste the output into **Google Stitch** (it's free for now). Stitch will generate these amazing UIs to get started, and trust me, it becomes much easier to do the wireframes and iterations when you have some visuals to start with. \n\nHope it helps! Remember, trying it out once is so much easier than it looks :)",

Sometimes you to understand that with the client ask for is not actually what they want, if we gave them what they said they wanted it would actually not solve the problem. They're trying to solve, or the solution would be too complex and not worth the incremental effort required to build the complexity they're asking for. \n\nThe long story short as with many things and product, there's no clear answer. \n\nI could certainly understand that a jaded founder or product manager after having sales teams tell him to build things that he knows are not the right thing for many iterations, would simply decide to not communicate with sales. I don't think that's the right answer, but if you've been a successful entrepreneur, who am I to tell you you're wrong.",

You may have to  build good rapport with sales in order to get access to the users and customers so you can do discovery. Some sales people might understand the product well and can help you with discovery/ideation. \n\nSome additional pitfalls - sales tends to be more self interested than other professions and some will try to use you. I have had sales people demand that I go see every single customer in person to do the roadmap presentation ( I said no I don't want to be traveling 50% of the time to do a series of 1 hour presentations that I can easily do remotely and get the same level of feedback). They sometimes try to use product managers as bait so the customers will agree to meet so they can then try to sell something else to them. I've had sales people demand that I run a product training session for a customer just to add \"next level white glove treatment\". I find that the more you communicate with them, the more they ask of you and the more they try to co-opt you into silly things like this. \n\nAlso when I used to provide more details to sales about what the developers were building,  I would just get more nitpicky feedback about trivial details (because they need to say something in meetings to feel important and that is all they can think of to talk about).",
