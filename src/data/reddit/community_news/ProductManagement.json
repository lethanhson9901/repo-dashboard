Perfectly acceptable and understandable to not know anything. If anything, engineers don't need you to be another engineer they can butt heads with, they need you to understand and chime in from the perspective of the user (and also, other microservice POs that power the data sources feeding said API).",

The TL's job is to take that product definition and create a design that can be implemented. For this specific question, you should have a dialog with the TL on how that decision could affect the user experience. In this case, how will the effect of the rate limiting be exposed to the user at all, and what are the trade-offs? Come to a joint conclusion with the TL on the path forward. It may be that this decision doesn't impact the UX at all, and in that case, it's an implementation detail that can be left up to the discretion of the TL. ",

That is a communication barrier that you can't overcome by being useless in meetings and looking stuff up later.\n\n\nYou're a PM. Part of your skill set is *building* expertise when you don't have it. It sounds like the team has technical expertise, so your job becomes using it.\n\n\nI say this as a comparatively very technical PM. I build my own data pipelines, I lead architectural discussions, I've coded live customer facing apps (without ChatGPT). I've also worked with a lot of developers and in your exact scenario I would have just said \"I'm not familiar with those terms, what's the difference.\" The lead explains it to me, I sketch out that explanation against the business problem at hand (it either doesn't matter which we do or one is better than the other because x). Decision done.\n\n\nNot everyone knows everything and you are NOT a developer. You're going to know less no matter how much of a \"Technical PM\" you are unless you were formerly a developer yourself. You need to understand and own up to that while still getting the answers you do need. CI/CD, DNS, migration patterns, gateways, logging practices, data consistency, caching, data contracts, versioning... the list of things you don't know will never end, so your strategy for dealing with it has to take that into account.\n\n\nI'm not surprised you feel like the team is losing faith in you - maybe it's true. i\nIt's not the fact that you can't participate in the architectural debates (which maybe you can't... yet), but that by hiding your ignorance the team doesn't know what you do and don't know and it makes you a poor collaborator. THAT'S the problem you need to fix.\n\n\nFrankly I'd suggest doing this immediately - first, in your next meeting write whatever you don't know down. You don't need to change anything yet, just get stuff to work from. Write down what you think it is. Then set up a 1-on-1 with your lead and walk him through your understanding. \"Hey. I'm realizing a lot of this terminology is new to me, so I'm going to be doing a bit of knowledge building and being more overt in asking questions in our discussions so I can give better answers. Here's what I have so far, how close/far am I?\". Next meeting you participate in, start weaponizing your ignorance. \"These options sound fine on the technical level but I'm not following where the actual trade-off is. Is it performance? Scalability? Observability?\" Etc. Start learning and leveraging the team's expertise to explain what you don't know to you.\n\n\nHopefully you get the idea.",

Keep doing this discovery until you no longer see any surprises from the stakeholders (or you might run out of people to talk to as well).\n\nOnce you have all this documented, circle back with the Lead.",

I should use milder language but a PM is someone whom the engineers tend to throw ideas and get non-techincal feedback. A good nontechnical PM can help ask great question and do gap analysis. A good PM is eager to learn to contribute while maintaining bounderies.\n\n You should try to understand why they asked you a question in the first place and what insights you can bring. After that if you are sure this does not concern you then just tell them, this is an engineering issue, I am not sure how I can help :)",

I had context scattered between JIRA tickets, Confluence pages, Slack threads, meeting notes, half-baked strategy docs. So every time someone asked me a question, I'd spend 20 minutes hunting for the thing I knew I'd written down somewhere.\n\nSo I started dumping everything into Obsidian. I used Tiago Forte's PARA method for structure - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Here's decent blog about it on the Todoist blog, though I don't actually use Todoist 😶\n\n[https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method)\n\nI pointed Claude Code at the vault, which reads and writes local files. You give it a CLAUDE.md file that explains the vault - what the folders are, who the key people are, the rules. Never write to JIRA directly, etc., and I tell it things like \"when I paste a Slack message, summarize it, connect it to what we already know, and add to-do's for me as needed.\"\n\nThat CLAUDE.md file is the whole trick. Without it, the AI improvises and you get garbage. With it, the AI behaves. There's a good guide on writing one.\n\n[https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md)\n\nFor external tools - JIRA, Confluence - I don't use MCP servers.  I use things like this and tell the agent how to interact with it:\n\n[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)\n\nLike I said, you can create agent files for specific jobs - strategy review, competitive analysis, meeting prep. Each one loads additional context on top of the base instructions.\n\n[https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase](https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase)\n\nDay-to-day, it's pretty simple. I open a terminal in my vault. I paste a Slack message. I say \"what do we know about this?\" The agent searches my notes, JIRA tickets, decision logs, meeting notes, Confluence pages, and gives me a connected answer with links to the source files. If it finds something worth keeping, it writes a note in the right folder.\n\nI don't need to worry about complicated things like RAG or vector DB's, embeddings. The context window on current models is big enough that reading files directly works fine. For a PM-scale knowledge base (a few hundred notes) file search and grep is plenty. Other people are arriving at the same setup independently.\n\n[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557)\n\nIf you want to try it: start with Obsidian and PARA. Just folders and markdown. Then install Claude Code (or Github Copilot CLI) and write a CLAUDE.md. After you start using it the system will shape itself around your actual work.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "My approach:\n\nI had Claude Code go through thousands of call transcripts, synthesize them into batch insight reports, then build a holistic picture of patterns across all of it.\n\nThen in [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) I dictated my full context. Goals, projects, what I wanted help with. Had it interview me extensively, then help me build out a detailed project prompt based on everything I told it.\n\nFrom there I set up a Claude project. Put the instructions in, added insights as markdown files, uploaded all my artifacts. Dozens of files, frameworks, reference material. Gave it the full picture.\n\nTurning on memory for the project made a big difference. This is separate from project knowledge. Memory lets Claude retain context across conversations, so it remembers decisions you've made, preferences you've stated, things you've told it to track. Without it, every new conversation starts from zero even if your docs are loaded.\n\nBut you have to actively maintain it. I regularly check what Claude has stored, correct anything that's off, and add new context as things change. Set it and forget it doesn't work. Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe other habit that changed everything was prompting Claude to pull specific artifacts before answering. Instead of just asking a question and hoping it grabs the right context, I'll say \"reference this doc and then answer\" or \"pull up the framework before you respond.\" Sounds small but the difference in output quality is massive. Without that, Claude answers from general knowledge. With it, it answers from YOUR context.\n\nTo answer your specific question, I'm not doing a RAG setup. For most PM use cases that's overkill unless you're working with massive datasets that change constantly. What's working for me is the combo of a well-structured project prompt + uploaded reference docs + memory + Claude's built-in search. Handles 90% of what I need without any infrastructure.\n\nwhat actually matters in practice: spend the time on your project prompt and keep your memory clean. That's your foundation. I prob spent 4 hours just getting the initial context right, having Claude interview me, building the prompt collaboratively, uploading the right docs. If your instructions are vague, it doesn't matter how many files you upload. If your instructions are specific and your memory is current, even a basic setup works surprisingly well.\n\nThat's my approach today, but at this rate it'll all change in 30 days when the next model update comes out. :P",

I already use AI, but I want to push past the current friction and automate most of the drafting — then just review, approve, and move tickets forward instead of writing everything manually.\n\nMy idea is like a ‘push to generate requirement button’. I pick an item from my roadmap / consolidated feedback doc, and have the Ai generate the PRD / ticket for it using everything it has on my product. \nWas anyone successful with something like that?",

          "text": "tried all three honestly. the master doc approach dies within 2 weeks because nobody updates it. good doc structure + drive search works okay until you have 200+ docs and you can't remember what you named something 3 months ago. and RAG is cool in theory but garbage in garbage out, if your docs are already a mess then your embeddings are just a searchable version of that mess.\n\nwhat i've been moving towards is less about where the docs live and more about connecting the tools that already have the context. like your PRDs are in one place, meeting notes somewhere else, user interview recordings in another, jira tickets in another, designs in figma, code in github. the context already exists. it's just scattered. so instead of building a master doc or a RAG pipeline on top of broken docs, i think the play is something that plugs into all of those and builds the brain automatically from what's already there.\n\nthe closest i've gotten is using claude with a bunch of context files but it still forgets everything between sessions. there's no persistence. every monday i'm re-explaining my own product to my own AI tools which kind of defeats the purpose. what i actually want is something that reads my codebase, knows my designs, understands past decisions, and can connect dots across all of it without me manually feeding it context every time.\n\nhaven't fully cracked it yet but that's the direction. if anyone's found something that actually does this i'm all ears",

I've been using Google Docs to keep track of PRDs (that were generated by Claude). That gave me the idea of creating a RAG setup. So I've created a setup that currently pulls from Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Adding Sheets + Slides was easy once I decided to add Docs. I use Voyage for embeddings and Haiku (to save money) for inference. And I added a Tiptap editor with some premade prompts (eg: write a PRD or tell me what to build next) that also uses the context and then gives an output. It's a super-duper basic setup and I'm still refining it, but I'm hoping to get it working really well for my own app.\n\nI'm going to add Jira and GitHub, but at this point I need feedback from some real users so I've reached out to some PM friends. Two of them work in big tech so I'm not sure they'll get approval to try it at work but fingers crossed. If anybody specifically uses Google Docs/Sheets/Slides and would like to try my app out please send me a DM!\n\nI think Claude projects feels a bit weird because it makes sense for persistent context (like coding standards), but otherwise you don't want persistent context for product background (like PRDs) and the project-level memory feels opaque in terms of how it's populated and not really a RAG setup.\n\nSomething else I heard a friend do is just use Cursor and dump everything in there. They said as long as that repo (if shared) or folder is well-maintained they were getting a good amount done.",

Switch to a place that uses the PM title but actually means project manager, product owner, etc. The smaller the company the more hats you have to wear and PMs (good ones) have to wear more hats than most other roles. Some companies do ask PMs to cover too much ground as a company is growing, though. If that's you, you may simply be understaffed or need to hire dedicated Product Marketing, or simply focus the company's priorities better. But guess what, that realization and advocacy for fixing it is ALSO your job. 😅 Welcome to being a leader. It can never be just a job.

For a lot of us, you have to really force \"the PM lifestyle\" on your company if that's what you want. This is especially the case once you get out of tech companies and into other industries. Hell, I find it preferrable to PM in an environment where I'm supporting/enabling the core business....but not actually being the core business. It gives me room to think about problems and address them properly, without also destroying my life. Companies pay handsomely for people to make it easier for them to do their core business. When someone makes $10B a year selling something, making that 10% more efficient is SUPER valuable and waaaaay easier then trying to figure out how to make their flagship product 10% more valuable/better.",

Right after that, SVPG wrote about the product coaching and AI. \n\nAnd then I heard a podcast with Boris Cherny (the Claude Code creator) where he basically said coding is probably solved now, so engineers should spend more time doing product work like talking to customers and validating hypotheses.\n\nThis topic is super hot right now, but in my experience it feels more like a process or skill problem than a tool problem. A lot of what people want seems like it could already be done with Cursor (or other AI tools). \n\nI’ve even built a few tools around this myself, but I’m not sure it’s actually a common enough pain to build yet another “PM copilot”.\n\nIs this a real unmet need, or just hype catching up to what’s already possible?",

Couple that with massive AI slop coming from all fronts, it can make a PM overwhelmed.\n\nPMs + engineers could technically build this as a tool in-house, with integrations that work with apps they currently use. While I understand that some teams may lack these resources and may be willing to pay for an external solution (\"PM copilots\"), I have a feeling that this may lead to more overheads, and eventually a race to the bottom.\n\nTons of PM influencers have jumped on this bandwagon, calling it PM copilot/PM OS and generating needlessly complicated setups. This is just hype in my opinion. More often than not, it is a shill to sign up for their course on Maven, or subscribe to their newsletter on substack by generating FOMO.",

Then I realized those were costing me context and often weren't worth it, so I culled the list and landed on a relatively simple system where the backlog in Linear just linked to markdown spec files in the repo, and most of the work happened from web fetch or reading the local files.\n\nI slowly organized a structure around industry references, customer comments, interview transcripts, and backlog ideas. From there I just asked Claude Code questions and guided it to certain areas of that md structure.\n\nAs things grew, I realized that it was hard to query without sending agents on a context burning goose chase. Long story long, I realized that structured artifacts were the key: one pagers from interviews, key insights in a normalized format (with citations to original sources from the messy world), summaries of the competitive landscape with differentiation points, and even a structure for the feature specs themselves. This lends itself well to a proper tool with a database, but the interface is still ideally an agent. So now I have a set of repeatable workflows with structured outputs that store to a database that holds all the structured data. Then I prompt Claude Code to talk to it via my MCP server. Building all this took a long time, so I'm wondering if that is a useful product: a product specific artifact generation and storage platform that existing agents can read from and even trigger via MCP.\n\nWhen we're prototyping things with agents, there are often a lot of decisions to be made, and it's actually kind of handy to give the agent tools like \"query_customer_insights\" and \"find_evidence_for_assumption\".\n\nAt the end of the day I feel like my biggest problem is still \"how valuable is this thing I'm prototyping to my customers?\" and the answer to that question isn't super helpful if it's just an LLM's hot take without any way to compare more than one option.\n\nAnyone else out there feeling this one?",

How good it can be...  \n  \nThere is a lot of slope in gen AI.

It’s a signal-to-noise problem. The real bottleneck is that raw thinking is expensive to turn into something other people or even ourselves can act on. If you could dump messy thoughts frequently and have them structured into whatever format your engineers or stakeholders need that changes the game more than another PRD template or “PM copilot.”\nMost of the AI-for-PM tools I’ve seen are solving the artifact problem (better docs, better specs).

Layering tools on top of other tools is rarely sustainable, but I would like to get it to where it’s an extra layer that functionally hides the bloat of the lower layers. In my testing so far, it’s been useful for some workflows, but I’m still early on it. \n\nIn terms of strategic decisions/coaching, I think I’m just generally weary of offloading any deeply human skills to AI.

It's that product context is inherently team-level, but every AI workflow today is built for an individual. Claude/Cursor/MCP setups are great for the PM who built them - but that context doesn't live anywhere the rest of the team can access or build on.\n\n\n\nSo you end up with this situation: one PM has a sophisticated Claude setup that knows the product inside out. Another PM on the same team starts fresh every conversation. An engineer wants to understand a decision from 3 weeks ago - there's no trail. A new joiner tries to get up to speed - they're reading stale Confluence docs.\n\n\n\nThe real gap isn't individual AI productivity. It's that product knowledge doesn't persist at the team level.\n\n\n\nThe teams that figure this out aren't building another copilot. They're thinking about it more like infrastructure: where does product context live, who can query it, how does it stay current when specs change or decisions get made in Slack?\n\n\n\nThat's a harder problem than PRD generation, but it's also the one worth solving. Individual AI workflows will commoditize fast. Shared, persistent product memory that the whole team can rely on - that's actually differentiated.",

But this is a recent shift. \n\nI think AI is changing how we work which will blur the lines between engineers, designers and PMs. \n\nI think the shift will take us from doing work to orchestrating it. \n\nIf you're saying that the core of the role is to really drive the strategy up, down and across your organisation and get the right things built the right way, then that's fair enough. \n\nBut if you are any more specific than that, then we're probably at odds. \n\nI think PMs will increasingly design and ship things. Simple front end changes won't need engineers nor designers and when we work together, we'll likely automate documentation by having meeting notes converted into project posters, specs etc. \n\nAnd even if it's just engineers pushing out more work with agents, this will change the role as the cost to deliver will decline sharply. This changes our role because so much of what we do is to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing or building the right thing the wrong way. \n\nBasically, a lot of our role is to manage investments where costs are high. But if that changes, so does our ability to return on that investment. \n\nI think we need to rethink the PM role from the ground up and if we don't, the PMs that can deliver more value will beat the old guard. \n\nThis will take some time and there will be lots of hype and snake oil before we see real changes. \n\nBut I think PM three years from now will be radically different. \n\nI might be agreeing with you more than I think, but I do think that we should feel more of a sense of urgency. \n\nI have a current goal of figuring out how I might ship a feature to prod. It will be small and I'll need to make sure it's not slop. But if agentic software development is half as good as my architects tell me, it should be doable.\n\nBut it's not about the feature.

Whether it’s writing documentation, doing market research or writing code - AI delivers very little value wrapped in a lot of fluff and grandeur. Unfortunately, this is also exactly what shitty PM’s in big organizations do, and historically are rewarded for it - so we are looking at the machine-powered amplification of utter bullshit, now coming at us from every direction with supersonic speed.\n\nIt will become a reality simply because the decision makers are mostly clueless, and the ones depending on them value their paycheck more than true efficiency of some company they don’t own. VC investors are drooling over AI use because it kinda sounds like a market differentiator and their grandkids generated a cute cat with ChatGPT once, so they put pressure on boards. Boards are mostly lobotomized by the time they get in this position, so they are simply not qualified to estimate quality - they just hear about the end result for 10 minutes every quarter and nod. Mid-senior management doesn’t give a shit, but they like their salaries and want to hide the fact that they are a useless organizational layer for longer, so they will pressure individual contributors to use AI. Individual contributors will happily shit out hoards of AI text and documents to simulate productivity and beg for a promotion because of all this fantastic productivity. I’ve literally pip’d a tech lead for using ChatGPT for anything he wrote last year, but I guess these days it’s a virtue. \n\nHonestly, I have given up. If people collectively want to do a subpar job and waste all of this planet’s resources to write a ticket explaining how to center the company logo on the page, and then jerk each other offer about how productive and fast “they” are by putting Gemini-generated research into Claude Code prompts - be my fucking guests.

And the tech is improving faster than any tech we seen before. \n\nCurrently, PMs need to be proficient in prompting AI-driven apps that assemble software apps, like Lovable, Base44, Bubble, Zapier. Whichever one has a workflow that clicks with you. \nRemember, and tell everyone you work with: \n1. You are not a designer. They have UI and UX skills. You don’t and the LLMs don’t. \n2. You are not a developer. You can make a working prototype. But it absolutely won’t be perfomant or resilient. \n\nAnd remember basic product mgt; spend more time with users, understanding their goals and challenges. This knowledge will become increasingly valuable as administrative tasks like market research and document creation become more automated. \n\nI think this is what we need to skill up for now.",

That was the perception, and perception is what gets you promoted or laid off.\n\nThere's a reason everyone and their mom is updating their LinkedIn headline to \"AI Native PM\" right now. Some of those ppl are genuinely learning. A lot of them just understand that the narrative matters more than the skill itself.\n\nI'm not saying don't upskill. You should. But be careful not to over-optimize on chasing the next trend and miss the meta lesson from your friend's story. What people think about you is more important to your career than what is actually true.\n\nTons of PMs keep their heads down and crush it and never get promoted. Meanwhile the PM who's always waxing poetic to leadership about their \"AI-first product vision\" but never ships a thing gets the next title bump. Why? Because it's a narrative game. You can be mad at it. You can even hate it. But you either find a way to authentically play it without selling out, or it plays you.\n\nTry this: start small. In your next 1:1, tell your boss about some side project you built with Claude Code or Cursor or whatever. Doesn't have to be fancy.

It turns out there is a deeper reason than that.\n\nI've been in PM for 10+ years across many industries, and I've never really had an \"aha\" moment with this job. I just.. fell into it and went with it. Each role had a nice initial phase of learning, and then the core of the job led to disengagement.\n\nCurrently evaluating whether I should quit my full time job for consulting / pivot to something more technical and less people-facing.\n\nFor PMs who are in a similar boat\n\n1. Do you think Product Management can be a genuinely rewarding career for someone on the spectrum, or does the job fundamentally require neurotypical social skills to thrive?\n2. What have you done to protect your energy and make the role sustainable?\n3. For those who've pivoted away: what did you move into, and did it help?\n\nPS - also exploring an ADHD assessment because my therapist suspects it, which would answer why my brain is always thinking in 20 different directions.

I’m also more hesitant to speak out when people disagree with me. I honestly feel like it’s not the profession for me but I’m too deep into it and not sure what else I’d do.\n\nI also have become more and more overwhelmed as I get older. Getting married, having kids, more responsibilities at work, and I have slowly become less and less functional. It’s almost like I’m getting more autistic as I age because I’m shutting down. This makes it hard to do a lot of critical thinking and learning new tech that a PM should do.\n\nI should also note that I can definitely have moments of super power. I can punch out a PRD in no time if I’m in the right mood. I am always calm and never react emotionally to anything. So there are advantages. I could also see someone if they are fixating on PM being incredible good. Unfortunately for me, my fixation is on cycling or cars not on work.",

You've started a journey of self-discovery that will change your love for the better. \n\n\n1. 100% I've worked with a number of neurodivergent product managers (autistic, audADHD and ADHD) And some of the best managers I've had were also neurodivergent.\n\n\n2. Learn what gives and takes away your energy. Now that you're diagnosed, keep working with a therapist or professional to learn the language of how your mind operates so that you can set up the ideal routines and behaviors that keep you in regulated. For example, you mentioned crashing after social interactions. It's likely that the crash is from masking to get through them. If you can learn what your masking behaviors are, you can work with a professional to replace them other behaviors that are less costly.\n\n\n3. I moved into a chief of staff/PMO role. I'm an IC but indirectly lead our org by supporting our senior leadership. There's a routine to the central planning and budget mechanisms I run, which gives me the stability I need  \n\n\nHowever, also I get the novelty of being thrown into the most random things sometimes because no one else is sure who should fix it (my flavor of ADHD loves a good crisis). My influence is in mostly one-on-one settings which helps with my social anxiety. \n\n\nPs, If you're on the spectrum, it's also highly likely you have ADHD. They are a common pair. Getting assessed will give you further language to find the tools the best fit your needs. Best of luck to you.",

But I coach a lot of neurodivergent PMs, so I'll offer what I've seen.\n\nGetting a diagnosis isn't a sign you need to quit. It's an explanation for challenges you've prob already noticed or suspected for years. You've had a 10 year PM career. You can clearly do this job. You already have been.\n\nTo put a product lens on it, the only thing this diagnosis did was put a name to the customer problem. The energy crashes, the discomfort with office politics, the disengagement cycle. Now you know what you're actually solving for.\n\nAnd that's good news. Because now you can stop trying to brute force your way through a neurotypical playbook and start building systems that work for how your brain actually operates.\n\nThe neurodivergent PMs I coach who are crushing it have all done some version of this. They protect their energy ruthlessly. Stack all stakeholder conversations into one or two blocks instead of spreading them across the week. Build in real recovery time between meeting-heavy days, not as a nice-to-have but as a non-negotiable. Lean into async written communication as a strength instead of forcing themselves into hallway politics. They stopped trying to mask through the standard PM playbook and built their own.\n\nOn the pivot, I'd push back a little. \"Less people-facing\" can be a trap because every role has people stuff eventually. The real question is whether it's the type of people work in PM that drains you, or the volume and format. Those are different problems with different solutions.\n\nDon't make a career decision until you've had time to sit with the diagnosis and figure out what's \"this job isn't right\" vs. \"I've been doing this job in a way that was never gonna work for me.\" Big difference.",

      "text": "My argument...it needs a bit of explanation.\n\nFirstly, AI is deflationary. What that means is that, by design, it commoditises execution. This is something that every business needs to defend in order to remain profitable. \n\nWhat is inflation anyway? Inflation is when there is too much money chasing goods and services i.e more people with cash want goods than there are goods in the world. So, prices rise because there's more competition for goods.\n\nOn the flip side, deflation is when there are too many goods chasing money i.e the market is flooded with \"stuff\" and not enough people want to pay for it.\n\nFor every product manager and business, this is a critical concept. It's life or death for a product or a business. Inflation is the norm. Deflation is dangerous.\n\nStick with me.\n\nForget everything about the whole \"AI replaces humans\" for a moment, and instead think about what happens when the barriers or \"moats\" around technology disappear.\n\nCompanies that had spent vast sums of money to build software are starting to see their \"moats\" slowly get filled with concrete.\n\nIndividuals are now able to build things in an hour that use to take whole teams weeks to create. Yes it might not be perfect, yet, but you have to consider the rate of innovation, not its current state. Humans are resourceful and there is infinite resources being poured into solving these problems. The will to progress is there and happening.\n\nBut what about distribution, brand strength or proprietary data moats? The thing with AI is that it is prolific. It enters every part of the chain.\n\nSo, AI creates a value problem. If moats disappear then there will be an oversupply of services. This will impact business' ability to make a profit and could result in many collapsing under the weight of easy competition.\n\nThese sorts of things happen slowly at first, and then happen rapidly. In my view, it's not a case of if, but when.\n\nNot all companies will suffer, many will gain that genuinely manage to hold onto their moat. And for those, they'll capture the remaining margin. The thing that many don't realise, is that economies can't handle big shocks like this because it means that governments have to print money, which increases the debt burden. In a deflationary environment, that isn't affordable. But that's a different conversation.\n\nThe question is: when the value of 'building the thing' drops to zero, how do we justify our products' existence?",

The bottleneck moves up. From \"can we build it\" to \"should we build it.\" That's judgment and taste. Understanding your specific users in your specific market at this specific moment.\n\nAI commoditizes the stuff with right answers. Code compiles or it doesn't. But deciding *what* to build, which tradeoff to make, how to position it? That's pattern recognition trained on years of domain experience. LLMs can't replicate it because training compresses everyone's judgment into average judgment. And average judgment is no judgment. It's why every AI-generated strategy sounds plausible and none of it sounds like yours.\n\nProducts built on pure technical moats are in trouble, but they always were and also we can see so many OSS project taking over etc. But products built on deep user understanding, good niche context and sharp product thinking get *stronger*. Because now you can execute on good judgment instantly instead of waiting months for a team to ship it.\n\nThe companies that die aren't the ones whose moats get filled. They're the ones whose moats were only ever \"we built it first.\" The real moat was always knowing what to build. That just became the most valuable skill in the industry.\n\nSo imo PMs with good taste will become critical need.",

More vendors = more noise in the market. \nMore noise makes more people ignore a larger % of that noise. \n\nThen the cost of marketing rises in an attempt to rise  above the clutter. \n\nSo, to the point of my previous comment,\nThose companies who have identified a narrow, highly homogeneous market and have product managers talking with people in the market -all the time- will better understand the goals and pains of those customers. \nCompanies that know how their users FEEL (not only what they do) will gain and retain market share better. \n(Of course this is all an educated guess.)",

There are less companies competing today simply because of their technical delivery moat. Bring that down and propositions will flood the markets. No different to what happened with websites, apps and chrome extensions. \n\nTake Amazon for example. They have a covert practice of replicating their marketplace winners and undercutting them with their own versions.\n\nMost people who create or manage products don't understand the balance of supply and demand and how it affects pricing.\n\nIt seems there are a few folk who think their business will be the one to stand tall amongst all the rest because they've built what they think is a unique and better experience or proposition. It may well be, until others notice and then copy and offer it cheaper.\n\nThe other consequence that people don't understand is that you only have to impact a small number of global companies to destabilise governments and their ability to fund a reduction in tax revenue and an increase in unemployment. You only need a 10% shock and we're all in trouble because that could cause a deep recession that takes out even the formally profitable companies.\n\nThere's many parts to this chain, but it begins with the product.",

What I’m less convinced about is that cheaper execution automatically leads to products collapsing.\n\nWe’ve seen similar shifts before. When cloud infrastructure got dramatically cheaper, companies didn’t disappear en masse. When open source matured, it didn’t wipe out software businesses. When no-code tools lowered the barrier to building apps, it didn’t eliminate products — it multiplied them. What changed wasn’t the existence of products, but the basis of competition.\n\nMost successful products weren’t defensible purely because they were hard to build. They survived because they solved a real problem in a way people trusted, because they became embedded in workflows, because they built brand recognition, because they accumulated data and relationships over time. Those dynamics don’t vanish just because execution accelerates.\n\nAI absolutely compresses the cost of making things. That will erode thin wrappers and surface-level tools that existed mainly because building them required resources. But that’s not the same as killing products altogether. It just forces a separation between features that were artificially scarce and systems that create durable value.\n\nOversupply is a real risk, but supply has never been the only constraint. Attention is scarce. Trust is scarce. Distribution is scarce. Even if anyone can build something, not everyone can get it adopted, integrated, and relied upon. That friction still matters.\n\nIf building approaches zero marginal cost, the leverage shifts. The differentiator becomes problem selection, positioning, experience design, ecosystem strategy, and long-term value capture. In that environment, judgment compounds more than technical execution does.\n\nSo maybe the better question isn’t what happens when building becomes free. It’s what happens when everything becomes buildable. When that’s true, the scarce resource isn’t code. It’s clarity about what deserves to exist and why.",

Smaller teams can sometimes pivot faster because they have less to unwind.\n\nOn the “no precedent” point, I agree this feels different. AI touches cognitive work in a way past shifts didn’t. But every major tech wave felt unprecedented at the time. The internet, cloud, mobile. Each one disrupted pricing and wiped out categories. The system didn’t collapse, value just moved.\n\nCheaper execution doesn’t mean value disappears. It usually means it relocates. When building gets commoditized, differentiation shifts toward trust, brand, distribution, integration, and owned data. The businesses competing only on access to the underlying capability will struggle. The ones that build defensibility above that layer can still hold margin.\n\nThe transition could be messy.

      "text": "I’m a PM at a large tech company working on a strategic initiative (AI-adjacent, high visibility). I joined about a year ago and had a strong first year with good performance rating, above-average variable pay, stock refresher, and positive feedback from leadership. I’ve been called a “high agency PM” and someone expected to grow into owning a major work track.\n\nMy manager is relatively new to people management (promoted \\~2 years back). He’s genuinely a nice guy, supportive in appraisals and comp discussions, and I don’t believe there’s evil intent in anything mentioned below.\n\nBut day-to-day, I’m struggling.\n\nHe is extremely involved in execution:\n\n\\-- He's always in panic and anxiety mode, doing the job of even program managers, seeking alignment, chasing timelines, engineering/design commitments\n\n\\-- I have 3-4 syncs with him during the day (even when he's working from home he keeps messaging) where we discuss our work tracks, he tells me what to prioritise and what to keep aside\n\n\\-- If I’m creating a doc/artifact, he creates his own version before I’m done.\n\n\\-- If I’m drafting a response for another leader, he drafts his own version in parallel.\n\n\\-- He reaches out to engineering, design or marketing spocs directly instead of routing through me when I know most of the answers since I'm working with them on ground.\n\n\\-- In Slack threads, he often responds before I do, even when I’m clearly the owner.\n\n\\-- In leadership reviews, he presents most of the material and answers most questions.\n\nRecently, I prepared extensively for a high-level meeting with very senior leadership (including the business head). I knew every detail and could answer every question. But my manager and engineering leads answered everything before I could speak. I left the meeting without saying a word.\n\nWe’ve discussed ownership before. He says he sees me as high-agency and wants me to grow. He has said he’ll step back. But under pressure (which is mostly the case in our work charter), he seems to revert to high involvement. It's come to appoint where I wish he goes on a long break so I can work and deliver features peacefully.\n\nThe tricky part is:\n\n\t•\tHe has supported me strongly in compensation and performance reviews.\n\n\t•\tI’m working on strategic AI initiatives that are high impact.\n\n\t•\tI don’t think he’s intentionally blocking me.\n\n\t•\tI’m not being treated poorly in formal processes.\n\nBut the daily experience feels like I’m the thinker/executor while he remains the visible voice. In our review meetings he always says how \"the team\" has a lot to deliver and we've come a long way, how I'm a great value add to the team, but I feel I'm not operating at my true potential.\n\nAnother complication: my skip-level leader (his manager) is someone who forms perceptions quickly. I worry that discussing with him could unintentionally damage my manager’s reputation or promotion trajectory. That’s not something I want to do even slightly.\n\nAt the same time, I’m starting to lose work satisfaction because of the duplication, panic urgency, lack of clear authorship and this mom treatment (checking in on my work, suggesting me what to do, asking for updates multiple times during the day).\n\nSo I’m trying to think clearly about my options:\n\n\t1.\tHave a very direct confrontation about boundaries and duplication, maybe even call out his anxiety or panic issues?\n\n\t2.\tStay and design around this behavior (process clarity, ownership agreements, etc.) and keep bugging him till it's established?\n\n\t3.\tQuietly explore switching teams?\n\n\t4.\tReach out to skip-level?\n\n\t5.\tConsider leaving altogether?\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in similar situations:\n\nHow do you distinguish between first-time manager anxiety and a real growth ceiling?\n\nCan someone actually grow under a highly involved manager like this?\n\nIs this something that typically improves over time, or does it harden?\n\nAt what point is switching teams the smarter move?\n\nWould appreciate candid advice from experienced PMs or leaders who’ve seen both sides of this dynamic.",

          "text": "First off, I'm sorry you're in this situation.  \n  \nI've seen this pattern a lot. And the frustrating part is your manager probably isn't doing this on purpose. He's doing it because he's anxious, because he hasn't learned how to lead without doing, and because jumping in feels like helping. It's not. But it feels like it to him.\n\nHere's my take\n\nStop thinking about this as a confrontation. That word is already setting you up to come in hot. This is a partnership conversation.\n\nAnd don't just spring it on him. Nothing makes the air get sucked out of a room faster than \"hey, we need to talk.\" Instead, lead with exactly what the conversation is about: \"Hey, I want to have a conversation about how we work together day to day.\" Simple. Clear. No ambiguity. Then ask permission to share your observations. Something like \"I've noticed some patterns in how we're splitting work and I'd love to share what I'm seeing. Are you open to that?\" Getting that explicit yes before you go in lets you be honest without them feeling blindsided. Changes the whole dynamic.\n\nThen get specific. \"We're duplicating effort on docs, Slack responses, and stakeholder conversations and I think it's slowing us both down. Can we get clear on who owns what?\" No accusations. No \"you're micromanaging me.\" Just a clean practical framing about efficiency.\n\nDon't leave that conversation without concrete ownership agreements. Who owns first drafts. Who responds in Slack threads. Who leads which meetings. Write it down.\n\nOn the meeting thing, that one stings but you kinda let it happen. Next time you prep for a leadership meeting, tell your manager beforehand: \"I've got deep context here, I'd love to take the lead on questions.\" Don't wait for the mic. Claim it ahead of time.\n\nOn the skip level, hold off. You haven't had the real conversation with your manager yet. Have the direct version first. If nothing changes in 4-6 weeks then the skip level becomes a reasonable next step.\n\nFirst-time managers revert under pressure. That's not permanent but it means you're gonna have to re-establish boundaries more than once. The question isn't whether he reverts. It's whether he's open to the feedback and tries to correct.\n\nDon't leave yet. You've got a manager who supports you in comp and reviews, you're on high visibility AI work, and you haven't pushed on this hard enough to know if it can change. Try the direct conversation, set clear ownership, claim your space, and give it a real shot. If in 2-3 months you're still leaving meetings without saying a word, then start exploring. But right now you've got more leverage than you think.\n\nHappy to be a sounding board if you need help scripting out this conversation before you have it. Feel free to DM me.",

I mentioned I wasn't used to that under previous mgr and while I know everyone has their style I can't help but feel like I'm not meeting expectations somehow. Given my seniority I would have expected my d2d to be self managed and to just keep her informed through weekly updates or ad hoc notes as needed or if decisions or escalations are required.  I asked if that's her expectation too or if there was something I needed to work on more to get to that level of trust.\n\nShe then sang praises and sorta defended why she needed to be so involved and yatta yatta but we came to an understanding aligned more to my expectations and they did chill out quite a bit after that.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to approach it but I think this would be helpful for you too.  Just like in a romantic relationship, work relationships require alignment on expectations and how to work together if they're going to thrive",

Makes sense.\n\n\nMight I offer one perspective to simply lean into this.  What if you leaned into the way they do the work?  Is it thorough and do they deliver?  Can you as their leader coach the org and stakeholders to adapt to an \"agile\" and \"continuous discovery\" way of doing things?  Some orgs do. Why not yours?\n\n\nI've been in positions where i can work with UX, thoroughly have something designed out. Write out stories to perfection (some devs love it). Devs validate, perhaps come back with a few little things but usually I've thought of everything at that point.\n\n\nI've also been in positions where i get it close enough and just throw it into a sprint and we work in through. Definitely more backend processes, new APIs and such just made it easier.  Perhaps a dev needs to really think something through or once they get into something then they learn.\n\n\nHonestly I think the later is better for software development even though I have more control over the thorough preparation process.  I think everyone thinks they want so much preparation and everything is thought out but software development feels smoother when you prepare enough, have \"enough\" thought but you simply go and move.  I find it reduces unnecessary scope and keeps the team thinking in smaller delivery.\n\n\nBut orgs hate that and want to burden you will all the bureaucracy.  But I'd consider coaching the org to embrace the faster more agile, last minute approach.  Smaller faster delivery IMO works better because it's just hard to properly think everything through until a few people can just dive into it.\n\n\nThis is what scrum is SUPPOSED to be btw but no one hardly ever does it",

Documenting in this way allows you to virtually walk through the use of the system and determine what information is needed for the user to achieve their task and what the system will need to do in response to user input. If you have a strong UCD or UX team, you can create wireframes or prototypes at a good-enough fidelity to walk through your use cases and understand if you're missing anything. Plus, you can put these in front of customers to gain additional insights or missing requirements. \n\nIt sounds like your team is just writing out their idealized requirements without thinking through actual use.",

The action should never be \"I'll try harder\".\n\n\nDocument what they've agreed to do next time (in writing). \n\n\nIf they do it consistently, the level of similar gaps should reduce over time as you go through a few of these conversations on different misses and agree on actions / frameworks to prevent them in future.\n\n\nIf they don't do what they've agreed to, move on to formal performance management / PIP etc.",

They call them Hotspots and there are a lot of them now.\n\nThis feels like the kind of request most teams see and keep saying no to because it doesn’t really fit the model. Delivery systems are usually built around validated addresses, density, and repeatable logistics. Random outdoor locations are kind of the opposite of that.\n\nBuilding something like this probably means stepping outside the optimized flow most teams spend years refining. It’s not the cleanest thing to support operationally, and it doesn’t scale the same way as the core use case.\n\nBut it does let them handle situations most delivery products aren’t designed for.\n\nIt made me think about how often “edge cases” show up like this. Not impossible, just awkward enough that they never get prioritized because they don’t match how the system is supposed to work.\n\nCurious how others think about this. Would you build for it or keep saying no?",

It's at the level of an internal hackathon idea. \n\nHackathons are a great way to create features like this. Someone gets an idea and is super motivated, it uses all your existing tooling, it just presents something in a different way or attaches a single additional widget... and all of a sudden, you've got something cool.",

We record coordinates and any addresses inputted are translated into coordinates before they're plotted and stored.\n\nIn my mind this is just creative thinking and taking advantage of low-hanging fruit. Effort wise, this probably is < sprint of work and wouldn't be more than a small enhancement on the roadmap.\n\nSo, Yes - always say yes to low-hanging fruit that is cheap from a dev standpoint.

They can deliver it next door or on the street and still be within the “footprint” of the delivery to avoid being caught by automatic comparisons with the delivery pin. \n\nDomino’s likely already using GPS for home deliveries for similar reasons and just decided to expose that and introduce it as a new feature. ",

The thinking can be crystal clear, but unless everyone - from engineering to design to finance - are working in lock-step with said strategy, across the board...the clarity of thought is left in that confluence document, unread and unabsorbed. I've made that mistake earlier in my career and years later, understood it through the help of mentors who reminded me of how critical change management is when trying to implement strategy at scale. \n\nA strong strategy in my experience is something that is designed not just for clarity of thought but also (most importantly) *designed to spread and resonate with all teams*. That's why PMs look at companies with great product culture and nick their ideas - some of them have compressed their strategy into simple, catchy principles that make it easy to adopt (whether they understood it in the context of their own org problems is its own rabbit hole). \n\nA strategy that requires a long document to be understood does not survive contact with a large organization. A strategy document isn't successful when it's well written, it's successful when it's actually used. If it isn't memorable principles or ideas, doesn't already leverage some artifacts that teams already have and use, doesn't create simple yes/no filters or re-inforced through any sort of rituals...it dies. Even quicker death ensues if leaders aren't keen to bat for it or if it doesn't show results in a timeline they're willing to wait for.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, apologies in advance for the rant, but I could really use some advice. I recently started a new role (with my existing job), and I'm finding it tough to manage burnout, excessive meetings, and the constant demands from people on remote teams.\n\nA bit of background: My team is quite inexperienced, and only 2 out of 10 people on my team are based in the same office as me. I spend about 70% of my week in meetings, which creates two big issues:\n\n1.      It destroys my ability to focus and actually get things done because I'm constantly moving between meetings and can't give people the attention they need to get up to speed. I cannot think.\n\n2.      Since my teammates haven't been able to get up to speed (not blaming them—they're new to the company and area), things only get done when I jump in and do them myself.\n\nThe area of the business we're in is difficult and full of jargon. I've been with the company for eight years, so I know how to navigate it, but most of the others don't.\n\nI'm wondering: How do others deal with meeting fatigue and remote work fatigue in other companies?\n\nI'm a very personable, in-person kind of person—I like to explain things with whiteboards and face-to-face conversations. I really dislike this fragmented, remote world. I had eight hours of back to back Teams meeting Tuesday, and genuinely think it made me sick.\n\nAny tips or experiences that could help would be much appreciated! I miss when work was somewhat enjoyable. ",

Default meeting time is 30mins. Most things can be done in that time. Doesn’t mean you can’t have a longer one where it makes sense but helps keep the meeting focussed and productive. \n2. Every meeting has an agenda, goal or format. \n3. Every 6 months have a company wide meeting free week. This helped force a reset and remind people how to work without having a meeting. \n4. This sounds counterintuitive but having a regular fixed meeting for some things helped reduce additional meetings. \n5. Having some meetings cameras off helped with the zoom fatigue. Looking at yourself is way more exhausting than in person meetings. We made cameras optional for all tech team meetings. \n6. Slack updates - move update style meetings to slack instead where appropriate. We created channels for projects where anyone who was interested could follow along and save attending a meeting each week. Helpful if there’s a lot of projects that you want / need to stay across. \n7. Train team how to work async. For people who prefer verbally explaining or want to show and tell, get them to record a loom or a video and share it. Help team learn how to improve their communication to make meetings unnecessary or at least run better. \n8. Have a good repository of info (I like notion) that is accessible to everyone. Have everything documented in there which everyone can access helps keep everyone on the same page and can self serve info. This includes a jargon / acronyms directory.",

Creating a little friction can go a long way sometimes. \n\nFor slack we had different channels so everything stayed focussed to a specific project. And used naming conventions to keep them organised. So #project-project name. And then folks used threads to keep things organised nicely within each. So you could skim the major updates and when there was one you needed more context on you could click to the thread to see more info. We also encouraged tagging of people and never expected anyone to stay across everything unless they were tagged in it. So you could mute channels and just get notified when/if they needed your eyes or input. \n\nMeeting free was always wonderful. We had a strong remote first culture so most people were experienced working async and appreciated the extra time in their calendars to think and get stuff done. As part of each one all meeting organisers and leaders were encouraged to review all their meetings and cancel any that no longer felt necessary permanently which free’d up time. \n\nAdditionally attendance at meetings was never enforced. You could always say no if it didn’t feel like you needed to be there. And there was no pressure to say no, just an expectation that you’d decline the invite so people knew not to expect you. For important meetings these would be recorded and transcripts shared incase anyone couldn’t make it or simply preferred to just skim the transcript. \n\nA lot of this was driven top down which helped obviously, but we also had a strong culture of if you could demonstrate a better way of working, folks were always onboard to listen and try it. \n\nAt the end of the day, less meetings is generally better for everyone. Sometimes you just need to show people the impact it can have to convince them.",

It could be any number of things like lack of the right skills, wrong technical architecture, remote working itself etc.\n\nIn my experience this usually comes down to skills. To address that you have to forget about people and start with the \"work\". What is the job to do and what outcomes do you need. Once you clarify what the work is, you can define the job. Once you define the job you can work out if the people currently doing the job have the right skills. Sounds harsh, but this is a cold reality.\n\nIf you do that and discover that you have the right skills for the work, then you have to go up the chain and assess the strategy, both technical and propositional. If the strategy is causing the issue, then you have a leadership skills issue. If it's a technical issue, then you probably have a budget problem, because technical usually means some level of investment is required.\n\nGood luck",

          "text": "A few things that actually help with this, from experience:\n\n\n\nThe core problem isn't too many meetings - it's that meetings are doing the wrong job. When a team is new and context-light (your words), meetings become the primary mechanism for transferring knowledge that should live in written form. Every sync reconstructs what happened last week because it's not written down anywhere reliable. So the fix isn't necessarily fewer meetings - it's making meetings no longer necessary for people to stay informed.\n\n\n\nPractical things that reduce meeting load without abandoning the team:\n\n\n\n1. Weekly written update, 5 bullets max. What got decided, what's blocked, what changed. You write it, they read it. This alone can eliminate a 1hr sync per week because people arrive with context instead of needing to be briefed.\n\n\n\n2. Distinguish between meetings that require real-time input vs. ones that are just status. Status meetings are almost always replaceable with async. Decision meetings often aren't. If you audit your 70% of week, I'd guess a majority are status or handoff, not genuine decision-making.\n\n\n\n3. When you jump in and do things yourself, document the process after. You're carrying tribal knowledge. Every time you do the thing for someone, add one line to a doc explaining why + how. This compounds - within a few months your team gets up to speed faster because the context is accessible rather than living only in your head.\n\n\n\n4. Protect 2-3 hour focus blocks on your calendar explicitly. Not as \"busy\" - as named blocks (e.g., \"Deep Work: Roadmap\"). People will fill whatever unblocked time you have with meetings. Visible blocks communicate that your calendar isn't a free-for-all.\n\n\n\nOn the in-person vs. remote friction: what you're feeling is real. But I'd reframe it slightly - it's not that remote is inherently worse, it's that remote requires more intentional information architecture to work. The whiteboard and face-to-face conversations encode context extremely efficiently. Remote doesn't have that natural channel, so you have to build the equivalent deliberately.",

When your team sees one another in the hallway this rarely happens. \"Oh! Shoot, I forgot to tell you,\" doesn't happen in Slack, or email, because your nervous system treats them as \"shit to do\" (annoyance) rather than actual humans that walk the earth and relate to one another.\n\nAnyhow.

Component and unit testing is something that AI is on paper excellent at generating. Then the tests fail and it iterates and iterates until they pass.\n\n\nBut often looking at what those tests do, they are of deeply debatable utility by the time they pass. But that's not even the problem.\n\n\nThe problem is that the AI can make those tests and then update those tests so quickly that your relationship as the arbiter of quality becomes a single huge point of failure. You have to interpret the tests, the purpose of the test, the changes, and any other changes. But you now have to do it in a stream of continuous changes, and the AI doesn't know if the ultimate implementation is \"correct\" or not, just that it works.\n\n\nThis pattern with AI agents is a common one and it exposes a core weakness called the [reverse centaur](https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/).\n\n\nSolving that problem is kind of the definition of an SDLC problem.",

You cannot convince them otherwise if their goal is to find “who” to blame instead of “what” to solve.\n\nLet’s evaluate here, you know better than any of us, are they in the situation to understand you, or they are just looking for something to blame?\n\nNormally I’ll work with the teams to find a shared understanding of r&r.\n\nBut my gut feeling if I were you, and I’ll be looking at the worse case scenario:\n\n1.

I have a Senior title, but I know I likely wouldn't meet Senior criteria for the most part in terms of yoe. At my company, we have no POs or Program Managers, so I handle everything from high-level strategy and discovery to specs, enablement comms, and analytics.\n\nA recruiter reached out about a Product Ops role with pretty good pay, but the JD overlaps heavily with what I do now. The hiring manager said their PMs own the \"Strategy/What,\" while Product Ops does \"everything else.\" This includes conducting client discovery, writing specs, managing delivery, and owning enterprise implementations and compliance.\n\nSo I'm confused, is this actually product ops? It feels to me more like a Technical PM role. If I take an Ops title, am I pigeonholing myself or taking a career \"downgrade\" that makes it harder to return to pure Product later?\n\nHas anyone made this move, what are your thoughts?",
