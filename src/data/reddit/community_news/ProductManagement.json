      "text": "I have a decade in PM. I started building apps with AI last year for rapid prototyping in my day job. Naturally, I explored ideas in my own time ..not because I had a startup idea…Because I looked at what the market wants from PMs now and realised my CV was going stale.\n\nEvery job spec wants “AI experience” or “technical fluency” or “full stack PM.” The market shifts to do everything …\n\nThe first app I built in Lovable. It looked beautiful. Zero security, zero business model, zero point. But it was so easy it was almost boring.\n\nThe second one solved a real problem for my team. I mixed Lovable with Cursor, added GitHub for version control, hosted it on Netlify. Still no auth, no database. Just a useful thing that exists. \n\nThe third one is where it got interesting. Not because I suddenly became a developer….I’m still not writing code. AI writes it. But I wanted to do a bit more. So instead of one tool abstracting everything away, I used the pieces separately. Next.js for the framework. Vercel for hosting. Supabase for the database. Upstash for rate limiting. Claude’s API directly. Resend for emails. Cursor orchestrating the AI coding.\n\nThat’s when things started breaking. And that’s when I started learning. I journaled all of it.\n\nI made a couple more apps since…each getting a little better. Focusing on security… RLS etc \n\nEvery day I built, I wrote up what happened. Not documentation. Just me explaining concepts to myself. What broke…What I learned. Why something worked the way it did.\n\nThose journals turned into personal playbooks. And now when someone asks about a technical trade-off, I don’t construct a hypothetical. I read my own notes. \n\nThe building is valuable. The writing about the building is what compounded …And once you’ve built a couple of apps, you’ve basically got a portfolio. \n\nThe same way UX designers are compelled to talk through their portfolio you can too. You can populate it with case studies. Lessons learned. How you’d scale it. What strategy you took and why. Hiring managers can actually look at something instead of taking your word for it… \n\nThe commercial awareness you pick up is the bonus. Cost optimisation for AI is a real skill now. Which model for which task. Haiku is 10x cheaper but falls apart on complex instructions. Structured outputs forces Claude to return data in an exact format, no conversational fluff, no mistakes. Sounds perfect until you notice it adds latency and slows your shit down. Model updates break your app overnight with no warning.\n\nThe job market wants “full stack PMs” now (even if they don’t explicitly say it!) Whether that’s reasonable is a different conversation. But if that’s where things are heading, I’d rather have something to show than hope my existing experience translates.\n\nIf you’re a PM thinking about future-proofing: pick a problem you actually have. Build something that solves it badly. Document what went wrong. Keep it hosted so you can talk through it and demo it. Better yet host all the links to your  apps on a landing page. \n\nEdit: this advice is probably more geared to new PMs starting out and struggling to get a role, or those who are stuck on internal tool product work and can’t really flex other things marketing and distribution.

Yep, I also noticed this idea of Full Stak PM which honestly I think it's a unicorn (one in a billion).\n\nAnyway, build a portfolio of products explaining the reational, economics, etc. seems a logical step in the PM job search.\n\nHowever, my view, my understanding is that you tend to be more a Full Stack Dev than a Ful Stack PM. The role of a PM, for me, seems more about: research the right business problem to solve (demostrate it with metrics like market size, etc.), finding the right product/feature-market fit (again based on metrics), market your product (aka marketing), Creating the business case (I think you did this one), etc. \n\nAgain, this is my view, and honestly, I may be wrong because when I see Full Stack PM in articles, job post, etc. they are looking for Full Stack Dev. PMs define the WHAT, Devs define the HOW, and selecting the LLM is a HOW not a WHAT. Selecting the business problem to solve is the WHAT.",

On December 1st I started my first Head of Product position in a company building AI products for municipalities (very popular products which is super cool). I already found myself struggling to rely on anything other than the opinions of my best engineers in terms of models we should use when balancing accuracy and pricing. It's incredibly difficult.\n\nI'll start vibe coding similar products as the 3 main ones we offer today - to get a better sense of what works, what scales and what breaks. Luckily I already have great in depth knowledge about our customers, users and use cases with too much voluntary feedback to even digest at this point (i.e. super engaged users) - so I'll start from that and see where it takes me.\n\nOne thing though...\n\nWhere do I comment VIBING2026 to get a free sample of your playbook (sarcasm intended) 😁\n\nHave an awesome new year and best of luck to everyone learning more about these types of AI decisions.",

Someone could view-source the entire frontend and find nothing because the key was never sent to them in the first place.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​..that’s what I hope works anyway for 80% of use cases.

The real life business strategies are reliable. The writing styles aren’t all the exact same. \n\nWhen Claude doesn’t understand the prompt, it asks clarifying questions. When recalling past conversations, it doesn’t forget half of it.\n\nClaude is so much more reliable for everything besides image creation, which let’s be honest are only for memes at this point, and deep research. Now I will say, I think the deep research is a lot better with chatgpt, and makes the case to keep the subscription for that single application mode.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Disagree?",

      "text": "I'm a Senior PO now, but years ago my first break into tech was a Business Analyst. I was embedded in a dev team, basically shadowing my PO. When the PO prioritised a feature, however big or small, it was my job to dig into what that actually meant. What was the impact on the wider product, how would we break it down into individual user stories, what would those stories look like? This allowed the PO to focus on the **why** and **when** of what was being delivered, while I as the BA focused on the **how**. Not in terms of project delivery, timelines, or cost, but the low level detail of the feature, into user stories, acceptance criteria etc.\n\nYears later, having moved onto being a PO, and now Sr. PO, it seems rare that companies even bother with BAs any more. More and more POs are spending time focusing on low level requirements, writing jira tickets, UAT testing, leading backlog refinements to answer detail on edge cases, as BAs are often missed out of the entire structure.\n\nIs SAFe to blame? As that doesn't have BAs at all.\n\nIt's not all companies, but it feels like an increasing number of companies are removing the BA role and expecting the PO to do it.\n\nMaybe it's a UK thing and other countries are different?",

The work previously done by business analysts still needs to be done, which means someone is doing it, and being paid.  Generally speaking, that person was hired to do something else, and hired because they were good at the thing they were hired to do.  Often they aren't very interested in (or particularly good at) doing things a BA would do, but the work still needs to be done.  So, it gets done less well and/or slower than before.  As a result, capacity decreases and problems increase.  In the interest of \"eliminating a position\", we often make our teams less efficient, less effective, and less happy.\n\nWhile I'm on a rant, DevOps doesn't mean saving money by making your developers responsible for your Ops functions.  It means reducing friction by connecting your dev people and your ops people to create overlaps and insight where there were once gaps and a wall that people were chucking problems over.\n\nI've spent years fighting with people (often fueled by consultants) who don't understand the purpose of Agile, of DevOps, of Product, or even Cloud, and think everything is supposed to be a cost cutting measure.  That isn't the purpose of any of these, and every time I've seen someone sell these transformation as cost-saving initiatives, they've failed to deliver either cost savings or the benefits those transformations should actually deliver.",

If as PO I'm focusing on story writing, low level detail, backlong refinements, answering edge case questions mid-sprint, guess what I'm not doing? Thinking about long term strategy and benefit, ensuring the right thing is being built now as opposed to the wrong thing, building stakeholder relationships. Or maybe I am, but as I'm wearing two hats I'm doing neither one particularly well.\n\nIt feels so many companies have just given BAs a PO title, small pay bump, and made them do both roles.",

The most successful teams I have seen are where the BA is the glue that holds the team together. They go deeper into the tech and the how - finding areas of overlap, redundancy, optimizations, etc, with the tech teams.\n\nNot every company can afford for a PM to spend 3 months on a feature. I work in a very fast-paced industry, mostly in tech transformations. The concept that the PM should do everything is ridiculous. This is just a small list of what is expected:\n\n* Talk to customers\n* Talk to stakeholders\n* Gain alignment\n* Document the what/why\n* Review charts/graphs\n* Develop experiments\n* Work with design\n* Drive delivery\n* Work with LT\n* Share out results\n* Gather new ideas\n* Manage a backlog\n\nThat's insane.\n\nHow we use BAs - I use the analogy of navigating a lake. The PMs stay at the surface level of everything so they can navigate and direct us where to go (areas of opportunity). BAs dive deep into the water - they work from the surface of the lake to the bottom. They partner with PMs to identify anything that may trip us up as we move forward. PMs should rarely have to dive deep into every aspect of the work. If this is happening, they have lost focus on what/why/customer.\n\nBeen using this model for 10 years and it works. We ship on time and deliver value.\n\nEdited for typos and clarity.",

In the short term it makes sense, but it also destroys the pipeline of senior SWEs that AI can't replace. I'd argue that the loss of BAs is the greatest single PM pipeline, so we're suffering in the same way.",

See the *Founder Mode* essay from *Paul Graham* or various interviews with *Brian Chesky*.\n3. Companies are more picky about the engineers they hire - and have increased their expectations. It is becoming more common for **engineers to write their own tickets** and think about the product-impact of what they are building.\n4. In some orgs (for example *Linear*), **Product Designers** have taken on more responsibility when it comes to making nitty gritty product decisions.\n5.

We need to consider removing one feature. \n\n\nThe combination of many companies and products being relatively mature and the desire to ship features leads to lots of bloatware. \n\n\nAdd AI into the mix where shipping is even faster and you're going to have awful experiences with tons of features that don't really solve customer needs or desires. \n\n\nThe most important word in a PMs toolkit is no,  not yes.",

The result isn’t better products...it’s faster confidence built on thinner understanding. Deferred complexity is never fun and bites hard later!

Even if it doesn't solve corporate politics issues, data is ammo that savvy PMs can use. And the thought process itself of coming up with more experiment hypotheses is really useful. It helps to show that things are always more nuanced than snake oil-selling PMs make them seem.\n\nShitty PMs used to be able to coast by for years by sounding convincing and bringing \"data\" to conversations.

It's surprisingly accurate and lets me zero in on what I need without relying on Onedrive's search function or viewing it manually.\n\nI also use ChatGPT as a news aggregator and to trawl competitor events and functionality on a weekly basis.\n\nFinally, Replit's prototyping can save me a bunch of time if I feed it a detailed enough prompt and a few screenshots. It will never give me something accurate enough to build on (not right now, at least) but it makes explaining ideas much easier than drawing mockups myself.\n\nSo far I've found that AI tools are good at organizing and surfacing information for me and they're much faster than doing it manually, as long as I know enough to verify their output. They haven't sped me up when it comes to actual deliverables though like PRDs or engineer-handoff level mockups.",

Even if I had the opportunity to visit more customers I likely couldn't due to having to work on hundred other things. I could do a ton of research and say \"Hey! This is what we should be doing and here's how I know it\" and it would be ignored because it doesn't align with the opinions of decision makers. \n\nEvery book I've read on PM seems idealized and the reality never seems to align. As another commenter mentions, it seems like companies like the title of Product Manager but don't want them to do the work of a product manager. Or rather, they want them to be product managers as well as project managers, copywriters, packaging designers, etc. \n\nFor context, I work in physical goods not software.",

However, the UX researchers I work with now are much methodical about this and I learn much more from customers when I work with them.\n\nSo TLDR.  It’s a skill that I learned from a mentor.  It takes time to develop so not every PM has it.  But working with UX researchers is better than going solo.",

One of the biggest things I learned is how much wording matters, especially avoiding leading questions.\n\nFor example, if you ask: *“Have you had any issues placing orders?”* you’re already framing the conversation around problems. You’ll get answers, but you don’t know if those issues are actually top-of-mind or just reactions to your prompt.\n\nInstead, I try to stay intentionally vague at first: *“Tell me about your last orders.”*  If they bring up problems unprompted, you know those issues matter to them.  If they focus on something else entirely, that’s often even more valuable.\n\nMy rule of thumb is: start broad, let users lead, and only narrow in once I understand what’s important to *them*, not what’s important to *me*.\n\nHope this helps!",

I think a better question is, \"does your organization actually follow best practice, or do they just do whatever pops into the CEOs head?\" I see this complaint a ton and also live it. The market cares a lot more about investors than users right now. The CEO and board are basically your investor researchers, and their voice is way louder right now, especially for established companies that can be traded. I expect this to change after the AI craze / stagflation period we're in, hopefully\n\n\n2. *Companies are reducing UR teams.* Yep. Long ago, in 2008, software was such a lucrative business--no overheard or physical cost to what you sell = insane profit margin--that companies could afford to split up the work across many individuals. We had engineers, scrum coaches, product managers, engineering managers who didn't actually write code, UX, UR, and QA all embedded in teams or in big departments. This has fallen off slowly for years. Every business now has a tech stack but the competition is a lot fiercer and only FAANG can afford all of those luxurious perks and hyper-specialized roles. Tools, including but also before AI, have moved in to help PMs or developers do more themselves. THIS is why they've gotten rid of User Researchers, not because it's a lower priority but because companies in general want everyone to do three jobs at once now.\n\n\nAnd... they're sort of right. And sort of wrong. Obviously every PM should be talking to clients and doing UR, but a lot of this was \"best practice\" bloat that the execs didn't actually use and I can't blame them for cutting. And I'm not one of the AI doom-and-gloomers, I think great humans (+ AI help) will always surpass pure AI. But having a UR team doesn't mean your company is actually learning and applying anything useful, and in the current era I don't see it being applied well or valued highly",

So for those companies that don’t have the dedicated resource and specialists it falls on other roles like PMs and PDs as companies freeze hiring due to economic conditions and AI. And again it depends company and industry e.g. my team has doubled in size when in the market there has been layoffs. \n\nThen you have the added layer of business buying to research. \n\nBut this is largely due to current economic conditions, I don’t agree with your “user researchers, as a role, is fading out” it’s just one of those roles that most company leaders see as a luxury so is one of the first to go in redundancy rounds.\n\nBut if you want someone with deep understanding of methodologies beyond that of a user test and a survey that knows about bias and objectivity then get a researcher.",

A good portion of that is because of organizational issues - executives telling their respective teams what is going to happen, for whom, and by when. This is a widespread corporate culture problem. The other portion comes from a lack of training/desire/curiosity on the part of PMs. Many people are uncomfortable with uncertainty and asking someone who is not trained in cognitive science to package that up to sell to their colleagues is a hard thing to do. Research is all about uncertainty, and finding comfort in that uncertainty to provide insights. \n\nTo put it bluntly, researchers know there might not be an easily captured answer to a question. PMs live and die by being able to answer a question explicitly. If the PM is doing actual research, then the culture is built to allow for it. Most aren’t. So most PMs aren’t.",

I used to coach mixed discipline teams in doing (lower stakes) research (properly), including quite senior product managers. This was at a streaming service where I worked. There were/are lots of UXRs. Over my 14 year career, most PMs have wanted to be involved in research (as they should), but not to conduct it themselves. It takes time, it's also important to do it well. \nI think there's a balance though. Not all research is equal (in terms of the skills required), and it takes people literally years of just focussing on research to get good at the more complicated stuff. It's not a side hustle. I don't know you can do the bigger pieces of research you might need, as well as manage the product at the same time. In places Ive worked we've had a mix of projects we have helped other conduct pre tactical work, (usability etc), while leaving us to do the more complex or heavy weight strat work. That's often worked well, but still requires upskilling most people. \nAs a UXR I've got skills in product management, service design, and UCD, but these help me help those teams better, so our work is more integrated. It's important to have a mix, but I couldn't take those roles in any ethical sense. ",

I checked LinkedIn profiles of people who were in similar roles, and if anyone was generous enough to mention type of product problems they solved in their bio and that resonated with me , I made a connection request. I am guilty of not going ahead with follow ups when initial messages were unanswered though.   \n3. ADPList was suggested to me by a friend who did find a mentor on that platform after much trial and error. You can try that  \n4. As of today, I am heavily relying on LLM (I use perplexity) as my guide/mentor and so far the bond has been going good (:P).

      "text": "I was recently transferred into a Technical Product Manager role focused on building AI agents and automations.\n\nBefore this, I was on our people analytics team working on machine learning, employee selection assessments, and employee listening. I have a coding background, and when GPT dropped in late 2022 I started building small Python tools and automations. That quickly turned into larger internal apps and experiments.\n\nMost of what I built never shipped. Not because it was bad, but because HR preferred maintaining the status quo. Over the last 6 to 9 months, I built several weekend projects purely out of interest. One could have replaced a vendor we paid ~$200k/year for, with better UX, better auditability, and lower risk. Another would have saved ~$30k YoY. I shared demos internally and in AI communities at my job. Internally, it was mostly radio silence.\n\nI kept building anyway, mostly for my portfolio.\nA month or two later, my manager told me to apply for an internal role. Turns out leadership had seen my work and wanted me in it. I got the role, and now I work with a team of devs I already collaborate with in an AI community where we share research, experiments, and memes. For example, I recently posted about how moving to a larger embedding model actually degraded performance due to dimensionality issues.\n\n\nNow I’m looking for advice from folks who have been here before:\nWhat should I be watching out for from a stakeholder management perspective, especially in AI-heavy products?\nAny open source or lightweight tools people like for project tracking?\nAny advice for working with leadership when automation may eventually reduce headcount?",

I'm also mentoring a guy in a similar situation to you right now.\n\nIt's great that you got the job but you need to focus on your product craft. It's a new skill and what got you into this career line won't be the thing that helps you grow.\n\nAwesome PMs are fantastic at understanding business context, strategy and can make tradeoffs quickly and efficiently. Your goal is to become less of a doer and instead become someone who can delegate and work cross functionality.\n\nSo the first thing to do in your space is build relationships with stakeholders and potential future stakeholders. Next be a key part of the product team, participate and get involved outside your area of ownership.\n\nStart thinking long term, what does my space look like 1-2 years from now and how can I get buy in for that vision and strategy. \n\nDon't make the mistake of assuming you have buy in from anyone.",

AI agents often look great in demos, but the real friction shows up in edge cases, handoffs, and when something goes wrong and no one owns the customer impact. I have seen stakeholder tension rise when leadership optimizes for efficiency metrics while support or ops is left managing the fallout from partial or incorrect automation. It helps to make failure modes visible early, not just accuracy or cost savings, but what happens when the agent is wrong and who absorbs that cost. On the headcount side, framing automation as load shaping rather than pure reduction tends to keep conversations more grounded. Teams are usually more open when the narrative is about fewer repeat issues and cleaner escalation paths, not replacing people.",

I have lots of confidence in the work I do, but my sphere of influence isn't big enough to cover the product end to end. Lots of \"Okay, I did my part...now do yours\" happens in business and unfortunately trust in that handoff is low pretty often.\n\nCustomer Service teams don't pick up the phone or respond to emails. Marketing teams botch an announcement. Google changes its mind and buries you on Page 4 for a couple weeks. An executive goes off script at a conference, lies about the product, and then says a racial slur. The tech debt you were very vocal about resolving first, but told not to concern yourself with because it was someone else's to manage. Delays you had no hand in. So many ways a product can fail that you have ZERO control over and no amount of contingency plan, failsafe, redundancy protocol, or blood sacrifice will prevent it. \n\nWe do our best to be 100% confident in our work, but we realize that we're all mostly taking educated guesses and then placing a bet without posted odds.",

If you are a senior, I'm just going to focus on your experience.  What did you build?  Why did you build it?  What did you learn when you did it?  What mistakes did you make?  What would you do differently?\n\nIf we spend 30 minutes talking about products you were directly involved in, I will know everything I need to know about how good of a PM you are.\n\nI've also done my share of interns.  Of course, they've never built anything serious so you can't ask about that.  What I ask are theoretical questions.  \"You are the PM for X.  I am your target user persona.  Interview me to see if you should build feature Y.\"    Again, after thirty minutes, I know how your head works.  That's what matters.\n\nThere are three things that determine if you can do a job (any job):\n\n1. Ability\n2. Experience\n3. Knowledge\n\nStandard certs only give you #3, knowledge.  However #1 and #2 are your best indicators for success.  #3 is also the easiest to fix.  If you suck at estimating, I can send you to an estimating class.  If you are not passionate about customers, I can't fix that.  Juniors are interviewed to see if they have #1.  If they do, #2 will come and I can give them #3.  Seniors should have #1 and #2.  If you have been doing this job then I assume you know how to learn and #3 will take care of it's self.\n\nSo, no.  I don't interview based on knowledge.  It's pointless.\n\nApologies if this offends folks, just relating my personal experience.\n\nOh, BTW, if you want to know why this technique works, read this book:  [https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU](https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU)",

But only if the education attacks your blind spots instead of polishing your badge wall.\n\nLong-winded answer: As a long-time PM, former programmer, now with a front-row seat to training and coaching, here's how I see the blind spots shake out across four common JTBDs and personas.\n\n(*Buckle up kids, I'm pretty passionate about this particular topic so this is going to go really long*)\n\nI've watched (and lived) what happens when technical backgrounds get dragged into the cold fluorescent light of business reality. Unit economics that bite back. Market forces that don't care how elegant your architecture is. Pricing and positioning that feel less like spreadsheets and more like knife fights in a dark parking lot. Business cases where you learn the difference between \"this is cool\" and \"this gets funded.\" Stuff that rewires how you see the problem through a P&L lens, not just how you format the PRD.\n\nI've witnessed (with some schadenfreude) MBA-types sweat when they have to drag strategy down from the mountaintop and make it survive first contact with engineers who actually build things. Discovery that doesn't devolve into cosplay. Shaping work so it can actually ship instead of dying as a catchy positioning statement. Turning narrative into decision instead of another deck that fossilizes in Confluence. Learning that execution isn't beneath strategy, it's where strategy goes to get judged.\n\nI've observed people from design or support backgrounds grow product leadership teeth. Real teeth. Prioritization under real constraint with real economic and strategic leverage. Surviving feature-hostage negotiations with sponsors and stakeholders by saying no ... or at least not yet ... without napalming trust. Translating raw customer pain into financial and opportunity trade-offs that hold up when the CFO squints and the CEO asks, \"And then what?\" Empathy, yes. But empathy with a balance sheet taped to it.\n\nAnd I've seen marketing and sales folks slow down long enough to learn how the sausage actually gets made. Learn the how Design thinking combined with Systems thinking avoids expensive failures. Deliberate delivery in trade-offs rather than HiPPO tirades. Technical feasibility conversations that don't end in promises engineering never made and that are metaphysically impossible. Living inside ambiguity longer than a quarterly quota permits. Learning that not everything persuasive is possible, not everything possible is worth building, and that PM is more than feeding the feature factory's endless appetite.\n\nPoint is: good education doesn't teach you new words. It gives you new scars. It fills gaps you didn't know were load-bearing and makes you uncomfortable in productive ways.\n\nThe certs you listed do exactly what they're designed to do. They teach the commonly Googled. The shared vocabulary. The stuff that clears HR filters and makes everyone nod in meetings. Useful. Necessary. Not sufficient if you want to advance into product leadership.\n\nSo yes, education can be worth it. Just don't collect it like trading cards. Find the kind that forces you to confront the parts of the job you've been avoiding.\n\nI'd name specific programs and training vendors, but this sub has prohibitions to keep this channel from becoming a billboard for unpaid shilling and low-effort spam. Full disclosure: I now teach product management after decades as a PM who waited too long to fill the business-side gaps I didn't know were load-bearing.\n\nTLDR: Fill gaps. Don't collect credentials.",

XD, but it worked)\n\nThe place I am currently at is very disorganised and unstructured in that sense.

It's boring, repetitive, and it should feel a bit heavy. Here is the 'workout' that actually moved the needle for me:\n\n1. Forensic Strategy: Don’t just read the news. When a company like Slack changes its pricing or Netflix buys a gaming studio, don't just say 'cool.' Force yourself to map out exactly what they are giving up to make that move. What are they deprioritizing? Who are they willing to piss off?\n\n2. The 'Where Not to Play' Rule: Pick a product you use every day. Write down three features they should build, and then force yourself to pick the two they should never touch—and defend why. Strategy shows up in the 'no's.'\n\n3. Paper Trading: Write your logic down. If you don't commit it to paper, your brain will trick you into thinking you 'knew it all along' once the results come in.\n\nForget the lectures. You don't need another framework; you need reps. You need to pressure-test your judgment until the trade-offs start feeling obvious.",

A lot of PM work is waiting, observing, connecting dots and making sure the right things happen, not staying busy. If you want to use that time better, I’d focus on digging deeper into user problems, sharpening requirements, talking more with stakeholders and proactively shaping what’s coming next instead of reacting.",

You can respond to the stakeholders with something like \"Unless we believe new feedback could materially change the decision, I think it’s responsible to place the bet and monitor outcomes\".\n\nI agree that deep user feedback is critical — but one thing that’s helped me is being explicit about **when feedback is “directionally sufficient” vs. when it’s still exploratory**.\n\nI try to separate three phases clearly with stakeholders:\n\n**1) Discovery → are we learning anything new?**  \nOnce feedback starts repeating and new inputs no longer change the decision set, I treat that as *signal saturation*. At that point, more feedback increases confidence marginally but delays action materially.\n\n**2) Decision readiness → do we have enough to place a bet?**  \nI anchor on a small set of decision criteria up front (user impact, business impact, risk, reversibility). If additional feedback wouldn’t change the choice against those criteria, we move forward.\n\n**3) Validation → what will we monitor post-decision?**  \nInstead of extending discovery, we shift feedback collection into leading indicators and guardrails after launch.\n\nThis framing has helped reset expectations: the goal isn’t *maximum* feedback, it’s *sufficient* feedback to make a responsible decision and learn forward.\n\nFor future, you could create a decision criteria upfront and then you can use \"We agreed on the decision criteria upfront. At this point, additional feedback isn’t changing how the options score against those criteria.”\n\nHope this is helpful!

Now I already have a thought in mind of what problem space looks like and how we might go about addressing it. I present a pitch of the problem space, why it is important to solve, and what is the financial upside. If leadership wants more data, I go get it later, but they usually don't.\n\n2.

Progressive exposure based on usage tends to outperform big announcements.\n\nWhat backfires most often are full screen announcements and forced walkthroughs. Existing users especially hate being interrupted for something they didn’t ask for, and many will just dismiss it on reflex and never revisit the feature.\n\n“New” badges can work, but only if they decay quickly. If everything is marked new for weeks, users stop seeing them altogether.\n\nIn app release notes are underrated. Not as a primary driver, but as a safe place for curious users to self educate without being pushed.\n\nThe pattern I’ve seen succeed is gentle, contextual, and easy to ignore.

Used CleverX to get the right user segments fast - worked well for getting specific types of users quickly. Learned that most people just don't read announcements or changelogs at all.\n\nWhat actually worked after that research: contextual \"new\" badges where the feature lives. Not fullscreen announcements (people swipe those away in under 2 seconds). Show the hint when users are doing something related, not randomly.\n\nAlso selective emails to existing users worked okay. We did one for a major feature and got decent adoption.

If you truly wanted to optimize for what’s outlined here, your best route is to overly and needlessly nurture relationships with each individual engineer so they give you good marks.  Ultimately this is framing things in a vacuum.  (1) PRD Quality is 99% of the time not the reason why a sprint might go over in my experience - this is not very measurable - how unclear was the PRD? How much exactly did that lack of clarity contribute to the delay? (2) Sprint scope contribution - how close you are with the tech lead? How exactly were your contributions meaningful? It might almost bias you to forcefully contribute when you have no idea what you’re talking about.  (3) Responsiveness - are your notifications on and do your engineers like you. (6) Do your engineers like you\n\n(4,5) These motivate you to overestimate sprints and initiatives.  If you’re only measured by if a sprint has completed, might as well sandbag and get “100% sprint completion and on time delivery” every time.  This also only works well for incredibly mature products which have very far line of sight and deep team understanding.  This would be ridiculous to measure for any greenfield product or at a startup - you don’t know what you don’t know and that’s ok.  Be antifragile and deal with new information properly.  Delays happen, but you should push towards a business result. \n\nAll in all I think the only way to properly measure a PM is by their ability to drive impact.  Have them set an OKR, make sure it’s specific, relevant, and measurable.  Make sure they’re not sand bagging by breaking down assumptions.  And track the teams performance against that OKR.  Ultimately the PM is responsible for the success or failure of a product.  You could be 100% sprint complete for the whole quarter, have the clearest PRD, run scrums like a machine and deliver a failed product - you shouldn’t reward or optimize for this.\n\nI’ve never seen a scorecard system like this before (fintech 2 large cos and 2 startups) and quite frankly think it misses the essence of what a PM is responsible for.",

Everyone will score very highly and then get laid off in the next downcycle.**\n\n**1) waste of time;  \"a shared document is not a shared understanding\"** (Jeff Patton, user story mapping)  \nIndividuals interacting is what matters, not verbose detail.  If you need verbose detail, split the story.  Remember when we used 3x5 index cards?  That constraint was there for a good reason.  Bloated verbose stories NEVER work and always have errors.  Small slicing feels less efficient but has fewer slips, lapses, mistakes and rework.\n\n2) **No such thing as Sprint Scope; you have a Sprint Goal that is based on a (measurable) business outcome,**  Measure that outcome, and use that as the basis for performance.  That's the only thing that matters.  Deliver multiple times within a Sprint to get feedback on your progress towards the goal.  Ruthlessly improve your DveOps and XP practices until that's a reality.   \n  \n**3) waste of time.**  STOP using JIRA as a communication channel.  Talk to each other, a lot.  Involve the developers in user story mapping.  Don't give them solutions to implement.  Written communication is always less effective, with delays and comprehension layers.  If you work is so unsafe you need to CYA, fix that first.   \n  \n**4) Kind of agree on this**;  UAT is your last-line-of-defense as part of your layered \"shift left, build quality in\" mindset.  But it's the whole team here, not the PM - escaped defects bad is a good idea though.  Don't blame the goal keeper because the attackers, midfield and defenders didn't keep control of the ball.   \n  \n**5) utter bollocks.** This is nothing to do with Scrum or effectiveness in the role.  Allowing this kind of bollocks into your org is already a red flag that the SMs are not effective at educating or influencing the org,  Where's the stuff on team learning and growth?  Nah.   \n  \n6) **I like this better** but it really should be something you as a team talk about in your retrospectives, always \n\n**7) \"Post release activities\"  lol.**  \nMeasure the value you created within the Sprint.

Basically, I run e-vals using the AI to get a score on different criteria. The tricky part is that if I run these evaluations multiple times, I often get different results each time. For example, one run might flag certain issues and another run will catch a completely different set of issues or give me a different pass rate.\n\nThis leaves me in a weird spot because I’m not sure if I’m actually improving the product or just seeing random variance in the AI’s scoring. Other than running the AI multiple times and averaging the results (or taking a union of all the different failures it spots), I’m not sure how to get a consistent measure.\n\nHas anyone else faced this kind of inconsistency when using AI for evaluation? I’d love to hear if there are smarter ways to stabilize the scores or any best practices to make sure I can trust the results over time. Thanks!",

          "text": "Yeah, this is a really common pain point, and you’re not doing anything wrong.\n\nWhat you’re running into is that LLMs are probabilistic, so unless you lock things down, variance is a feature, not a bug. If you treat the output like a deterministic test, it’ll drive you a bit mad.\n\nA few things that usually help in practice:\n\nFirst, tighten the evaluation prompt way more than feels natural. Explicit rubrics, scoring scales with definitions, and examples of what a “good” vs “bad” answer looks like reduce variance a lot. Vague criteria almost guarantee drift run to run.\n\nSecond, fix everything you can. Temperature as low as possible, same model version, same prompt ordering, same input formatting. Small differences compound more than people expect.\n\nThird, stop thinking of a single run as truth. What tends to work better is treating evals as trend signals. If scores move consistently over time across multiple runs, you’re improving. If they bounce randomly, you probably aren’t. Averaging or majority voting is boring, but effective.\n\nFourth, separate discovery from measurement. Let the model be loose and exploratory when you want to find issues. Then lock down a stricter eval for tracking progress. Mixing those two goals in one judge usually causes confusion.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen eventually accept that AI judges are closer to noisy sensors than unit tests. Once you design around that reality, confidence comes from consistency of direction, not identical scores every run.",

                  "text": "Got it, that context helps.\n\nAt a high level, your evals look like they’re trying to do two jobs at once: explore whether a question is interesting and judge whether it meets a fixed standard. That’s where the noise creeps in.\n\nOn the discovery vs measurement point, think of it like this. In discovery mode, you let the evaluator be opinionated and loose. You ask things like “what’s weak here,” “what feels off,” or “what would confuse a PM.” You expect variance because you’re learning. Those outputs are for insight, not scoring.\n\nMeasurement mode is much narrower. You freeze the criteria and only ask things that can be judged consistently. For example, instead of “is this a good product question,” you score specific dimensions like clarity of prompt, presence of a real tradeoff, and whether there’s enough context to make a decision. Each dimension should be something the evaluator can say yes or no to with minimal interpretation.\n\nIf I were to improve one eval, I’d start by removing any language that asks the model to infer intent or quality holistically. Replace it with concrete checks. Does the question force a prioritization decision. Does it include constraints. Is there a clear failure mode. Those tend to be much more stable run to run.\n\nOnce you separate those two modes, the system usually feels a lot saner. You explore with one prompt, then measure progress with a much stricter, almost boring one.",

Get a human judge to score the product on the same criteria you’re asking your LLM as a judge to score the outputs against. Then check for agreeability between the human and AI scores. You will start to spot whether there’s a correlation, and you can refine your prompt if not. Keep doing this until you have an acceptable level of agreeability between human and AI. LLM outputs are indeed probabilistic as others have pointed out here, but you can try to reduce the variance with stricter definitions and continuous evaluation.",
