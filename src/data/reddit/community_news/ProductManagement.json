But I'm curious why people who seem to have stable 300K jobs in big tech are out piggy backing those names to sell courses on Maven and elsewhere.  Is the job not good enough where they then want to take learning funds from the rest of the Fortune 500 just to teach them stuff that is freely available on YouTube?\n\nI'm all for courses if valuable and self learning, but if you're getting paid 300K ten years in to be a semi-fluffy PM doing talks all week, and have the time to work on a course...how busy is your day job really?",

                  "text": "I didn't design it. It evolved.\n\nThe starting point was frustration. I had context scattered between JIRA tickets, Confluence pages, Slack threads, meeting notes, half-baked strategy docs. So every time someone asked me a question, I'd spend 20 minutes hunting for the thing I knew I'd written down somewhere.\n\nSo I started dumping everything into Obsidian. I used Tiago Forte's PARA method for structure - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Here's decent blog about it on the Todoist blog, though I don't actually use Todoist 😶\n\n[https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method)\n\nI pointed Claude Code at the vault, which reads and writes local files. You give it a CLAUDE.md file that explains the vault - what the folders are, who the key people are, the rules. Never write to JIRA directly, etc., and I tell it things like \"when I paste a Slack message, summarize it, connect it to what we already know, and add to-do's for me as needed.\"\n\nThat CLAUDE.md file is the whole trick. Without it, the AI improvises and you get garbage. With it, the AI behaves. There's a good guide on writing one.\n\n[https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md)\n\nFor external tools - JIRA, Confluence - I don't use MCP servers.  I use things like this and tell the agent how to interact with it:\n\n[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)\n\nLike I said, you can create agent files for specific jobs - strategy review, competitive analysis, meeting prep. Each one loads additional context on top of the base instructions.\n\n[https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase](https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase)\n\nDay-to-day, it's pretty simple. I open a terminal in my vault. I paste a Slack message. I say \"what do we know about this?\" The agent searches my notes, JIRA tickets, decision logs, meeting notes, Confluence pages, and gives me a connected answer with links to the source files. If it finds something worth keeping, it writes a note in the right folder.\n\nI don't need to worry about complicated things like RAG or vector DB's, embeddings. The context window on current models is big enough that reading files directly works fine. For a PM-scale knowledge base (a few hundred notes) file search and grep is plenty. Other people are arriving at the same setup independently.\n\n[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557)\n\nIf you want to try it: start with Obsidian and PARA. Just folders and markdown. Then install Claude Code (or Github Copilot CLI) and write a CLAUDE.md. After you start using it the system will shape itself around your actual work.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "My approach:\n\nI had Claude Code go through thousands of call transcripts, synthesize them into batch insight reports, then build a holistic picture of patterns across all of it.\n\nThen in [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) I dictated my full context. Goals, projects, what I wanted help with. Had it interview me extensively, then help me build out a detailed project prompt based on everything I told it.\n\nFrom there I set up a Claude project. Put the instructions in, added insights as markdown files, uploaded all my artifacts. Dozens of files, frameworks, reference material. Gave it the full picture.\n\nTurning on memory for the project made a big difference. This is separate from project knowledge. Memory lets Claude retain context across conversations, so it remembers decisions you've made, preferences you've stated, things you've told it to track. Without it, every new conversation starts from zero even if your docs are loaded.\n\nBut you have to actively maintain it. I regularly check what Claude has stored, correct anything that's off, and add new context as things change. Set it and forget it doesn't work. Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe other habit that changed everything was prompting Claude to pull specific artifacts before answering. Instead of just asking a question and hoping it grabs the right context, I'll say \"reference this doc and then answer\" or \"pull up the framework before you respond.\" Sounds small but the difference in output quality is massive. Without that, Claude answers from general knowledge. With it, it answers from YOUR context.\n\nTo answer your specific question, I'm not doing a RAG setup. For most PM use cases that's overkill unless you're working with massive datasets that change constantly. What's working for me is the combo of a well-structured project prompt + uploaded reference docs + memory + Claude's built-in search. Handles 90% of what I need without any infrastructure.\n\nwhat actually matters in practice: spend the time on your project prompt and keep your memory clean. That's your foundation. I prob spent 4 hours just getting the initial context right, having Claude interview me, building the prompt collaboratively, uploading the right docs. If your instructions are vague, it doesn't matter how many files you upload. If your instructions are specific and your memory is current, even a basic setup works surprisingly well.\n\nThat's my approach today, but at this rate it'll all change in 30 days when the next model update comes out. :P",

I've been using Google Docs to keep track of PRDs (that were generated by Claude). That gave me the idea of creating a RAG setup. So I've created a setup that currently pulls from Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Adding Sheets + Slides was easy once I decided to add Docs. I use Voyage for embeddings and Haiku (to save money) for inference. And I added a Tiptap editor with some premade prompts (eg: write a PRD or tell me what to build next) that also uses the context and then gives an output. It's a super-duper basic setup and I'm still refining it, but I'm hoping to get it working really well for my own app.\n\nI'm going to add Jira and GitHub, but at this point I need feedback from some real users so I've reached out to some PM friends. Two of them work in big tech so I'm not sure they'll get approval to try it at work but fingers crossed. If anybody specifically uses Google Docs/Sheets/Slides and would like to try my app out please send me a DM!\n\nI think Claude projects feels a bit weird because it makes sense for persistent context (like coding standards), but otherwise you don't want persistent context for product background (like PRDs) and the project-level memory feels opaque in terms of how it's populated and not really a RAG setup.\n\nSomething else I heard a friend do is just use Cursor and dump everything in there. They said as long as that repo (if shared) or folder is well-maintained they were getting a good amount done.",

That is a communication barrier that you can't overcome by being useless in meetings and looking stuff up later.\n\n\nYou're a PM. Part of your skill set is *building* expertise when you don't have it. It sounds like the team has technical expertise, so your job becomes using it.\n\n\nI say this as a comparatively very technical PM. I build my own data pipelines, I lead architectural discussions, I've coded live customer facing apps (without ChatGPT). I've also worked with a lot of developers and in your exact scenario I would have just said \"I'm not familiar with those terms, what's the difference.\" The lead explains it to me, I sketch out that explanation against the business problem at hand (it either doesn't matter which we do or one is better than the other because x). Decision done.\n\n\nNot everyone knows everything and you are NOT a developer. You're going to know less no matter how much of a \"Technical PM\" you are unless you were formerly a developer yourself. You need to understand and own up to that while still getting the answers you do need. CI/CD, DNS, migration patterns, gateways, logging practices, data consistency, caching, data contracts, versioning... the list of things you don't know will never end, so your strategy for dealing with it has to take that into account.\n\n\nI'm not surprised you feel like the team is losing faith in you - maybe it's true. i\nIt's not the fact that you can't participate in the architectural debates (which maybe you can't... yet), but that by hiding your ignorance the team doesn't know what you do and don't know and it makes you a poor collaborator. THAT'S the problem you need to fix.\n\n\nFrankly I'd suggest doing this immediately - first, in your next meeting write whatever you don't know down. You don't need to change anything yet, just get stuff to work from. Write down what you think it is. Then set up a 1-on-1 with your lead and walk him through your understanding. \"Hey. I'm realizing a lot of this terminology is new to me, so I'm going to be doing a bit of knowledge building and being more overt in asking questions in our discussions so I can give better answers. Here's what I have so far, how close/far am I?\". Next meeting you participate in, start weaponizing your ignorance. \"These options sound fine on the technical level but I'm not following where the actual trade-off is. Is it performance? Scalability? Observability?\" Etc. Start learning and leveraging the team's expertise to explain what you don't know to you.\n\n\nHopefully you get the idea.",

It’s clear there’s a 1–2 year vision in their head.\n\nOn one hand, I appreciate it. Knowing where we *might* go helps avoid painting ourselves into a corner.\n\nOn the other hand, every time we try to scope V1, those future ideas creep back in:\n\n* “We should design this so it supports X later.”\n* “What if in a year we want to do Y?”\n* “Let’s structure it in a way that won’t block Z.”\n\nAnd suddenly our “simple first version” becomes a semi-abstract, overly flexible thing that takes twice as long to build. I’m struggling with the balance between being strategically responsible vs. over-engineering for a future that might not happen\n\nWhere’s the line? Is this:  \nA) A VP asking for too much too early  \nB) A normal tension that good PMs know how to manage  \nC) A skill gap on my side (modular thinking? better framing? better pushback?)\n\nI don’t want to just say “not now” to someone two levels above me. I’d rather level up if there’s a better way to absorb long-term vision without slowing short-term delivery.\n\nFor those who’ve navigated this:\n\n* How do you separate “future-proofing” from “future-fantasizing”?\n* Do you explicitly document what you’re *not* solving yet?\n* Are there frameworks/books that helped you architect in phases instead of trying to build the final form from day one?\n\nWould genuinely appreciate experienced takes.

          "text": "Oh boy, my favorite question that I’ve encountered continuously throughout my career and addressed based on context, but by following these same patterns, sorry if my answer is a little wordy.\n\nSo I’m also a VP (and have over a decade of PM experience) and I operate this way for one primary reason. I try to spare my team what I call deferred complexity. \n\nProduct is hard because we’re solving for now and later at the same time. If we only optimize for the immediate use case, we often create structural constraints that force expensive rework 6 to 12 months down the road. That said, there’s a difference between:\n\nDesigning clean seams that allow future expansion AND Building future features into V1\n\nOnly the first one is responsible architecture. The second is scope creep.\n\nA simple example I love to reuse 😂:\n\nYou are building role-based permissions for a single user type.\n\nIf you hardcode logic around that one role because “that’s all we need today,” it feels faster.\n\nBut 12 months later, when you introduce multi-role access or enterprise hierarchies, you now have permission logic embedded everywhere. You aren’t adding a feature. You’re untangling your own shortcuts.\n\nThat’s deferred complexity. And it’s painful. The better middle ground:\n\n• Build for one role in V1\n• But structure permissions as a service or abstraction layer\n• Document explicitly: “We are not solving multi-role yet.” - create the future epics as shells.\n\nNow you’ve preserved speed without boxing yourself in. If your VP is constantly expanding scope, that’s a problem. If they’re asking for clean extensibility without feature expansion, that’s architectural maturity.\n\nA tactic that works well:\n\nWhen long-term ideas come up, say:\n“Let’s capture that as an architectua constraint and confirm we’re only building the minimal implementation for V1.”\n\nBy doing this you acknowledge vision, protect delivery, and make tradeoffs and dependencies explicit. The tension itself isn’t a red flag, imo. The lack of clarity about what’s architectural runway vs. feature scope is.\n\nSorry for the wall of text but I also teach and write on the side. 😊",

If they hand me a crisp V1 and can articulate how it scales later without rework, that’s maturity.\n\nYou’re exactly right that “optimal V1” and “multi-role future” can be at odds.

              "text": "I actually strongly disagree here. But this is a recent shift. \n\nI think AI is changing how we work which will blur the lines between engineers, designers and PMs. \n\nI think the shift will take us from doing work to orchestrating it. \n\nIf you're saying that the core of the role is to really drive the strategy up, down and across your organisation and get the right things built the right way, then that's fair enough. \n\nBut if you are any more specific than that, then we're probably at odds. \n\nI think PMs will increasingly design and ship things. Simple front end changes won't need engineers nor designers and when we work together, we'll likely automate documentation by having meeting notes converted into project posters, specs etc. \n\nAnd even if it's just engineers pushing out more work with agents, this will change the role as the cost to deliver will decline sharply. This changes our role because so much of what we do is to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing or building the right thing the wrong way. \n\nBasically, a lot of our role is to manage investments where costs are high. But if that changes, so does our ability to return on that investment. \n\nI think we need to rethink the PM role from the ground up and if we don't, the PMs that can deliver more value will beat the old guard. \n\nThis will take some time and there will be lots of hype and snake oil before we see real changes. \n\nBut I think PM three years from now will be radically different. \n\nI might be agreeing with you more than I think, but I do think that we should feel more of a sense of urgency. \n\nI have a current goal of figuring out how I might ship a feature to prod. It will be small and I'll need to make sure it's not slop. But if agentic software development is half as good as my architects tell me, it should be doable.\n\nBut it's not about the feature.

Whether it’s writing documentation, doing market research or writing code - AI delivers very little value wrapped in a lot of fluff and grandeur. Unfortunately, this is also exactly what shitty PM’s in big organizations do, and historically are rewarded for it - so we are looking at the machine-powered amplification of utter bullshit, now coming at us from every direction with supersonic speed.\n\nIt will become a reality simply because the decision makers are mostly clueless, and the ones depending on them value their paycheck more than true efficiency of some company they don’t own. VC investors are drooling over AI use because it kinda sounds like a market differentiator and their grandkids generated a cute cat with ChatGPT once, so they put pressure on boards. Boards are mostly lobotomized by the time they get in this position, so they are simply not qualified to estimate quality - they just hear about the end result for 10 minutes every quarter and nod. Mid-senior management doesn’t give a shit, but they like their salaries and want to hide the fact that they are a useless organizational layer for longer, so they will pressure individual contributors to use AI. Individual contributors will happily shit out hoards of AI text and documents to simulate productivity and beg for a promotion because of all this fantastic productivity. I’ve literally pip’d a tech lead for using ChatGPT for anything he wrote last year, but I guess these days it’s a virtue. \n\nHonestly, I have given up. If people collectively want to do a subpar job and waste all of this planet’s resources to write a ticket explaining how to center the company logo on the page, and then jerk each other offer about how productive and fast “they” are by putting Gemini-generated research into Claude Code prompts - be my fucking guests. Just like I pretended to agree with the bald Silicon Valley fuck writing radical books about product management without shipping a single thing in the past 20 years, I can nod along when someone claims that a Replit mock-up is comparable to a production platform",

And the tech is improving faster than any tech we seen before. \n\nCurrently, PMs need to be proficient in prompting AI-driven apps that assemble software apps, like Lovable, Base44, Bubble, Zapier. Whichever one has a workflow that clicks with you. \nRemember, and tell everyone you work with: \n1. You are not a designer. They have UI and UX skills. You don’t and the LLMs don’t. \n2. You are not a developer. You can make a working prototype. But it absolutely won’t be perfomant or resilient. \n\nAnd remember basic product mgt; spend more time with users, understanding their goals and challenges. This knowledge will become increasingly valuable as administrative tasks like market research and document creation become more automated. \n\nI think this is what we need to skill up for now.",

I ingest granola meeting transcripts from cache to map them to themes in my work stream. I bring in Jira API to map already existing opportunities in product discovery to validate validate existing solutions or expose a gap. \n\nIn cursor itself I have a number of skills that I use to shortcut the discovery process:\n/Analyze-meeting\n/Build-opportunity\n/Build-solution\n/Build-PRD\n/convert-to-doc\n/context - all company info, role, module, workstream, stakeholders, and process are stored in markdown for the agent to consume. \n\nFull workflow is sync meeting transcript > align existing opportunities (or build new ones) > create solution > create lightweight PRD then convert .md to .doc. \n\nI’ll edit and refine all of them then push to Jira. Conversation to validated solution with spec doc in about 5 minutes. \n\nYes, it’s not out of the box solution but it solves my workflow. Sonnet 4.5 was capable of building it all in an afternoon just using plan mode. It runs on flask and SQLite everything stays on the company machine. The front end dashboard has the meeting context and aligned opportunities and a mind map of the entire jira space to see connections from product to engineering (I hate navigating jira). You could literally copy and paste this message into the chat and ask for plan mode and it will build it after a few tweaks.",

          "text": "I'm an interviewer at a fang. We do case studies. \n\n\nWe know the case study is not a real example of how you do product development, but product development is pretty tricky to interview for. The case study is a good proxy. \n\n\nWe can see what sort of questions you ask, we can see how you interact with other partners (in our case study, we have ux partners and product partners and often data partners), we can see how you lead a conversation, we can see how you think in real time. \n\n\nIs this perfect, certainly not. But it does give us a glimpse of how you behave in more of a \"real\" product environment.\n\n\nThe advice for cases I have is to have some sort of logical progression you're going to take everybody through. Typically it starts with some sort of customer problem exploration, at this stage I don't want you to zero in on one problem, typically I want to see you think through all the different customer problems that you can given the case is complexity and have some sort of ranking system where you bring everybody in the case study along to align on what the right problem to solve is. There's no real right answer here, but I want to see some sort of logic to why one of these problems should be solved versus all the others. This could involve some made-up business data severity of use case urgency of problem customer demand for feature, it really varies on the case, but the point is you have some way of prioritizing one problem above all the others and you bring everybody along.\n\n\nNext is potentially the most fun, you can start thinking about solutions now that you have a problem. Again, I don't want you to zero in on one solution, and if this is kind of a group case study, I want to see you ask other people's opinion, but you need to center around two or three reasonable solutions that limited in scope technically feasible and defensible in terms of rough CX for the problem you're solving. \n\n\nIf there's an engineer involved, I want to see you ask about feasibility, if there's a designer involved, I want you to ask their opinion about customer patterns, if there's a data person involved, I want you to ask questions about how you would measure success or different key metrics that you would look for, the point is to involve people. \n\n\nCase studies are usually also pretty time limited, something I'm looking for is can you manage time in a stressful situation. If you only get through problem Discovery and not solution and alignment, not a great look. If one stakeholder seems to be really focusing on one aspect of a problem, I want to see how you gracefully pivot them towards moving to the next challenge. \n\n\nAgain these are all proxies for the real skills you leverage is approx manager, but interviewing is a terrible process and we have to do the best we can. \n\n\nTo me, the case study is probably one of the more enjoyable interview steps. I can't stand doing star responses to generic questions and I don't like hearing them either haha",

Those are just the means. \n\n\nI think a lot of current professional development around PMS hyperfixate on specific objects like prds, or customer interview questions, or some magic roadmap format. Honestly in my opinion none of that matters. Use whatever PRD you can to get your idea across. Have a roadmap that makes sense to your stakeholders. If you waste time on perfecting those artifacts versus actually having a clear vision, you're going to have a whole bunch of style and no substance. \n\n\nNow of course it's hard to find the time to work on the substance, I probably only spend like 15% of my time actually doing that, but it's my favorite time and it's the most value add time.",

      "text": "My argument...it needs a bit of explanation.\n\nFirstly, AI is deflationary. What that means is that, by design, it commoditises execution. This is something that every business needs to defend in order to remain profitable. \n\nWhat is inflation anyway? Inflation is when there is too much money chasing goods and services i.e more people with cash want goods than there are goods in the world. So, prices rise because there's more competition for goods.\n\nOn the flip side, deflation is when there are too many goods chasing money i.e the market is flooded with \"stuff\" and not enough people want to pay for it.\n\nFor every product manager and business, this is a critical concept. It's life or death for a product or a business. Inflation is the norm. Deflation is dangerous.\n\nStick with me.\n\nForget everything about the whole \"AI replaces humans\" for a moment, and instead think about what happens when the barriers or \"moats\" around technology disappear.\n\nCompanies that had spent vast sums of money to build software are starting to see their \"moats\" slowly get filled with concrete.\n\nIndividuals are now able to build things in an hour that use to take whole teams weeks to create. Yes it might not be perfect, yet, but you have to consider the rate of innovation, not its current state. Humans are resourceful and there is infinite resources being poured into solving these problems. The will to progress is there and happening.\n\nBut what about distribution, brand strength or proprietary data moats? The thing with AI is that it is prolific. It enters every part of the chain.\n\nSo, AI creates a value problem. If moats disappear then there will be an oversupply of services. This will impact business' ability to make a profit and could result in many collapsing under the weight of easy competition.\n\nThese sorts of things happen slowly at first, and then happen rapidly. In my view, it's not a case of if, but when.\n\nNot all companies will suffer, many will gain that genuinely manage to hold onto their moat. And for those, they'll capture the remaining margin. The thing that many don't realise, is that economies can't handle big shocks like this because it means that governments have to print money, which increases the debt burden. In a deflationary environment, that isn't affordable. But that's a different conversation.\n\nThe question is: when the value of 'building the thing' drops to zero, how do we justify our products' existence?",

It's why every AI-generated strategy sounds plausible and none of it sounds like yours.\n\nProducts built on pure technical moats are in trouble, but they always were and also we can see so many OSS project taking over etc. But products built on deep user understanding, good niche context and sharp product thinking get *stronger*. Because now you can execute on good judgment instantly instead of waiting months for a team to ship it.\n\nThe companies that die aren't the ones whose moats get filled. They're the ones whose moats were only ever \"we built it first.\" The real moat was always knowing what to build. That just became the most valuable skill in the industry.\n\nSo imo PMs with good taste will become critical need.",

What I’m less convinced about is that cheaper execution automatically leads to products collapsing.\n\nWe’ve seen similar shifts before. When cloud infrastructure got dramatically cheaper, companies didn’t disappear en masse. When open source matured, it didn’t wipe out software businesses. When no-code tools lowered the barrier to building apps, it didn’t eliminate products — it multiplied them. What changed wasn’t the existence of products, but the basis of competition.\n\nMost successful products weren’t defensible purely because they were hard to build. They survived because they solved a real problem in a way people trusted, because they became embedded in workflows, because they built brand recognition, because they accumulated data and relationships over time. Those dynamics don’t vanish just because execution accelerates.\n\nAI absolutely compresses the cost of making things. That will erode thin wrappers and surface-level tools that existed mainly because building them required resources. But that’s not the same as killing products altogether. It just forces a separation between features that were artificially scarce and systems that create durable value.\n\nOversupply is a real risk, but supply has never been the only constraint. Attention is scarce. Trust is scarce. Distribution is scarce. Even if anyone can build something, not everyone can get it adopted, integrated, and relied upon. That friction still matters.\n\nIf building approaches zero marginal cost, the leverage shifts. The differentiator becomes problem selection, positioning, experience design, ecosystem strategy, and long-term value capture. In that environment, judgment compounds more than technical execution does.\n\nSo maybe the better question isn’t what happens when building becomes free. It’s what happens when everything becomes buildable. When that’s true, the scarce resource isn’t code. It’s clarity about what deserves to exist and why.",

Smaller teams can sometimes pivot faster because they have less to unwind.\n\nOn the “no precedent” point, I agree this feels different. AI touches cognitive work in a way past shifts didn’t. But every major tech wave felt unprecedented at the time. The internet, cloud, mobile. Each one disrupted pricing and wiped out categories. The system didn’t collapse, value just moved.\n\nCheaper execution doesn’t mean value disappears. It usually means it relocates. When building gets commoditized, differentiation shifts toward trust, brand, distribution, integration, and owned data. The businesses competing only on access to the underlying capability will struggle. The ones that build defensibility above that layer can still hold margin.\n\nThe transition could be messy. I just don’t see it as automatically catastrophic. It feels more like a reshuffling of where profit lives than the end of it.",

      "text": "I’m a PM at a large tech company working on a strategic initiative (AI-adjacent, high visibility). I joined about a year ago and had a strong first year with good performance rating, above-average variable pay, stock refresher, and positive feedback from leadership. I’ve been called a “high agency PM” and someone expected to grow into owning a major work track.\n\nMy manager is relatively new to people management (promoted \\~2 years back). He’s genuinely a nice guy, supportive in appraisals and comp discussions, and I don’t believe there’s evil intent in anything mentioned below.\n\nBut day-to-day, I’m struggling.\n\nHe is extremely involved in execution:\n\n\\-- He's always in panic and anxiety mode, doing the job of even program managers, seeking alignment, chasing timelines, engineering/design commitments\n\n\\-- I have 3-4 syncs with him during the day (even when he's working from home he keeps messaging) where we discuss our work tracks, he tells me what to prioritise and what to keep aside\n\n\\-- If I’m creating a doc/artifact, he creates his own version before I’m done.\n\n\\-- If I’m drafting a response for another leader, he drafts his own version in parallel.\n\n\\-- He reaches out to engineering, design or marketing spocs directly instead of routing through me when I know most of the answers since I'm working with them on ground.\n\n\\-- In Slack threads, he often responds before I do, even when I’m clearly the owner.\n\n\\-- In leadership reviews, he presents most of the material and answers most questions.\n\nRecently, I prepared extensively for a high-level meeting with very senior leadership (including the business head). I knew every detail and could answer every question. But my manager and engineering leads answered everything before I could speak. I left the meeting without saying a word.\n\nWe’ve discussed ownership before. He says he sees me as high-agency and wants me to grow. He has said he’ll step back. But under pressure (which is mostly the case in our work charter), he seems to revert to high involvement. It's come to appoint where I wish he goes on a long break so I can work and deliver features peacefully.\n\nThe tricky part is:\n\n\t•\tHe has supported me strongly in compensation and performance reviews.\n\n\t•\tI’m working on strategic AI initiatives that are high impact.\n\n\t•\tI don’t think he’s intentionally blocking me.\n\n\t•\tI’m not being treated poorly in formal processes.\n\nBut the daily experience feels like I’m the thinker/executor while he remains the visible voice. In our review meetings he always says how \"the team\" has a lot to deliver and we've come a long way, how I'm a great value add to the team, but I feel I'm not operating at my true potential.\n\nAnother complication: my skip-level leader (his manager) is someone who forms perceptions quickly. I worry that discussing with him could unintentionally damage my manager’s reputation or promotion trajectory. That’s not something I want to do even slightly.\n\nAt the same time, I’m starting to lose work satisfaction because of the duplication, panic urgency, lack of clear authorship and this mom treatment (checking in on my work, suggesting me what to do, asking for updates multiple times during the day).\n\nSo I’m trying to think clearly about my options:\n\n\t1.\tHave a very direct confrontation about boundaries and duplication, maybe even call out his anxiety or panic issues?\n\n\t2.\tStay and design around this behavior (process clarity, ownership agreements, etc.) and keep bugging him till it's established?\n\n\t3.\tQuietly explore switching teams?\n\n\t4.\tReach out to skip-level?\n\n\t5.\tConsider leaving altogether?\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in similar situations:\n\nHow do you distinguish between first-time manager anxiety and a real growth ceiling?\n\nCan someone actually grow under a highly involved manager like this?\n\nIs this something that typically improves over time, or does it harden?\n\nAt what point is switching teams the smarter move?\n\nWould appreciate candid advice from experienced PMs or leaders who’ve seen both sides of this dynamic.",

          "text": "First off, I'm sorry you're in this situation.  \n  \nI've seen this pattern a lot. And the frustrating part is your manager probably isn't doing this on purpose. He's doing it because he's anxious, because he hasn't learned how to lead without doing, and because jumping in feels like helping. It's not. But it feels like it to him.\n\nHere's my take\n\nStop thinking about this as a confrontation. That word is already setting you up to come in hot. This is a partnership conversation.\n\nAnd don't just spring it on him. Nothing makes the air get sucked out of a room faster than \"hey, we need to talk.\" Instead, lead with exactly what the conversation is about: \"Hey, I want to have a conversation about how we work together day to day.\" Simple. Clear. No ambiguity. Then ask permission to share your observations. Something like \"I've noticed some patterns in how we're splitting work and I'd love to share what I'm seeing. Are you open to that?\" Getting that explicit yes before you go in lets you be honest without them feeling blindsided. Changes the whole dynamic.\n\nThen get specific. \"We're duplicating effort on docs, Slack responses, and stakeholder conversations and I think it's slowing us both down. Can we get clear on who owns what?\" No accusations. No \"you're micromanaging me.\" Just a clean practical framing about efficiency.\n\nDon't leave that conversation without concrete ownership agreements. Who owns first drafts. Who responds in Slack threads. Who leads which meetings. Write it down.\n\nOn the meeting thing, that one stings but you kinda let it happen. Next time you prep for a leadership meeting, tell your manager beforehand: \"I've got deep context here, I'd love to take the lead on questions.\" Don't wait for the mic. Claim it ahead of time.\n\nOn the skip level, hold off. You haven't had the real conversation with your manager yet. Have the direct version first. If nothing changes in 4-6 weeks then the skip level becomes a reasonable next step.\n\nFirst-time managers revert under pressure. That's not permanent but it means you're gonna have to re-establish boundaries more than once. The question isn't whether he reverts. It's whether he's open to the feedback and tries to correct.\n\nDon't leave yet. You've got a manager who supports you in comp and reviews, you're on high visibility AI work, and you haven't pushed on this hard enough to know if it can change. Try the direct conversation, set clear ownership, claim your space, and give it a real shot. If in 2-3 months you're still leaving meetings without saying a word, then start exploring. But right now you've got more leverage than you think.\n\nHappy to be a sounding board if you need help scripting out this conversation before you have it. Feel free to DM me.",

I mentioned I wasn't used to that under previous mgr and while I know everyone has their style I can't help but feel like I'm not meeting expectations somehow. Given my seniority I would have expected my d2d to be self managed and to just keep her informed through weekly updates or ad hoc notes as needed or if decisions or escalations are required.  I asked if that's her expectation too or if there was something I needed to work on more to get to that level of trust.\n\nShe then sang praises and sorta defended why she needed to be so involved and yatta yatta but we came to an understanding aligned more to my expectations and they did chill out quite a bit after that.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to approach it but I think this would be helpful for you too.  Just like in a romantic relationship, work relationships require alignment on expectations and how to work together if they're going to thrive",

Just because he has been supportive, does not mean that the micromanaging is done innocently.  It could be a calculated effort to keep you under his thumb, recognizing that your skillset exceeds his own and you are a potential threat.\n\nOf the 5 options you list, #1 and #4 are deal-breakers.  Nothing good will come of that.\n\nHere are my answers to your questions, having been in your shoes:\n\n*How do you distinguish between first-time manager anxiety and a real growth ceiling?*\n\n* It doesn't really matter as it is unlikely that he will change. A micro-manager behaves this way because they are inherently insecure. \n\n*Can someone actually grow under a highly involved manager like this?*\n\n* No. Right now, you are extremely valuable to him because he is new.  When the threat you offer to his career exceeds your value, he will sabotage you, and it may be through micro-managing by just wearing you down with the daily intrusions, in an effort to get you to move on your own, or it may be an attempt to undermine your confidence.  To be fair, he may not yet be there, but when he is you may just see the same type of behavior but worse.\n\n*Is this something that typically improves over time, or does it harden?*\n\n* It typically does not.  A manager that starts off this insecure or feels that he is the smartest person in the room usually remains that way because that is an inherent character flaw.\n\n*At what point is switching teams the smarter move?*\n\n* That would be a smart move now, if you do your research and do not switch to a team with a worse manager, or a worse project.",

Dealing with these tools has always significantly increased my overhead and “busy work” and has never actually improved stakeholder visibility. \n\nMy new employer is going down this path right now and spending lots of time and human hours evaluating various tools. This is a small company that doesn’t have a dedicated IT or Security hire, but has decided now is the time to buy Aha. \n\nThe best roadmap tool I ever used was just Jira. Initiatives and Epics, organized in the backlog. Everyone has visibility. You never need to transcribe things in external systems. If a stakeholder wants more info on status, they can just drill down. And yet, without trying it, everyone seems convinced this is not going to meet our needs and we need to buy Aha. \n\nAre you this kind of person?

It also allows to roll up progress based on smaller issues in Jira (like epic progress based on feature statuses, synced to Jira). Finally, you can use Aha to collect ideas and then promote them to records/issues with more flexibility than Jira (Jira Product Discovery is an all or nothing access vs Aha allows you to show just what you want in your idea reports). Oh and with Aha you can create interactive slides based on the source data that is always up to date and you can choose which data points show up.",

The confluence page just points to the epics, so you see the current status, but the actual stack rank is in Confluence so it doesn't change.  Then when we do quarterly planning, we mark each one as \"commit\", \"stretch\" or \"won't do.\"   Now I have a list of all the epics that we think we will get done this quarter.  I usually then build a quick slide deck for sales and mktg so they don't have to dig through Jira which they won't understand.  Takes me a couple of hours per quarter total.  \n\nSo, yes?  Jira is the source of truth, but the actual stack rank and roadmap are documented separately and just refer back to Jira epics.  \n\n",

          "text": "u/Ok-Appearance3478 I completely hear you. In fact, for a lot of internal only teams, Jira is enough. However, when I started to work at a software agency, my perspective changed a bit when I realized that Jira is can be really a developer tool that we try to force stakeholders to use and speak about lists. Non-technical stakeholders just don't understand it. Then we started to look for a solution to make our communication as efficient as possible for everyone no matter our stakeholders technical maturity. Our common language and shared understanding directed us towards user story mapping. We needed a visual explanation tool that anyone can join and make sence of any project we worked on. So we started to search for story mapping tools and we came across StoriesOnBoard and we use it for some years now. It changed everything. \n\nJira is a great bottom-up tool to track individual tasks. Even with advanced roadmaps, the view is linear and technical. For our clients, a flat list of 100 epics is a back hole. StoriesOnBoard gives us a horizontal, top-down view. We map the user journey (goals > steps > stories) on the story map and set our prioritize and slice releases. Then we simply push the result to Jira for our team to execute while the map syncs perfectly and keeps everyone up-to-date on a simple not tach heavy interface. When a client asks, \"Why are we building this?\", we don't show them a ticket in Jira, instead we show them exactly where it sits in the user's life on the story map so they can releate to it immediately. \n\nThe biggest risk isn't a bug for us it's more of a misunderstanding of scope. Jira doesn't make gaps obvious. In a story map, if you see a user step with only one story under it, but the other step has fifty, the imbalance is visual and immediate. Not to mention how extremly useful the user journey on the map. We use this to prevent over-engineering early on. We slice the map into releases visually. It makes the \"in vs. out\" conversation a collaborative design session rather than a defensive argument over a Jira backlog. So we keep everyone happy and this turned out to be really efficient for us. \n\nThis also let us overcome the fear of most stakeholders have as they are terrified of using Jira. They click the wrong thing, or see technical sub-tasks that trigger unnecessary panic. So Jira became where the devs work, talk tech, and manage technical debt. While we go to StoriesOnBoard to talk about value, journeys, and this becomes our roadmap plus they have roadmap for tracking epics or releases as well. We sync the two systems bi-directionally. When a dev closes a ticket in Jira, the status updates on the Story Map automatically along with other changes.   \n  \nDon't get me wrong, we're not transcribing anything. We're just viewing the same data through a lens that makes sense for someone who doesn't code. It is really the bridge that matters between buiness and tech folks. We maintain our story maps so they became the ultimate source of truth for everyone and makes communication much easier with our clients. \n\nFrom what you’ve described, switching to something like Aha really doesn’t make sense at that stage. Still, we’ve all seen cases where a top-down decision gets pushed because someone thinks it’s best for everyone ...even when it isn’t.",

You've started a journey of self-discovery that will change your love for the better. \n\n\n1. 100% I've worked with a number of neurodivergent product managers (autistic, audADHD and ADHD) And some of the best managers I've had were also neurodivergent.\n\n\n2. Learn what gives and takes away your energy. Now that you're diagnosed, keep working with a therapist or professional to learn the language of how your mind operates so that you can set up the ideal routines and behaviors that keep you in regulated. For example, you mentioned crashing after social interactions. It's likely that the crash is from masking to get through them. If you can learn what your masking behaviors are, you can work with a professional to replace them other behaviors that are less costly.\n\n\n3. I moved into a chief of staff/PMO role. I'm an IC but indirectly lead our org by supporting our senior leadership. There's a routine to the central planning and budget mechanisms I run, which gives me the stability I need  \n\n\nHowever, also I get the novelty of being thrown into the most random things sometimes because no one else is sure who should fix it (my flavor of ADHD loves a good crisis). My influence is in mostly one-on-one settings which helps with my social anxiety. \n\n\nPs, If you're on the spectrum, it's also highly likely you have ADHD. They are a common pair. Getting assessed will give you further language to find the tools the best fit your needs. Best of luck to you.",

It was a workflow tool used by internal employees, catered to roles, so that every person could navigate the UI according to their role and path to perform steps in an implementation.  This executive convinced upper management that the entire product needed to be redesigned to have a layer that was a common process layer.  I argued against it because the users loved our tool as is, had not asked for this change, and if it added any complexity to their decision-making, it would fail.  The executive won.  They made the changes.  He demo'd it in front of the company leadership and got a promotion.  Within two years the tool was abandoned with complaints on day 1 when it was released.  I moved to another department before the redesign was even completed because I knew how it would turn out.  It was a disaster, and I think that guy went on to become a President at a startup.  LOL.  \n\nAnyway, yes, it happens a lot.  % of how much it happens?  I think you won't get good data on that unless you divide it by levels:\n\n* Whole new project\n* Redesign of existing project's core navigation model\n* Feature \n* Function",

The thinking can be crystal clear, but unless everyone - from engineering to design to finance - are working in lock-step with said strategy, across the board...the clarity of thought is left in that confluence document, unread and unabsorbed. I've made that mistake earlier in my career and years later, understood it through the help of mentors who reminded me of how critical change management is when trying to implement strategy at scale. \n\nA strong strategy in my experience is something that is designed not just for clarity of thought but also (most importantly) *designed to spread and resonate with all teams*. That's why PMs look at companies with great product culture and nick their ideas - some of them have compressed their strategy into simple, catchy principles that make it easy to adopt (whether they understood it in the context of their own org problems is its own rabbit hole). \n\nA strategy that requires a long document to be understood does not survive contact with a large organization. A strategy document isn't successful when it's well written, it's successful when it's actually used. If it isn't memorable principles or ideas, doesn't already leverage some artifacts that teams already have and use, doesn't create simple yes/no filters or re-inforced through any sort of rituals...it dies. Even quicker death ensues if leaders aren't keen to bat for it or if it doesn't show results in a timeline they're willing to wait for.",

The root issue is usually that different stakeholders need different views of the same information, but most tools force you to recreate everything from scratch for each audience.  \n  \nThe teams that handle this best tend to pick one source of truth (usually where the actual work lives, like Jira) and then find ways to present that data differently rather than maintaining separate documents. Some use tools that can pull from Jira and automatically generate the visual presentations, others build lightweight dashboards that filter the same underlying data for different audiences. The key is avoiding manual updates across multiple systems.  \n  \nFor what you're describing - needing both high-level strategic views and detailed execution views from the same data - Easy Agile Roadmaps (full disclosure, I work for Easy Agile but just think it could be agood solution) might be worth looking at since it connects directly to your Jira work and can switch between those different levels of detail without you having to maintain separate versions.

Act as my personal communication coach for the next 10 minutes.\n\nBefore we start, ask me these three quick questions and wait for all my answers before continuing:\n\n1. What is your current communication style - are you naturally direct, diplomatic, detailed, or informal?\n2. Is English your first language or second language? If second, what is your first language?\n3. What is one word someone who works with you would use to describe how you communicate today?\n\nOnce I answer, ask me about a real communication challenge I am facing right now - a meeting, a presentation, a difficult conversation, or a message I need to send.\n\nThen help me reframe how I would approach it with more clarity, confidence, and executive presence. Adapt your coaching specifically to my communication style and language background. If English is my second language, help me sound natural and confident without losing my authentic voice.\n\nAlso give me 3 power words I can consciously use today in conversations, emails, or meetings. For each word tell me what it signals to others and give me one example sentence using it in a professional context. Choose words that feel natural for my communication style.\n\nAfter we work through my challenge, give me one communication habit I can practise this week that will make the biggest difference to how I come across to senior stakeholders.\n\nFinally, give me one phrase I should stop using in executive meetings and explain exactly why it weakens my presence.\"\n\nFeel free to modify the prompt to your needs. Initially, as the AI tool is gathering all the details, it will take more than 10 mins.  \nI hope this helps.",

I'm currently stuck on a modernization project for a legacy system with full process preservation, and I could really use some perspective.\n\nWe're about a year in with no clear end in sight, and leadership patience is wearing thin. A lot of the blame is being directed at me as the sole PO, with the criticism being that developers are spending time on business/systems analysis work that should fall under my responsibility.\n\nThe core challenge is that we're finding out functionality as we develop, and I'm finding it nearly impossible to capture everything upfront. So much of the existing workflow is driven by undocumented business practices and unwritten rules that don't surface often times until dev starts digging in. As a result, my developers are regularly catching things I missed which is creating tension.\n\nHas anyone navigated a similar situation?

The more that you can create a unified sense of \"this is our mission and here's what we're trying to do,\" The last pushback you will likely get. \n\n**Team morale**: are your developers upset about having to help you dig through all of this, or are your developers all right with the current way of working? \n\n**Leveraging milestones**: how much are you using milestones to deliver value even as the project gets delayed and timelines grow longer? If leadership can feel like you have hit certain milestones and are making progress against a very large and complicated initiative, that might also help them develop a little bit more patience. If they're having to wait three years until they can actually see any of the value of this investment, it's a lot harder for them to play along patiently. \n\n**User research**: How are you currently figuring out what is going on today with these systems? Is there a way for you to watch users use these systems as you are writing up your materials? Or other ways to get closer to the people actually in the business who are the ones that need this functionality working in a particular way? When there is very little documentation, the best thing you can do is find patterns of how people are actually using it.

      "text": "For anyone who missed the context: in late January, YC posted a request for startups building more AI tools for product management. Right after that, SVPG wrote about the product coaching and AI. \n\nAnd then I heard a podcast with Boris Cherny (the Claude Code creator) where he basically said coding is probably solved now, so engineers should spend more time doing product work like talking to customers and validating hypotheses.\n\nThis topic is super hot right now, but in my experience it feels more like a process or skill problem than a tool problem. A lot of what people want seems like it could already be done with Cursor (or other AI tools). \n\nI’ve even built a few tools around this myself, but I’m not sure it’s actually a common enough pain to build yet another “PM copilot”.\n\nIs this a real unmet need, or just hype catching up to what’s already possible?",

          "text": "It's definitely a need, but one that PMs and engineers can solve by themselves, for free.\n\nThe issue is that PMs need to make decisions, generate artefacts (documents/tickets), resolve trade-offs  and research customers/markets quickly but their context is scattered across slack, documents, jira tickets and research notes. Couple that with massive AI slop coming from all fronts, it can make a PM overwhelmed.\n\nPMs + engineers could technically build this as a tool in-house, with integrations that work with apps they currently use. While I understand that some teams may lack these resources and may be willing to pay for an external solution (\"PM copilots\"), I have a feeling that this may lead to more overheads, and eventually a race to the bottom.\n\nTons of PM influencers have jumped on this bandwagon, calling it PM copilot/PM OS and generating needlessly complicated setups. This is just hype in my opinion. More often than not, it is a shill to sign up for their course on Maven, or subscribe to their newsletter on substack by generating FOMO.",
