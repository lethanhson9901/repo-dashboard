I’ve been placed on a PIP because, according to my org, I am accountable for dev team performance since I “own all aspects of the product”.  \n\nSome of my issues include:\n\n1. Devs flat ignore acceptance criteria, and constantly deliver features that break core areas of the application.  They always complain that “I didn’t specify that feature X could not break all other features in the app”, so how were they supposed to know?  \n\n2. Zero accountability.  Devs refuse to estimate, increment work, and are…generally unavailable.  Every solution they merge looks like they were just trying to lazily bang it out as fast as possible.\n\n3. Zero QA.  My org fired all QA to save money, and I absorbed that role.\n\n4. MIA engineering manager.  They never show up to ceremonies, don’t answer calls / emails, and nobody knows what they are working on.\n\nAll in all, this is the most poorly performing dev team I’ve ever led by a wide margin.  The org feels they have no accountability, and that it is my job to fix the process.  \n\nIn a situation like this, where do I start?  Performance management is not an option, as leadership says it is my job to “inspire them” to work harder and that firing anyone is “a failure of my leadership, and not of them”. ",

Use AI to \"ironman\" your specs - get good at prompting it to take your general specifications and make them absolutely bullet proof. DM me if you want any guidance on this.\n2. Understand the motivating factors of the devs. Are they being lazy because they're also being crushed by the organisation? For example, if one of the devs wants to develop their skills in area X, try occasionally matching tickets related to their area of interest to their queue. \n3. Consider the opposite case to what you've said above\n   1. Do the genuinely not understand your requirements (language barriers?)\n   2. Do they not know how the rest of the product works, and thus don't know what they will or won't break?\n   3. etc.... In most cases one or two bad apples in a squad is possible, but all 7 being bad is unlikely. So consider the systemic reasons why they might output work that isn't acceptable and address those things. \n4. Find an ally in your squad of engineers - find just one person and work outwards from there. Think Kotter's theory of change.\n5. Reframe QA being pushed onto you as an opportunity - depending on your stack, learn some Selenium etc. It's never been easier to write test code. And your skills as a PM will increase as you understand the tech more. \n\nNobody should have to stay in a role like the one you describe, but if you don't have a choice then the above is my best, quick advice. \n\nTo be clear, I am not excusing or saying the employer's behaviour here is acceptable. I am not endorsing it in any way, but it is a privileged position to be in to say \"move jobs\" and if OP doesn't have that opportunity, making it work as best as possible might be the only option.",

Code quality may matter to you, but if no one is controlling it, insist at least on static code analysis (for example SonarQube) and mandatory testing (unit, regression, integration, etc.), with results documented (for example test screenshots attached to the ticket). Define non functional requirements as a part of DoD.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are held responsible for team performance even though this is not a PO role, you also need corrective mechanisms: rotations, terminations, and clear evaluations of underperformers.",

They may have other engineering skills that are valuable for other projects.

If not, I'd articulate to your boss on a curious question of how you work a dev team that can't deliver the product and that there needs to be real accountability.",

Discuss these challenges with your manager and manager's manager. Be open about the challenges and seek help 'I want to make this work  I like some assistance, what are your thoughts on how i can improve the state of things'. Go with a few ideas to this discussion and then also ask them for ideas and set measurable goals for 6 months. \n\n2. Use your power to accept or reject features. When the dev team says they have completed something, dont close it till you are satisfied. If they close work items, reopen them if you feel they dont meet the acceptance criteria. \n\n3. Roll out an anonymous survey to the team to understand where the team wants you to spend time with them. Spend some time analysing the responses and if those expectations align with your role, then do the needful. If not be ready with proper explaination. Then do a debriefing with the team on what action you are going to take based on the survey results. \n\n4. Set expectations with tech lead saying that not every minute detail can be called out in the acceptance criteria and they need to work with you in an iterative way to build what is best for the users. \n\n5. Ask you team to give you demos regularly. Give them feedback so that they can address them during development and not wait till the end.\n\n6. If this doesnt work in 3 months, try escalating to your manager, the engineering manager. If things change, it is good. Else, better move on to different teams or company.\n\nEvery PM deserves help from their management and co operation from the dev team. Sometimes we'll have to go the extra mile (life is unfair) for the greater good. But it is also important to walk away when things dont improve.",

I’m now trying to be more intentional about improving these skills and would love some practical advice or resources on how to do this and what has worked for you. \n\nI understand these are skills that are mostly developed through experience but I’d really appreciate pointers or even case studies that can help. I’ve been practicing but without the right approach it feels counterproductive.\n\nI’m specifically interested in:\n- How you evaluate opportunity size and decide what to build vs what not to build\n- How you define a clear product strategy that actually guides decisions\n- How you connect company goals to product bets in a concrete way\n- How you get better at identifying the right problems to solve, not just shipping solutions\n- Any frameworks, mental models, or exercises that made strategy “click” for you\n- How product leaders think about strategy differently from mid-level PMs",

When we decide features, we use RICE, when we decide MVP scope, we use MoSCoW etc.\n\n\n\n I would also say it depends on business goals too. If you're looking to augment specific KPIs, how will those features help. Not many features or items will increase EVERY metric, you have to teeter totter with knowing the pros and cons of each item.\n\n  \n2. If you think of your product strategy from a today POV you're only using yesterday's facts, you need to think about where you think your product will be in 3-5 years and what that domain looks like. How can we build steps to the second floor if we don't know where the second floor will be kind of thinking. \n\nThe steps can change, heck even the 2nd floor can change but the general idea is there's a second floor and you need to aim for it with specific items.\n\n  \n3. Experiment boards, run experiments that have business goals in line within your product. Example would be more subscribed users, run different pricing promos, trim the onboarding process etc\n\n  \n4. Not every problem has a solution, but every solution had a problem. Group your problems together, run problem analyses and tackle the problem at large not individually\n\n5. Problem > Idea > Data Validation > Solution > Data Validation > Build > Iterate. It's not a frame work or a model, but it's what I've used for a while in 3 platforms for 0-1s. \n\n6. Not so much a product leader, but I was a founding PM. It all came down to revenue goals for me when I was a founding PM. My CEO didn't care about users, kpis etc. Just wanted to know the P&Ls",

Leadership tends to respond more to whether they already see you as someone who owns a narrative, not just someone who executes well. How you frame problems, tradeoffs, and impact upward often carries more weight than adding another skill.\n\nGrowing those skills is still valuable, but it usually works best when it’s paired with being more intentional about how your work is understood.

      "text": "Hey everyone, having an issue at my current company and could use advice.\n\nIt is an expectation that (despite being agile) we build every single minute feature in such a way that it can handle any conceivable edge cases.  If we ever have to make modifications to a feature at any point in the future, product is blamed for “not scoping edge cases”.  However; the trade off is that every feature implementation is so complicated that none ever get complete.\n\nFor example: \n\nWe are building a widget which allows for users to send messages directly to our support.  Think help button.  Easy ask, right?\n\nWell, no.  Executive leadership is demanding that we consider the following in our design:\n\n1. Speech-to-text enscription of queries.  And apparently, this speech to text must support multi-lingual translations and have 10 different male / female voices.\n\n2. Support complex functionality like a built-in equation editor, or modification of images copy-pasted into request (re-sizing, etc)\n\n3.  Conversion of requests into JSON, in case we ever decide to send our requests to some hypothetical platform that ingests JSON.\n\n4. Email support such that any emails that got to users who might receive the request are automatically scrubbed, and then redundantly logged in our system.  This must happen automatically.\n\nAnd I could go on.  Essentially, if someone can conceive of it, it “MUST” be included in the design.  If not, then I am “painting them in a corner” for future rework.  However, this 2 week implementation is sprawling out into what they estimate would be 9-12 months, at the expense of other critical path features.  \n\nUltimately, I have veto authority but essentially everybody is telling me I’m a “moron” for not thinking about the future.  For whatever reason, they seem totally okay developing in perpetuity and never finishing any features.\n\nWhat can I do here?  This is impacting me, as I’ve lost tons of influence.  And the org has more or less told me I’d be terminated for “wasting dev time” in the case that a high profile client were ever to request any of these features in 10 years.\n\nI’m at a loss.  It’s impossible to scope any of these things.  I try to be a realist, but I lose either way.  I’m either held accountable for nothing finishing, or held accountable for any request a client may ever make in the future that we did not proactively design for. ",

That’s 60% of the battle, so that is good—as long as they actually can list most of the edge-cases that will pop-up.  \n  \nTo push back on requirements that you think that unreasonable, do three things:  \n\\- Thank the people for listing them, so that developers can plan their architecture around that need; that unexpected features are harder to get early. It’s not really a thing (software patterns wouldn’t change that much), but it will make them feel heard, whether you build what they want or not.  \n\\- Add the additional work time in your public facing plan, and frame it as a delay to the release; if you have expected sales, retention targets, etc. frame it as a corresponding business loss. Make sure to model it as you are not losing the first few early weeks of low sales, but delaying the whole calendar, so you are delaying full-speed adoption, user testing feedback, and that the sales team will have to rescind commitments they made to prospects, etc.  \n\\- Publicly regret that this is too negative framing and ask the requirements to come with a business case: how much more sales, how many more retention they expect with and without the feature. Say that you want to include that feature, but you are under pressure to deliver the most profitable option, and delays are a cost that you need to justify to either a undisclosed and invisible profitability monster, or scary big-boss. Most people see their ideas as a “must” and struggle to list paying customers whose decision will hinge on that; when they do, it’s often one client with a personal contact and a very long lit of very specific requirements: their business will pale in comparison to the wall of features they need, and the “personal relationship” will seem very unprofitable.",

Unless your product is used by people who can’t type (say, dee-sea divers), this is a non-starter.  Anyone who someone works with voice because AI is cool has a way to convert on their machine.  \nThere are plugins that do that: reach out to Eleven Labs, ask for a price, slap it at the end of suggestions, with a generous “integration” delay.   \n  \n\\> Support complex functionality like a built-in equation editor, or modification of images copy-pasted into request (re-sizing, etc)  \nI might be the only person here who actually writes down equations several dozen times a day, and… that’s not even remotely needed for us. Type LaTeX code, put it between $$, and that works for anyone who cares. Anyone who can process those now reads raw code. Personally, I think it’s nice, but I can tell that’s my very obvious bias. No one who reads equations for a living has any budget or buying power.  \n  \nIncluding images notably screenshots, that’s key (I’m tempted to defend that), but editing them? Why? Some edits like cropping and rotation, maybe but… any basic device has those embedded already. Unless you thing is embedded in a truck driving console, I have no idea how that came up.  \n  \n\\> Conversion of requests into JSON, in case we ever decide to send our requests to some hypothetical platform that ingests JSON.  \nThe emblematic example of a feature that should come in v. 1.2 after customer explicit feedback, with a structure that actually matches their requirement.

Without dismissing some of the ideas of your management as 'bad ideas', you always need to counter-weigh them against other opportunities. \n\nIf management has a (at least somewhat) shared understanding of a longterm roadmap, then the discussion about 'manager A's pet project idea' is not judgemental, like it being 'good or bad', but merely a matter of 'do we want this outcome over that outcome'.\n\nAs much as I dislike leader cult fixation with people like Steve Jobs, here is a quote, that I have used in presentations before: \"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\"\n\nSo, as for your question on losing influence: I think you cannot fight the losing battle of having to be the one to argue against each and every feature - the answer lays in a shared understanding of a broader strategy. This is easier said than done - I, too, have not managed to instill this kinda thinking into my management.",

When you say YES too much, no one believes you, and stakeholders and engineering know they can't trust you.  Most engineers I know hate building obviously dumb stuff, and will push back really hard on dumb ideas, even if you make them do them.... (If they ask for too much spec, it's because they think it's dumb; if they think it's a good idea, they will write the whole thing based on a good Post It note) People trust PM's who say No, not PM's who say Yes....\n\nIt's like reverse psychology.  Your current most important mindset is \"Yes\" and by your own admission have really delivered nothing, my most important mindset is \"No\" and I've truly delivered..... Well not a metric fuck-ton, but still, quite a lot. ;-P  \n  \n In my super long career in PM, the word \"No\" is one of my favorite arrows in my quiver and nearly the first thing I say to any idea that comes my way, but not in a grumpy way, it's more like:  \"That sounds really cool!  Sorry, let me start by saying No..... We're already going to launch X on Y date, but this sounds interesting and we can start looking in to this, maybe get some user feedback, and hopefully some analytics that can give us some sense of security that we're spending time and resources wisely.... Now let's talk more about why we would need this.... How did this idea come to you? How much value does it add, who needs it, does it get us to our north star, and can we do it later when we discover that it's necessary, delightful, or value-add in some way?  The good news is that we're not yet locked in to a solution, so we can really figure this out and I can't wait to see if it has legs!\"  or whatever.\n\nAnyway, obviously \"No\" is not forever, but people need to know that when they come to you, you're going to say \"No\", and so WHEN they come to you, they will have thought out how they will get around your \"No\" which means they will have thought through some value proposition on their own ahead of time and the level of their conviction, which is good, because you need that.  They will need to put some emotional/tactical skin in the game to put forth their ideas, and this is good.\n\nA caveat.... PMs, clients, peers, stakeholders.... They're all different.....  So this strategy is just one idea and maybe it won't work for you, but hopefully it gives you something to think about.",

Make them feel heard and seen by not dismissing their concerns or suggestions. Instead, ask questions about how they’re solving the problem with the tools they have today (read The Mom Test if you haven’t).\n\nThe question to ask: “Walk me through the last time this was a problem for you.” Real examples and story time (I love story time, also helps build rapport). This does a few things: 1) shows you’re taking them seriously, 2) helps you understand if it’s actually critical or just feels urgent, 3) you understand the current state and the problem, and now you can take the problem back to your team to solution instead of just taking their feature idea.\n\nOnce you understand the problem, protect your team from the noise. They shouldn’t be hearing ten different priorities from ten different stakeholders. That’s your job to filter and translate.\n\nGet a prioritization exercise going with the key decision makers all in the same room. Together review the strategic direction set by the company (I hope you have one).\n\nIf there IS a company strategy, this is your North Star. Ask everyone to make a list of things they think will generate incremental revenue or assist with user adoption (whatever your goals are). Each proposal needs a business case to be considered. Your objective is to have them compete with each other for priority instead of competing with you. You’re the facilitator, not the gatekeeper.\n\nUse a framework they can’t argue with—RICE, ICE, whatever. Just make it objective and make it visible. When someone asks why their thing isn’t being built, you point to the scoring everyone agreed to.\n\nIf there’s NO company strategy, maybe it’s up to you to propose one and lead through influence. Come armed with data on who your profitable users are and how you bet you can get more of them. Ideally partner with Finance or Revenue so your plan has the numbers add up in the same language your leaders are used to.\n\nBasically:\nEverything can’t be critical. If everything is critical, nothing is. Make this explicit in your prioritization sessions.\nYou’re not a project manager taking orders. You’re a product manager making strategic bets. There’s a difference.\nIf the organization is truly chaotic and won’t set priorities, that’s a red flag. Time to get people fired or get out yourself.",

That should “arm” you with proof that it’s not needed to consider all edge case, BUT the trick is not to wave in in their face but use negotiation and influencing tactics so that they actually uncover it themselves.\n\n3. Transparant USer Story Mapping: create a user story map of such a feature and break it down into releases. Show leadership your are thinking of every edge case, but just broke it down into smaller releases. You can use AI also here to help you conceive even more use cases, showing your stakeholders how thourough you are.\nThen; when you deliver initial parts of the feature, go back to step 2: show them how the feature is being used, and then you ask them: now, do we want more of these edge cases delivered, or should we move on to the next feature?\n\n4. Key stakeholder/client mapping. Who are the key stakeholders and/or clients you feel you should “always” listen to?

Jira is for developers no matter how hard they try to expand outside of that. PB integrates with Jira and Azure so they can do what they do best. \n\nI share specific boards in PB with stakeholders so they can focus on what they care about and it’s much friendlier to non-tech users. Their Insights feature is a game changer for collecting, storing, and taking action on customer/user feedback. I also like that I can do product work there without engineers getting too curious about ideas I’m not ready to share with them. ",

I’ve been reflecting on something I keep running into and wanted to sanity-check my perspective with the community.\n\nIn many orgs, I see PMs who operate primarily at a very high level, focusing on vision, outcomes, and abstract requirements (e.g., “we need 600ms response times globally”) without getting deeply involved in how a feature actually works end-to-end.\n\nMeanwhile, I tend to be more hands-on and spending time with engineers, understanding system constraints, data flows, edge cases, and operational compelexity. I often feel like this leads to better product decisions, but I also notice that the more high-level, “strategic” PMs often seem to advance faster in larger organizations.\n\nSo I’m genuinely curious about a few things:\n\n* Is staying high-level actually a mark of strong product leadership, rather than a lack of product depth?\n* Where’s the healthy boundary between being strategic vs. overly tactical as a PM?\n* In your experience, does being more hands-on with technical and operational details help or hurt career progression in larger companies?\n\nI’m not trying to criticize, I’m honestly trying to understand whether I’m optimizing for the wrong dimension of the role, especially in more corporate or scaled environments.\n\nWould love to hear how others see this.",

I don’t want to manage people, and I don’t want to operate exclusively at the vision/outcomes layer. I enjoy strategy because I understand how the product actually works end-to-end.\n\nBeing hands-on with engineers, designers, commercial helps me pressure-test ideas, spot edge cases early, and avoid decisions that look good on a roadmap but fail in execution. That tradeoff is worth it to me, even if it’s not always the fastest path to advancement in large companies.",

          "text": "Different organizations and corporations flesh out the job requirements of Product Managers and Business Analysts differently.  For some organizations, what you have described as your role would be a senior business or business systems analyst position.  For others, it would be some level of Product Management.  These distinctions are also variable depending on the size of your organization.  So there is no cookie-cutter response to your questions because at one organization what you have described as a high-level, strategy PM is actually a Product Owner, and at another organization it is a senior Product Manager managing other PMs and BAs.\n\nTitles do not matter for quality of product.  What matters is that you have the correct amount of people performing the correct roles.  You must have a detail-oriented person doing the analysis to flesh out the requirements for a feature, prioritize them in the plan, etc. but by the same token you need to have a person that sees the product at a higher level within the company's overall business goals and strategy, and perhaps where there is crossover with other products, departments, etc.  Sometimes, if the company and product is small and simple enough a PM can do it all, but that is rare.\n\nWhat you do NOT want is a PM that typically functions as you say (high-level), but when bored or lacking work tries to jump into your space of detail, without full knowledge and understanding of every function, feature, etc., and rather than being a collaborative resource wants to make product detail decisions that you are more qualified to make.\n\nWhat you really need to ask yourself is what to do you want, and what is more important . . . the same analysis and prioritization process you do in work, but for your career.  So, for example, is it more important to you to move up the corporate ladder in title and pay, with the possibility of adding more overall stress or lack of enjoyment of your job?  Do you like your current job and the level of detail but feel as though you are not being valued and compensated appropriately?  What is pulling you to these questions?",

          "text": "You are touching on a classic tension between the ivory tower and the trenches. In many large organizations, being high-level is rewarded because it scales well with stakeholder management, even if the product itself suffers because no one understood the technical constraints.\n\nIs staying high-level a mark of leadership? Not necessarily. Often, it is just a survival mechanism for PMs who want to avoid being held accountable for the details. However, in deeply technical fields like cybersecurity, a PM who cannot discuss data flows or system constraints eventually loses the respect of the engineers. You become a paper pusher who promises outcomes the architecture simply cannot support.\n\nThe healthy boundary is what many now call technical orchestration. It is not about doing the engineer's job, but about understanding the \"how\" well enough to know when a requirement is a minor tweak versus a major overhaul. If you are spotting edge cases early, you are not being too tactical, you are de-risking the strategy. Strategy without technical feasibility doesn't become real that easy.\n\nDoes it hurt career progression? In a traditional corporate ladder, the storytellers often move faster because they focus on visibility. But as we move further into the era of AI-assisted development, the gap between concept and execution is shrinking. The market is shifting back toward the hands-on technical orchestrator because companies need PMs who can actually ship, not just slide-deck their way through a quarter. That requires speaking with engineers and QAs in language that they are comfortable with - and by now this would be your edge.\n\nMy advice is to stay hands-on but change your framing. Stop telling leadership you spent four hours on data flows. Tell them you identified an architectural bottleneck that would have delayed the launch by two months. Translate your technical depth into strategic risk mitigation.",

The trick, at least for me, was learning when to zoom out. I still dive deep with engineers, but I stopped leading with that.

They knew the pain points that needed to be solved to make it successful. The PM was just making educated guesses in comparison.\n\nI’m also dogfooding my own product [lube](https://lube.gg) as well to understand the product landscape better.",

      "text": "I'm a therapist and product leader (18 years in tech, currently IBM). In my practice I spend a lot of time talking to people who've \"made it\" but feel empty.  \nThis loss of meaning usually hits mid-career... and it's rarely what people expect it is.\n\nTypically you've done the same job for so long that  there's no challenge left. Or you've reached your definition of success and realised... wait... this is it?\n\nFor high achievers especially, impostor syndrome is normally the source of fuel.  \nYou work extremely hard because you feel \"not enough.\" Then the day comes when  you hit your goals, look around and ask yourself: \"Is this all there is?\"\n\nSometimes it's in your environment: I've watched people in SaaS burn out like chickens because the industry is so competitive that everyone's playing on super hard mode all of the time.  \nYou're exhausted, things barely work, successes are rare and at some point you think: \"What's the point of killing myself to make this business more money?\"\n\nThe thing is, when people ask \"what's the meaning of this?\" they're really asking \"am I good enough?\" It's an intellectualised version of the same question.  \nIf you were wildly successful at this game, would you still question if it makes sense? I don't think so.\n\n**! Understand this before you quit your job or start that business:!**\n\nThe loss of meaning is multi-factor. Some reasons are real and rational, others are circumstantial. I've seen people do a slight industry pivot and find meaning because their work suddenly helps people in a more tangible way. A few others found it by taking a break, starting a hobby, or monetising something on the side for the challenge.\n\nI've also seen people leave corporate jobs thinking entrepreneurship will save them, only to realise they just traded one type of shit for another type of shit they hate more.  \nThen they fall into a deeper crisis because, well -  they didn't like the first thing, don't like the second thing - now what???\n\nWhat worked for my case:\n\nI went on without meaning for 3-4 years, lost clients and nearly went bankrupt. Really bankrupt. Ironically, the process of making back that money gave me meaning and drive again. So did the therapy work, helping people one-on-one.\n\nBut a year before this, if you'd asked me, I would've said that I'm not cut out to be a therapist.\n\nI had to go through very structured exercises to deeply understand: What makes me feel whole?\n\nThis question is insanely difficult because when you're happy and whole you don't notice it.  \nThose moments pass directly to the subconscious, skipping your active awareness.\n\nAnytime you're thinking \"does this make me happy?\" you're not there yet.\n\nI had to ask: Who am I? What do I love doing when no one's watching? What's my default activity?\n\nFor me, the answer was in front of my eyes the whole time: using my skills and knowledge for helping people but I just couldn't see it.\n\nIt took isolation, reflection, me-time, and crucially… I had to stop worrying about finding meaning in order to find it.  \nThree or four years of intensive effort, and then one day over coffee something just clicked.\n\nMy advice if you're “in the fog” right now:\n\nDon't make big decisions while you're still in crisis.  \nIf you think running a business will make you happy, run it on the side first. If you think changing companies will help, send some resumes. If you think golf will help, play golf.  \nTry minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability.\n\nYou might not be supposed to find meaning in your corporate job either, that might just not be its purpose. I've seen people treat their 9-to-5 as the source of every problem until they lost it and realised the grass wasn't greener.\n\nThe meaning might be in front of your eyes, you just can't see it yet because you're too deep in the crisis and the pressure clouds you.\n\nGet some distance. Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.  \nIt's hard to be the driver and the observer at the same time.",

Doing 1 and its ebbs and flows has shown me not to quit my steady thing that gives me the most stress. Looking at the satisfaction from my partner and children about what I can do from the money made by doing the boring steady state thing does allow me to feel happy.\n\nFound a mirror in my partner and also some very critical friends. The latter did take me down more than I needed to but they are not as close to me as my partner so having some healthy self respect helped me figure out noise from signal. \n\nNumber 3 is the easiest check and love it. I have been using it for the last 2 years to avoid dipping into things that would distract and make it all worse. ",

It’s taking messy reality, data, tradeoffs, and uncertainty, then turning it into something people can actually align around and act on.\n\nAt director/CPO level, you’re constantly doing things like:\n\n* explaining why this strategy matters\n* getting teams moving in the same direction\n* making bets before the data is perfect\n\nThat requires a story. Otherwise it’s just disconnected metrics and roadmaps. The story also has to be grounded. If you’re selling something that doesn’t hold up in reality, you might get a short-term yes, but you lose trust fast. The best product leaders I’ve seen are persuasive because they’re clear, not because they're delusional. So yeah: storytelling is a top skill. But I would think of it more like the delivery mechanism for the truth based off of what evidence you know.",

I’ve been struggling with confidence, thinking, and interviews, and I’m trying to figure out how to get unstuck.\n\nSome context:\n\nI genuinely feel like I’ve become bad at thinking. I struggle to answer basic product questions like “How would you build X?” or “How would you launch Y?” My mind just goes blank.\n\nI have pretty severe social anxiety. Even casual questions like “How was your day?” or “What’s up?” throw me off if I haven’t mentally rehearsed.\n\nHeavy impostor syndrome. Constant feeling that I don’t belong at my level.\n\nI grew from APM → Principal PM in ~4 years at the same company, so objectively I must been doing something right. But strangely, I now struggle to clearly articulate my past work or impact.\n\nI’m trying to switch companies and not getting interview calls, which has been really discouraging and honestly depressing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\nHow do I start thinking like a senior/Principal PM again instead of freezing?\n\nHow do I prepare for interviews when my brain blanks under pressure?\n\nHow do I approach the job hunt when confidence is already low?\n\nIf you’ve been here before: what actually helped?\n\nI’m open to tactical advice (frameworks, prep methods, exercises) and mindset shifts. Even hearing that others have gone through this would help.\n\nAnyone else feel like they “lost” their PM thinking at senior levels?\n\nThanks in advance",

With that CV, hiring, I would assume that you're either the top 0.0001% of PMs in the world (and I might believe it if I saw, like, MIT on your CV) or much more likely, subject to egregious title inflation. For the two Principals I manage, at least, it's openly known and openly discussed as one of the hardest and most scrutinised promo docs in the entire company and most people in the role have 15-20 years experience in tech or related industries total. It's HARD to get, and the title is very respected; no one gets it unless they get top 10% in both potential and performance that year.\n\nAs other PMs have said, Principal doesn't scale too well without significant exposure to multiple other stacks / ecosystems / verticals either.\n\nAre you at an Indian company, by any chance? I know promote-every-year title expectations are way higher there.\n\nTo be brutally honest, as a current hiring manager in this market, I think your problem for callbacks outside your mental blocks is not imposter syndrome; it's title inflation. You're a mid-level at best and I would, genuinely, think about putting yourself down as a Sr PM instead, and go for Product Manager / Sr PM roles at better companies.",

What you’re describing is not a deficit of skills or knowledge, but of mental and emotional hurdles that impact your ability to do what you otherwise could. I am going to give you some advice that you are going to want to dismiss as too obvious to be helpful, but I urge you to take a breath, put your phone down for just a second and really consider it.\n\nThe advice is this: First, get more sleep, at least eight hours per night. If you already are and still feel tired get tested for sleep apnea, especially if you know you snore. Then actually use the cpap machine they give you- it’s super effective amongst those who use it but many don’t.\n\nSecond, get more movement in your life. Substantial movement, amounting to miles of walking and substantial weight training and stretching. Commit to a step goal and hit it every day. Stretch when you get up. Lift heavy things. Do it for ninety days and then do it for ninety more. \n\nWhatever you’re going through if you do these two things your concentration will improve. You might be depressed - exercise and sleep are one of the most effective treatments. Same for adhd. Same for many many other possible causes for your disruption.\n\nGood luck!",

Doing a round of pushups prior to these high pressure settings can help reduce anxiety. Also don’t forget to take time thinking about how to answer questions.

          "text": "I'll add something from a slightly different angle here. Lots of folks are saying that APM to principal in four years is probably title inflation, and they're likely right to a certain extent at least, but what I want to emphasize is that that's not strictly a bad thing, and you don't need to feel like even more of an imposter because of it. \n\nProduct management is a weird discipline, and there's basically no such thing as a standard career path into or through it. There's no default degree or training program for it, it's vastly different at a small startup than at a giant established corporation, and even in the same category every company does it differently. There's a good chance that principle at your current company isn't at all the same as principal at another one, and given your quick rise it's probably not as high-level or heavy as at many, and that's ok. As you said, that progress indicates that you were objectively doing things well, even if principal there isn't objectively the same as principal somewhere else. \n\nThe thing is, we all know that. That's part of the problem, because (as we're seeing in the comments) some hiring managers will look at the timing on your resume and assume there was inflation. But it's also helpful, because that sort of thing is common, so nobody's going to automatically assuming you're just full of shit and faking it. That means that, in this industry more than many others, you have an opportunity to show the skills you have independently from the title. (Obviously not every hiring manager is going to give you this opportunity, but honestly you don't want to work for the ones who don't, because that's not setting yourself up for success.)\n\nSo, in your job search, instead of trying to justify being at a principal level, focus on what gave you the momentum. Be open about your limited experience in one company, because people are very good at spotting generic BS if you try to pretend you could be a principal anywhere, but talk about your strengths. Did you move up fast because you are good at dabbling in any skill and can get stuff done without a lot of oversight or prompting? Was it because you're really good at teasing out customer requirements from interviews or data? Was it because you manage projects really well and so things get built more quickly and smoothly when you're at the helm? All of the above or something else entirely? Those are things that translate really well into new jobs, regardless of the official level of the new title. Not every company will prioritize those—I personally have a very wide breadth of experience across a ton of disciplines and not a huge amount of depth in most of them, which means I can often say \"yes, I can make that happen\" but less often \"yes, I know how to do that.\" So I thrive at small companies where things are somewhat less structured and there are too many hats to go around and results are more important than process, but I would have a lot of trouble getting hired at someplace like Google. I suspect you're going to be in a similar boat, at least until you have more experience on your resume. But conversely, someone with tons of experience in highly structured environments who wants a specific chain of command and advancement track and strict responsibilities would probably hate having my job and also probably wouldn't get hired here anyway. Different strengths fit in different places. \n\nIf you can reframe that stuff for yourself ahead of time, you can tailor resumes and cover letters around it, which hopefully will help you get in the door for an interview. And then hopefully because you're thinking about it differently, it will be easier to feel confident during the interview because you can spend the time talking about who you are and what you're good at, instead of trying to fit into a theoretical empty space that may or may not fit your strengths. \n\nOne last piece of advice: don't focus on the principal title right now. Another effect of everyone knowing that career progress goes at different speeds in different places is that if you go from principal back to a \"lesser\" title later, people rarely assume that's a downgrade, so you don't need to worry about how that looks on a resume. Just be prepared to explain (later, in your next job search) that you got to principal *at that company* and then continued to grow your breadth of experience at the next one (which you're hunting for now).",

If you are overthinking \"how was your day\", then a lot is going on in your head. \n\nIn the long term, PM is about recognising the different typical challenges in the product lifecycle and having done a few cycles and figured out what works for you. \n\nThings like how to prioritise, how to get leadership onboard, how to roll out a feature, how to measure etc. And this includes the bumps in the road like a difficult designer or tech lead, incompetent management etc. \n\nThis just takes time and a bit of reflection to develop pattern recognition. \n\nMore tactically, I'd recommend some simple strategies for answering those questions on the spot. \n\nFor social questions, maybe repeat the question and think aloud and then ask the other person the same thing. \n\n\"What did I do on the weekend? Wow. I can barely remember. Nothing crazy. Hung out with friends, enjoyed some slow time. It was good. What about you?\"\n\nNote that this works even if you can't recall what you did. \n\nFor the product craft questions, just look up some answers on Google and use them as a guide. \n\nMost of these things are pretty simple. Product launches typically involve testing, customer support briefing, marketing and, ideally, measurement. \n\nYou can probably do similar things for most other questions. \n\nBut always remember that you are a product manager, not a product monkey.

You're offloading the tactical and guiding the big picture by synthesizing what is important, anticipating user behavior, and knowing where to drill down and where to save time.\n\n\nNow to your question on the job hunt. You have ~3 issues here. \n1. Getting the interview\n2. Passing the filters for boilerplate PM work\n3. Demonstrating high level PM leadership commensurate with Sr or Sr Princ. level work\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\n1. Is about having a resume that fits the expected formulas. Watch the Google video on building your resume. Use AI to interview yourself about your work and write it for you (then edit yourself, obviously). Tell it exactly what role you are aiming for. Put metrics here even if it's not product directly: \"got half of PMs in my org building specs my way and saved devs a week of meetings\" or whatever.\n\n\n2. Practice the dance. If you're asked how you'd go about building a new feature, you're expected to follow a pattern that is generic. Fine. You can use AI again for practice, and watch interview videos.\n\n\n3. Leadership is a story telling skill. So is compelling writing. PMs have to do both, daily. Work on learning the stories you can tell about yourself. Write them down. Get AI critique. Edit. Read them. Get crystal clear on your own mythology. Personally I hate the \"tell me about a time when\" questions, but you can anticipate them and have a story adjacent and ready to go that you tell over and over. \n\n\nAnd finally, know yourself. What are you exceptionally good at? Besides PM tasks, I mean. In my case, I've found I'm far better at intuitive pattern recognition and putting high level structure to ambiguity quickly than the vast majority of my peers. I see priorities and put boxes around complexity. Now that doesn't mean I'm automatically any damn good at anything I do or that I'm better than peers at my job, but it gives me a lens through which I can tell my story and demonstrate value. At work I can lean into it in the service of others and create impact through being a willing volunteer, and it adds to the stories I tell. All impact is someone else's perception of value.",

          "text": "The fact that you went from APM to Principal in four years at one company is both an incredible achievement and the likely source of your current \"thinking\" block. You have essentially spent your entire career in one \"ecosystem,\" and while you mastered that specific culture, you are now facing the gilded cage effect. You are excellent at being a principal at *your* company, but you haven't yet built the \"generalized\" muscles that work everywhere else.\n\nHere is a tactical way to reset your brain and regain your confidence:\n\n**1. Move from frameworks to first principles** The reason your mind goes blank on questions like “How would you build X?” is likely because you are trying to find the \"correct\" framework to fit the answer. At the principal level, frameworks are often a trap. Instead, start with the system logic. If someone asks how to build a global notification system, don't think about user personas, think about the data flow. How does the trigger reach the user? What breaks first? When you anchor your thinking in how things actually work (technical orchestration), the \"product\" answers start to flow naturally because they are grounded in reality, not abstract theory.\n\n**2. The \"proof of work\" interview hack** If your brain blanks under pressure during interviews, stop trying to win the \"verbal sparring\" match. Most people with social anxiety struggle with the performance aspect of interviews. You can bypass this by having proof of work. In 2026, a Principal PM who can show a live url of a functional tool or a detailed technical map they built using AI orchestration is 10x more convincing than someone who just talks well. When you have something tangible to show, the interview becomes a \"walkthrough\" of your work rather than a high-pressure interrogation.\n\n**3. Resetting the \"impostor\" narrative** You didn't get to principal in four years by accident. You likely have a high \"delivery-to-noise\" ratio. Your company kept promoting you because you solved problems. The reason you can’t articulate your impact right now is that you’re looking for \"grand strategy\" stories when your real strength is probably \"high-velocity execution.\" Document your wins as technical de-risking events. Did you save a launch? Did you identify a scaling bottleneck? Those are your stories.\n\n**4. The job hunt strategy for low confidence** If you aren't getting calls, it is usually a resume formatting issue. In the current market, \"generalist\" principal pms are being overlooked for \"technical\" pms who understand ai integration. Update your resume to highlight your experience with AI-driven product cycles and agentic workflows. Even if you haven't done it at scale, showing that you are currently building and learning in this space will trigger the algorithms and the recruiters.\n\n**What actually helps?** Start building something small and solo. When you are the one responsible for the logic, the \"PM thinking\" comes back because it has to. It forces you to get out of your head and into the build. Once you see a live url of something you created, that \"bad at thinking\" feeling usually disappears.",

There is a lot in product that come from pure experience and time, and even if you have just absolutely rocked your current role, there just hasn’t been enough time for you to encounter many of the situations that a principal would be expected to manage. \n\nI know it may be hard to hear, but you might be better served “stepping back” (not really, but just in title) in your next role so you can get the extra experience under your belt. You clearly have a lot of potential, but I think it’s going to be unlikely that you’ll really be in the running for a true principal role. With only 4 years experience at one company, even a Senior PM role is probably going to be difficult to get an interview.",

Start with whatever your last annual salary was, plus any expenses related to benefits that will now come out of your pocket . . . for burning through over the next year to get your first client.\n\nIf you are talking about moving to a consulting firm in the role of PM, that's different, and I would tell you that if you enjoy your current job do not leave it for the lure of consulting without understanding the cons.  There are definitely pros, but the cons can be brutal. \n\nResource and budget constraints are an issue no matter where you are, but there is a layer of this in consulting that makes it worse.  When you work for a consultant and are an ethical PM you form a relationship with your client in which you act as a steward of quality and their best interest.  This may be in direct opposition to the Sales and C-Suite of your consulting firm who care almost exclusively about the bottom line of the company, in which case they will put the added pressure on you to get what you can out of the relationship . . . which, if you are ethical, will make you vomit in your mouth.\n\nThe other con is that consultants are always chasing the next gig, juggling clients in order to bridge project gaps, while simultaneously dealing with the same problems of resource and budget issues.  Of course, this is amplified in boutique firms, but while you may have more stability at a big consulting firm, the climate and financial stability can change on a dime, if they lose a big client.\n\nHaving worked for a large-scale corporation that built and sold their own IT products, having worked at a mid-size firm in which we built our own internal IT products, and having worked at a boutique consulting firm, had I to pick again, the last place I would go would be the consulting route.",

          "text": "Here's what I do that works as well as anything I've tried:\n\n\\- Make a list of everyone who needs to be on the call\n\n\\- Call (don't text / email) everyone on the list 1:1. Tell them you're going to schedule an alignment meeting to get \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\[people\\] aligned around path forward for \\_\\_\\_\\_ topic, and that you wanted their input before the meeting. Framing it as \"soliciting feedback\" is critical - you want to make them feel special, like their opinion matters and that's why you're reaching out the THEM directly (they don't need to know you're doing the same thing for everyone else who will be on the call).\n\n\\- On each 1:1 call, introduce super high level direction / goal for whatever it is that you're trying to get alignment around - don't get into detail on whatever plan you have, or show all your cards. Then, shut up and listen. 9/10 times they'll tell you every objection they have, and what they think you should do instead. Don't debate, just ask questions and figure out why. What are their motivations? Fears? Hesitations? Do they have conflicting goals? Are they counting on resources that you need and therefore they're worried they won't get their bonus? Are they making assumptions / missing context? Etc. Etc.\n\n\\- Rinse, repeat with everyone. \\[Reminder, this is all BEFORE the alignment call\\]\n\n\\- Now you have a list of each stakeholder's motivations, objections, and fears... i.e. you know exactly what each person is going to say / react to on the call, and can adjust your plan for how to navigate the call.\n\n\\- I like to sprinkle little nuggets / anecdotes from each person throughout the deck / presentation (I use quotes / terms verbatim, so they know they were the person you got the ideas from). E.g. Jim said \"doing X is going to take resources and delay the delivery of Y!\" ... Literally add a bullet to the \"risks\" and write Jim's comment \\*exactly as he said it\\*.  E.g. 2: Suzy is advocation for you to do X thing in Y way - you were already planning on doing exactly that, and had that concept in the deck... go update the deck to use the EXACT wording Suzy used on the call...Boom! Now Suzy thinks she gave you that idea in her pre-call with you, and smirks when you get to that slide.  etc. etc.\n\n\\- \\[OPTIONAL\\] - After the 1:1, but before the alignment call, if there's anything particularly controversial that you are still going to present / talk about, call the stakeholder who disagrees. Make them feel heard, or even make them believe you agree with them, but most importantly give them a heads up that you are going to still present the thing they disagree with in the meeting for X/Y/Z reason... You can even tell them \"look, I will add your counter points to the presentation and when we get to them I will tap you in to share your opinion... but to the extent that we go the other direction that I know you don't agree with, I need your help moving things along and I want to ask that you disagree and commit.\"\n\n\\- If you do this right, you will have alignment before you walk into your alignment call...but nobody else knows that... they all think that their voice was most important in crafting the solution that you want to align everyone around. You know every objection that people are going to bring up and you've already mitigated them. You've also already gotten the strongest personalities to commit (to you) to playing ball and \"disagreeing and committing\" in the meeting.  \n\nTL;DR - Call everyone 1:1 first, hear their objections, make them feel special and heard, and then you'll walk into the alignment call already having alignment.",

If you walk into a room of leaders without knowing exactly what they are going to say, it's a much harder conversation.\n\nHere is the three-step flow to handle this:\n\n1. The real work: speak to key stakeholders before the big meeting. Show them a rough draft and ask, \"Is there anything in here that would make you say no?\" It is much easier to handle an objection in a private chat than in front of a crowd. By the time the big meeting starts, you should already have everyone's \"soft\" approval.\n2. The meeting: The actual meeting is just a formality to get everyone to say \"yes\" at the same time. Keep it specific. State the problem, present the solution you already vetted in your 1:1s, and ask if there are any final blockers. Since you already did the pre-wire, there shouldn't be any surprises.\n3. The alignment lockin: Send a recap email within an hour. Start with, \"Great meeting. Here is what we aligned on and who is owning the next steps.\" If it isn't in writing, the alignment is hard to resurrect 😂\n\nSince you are new, use the \"I'm still learning the landscape\" excuse to ask leaders for 1:1s. It is the best way to build a rapport while secretly getting your plan approved.",

      "text": "Hi all, \nI am quite struggling in my new role as a PM. Unfortunately my manager is also new and he doesn't have product background, he came from sales. I'm feeling quite stuck between stakeholders and engineering pushing different directions and even not managing transferring the requirements. \n\nTo give some context, I work at a large, established B2B company that is historically hardware-driven, but has also growing software organization. Part of our software work results in standalone products, while another part is developed for internal business units. So in many cases, hardware teams are my clients.\n\nFrom the stakeholders, a big request is to launch as quick as possible so that we are the first in the market. On the other hand architects have been spending 3 months to explore and answer some architectural questions and now they want to have another exploratory 3/6 months period. They say in this period they want to prototype so that we get feedback and we derisk architectural decisions. They don't want me to come up with a well defined scope for this period but they say we do as far as we come and they already mention 20% rework later. We made already prototypes in product management side and we already have feedback and confidence for business outcome. So I find the entire story from architects completely unacceptable but I don't know how to handle it. \n\nAnyone would be interested in mentoring me for some well defined situations like this.  There is quite some politics which I'm not ready to handle so it would be best to have some sessions with someone who is familiar to a setting like mine. \n\nThank you in advance!!\n",

As a mentor, set up booking questions like what topics or why did you choose me to help set up more context.\n- mentors be explicit about what you don’t want to help with. For me, I prefer not to help with job hunting topics.\n- and beware of people using it for product research. It’s happened a few times and is really annoying.",

A good thing to do here is to deploy incrementally. From your total scope, can you divide it into a few versions? What would be you V1? When you deploy this way, you derisk development and tend to stakeholders' expectations.\n\n\nOn engineering asking for months to prototype:\nYou'll have to persuade them into building something simpler and shape up from there. Study lean development and shape up methodology, might give you some insights.\n\n\nAnd most importantly, going through it will give you experience to handle these situations better in the future. It might be confusing now, but a few years in the future you'll be able to handle it much better. Hang in there!",

If they're looking to derisk architectural decisions then state what they are and the consequences if they happen. Sometimes you move ahead and accept that level of risk. This is a joint decision between stakeholders and engineering. If your clients are internal hardware teams then judge the downside risk. I would not accept loose scope. If I give you a month I expect concrete outcomes at the end of it.   \n  \n\\- Stakeholders - You generally have 3 factors when building. You have scope, resources and deadlines. If you want to push any of these then you need to compromise. Generally resources are fixed so if they want speed then you need to cut scope. Don't try and promise everything. This will almost always fail.   \n  \n\\- Communicating to engineering - You have 2 options. Escalate to engineering leadership who are normally more tied into business outcomes or make it clear that they are accountable for failing to launch lands on them.   \n   \n\\- For you - I wouldn't conflate prototypes in product management and derisking architectural decisions. These are different risk profiles. The best thing you can do is align the two groups to drive towards a decision. What is the risk, how much time do we need to derisk it and what is our accepted launch date.",

That urge to add \"just one more B2B feature\" is usually just a defense mechanism to delay the pain of finding out if people actually want what you are building.\n\nThe community-led approach you mentioned is actually the most reliable forcing function I have seen work. Transitioning from \"solo tinkering\" to a \"pressure cooker\" environment changes everything. When you have a small group of beta testers expecting a weekly update, the fear of launching is replaced by the fear of letting your users down. It forces you to prioritize the core logic over the \"nice-to-have\" stuff.\n\nMy current hack for validation is the \"Live URL\" test. I stopped building full-stack MVPs behind closed doors. Now, I use tools like Cursor and v0 to ship a functional, single-feature tool. If I can't get 10 strangers to click that link and get value out of the core logic immediately, I don't spend another minute on it. Real-world pressure is the only thing that kills \"tinkering mode.\"\n\nI have seen this work exceptionally well in cohort-based setups. Having a group of peers who are also shipping at the same time provides the \"honest feedback\" you are looking for because they understand the struggle of the build. It turns validation from a lonely, existential crisis into a tactical group sport.\n\nIf you are stuck in \"tinkering\", my advice is to stop coding for a second and find your \"hand-raisers\" first. Build a functional slice of your idea, put it on a live URL, and see who actually uses it.",

As u/NihilisticMacaron said, you start with the perceived business problem to solve.  If you have not realistically defined this and overestimated the importance to solve . . . if there is not a market for a solution, then there is no reason to build it. \n\nThe other bit of advice I would give is to avoid building a coded prototype that expends too much time.  You just need visuals that can walk a user through the workflow.  I cannot tell you how many time execs that are terrible at their jobs will send a team of engineers off to code a live prototype, wasting so much money, because they came up with an idea or feature on a whim, only to find out that their idea was in a vacuum and not validated as needed, or that someone else had penetrated the market to a level that could not be easily overcome.",

For me at least it's more about the practice of empathy and finding the \"question behind the question\" (or the feedback behind the feedback).\n\nA question I always include in some form: \"when did you hit frustration / the most frustrating thing\" or \"what broke your flow?\" The flow one has surfaced some great insights over time, and I suspect it tends to be where people get interrupted or disconnected from solving their problem in the first place.\n\nedit - words\n\nedit 2 - there are lots of \"discovery hacks\" out there, but I find they tend to be more about injecting AI automation than actually improving discovery.

For me it was due to context switching and being \"too available.\" Slack is very helpful and far superior to Teams, but it also can really kneecap your productivity unless you approach it in a more controlled way. I check it in the AM, at lunch, 3pm and then before I shut the laptop for the day.\n\nA few suggeestions:\n\n\\- Create scarcity. Take a day off and let everyone adjust to the feeling of you not being as responsive. I had a boss who had to coach me for months, reassuring me that it was in my best interest to ignore certain slack messages sometimes indefinitely. Once people stopped expecting me to respond right away, the urgency went down and I was able to start doing valuable work again. I take a scarcity day ever six months or so and am further reinvigorated by how much more appreciative some folks are when I do go back online.\n\n\\- Control slack before it controls you - Whatever internal messaging app you use might be getting out of control with the notifications. Maybe you can mute some channels? Never be ashamed to leave a slack channel that is doing nothing for you. It goes back to scarcity. When you show that you value your time, others will follow suit.\n\n\\- Take care of yourself - sounds like you're working a lot of hours, OP. I'll save you all the cliche shit like \"work will always be there\" and just say this... when you take time off and do things other than work, it can lead to the most productive, high output, creative and memorable of your life. Make sure you're balancing things the best you can.",

I've gone back and forth between IC and manager roles, I like them both for different reasons. \n\nThere are places where you simply \"top out\" as an IC at Principal and this causes some PMs to switch over to people manager simply so they can get promoted.  I think this explains the general lack of quality in our PM leadership when it comes to people management skills.  Most PM leaders that I have worked for are continuing to act like PMs instead of managing the team.  I've had several PMs join my team only to be shocked that I want to talk to them about career development and other very basic people manager tasks.\n\nSo, no, I would say that people management isn't a \"core skill\" for PM.  Just the opposite.  Very rare to run into a PM leader who is good at it.  I can think of only two or three in my entire career.\n\nI was very lucky in that I didn't come to PM until later.  I was a former Director of Presales Engineering who took a step down to be a Senior PM.  My first PM manager had no business having direct reports.  He seemed surprised to see me each day.  1:1 meetings were a bother for him.  No guidance, no personal development, etc..  I had to look elsewhere to learn how to be a PM.

People are not “manageable”, because they have feelings, emotions, opinions, thoughts, worries, etc.\n\nSo, it comes down to leading people. And (people) leadership is a special skill.\nThink about your past careeer; and think of how often you had a manager or leader that truly cared for you and that inspired you. It seems often not a lot of great examples exist. Most people are mediocre at best.\nThat is because it takes something special. You’ve gotta be okay with all the different personalities, traits, behaviors, emotions, and find a good way to lead.\n\nThat can be extremely rewarding, but it’s also hard work.\n\nI teach a course called “Leadership for Product Mangers”, and we talk about three pillars:\n- Leading yourself \n- Leading the product (through vision, strategy; discovery, etc)\n- Leading others/leading people\n\nFor lower level/Mid level PMs we can argue you lead through the product and often your team reports into somebody else, so use product skills to lead. \n\nBut more senior level PMs would need to develop some people leadership skills, which in my opinion, not everyone is suited for (to do a really great job).\n\nTherefore some might pick a different type of career not needing to have to lead people",

For PMs, that's not the case.\n\nThe other reason is a lot of people move into product after starting as an IC in an other adjacent field and then there's just never really the opportunity to move into a people management role. Most companies do not utilize multiple layers of management between VPs/CPO and senior PMs. There's maybe one director with a half dozen PMs and seniors and that's sufficient. Orgs scaling up in the last 7-10 years used more Group PMs and the like but those middle management roles are not that critical and most \"Senior\" PMs don't manage juniors, so there's a big gap between being a mid-career senior PM and a group PM or other people manager. \n\nLess opportunity and more pathways to career success as an IC mean most people just do that. And if you do hire a PM to be a people manager, you often find a candidate who has already done it vs trusting someone you like internally to take on that entirely new skill.",

Observe where people are spending time. A couple examples can be (1) Are PMs spending too much time directly with internal teams educating/teaching? Can you be the functional liaison there 50% of the time? (2) Is engineering taking many direct tickets that could be troubleshooted by support? Does support need a tool to solve this problem, or is there an information gap?\n\n2. Product Operations should be product first and operations second. Every person I've seen that struggled couldn't see the forest from the trees. They would come into every project / effort with a playbook, but they didn't want to dive into what is truly novel in that situation. Everything situation is different. Adapt fast, be flexible, fill the gaps and scale. Understand where  you should be diving deep.

But the fact that you don’t have a ton of data makes it hard to gain the knowledge so you have to leverage existing customers for much of it. If you’re an early-stage B2B you might not have that either, so you’re back to vibes. \n\nu/jerquatrro if you are knowledgeable in the B2B space you’re considering, that could be great for your career as you can act like the true SME internally and with customers. If you’re not already there, then B2C might be a better fit since you typically have a lot more signals (plus messing up a single customer relationship is less life/death).",

Product-market fit is the name of the game and you're dealing with execs and the sales teams. \n\n\nInternal products is more chilled. Stakeholders are easier to pin down and requirements are usually clearer.  Problems here come when the senior leadership changes and the 'need' for certain products and programs evaporates.
