      "text": "I have a decade in PM. I started building apps with AI last year for rapid prototyping in my day job. Naturally, I explored ideas in my own time ..not because I had a startup idea…Because I looked at what the market wants from PMs now and realised my CV was going stale.\n\nEvery job spec wants “AI experience” or “technical fluency” or “full stack PM.” The market shifts to do everything …\n\nThe first app I built in Lovable. It looked beautiful. Zero security, zero business model, zero point. But it was so easy it was almost boring.\n\nThe second one solved a real problem for my team. I mixed Lovable with Cursor, added GitHub for version control, hosted it on Netlify. Still no auth, no database. Just a useful thing that exists. \n\nThe third one is where it got interesting. Not because I suddenly became a developer….I’m still not writing code. AI writes it. But I wanted to do a bit more. So instead of one tool abstracting everything away, I used the pieces separately. Next.js for the framework. Vercel for hosting. Supabase for the database. Upstash for rate limiting. Claude’s API directly. Resend for emails. Cursor orchestrating the AI coding.\n\nThat’s when things started breaking. And that’s when I started learning. I journaled all of it.\n\nI made a couple more apps since…each getting a little better. Focusing on security… RLS etc \n\nEvery day I built, I wrote up what happened. Not documentation. Just me explaining concepts to myself. What broke…What I learned. Why something worked the way it did.\n\nThose journals turned into personal playbooks. And now when someone asks about a technical trade-off, I don’t construct a hypothetical. I read my own notes. \n\nThe building is valuable. The writing about the building is what compounded …And once you’ve built a couple of apps, you’ve basically got a portfolio. \n\nThe same way UX designers are compelled to talk through their portfolio you can too. You can populate it with case studies. Lessons learned. How you’d scale it. What strategy you took and why. Hiring managers can actually look at something instead of taking your word for it… \n\nThe commercial awareness you pick up is the bonus. Cost optimisation for AI is a real skill now. Which model for which task. Haiku is 10x cheaper but falls apart on complex instructions. Structured outputs forces Claude to return data in an exact format, no conversational fluff, no mistakes. Sounds perfect until you notice it adds latency and slows your shit down. Model updates break your app overnight with no warning.\n\nThe job market wants “full stack PMs” now (even if they don’t explicitly say it!) Whether that’s reasonable is a different conversation. But if that’s where things are heading, I’d rather have something to show than hope my existing experience translates.\n\nIf you’re a PM thinking about future-proofing: pick a problem you actually have. Build something that solves it badly. Document what went wrong. Keep it hosted so you can talk through it and demo it. Better yet host all the links to your  apps on a landing page. \n\nEdit: this advice is probably more geared to new PMs starting out and struggling to get a role, or those who are stuck on internal tool product work and can’t really flex other things marketing and distribution.

Yep, I also noticed this idea of Full Stak PM which honestly I think it's a unicorn (one in a billion).\n\nAnyway, build a portfolio of products explaining the reational, economics, etc. seems a logical step in the PM job search.\n\nHowever, my view, my understanding is that you tend to be more a Full Stack Dev than a Ful Stack PM. The role of a PM, for me, seems more about: research the right business problem to solve (demostrate it with metrics like market size, etc.), finding the right product/feature-market fit (again based on metrics), market your product (aka marketing), Creating the business case (I think you did this one), etc. \n\nAgain, this is my view, and honestly, I may be wrong because when I see Full Stack PM in articles, job post, etc. they are looking for Full Stack Dev. PMs define the WHAT, Devs define the HOW, and selecting the LLM is a HOW not a WHAT. Selecting the business problem to solve is the WHAT.",

Understanding customers, distribution, pricing, all that stuff matters more than whether I can deploy to Vercel.\n\nNot saying don't learn technical stuff, but building apps with AI isn't the same as being a \"full stack PM.\" It's just prompting with extra steps.",

I spent years in product at eBay and other big tech, left three years ago to do consulting, and more recently started building products with a co-founder - we launched our first one three months back and are already onto the second. What I've noticed is exactly what you're describing but from the other side of it: the bottleneck has genuinely moved. Vibe coding means the hard part isn't syntax anymore, it's problem definition, scoping, knowing what to build and what to leave out, understanding tradeoffs - all stuff that good PMs have been doing forever, just without the ability to immediately act on it. Your point about journaling is underrated though, I think a lot of PMs will start building but skip the reflection piece and wonder why the learning doesn't stick. The portfolio isn't just proof for hiring managers, it's proof to yourself that you actually understand what you made. One thing I'd add for anyone reading this who's earlier in their career: don't wait until you feel ready or until you have a \"real\" idea, the first few things you build will be rough and that's the point, you learn more from the breaking than from the building.",

Luckily I already have great in depth knowledge about our customers, users and use cases with too much voluntary feedback to even digest at this point (i.e. super engaged users) - so I'll start from that and see where it takes me.\n\nOne thing though...\n\nWhere do I comment VIBING2026 to get a free sample of your playbook (sarcasm intended) 😁\n\nHave an awesome new year and best of luck to everyone learning more about these types of AI decisions.",

The real life business strategies are reliable. The writing styles aren’t all the exact same. \n\nWhen Claude doesn’t understand the prompt, it asks clarifying questions. When recalling past conversations, it doesn’t forget half of it.\n\nClaude is so much more reliable for everything besides image creation, which let’s be honest are only for memes at this point, and deep research. Now I will say, I think the deep research is a lot better with chatgpt, and makes the case to keep the subscription for that single application mode.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Disagree?",

      "text": "I'm a Senior PO now, but years ago my first break into tech was a Business Analyst. I was embedded in a dev team, basically shadowing my PO. When the PO prioritised a feature, however big or small, it was my job to dig into what that actually meant. What was the impact on the wider product, how would we break it down into individual user stories, what would those stories look like? This allowed the PO to focus on the **why** and **when** of what was being delivered, while I as the BA focused on the **how**. Not in terms of project delivery, timelines, or cost, but the low level detail of the feature, into user stories, acceptance criteria etc.\n\nYears later, having moved onto being a PO, and now Sr. PO, it seems rare that companies even bother with BAs any more. More and more POs are spending time focusing on low level requirements, writing jira tickets, UAT testing, leading backlog refinements to answer detail on edge cases, as BAs are often missed out of the entire structure.\n\nIs SAFe to blame? As that doesn't have BAs at all.\n\nIt's not all companies, but it feels like an increasing number of companies are removing the BA role and expecting the PO to do it.\n\nMaybe it's a UK thing and other countries are different?",

              "text": "Hijacking the top post to challange the belief that eliminating business analysts (or scrum masters, QA, managers, or whatever titles are considered \"non-essential\") actually accomplishes anything positive.\n\nIn my experience, this approach doesn't save a salary, it just eliminates a title in the org chart. The work previously done by business analysts still needs to be done, which means someone is doing it, and being paid.  Generally speaking, that person was hired to do something else, and hired because they were good at the thing they were hired to do.  Often they aren't very interested in (or particularly good at) doing things a BA would do, but the work still needs to be done.  So, it gets done less well and/or slower than before.  As a result, capacity decreases and problems increase.  In the interest of \"eliminating a position\", we often make our teams less efficient, less effective, and less happy.\n\nWhile I'm on a rant, DevOps doesn't mean saving money by making your developers responsible for your Ops functions.  It means reducing friction by connecting your dev people and your ops people to create overlaps and insight where there were once gaps and a wall that people were chucking problems over.\n\nI've spent years fighting with people (often fueled by consultants) who don't understand the purpose of Agile, of DevOps, of Product, or even Cloud, and think everything is supposed to be a cost cutting measure.  That isn't the purpose of any of these, and every time I've seen someone sell these transformation as cost-saving initiatives, they've failed to deliver either cost savings or the benefits those transformations should actually deliver.",

If I wanted to do BA work, I wouldn't have transitioned into a PO role. \n\nAs a BA I was only really thinking weeks, sprints, maybe a couple of sprints ahead, where as a PO I'm thinking months, quarters, even years ahead. If as PO I'm focusing on story writing, low level detail, backlong refinements, answering edge case questions mid-sprint, guess what I'm not doing? Thinking about long term strategy and benefit, ensuring the right thing is being built now as opposed to the wrong thing, building stakeholder relationships. Or maybe I am, but as I'm wearing two hats I'm doing neither one particularly well.\n\nIt feels so many companies have just given BAs a PO title, small pay bump, and made them do both roles.",

I work in a very fast-paced industry, mostly in tech transformations. The concept that the PM should do everything is ridiculous. This is just a small list of what is expected:\n\n* Talk to customers\n* Talk to stakeholders\n* Gain alignment\n* Document the what/why\n* Review charts/graphs\n* Develop experiments\n* Work with design\n* Drive delivery\n* Work with LT\n* Share out results\n* Gather new ideas\n* Manage a backlog\n\nThat's insane.\n\nHow we use BAs - I use the analogy of navigating a lake. The PMs stay at the surface level of everything so they can navigate and direct us where to go (areas of opportunity). BAs dive deep into the water - they work from the surface of the lake to the bottom. They partner with PMs to identify anything that may trip us up as we move forward. PMs should rarely have to dive deep into every aspect of the work. If this is happening, they have lost focus on what/why/customer.\n\nBeen using this model for 10 years and it works.

We involve Solution Architects when it is a very complex feature or has different microservices intertwined. \n\nWe create the technical documentation, API definitions, User Stories and drive the refinements, the rest, we are involved, but in a consulting/monitoring role. We of course involve everyone on the definition of the solution, but we are the owners of it, the choice is ours.\n\nI understand Technical Product Owners are normally associated to Product Managers/Owners for Core Technology Platforms (Cloud, plugins, etc), but i would say it is according on the business needs of the company. \n\nWe really enjoy our work, every new requirement is a new challenge and few feelings at work compare to see how Product Managers use a solution you designed and how it can be reused for other purposes due to our solution creation foresight.",

It will continue predicting based on the lines you gave it. So yes, it will help you build the wrong things faster.\n\nAn embedded systems team I worked with adopted LLMs into their workflow pretty early on. They didn't have much experience in either field and were working on a pretty poorly defined problem. Those who relied on the LLMs didn't tend to understand the relationship between their designs and the requirements or desireable qualities of the project. It was a big hassle that resulted in more design review rounds since they weren't applying critical thought beyond what the LLM was spitting out. \n\nWe would have done with more talking with the client and thinking about what we actually needed to build. A good lesson I've taken for our future work. Then perhaps we could have applied LLMs, but honestly I find I spend more time herding and explaining context than getting useful work done.",

I was a solid performer, felt competent, and was even promoted to a leadership role \n\nI moved into PM because I wanted to be closer to the actual product, work directly with engineering and design, and be part of making product decisions. The role itself sounded (and still sounds) exciting to me.\n\nBut honestly, my experience so far has been… bad. People are great and the company's culture is amazing - I seem to be the problem.\n\nI’ve gotten positive feedback from my manager and my eng manager counterpart, but day to day I feel like I’m drowning. After more than 6 months, I still struggle with things that will sound very basic: making decisions, giving engineers enough clarity, and moving design discussions and decisions forward at a reasonable pace. I often feel slow, unprepared and like I’m not adding value.\n\nI’m putting a lot of effort into learning and improving, but I’ve started questioning whether PM is actually for me or not... The confusing part is that I like the job, weirdly enough, I just feel like I suck at it right now.\n\nTwo questions:\n1. If this happened to you, how did you recover from a rough start as a PM?\n2. How do you personally tell the difference between “this is just a steep learning curve” and “this role isn’t the right fit”?\n\nAny insights are appreciated. I read through many posts, and saw a lot about impostor syndrome or organizational problems, but that isn't my key issue.\n\nTL;DR: I like being a PM but feel bad at it after 6+ months in a PM role.

These are the insights I’ve uncovered from my discovery for context…” \n\nI can guarantee that you that you’ll garner more respect, because engineers and designers can smell bullshit from a mile away, and the truest sigh of intelligence is being aware of what you don’t know instead of trying to fake it till you make it. Plus, people usually love being looped in and jamming together on ideas instead of being told what to do. So turn it into a dialogue, leverage your colleagues and accept that you’re on a learning curve that will feel uncomfortable for a while longer.\n\nOver time you will gain “product sense” and confidence with experience. You’ll be able to challenge your colleagues opinions and have conviction in your own ideas. Your work will still be very much focused around having a dialogue, but you’ll be respected enough to lead and be trusted. \n\nIn the meantime, to remember that you are in fact adding lots of value, think to yourself: imagine if my squad didn’t have me? Sure, you’re not committing code, but I guarantee you’re doing a bunch of other tasks that shield your team from the drudgery of working in any bureaucracy, and letting them focus on what they love doing best.

That gave me the raw look at long-term strategy and what they actually expected from us. I also dug into documented outcomes from 'balanced scorecard' exercises, those are goldmines for understanding how leadership measures success. Once I knew what the Board wanted and what the Managers feared, the Product Vision basically wrote itself.\nTo map out the 'chess board,' I actually created personal Kanban boards for every department. It was just for me, but it helped me visualize their specific pain points and how they planned to hit their targets.\nBut the biggest move was the Coffee and lunch. I spent a lot of time just listening. Having lunch together builds a level of trust that you’ll never get in a formal meeting. Managers would share their honest thoughts on what was actually working versus what the official strategy said.\nSometimes the best 'action' isn't a task, it's just finding the right questions and listening until the patterns emerge.",

          "text": "You mention experience in analytics, which I imagine involved a lot of communicating trends to help decision makers, or even you being the decision maker yourself. What is making you feel less confident in your decision making? Without knowing that answer yet, it sounds like maybe you’re hesitating or second guessing your own ability to be the driving voice in these new spaces. Perhaps being unsure if your suggestions are the “best path”? If any of that resonates, I’d say fall back to your analytics background. You can make data tell pretty much any story you want, it’s about applying strategy and vision to them. Sure, a design concept might not be perfectly hashed yet, or a launch / test might not seem fool-proof, but in a lot of PM roles you’re supposed to master the “fail fast pivot faster” route. It all depends on how agile your company really is and their risk appetite, but once you get a grasp on those things you shouldn’t let failure be your fear. Not moving forward confidently with plan Bs & Cs is the fatal flaw in most PMs, imho.\n\nIf you’re more so feeling like you can’t move fast enough, find tools that help you move faster. Believe it or not using copilot in vscode for writing my own markdown files helped increase my pace immensely because it helps generate your ideas faster than you can (but you need a really close eye on the value of the suggestions too). Both of those were free to install  and passed my company security, even if no other PMs were using it.\n\nBut if I’m off base, I’m still curious to hear what you feel like your blockers are.",

I'd say this: maybe your rough start isn't you but the organization you're in.   \n  \nMy advice: no PM gig goes by the book - each one needs to be tailored to where the leaders and culture and team is at, and ideally move the org towards high performance. Find the currency of your stakeholders, make them seem like rockstars wherever you can, and put numbers on the board that resonate with leadership. That will build your credibility and give you the mojo to move the organization towards a more product-adapted culture.",

Product influencers and authors and podcasters don’t dwell on these feelings but these feelings accompany not just learning but mastering something.  Getting to 75% competence is exhausting, 99% feels impossible. There are no shortcuts or frameworks or matrices for these feelings because so much of the job is unique to the culture and people there. You will likely feel like this in every new product role you take for the first 9 months- not the exact same because you’ll know this a part of any ramp, but a lot of the job can’t be taught to you\n\n2. Every manager is different and nearly all of them want to worry about less stuff. “You’re doing great” can often be synonymous with “I don’t know/care how you’re doing”. Make sure you advocate for yourself without too much honesty about feeling insufficient. I have never seen one company ramp/train a PM well.\n\nHang in there! Keep going",

In B2B Product Management, the inputs are messy, and the 'architecture' of your decision making hasn't caught up to the complexity of the new role yet.\n\nTo your two questions:\n\n**1. How to recover?** Treat yourself like a product in beta. If your engineers lack clarity, it’s usually because the 'Requirements Architecture' is broken. Start using a rigid framework for every decision. Instead of 'thinking' about a choice, run it through a standard weighted scoring model (like RICE) and share that *exact* logic with your team. When engineers see the 'architecture' behind your thought process, they gain confidence even if you’re still learning the technical side.\n\n**2. Learning Curve vs. Wrong Fit?** The difference lies in the 'Energy Tax.'\n\n* **Steep Curve:** You are exhausted because you are building new mental workflows (learning how to architect a roadmap).\n* **Wrong Fit:** You are exhausted because the core activities (negotiating, trade-offs, ambiguity) fundamentally drain your soul.\n\nSince you said you actually *like* the job, you’re likely just in the 'Trough of Disillusionment' where your taste is higher than your current output. Focus on building better **operating rituals** (weekly sync templates, decision logs, etc.). Once the 'system' is in place, the 'drowning' feeling usually turns into 'swimming.'

All ambiguity should be foreseen, and it should be impossible for developers to misunderstand.

Honestly, I wish my company provided the right resources—like Jira accounts and the necessary tools—so I could draft features, epics, and user stories directly with Copilot. Right now, the systems don’t talk to each other: epics and features sit in Aha, while Jira integrates only with Aha. What I really need is a way to connect Copilot seamlessly, ideally with a single click to push everything across. Deep integrations between Jira and Copilot could make backlog grooming far easier and help address the critical path in each sprint.

              "text": "That's a common refrain I hear, and one of multiple explanations is this: companies will sometimes use the same job requisition or job listing for ongoing recruitment. They keep one pipeline open, so it may appear to a job seeker that it's the same job over and over. On their end, they're just using it to fill the same type of role.\n\nAnother case is where they had a candidate in the process but lost out to someone else. There are more reasons, but not every role is fake simply because it's being reposted or has not been filled.\n\nI also agree that LinkedIn's \"new postings\" label is misleading, and that feedback continues to be shared with them, but I don't see them changing it. This report looks only at the total number of active listings and doesn't presume any of them to be new. It compares the total number of active listings to previous time periods when they were pulled.\n\nSo while there may be existing jobs that were live a month ago and are still live today, that nuance is not captured in the reports. The reports simply show the total number of open listings at the time I pulled the data.",

I think it's more a reflection of what's happening in the job market and how different it is from years past than a reflection on you specifically.\n\nMost product managers are spending around six months or more to find a new job. If you've only had four interviews after hundreds of applications, that's usually a signal that, despite what you've been doing, there is opportunity to improve your application conversion rate or that you're applying to roles where they're being more selective about who they interview.\n\nThe reality is nearly no one is finding new jobs in under two months, and that has been true for the past couple of years.

Or is it just more common in the US to have tech companies that work more smoothly and have less \"drama\"?\n\nFrom the outside, it seems that only 10% of tech companies have a real product-driven culture where strategy is clear, stakeholders are aligned, the focus is on shipping real value (for the user - not only the company) and overall there's less friction.

In the startup mode and growth mode, some things can be more product-driven.\n\nTypical companies are more focus on growing the business and products are just a vehicle to do this. Specially if you are in B2B. Product vision or strategy are rarely properly articulated. So yeah some companies will have stronger product culture while others won't, but I've never seen what is described in the books or podcasts.\n\nPM influencers tend to talk about the best scenario, which probably is very hard to achieve for most companies, if possible at all.\n\nCreating a product culture can work and make things smoother. The problem with the world of PM is that it has painted the picture of product being the center of everything, and at least in my experience, this is not often the case.\n\nBut I would say that pretty much the same goes for any other teams. And yes, sales tend to be highlighted in the results. \n\nIn my opinion companies should not focus so much on product-led or PMs, but focus on creating small squads that are responsible for the success of a product/business area. That tends to force them to work together, along and collaborate. And remove the silo mentality.\n\nBtw, I'm not saying product is not key, in my experience typically product and sales, some times other teams, are in the key discussions. \n\nBut we all know what happens when a big deal is proposed and where the product-driven philosophy goes.",

Even if I had the opportunity to visit more customers I likely couldn't due to having to work on hundred other things. I could do a ton of research and say \"Hey! This is what we should be doing and here's how I know it\" and it would be ignored because it doesn't align with the opinions of decision makers. \n\nEvery book I've read on PM seems idealized and the reality never seems to align.

If they focus on something else entirely, that’s often even more valuable.\n\nMy rule of thumb is: start broad, let users lead, and only narrow in once I understand what’s important to *them*, not what’s important to *me*.\n\nHope this helps!",

There are some PMs that are quite good at uncovering customers’ root problems while talking with them and not leading with a product/solution, but they are the minority. \n\nI do agree PMs should not outsource customer understanding but IMO they can do that better when they lean into the expertise of UXR (and not just UX Design either) to get them good data and then work together to interpret the “so what” and develop a proposal for “what now”",

          "text": "Let's not conflate different issues, and discuss each separately:\n\n\n1. *Product Managers should do UR?* Coldest take in the world. Of course. I think a better question is, \"does your organization actually follow best practice, or do they just do whatever pops into the CEOs head?\" I see this complaint a ton and also live it. The market cares a lot more about investors than users right now. The CEO and board are basically your investor researchers, and their voice is way louder right now, especially for established companies that can be traded. I expect this to change after the AI craze / stagflation period we're in, hopefully\n\n\n2. *Companies are reducing UR teams.* Yep. Long ago, in 2008, software was such a lucrative business--no overheard or physical cost to what you sell = insane profit margin--that companies could afford to split up the work across many individuals. We had engineers, scrum coaches, product managers, engineering managers who didn't actually write code, UX, UR, and QA all embedded in teams or in big departments. This has fallen off slowly for years. Every business now has a tech stack but the competition is a lot fiercer and only FAANG can afford all of those luxurious perks and hyper-specialized roles. Tools, including but also before AI, have moved in to help PMs or developers do more themselves. THIS is why they've gotten rid of User Researchers, not because it's a lower priority but because companies in general want everyone to do three jobs at once now.\n\n\nAnd... they're sort of right. And sort of wrong. Obviously every PM should be talking to clients and doing UR, but a lot of this was \"best practice\" bloat that the execs didn't actually use and I can't blame them for cutting. And I'm not one of the AI doom-and-gloomers, I think great humans (+ AI help) will always surpass pure AI. But having a UR team doesn't mean your company is actually learning and applying anything useful, and in the current era I don't see it being applied well or valued highly",

A good portion of that is because of organizational issues - executives telling their respective teams what is going to happen, for whom, and by when. This is a widespread corporate culture problem.

Research is all about uncertainty, and finding comfort in that uncertainty to provide insights. \n\nTo put it bluntly, researchers know there might not be an easily captured answer to a question.

There were/are lots of UXRs. Over my 14 year career, most PMs have wanted to be involved in research (as they should), but not to conduct it themselves. It takes time, it's also important to do it well. \nI think there's a balance though. Not all research is equal (in terms of the skills required), and it takes people literally years of just focussing on research to get good at the more complicated stuff. It's not a side hustle. I don't know you can do the bigger pieces of research you might need, as well as manage the product at the same time. In places Ive worked we've had a mix of projects we have helped other conduct pre tactical work, (usability etc), while leaving us to do the more complex or heavy weight strat work. That's often worked well, but still requires upskilling most people. \nAs a UXR I've got skills in product management, service design, and UCD, but these help me help those teams better, so our work is more integrated.

      "text": "Hi everyone. I am currently in a very challenging product role with no opportunity to seek mentorship internally within my company. I spent the past year feeling stuck and overwhelmed with the scale and volume of problems that I am trying to solve.\n\nAfter a lot of thought I feel what I need is to talk to a senior product professional that has a strong grasp of product fundamentals to help me stay grounded in what matters and in delivering value where it counts the most. Have you been in such a position before? Any recommendations for me on how to go about finding such mentorship opportunity? \n\nAlso if you feel it is worth it, I would be open to paid product coaching type sessions as well so feel free to share any experiences that you have with this. Thank you all!",

I checked LinkedIn profiles of people who were in similar roles, and if anyone was generous enough to mention type of product problems they solved in their bio and that resonated with me , I made a connection request. I am guilty of not going ahead with follow ups when initial messages were unanswered though.   \n3. ADPList was suggested to me by a friend who did find a mentor on that platform after much trial and error. You can try that  \n4. As of today, I am heavily relying on LLM (I use perplexity) as my guide/mentor and so far the bond has been going good (:P). I keep dumping context to it and at least an action plan is cooked, however imperfect.   \n5. I have also started believing in 'do good, get good'.

Ones that allow me to effectively organize my brain. Ones that allow me to effectively support my engineers.  \n\n3: It varies. Many PMs can have long careers with little technical knowledge, especially in B2B spaces where domain knowledge is sometimes considered equally or more important. I try to keep up to date with my technical know how, at a minimum it allows you to understand if your engineers are over or under estimating level of effort. I feel that is an important skill. Table stakes is knowing SQL for analytics purposes. \n\n4: There are many lists that teach you the fundamentals, Cagan, Eyal, Ries, etc are essential reading, but are not fully instructive for your actual role. Understanding the literature is valuable, but it is extremely unlikely you’ll ever work in a company where it operates by such ideals. Learn the basics, and then observe and write what you see working at your employer. Contrast that against the literature and develop your own hypothesis on how to be effective.

          "text": "Fundamentals\nI’ll go a bit deeper than the usual “ship fast and learn from customers”. These are three mantras I try to live by.\n\nUnderpromise overdeliver - whenever working with timing, plan pessimistically and ship early, e.g., when asked for a deadline, knowing you can deliver early this week, always say end of this week. Or when asked to present a mock-up, set expectations low and give high (more evidence = stronger use case)\n\nNever EVER leave with questions in your mind - (I’m a non-technical PM), but I always ask to the greatest extent possible, what technical implications are. Sometimes I just mention it’s just a couple lines of text, how hard can it be to change it? If you have the feeling at the end of a conversation with engineers that you still don’t fully understand what they’re doing or what the problem is, you need to clarify as much as you can. Assume stakeholders would like to understand what’s taking so much time.\n\nAllow yourself time to think (when possible) - We often feel pressured to respond immediately. Don’t. First thoughts are rarely the best ones. Take time to think, collaborate with engineering and design, explore alternatives, and consider edge cases. A slightly slower, well-thought-out response often saves weeks later.\n\nTooling\n(Highly dependent on what your company allows)\nMiro – stakeholder collaboration & getting ideas out of my head\nJira – project management (2-week sprints)\nMicrosoft Clarity, GA4, BigQuery – data & analytics\nLyssna – quick user feedback\nFigma / Lovable – prototyping\nChatGPT – writing simple tickets or first drafts\n\nTechnical know-how\nThis really depends on your context. SQL is often less “technical” than people think and very handy. From a web perspective, understanding how Google Tag Manager works is also extremely useful.\n\nReading & learning\nHonestly, I don’t read much anymore. I became a dad 1.5 years ago, so time is limited. The best learning for me has been learning on the job, observing other PMs and picking the things that work for you, and ignoring the rest",

Also, accept that this is often very, very difficult.

MVP starts with MINIMUM/MINIMAL. If someone wants to add scope, ask why. It's on them to motivate. Never just accept additions because someone thinks they make sense or are cool or nice or whatever.

This increases your odds of building good software.  Spend time with them, ask questions.  Learn.  The more time you spend with customers the better off you will be long term. \n\n2) Own and drive the process.  As the PM, you are responsible for the outcome.  Thus, you need to be empowered to drive to that outcome.  If your leadership isn't allowing you to drive the outcome, push back.  Engineering has their role, marketing has their role, design, etc...   However, PM has to drive the ship.  As a new PM, take your queues from your seniors.  You'll have to spend some time learning the job, but your goal is to be the leader of your feature team, not a contributor.\n\n3) Trust your engineers.  It's not your job to build the thing.  It's their job.  Yes, you want to know what they're building and why, but no, it's not your call how the thing is built.  If you have a strong relationship with eng, you'll have a seat at the table and you'll know you're doing well because they'll ask for your input.  But  you have to respect their position.  If the thing doesn't work, they're the ones who will get the call in the middle of the night, not you.   Actively seek a strong partnership with your eng counterpart.  The two of you are in this together.\n\n4) Learn to work the machine.  Depending on the size of your company, you will have more or less support.  Do you have a dedicated designer?  A tech marketing engineer?  Sales specialist?  In most cases, there is a team surrounding your product or feature.  Get to know them.  Understand what they do.  Actively work to bring them into your orbit.  Many junior PM's think that they have to do everything and get overwhelmed.  You don't have to do it all yourself.  Get your supporting cast going, get them on our side.  Approach it as a team exercise.\n\n5) Focus on velocity and quality.  In the end the only two things that matter (IMHO) for a feature team are velocity and quality.  Are you moving quickly?  Are you building good software?  If not, stop.  Those things have to be true or nothing else matters.",

          "text": "3 fundamental principles that are a must have to grow in the PM role -\n\n1. **Customer Backward Mindset**. The center of everything you do as a PM on a product is are you able to step into the shoes of your users. Are you really able to dissect a hypothesis or a problem statement to a layer that you start to find the real causes of a pain-point. And are you able to overpower this customer backward mindset over your pre-conceived biases.\n2. **You must be a natural / keen observer**. For a PM, it is extremely important to keenly observe and identify underlying layers that may be impacting your users. This becomes even more important because for PMs there is generally no-task delegation from their managers. You are on your own for the product you're handling. You are generally told about the company objectives and product function objectives, rest is upto you, on how you will help the teams achieve these objectives.\n3. **Patience** is an important skill that every PM has to learn or possess. It adds value to how you operate as a PM because you manage multiple stakeholders on a single product, and aligning them takes alot of convincing, negotiations and long war-room meetings. And all this multiplies as you have no direct control on the say of these stakeholders.\n4. few more would be business acumen, communication skills, etc.\n\nNot a big user of tools, the most we are exposed to is JIRA that too during the execution phase. Rest of the stuff is done at the usual google / microsoft suite. For user interviews I use dovetail and for wireframing balsamiq / lucidchart. \n\nOn a day to day basis, the most technical exposure you need to be at is during the standup calls with your execution team or when you are working with a 3rd party & trying to integrate their APIs. \n\nI have been writing articles on ***PM Transition and 0 to 1 Product Building***, if you wish, I would love to share the articles with you.",

      "text": "I was recently transferred into a Technical Product Manager role focused on building AI agents and automations.\n\nBefore this, I was on our people analytics team working on machine learning, employee selection assessments, and employee listening. I have a coding background, and when GPT dropped in late 2022 I started building small Python tools and automations. That quickly turned into larger internal apps and experiments.\n\nMost of what I built never shipped. Not because it was bad, but because HR preferred maintaining the status quo. Over the last 6 to 9 months, I built several weekend projects purely out of interest. One could have replaced a vendor we paid ~$200k/year for, with better UX, better auditability, and lower risk. Another would have saved ~$30k YoY. I shared demos internally and in AI communities at my job. Internally, it was mostly radio silence.\n\nI kept building anyway, mostly for my portfolio.\nA month or two later, my manager told me to apply for an internal role. Turns out leadership had seen my work and wanted me in it. I got the role, and now I work with a team of devs I already collaborate with in an AI community where we share research, experiments, and memes. For example, I recently posted about how moving to a larger embedding model actually degraded performance due to dimensionality issues.\n\n\nNow I’m looking for advice from folks who have been here before:\nWhat should I be watching out for from a stakeholder management perspective, especially in AI-heavy products?\nAny open source or lightweight tools people like for project tracking?\nAny advice for working with leadership when automation may eventually reduce headcount?",

AI agents often look great in demos, but the real friction shows up in edge cases, handoffs, and when something goes wrong and no one owns the customer impact. I have seen stakeholder tension rise when leadership optimizes for efficiency metrics while support or ops is left managing the fallout from partial or incorrect automation. It helps to make failure modes visible early, not just accuracy or cost savings, but what happens when the agent is wrong and who absorbs that cost. On the headcount side, framing automation as load shaping rather than pure reduction tends to keep conversations more grounded. Teams are usually more open when the narrative is about fewer repeat issues and cleaner escalation paths, not replacing people.",

Now the work shifts from keyboards and demos to rooms where decisions are made indirectly, through budget lines, risk narratives, and the soft physics of ego and fear.\n\nMeaning, you've got to get someone in leadership to become a champion for your cause.\n\nThis is the part where influence matters more than correctness. Where good ideas don’t fail because they’re wrong, but because they arrive without an executive sponsorship work visa.\n\nKeep building agents that pull real levers: productivity that compounds, costs that bend downward, compliance that helps everyone sleeps at night.\nBut in parallel, learn the darker arts of negotiation and power, because every organization runs on an invisible P&L written in incentives, reputations, and who gets blamed when things go sideways.\n\nRead books by Christopher Voss and William Ury. Listen to people who understand how “no” is rarely about the proposal and almost always about the person hearing it.\n\nYour hurdle isn’t shipping agents.\nIt’s making decisions sturdy enough to survive rooms you’re not invited into.\n\nAI doesn’t change that.\nIt just pours gasoline on the stakes.\n\nRight now, the missing skill isn’t technical brilliance. It’s learning how to turn good work into work that gets sponsored, sanctioned, and survives.",

Focus your initiatives on high-cost areas; for instance, if infrastructure costs are peaking, demonstrate how AI can optimize that spend. Avoid framing your solutions as a way to reduce headcount. Doing so can inadvertently threaten the influence of senior leaders who equate team size with organizational power. If you position your work as a way to 'replace' people, you risk creating enemies among those who feel their importance is being undermined. Instead, frame your successes as **productivity multipliers**—tools that reduce clicks, save time, and allow talent to focus on higher-value work. Let the data speak for itself regarding efficiency, but let management make the final calls on staffing.  \nYou have worked and showed your demo but there have been radio silence, untill you have the backing of someone very important just be careful.  \nThe above is based on my personal experience and the situations that I have faced to come out of diffficulties, you can have a different approach but be cautious,be mindful of the **human element, don't hurt anyone's ego.**",

That’s where a lot of internal tools quietly die.\n\nI do think internal PMs become more valuable in teams that choose to build selectively. Someone has to be ruthless about what is actually worth custom work versus good enough off the shelf. The danger is assuming cheaper build means cheaper forever.

I have the Scrum CSP-PO, SAFe POPM, and PMI-ACP, and in my experience, all of these are great at teaching you what a few books and Google searches would teach you.\n\nI'll keep taking them if they keep getting paid for, don't get me wrong, but wondering: Has anyone taken any courses, certifications, or degrees that actually helped you become a better product manager, especially when it comes to moving into more strategic and operational roles vs more tactical?\n\n\\---------\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for your input. Just updating this with some key takeaways, for people finding this post in the future.\n\n* Consensus is that it is not worth *your* money for most of these courses (if your company pays, that's their decision, then go for it). They cost too much and usually focus on process knowledge over the actual strategic elements of being a PM.\n   * If you are still looking for courses, identify and focus on your gaps, and educate yourself on those. There are also a few suggestions below.\n* Focus your effort doing the work and learning to deliver a product/feature that users want. The ability and experience required to do this are what actually makes a PM, not letters behind your name. Being able to demonstrate your process of market research, user research, pricing decisions, understanding P&Ls, etc. is what will set your apart.",

If you are a senior, I'm just going to focus on your experience.  What did you build?  Why did you build it?  What did you learn when you did it?  What mistakes did you make?  What would you do differently?\n\nIf we spend 30 minutes talking about products you were directly involved in, I will know everything I need to know about how good of a PM you are.\n\nI've also done my share of interns.  Of course, they've never built anything serious so you can't ask about that.  What I ask are theoretical questions.  \"You are the PM for X.  I am your target user persona.  Interview me to see if you should build feature Y.\"    Again, after thirty minutes, I know how your head works.  That's what matters.\n\nThere are three things that determine if you can do a job (any job):\n\n1. Ability\n2. Experience\n3. Knowledge\n\nStandard certs only give you #3, knowledge.  However #1 and #2 are your best indicators for success.  #3 is also the easiest to fix.  If you suck at estimating, I can send you to an estimating class.  If you are not passionate about customers, I can't fix that.  Juniors are interviewed to see if they have #1.  If they do, #2 will come and I can give them #3.  Seniors should have #1 and #2.  If you have been doing this job then I assume you know how to learn and #3 will take care of it's self.\n\nSo, no.  I don't interview based on knowledge.  It's pointless.\n\nApologies if this offends folks, just relating my personal experience.\n\nOh, BTW, if you want to know why this technique works, read this book:  [https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU](https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU)",

          "text": "Short answer: yes. But only if the education attacks your blind spots instead of polishing your badge wall.\n\nLong-winded answer: As a long-time PM, former programmer, now with a front-row seat to training and coaching, here's how I see the blind spots shake out across four common JTBDs and personas.\n\n(*Buckle up kids, I'm pretty passionate about this particular topic so this is going to go really long*)\n\nI've watched (and lived) what happens when technical backgrounds get dragged into the cold fluorescent light of business reality. Unit economics that bite back. Market forces that don't care how elegant your architecture is. Pricing and positioning that feel less like spreadsheets and more like knife fights in a dark parking lot. Business cases where you learn the difference between \"this is cool\" and \"this gets funded.\" Stuff that rewires how you see the problem through a P&L lens, not just how you format the PRD.\n\nI've witnessed (with some schadenfreude) MBA-types sweat when they have to drag strategy down from the mountaintop and make it survive first contact with engineers who actually build things. Discovery that doesn't devolve into cosplay. Shaping work so it can actually ship instead of dying as a catchy positioning statement. Turning narrative into decision instead of another deck that fossilizes in Confluence. Learning that execution isn't beneath strategy, it's where strategy goes to get judged.\n\nI've observed people from design or support backgrounds grow product leadership teeth. Real teeth. Prioritization under real constraint with real economic and strategic leverage. Surviving feature-hostage negotiations with sponsors and stakeholders by saying no ... or at least not yet ... without napalming trust. Translating raw customer pain into financial and opportunity trade-offs that hold up when the CFO squints and the CEO asks, \"And then what?\" Empathy, yes. But empathy with a balance sheet taped to it.\n\nAnd I've seen marketing and sales folks slow down long enough to learn how the sausage actually gets made. Learn the how Design thinking combined with Systems thinking avoids expensive failures. Deliberate delivery in trade-offs rather than HiPPO tirades. Technical feasibility conversations that don't end in promises engineering never made and that are metaphysically impossible. Living inside ambiguity longer than a quarterly quota permits. Learning that not everything persuasive is possible, not everything possible is worth building, and that PM is more than feeding the feature factory's endless appetite.\n\nPoint is: good education doesn't teach you new words. It gives you new scars. It fills gaps you didn't know were load-bearing and makes you uncomfortable in productive ways.\n\nThe certs you listed do exactly what they're designed to do. They teach the commonly Googled. The shared vocabulary. The stuff that clears HR filters and makes everyone nod in meetings. Useful. Necessary. Not sufficient if you want to advance into product leadership.\n\nSo yes, education can be worth it. Just don't collect it like trading cards. Find the kind that forces you to confront the parts of the job you've been avoiding.\n\nI'd name specific programs and training vendors, but this sub has prohibitions to keep this channel from becoming a billboard for unpaid shilling and low-effort spam. Full disclosure: I now teach product management after decades as a PM who waited too long to fill the business-side gaps I didn't know were load-bearing.\n\nTLDR: Fill gaps. Don't collect credentials.",

The biggest growth for me came from being closer to actual business decisions, pricing, support volume, churn, not another course. Reading case studies and tearing apart products I use helped more than any credential. If you are aiming for more strategic or ops-heavy roles, I think getting exposure to P and L, support, and sales trade-offs matters way more than adding another badge.

In my experience, the dev studios don’t usually have people in the role, but they will usually have someone handling production or project management with some overlap in responsibility.  Publishers, though, will more likely have a dedicated product manager or two.\n\nYou’re probably more likely to get hired as a product manager without prior games experience, than as a producer, even if there are fewer roles out there.  A challenge though, is that studios will often have someone already in-house that can fill the role, even if they don’t have someone full-time.  Both are often hired internally, from people who are already familiar with the studio’s games, players and processes.\n\nIf you’re determined, start applying.  I’d also recommend actually learning another related skill, too.  The barrier to “be a game dev” is quite low, which actually works against you if you’re applying alongside people who have actually worked on game projects, but don’t have any under your belt.\n\nFinally, be careful to set appropriate expectations about job satisfaction.  The pay is usually lower than in literally any other industry, especially without games experience.  Game companies can seem cool from the outside, but the culture can be wildly different from studio to studio.  Personally, I saw product management in a “regular” company more rewarding; most other industries have a lot more organizational support and resources available to maintain a product management function, than what you get in the games industry.",

          "text": "Hi.\n\nI know a bunch of folk in the gaming industry, some working on AAA titles etc.\n\nThe first thing to say is, at least from the folks I know, there is not really a \"Product Manager\" type role. There are producer roles, but they are more like a project manager as far as I can see, with little to no input on the games they work on. In fact, from what I see, the industry is generally very old school, with no real product-style way of working.\n\nThe second thing to say is that it is not a good industry to work in. It is brutally exploitative and badly run. Most of the folks I know who work in it, earn considerably less than equivalent roles in other industries (even folks in big studios working on high budget games) and lots of them fucking hate their jobs, their management, the work, etc.\n\nThe problem is that there is a huge supply of folks who are eager to work in gaming, because they are fans, and so there is huge competition, and and endless supply of fresh meat for the grinder, as folks get burnt out by the hours and low pay and leave, simply to be replaced by someone younger, cheaper, and full of passion for a few years.\n\nMy overall recommendation is *don't*",

      "text": "So I exited to a large US based SaaS company back in April, I was a solo founder, several years as a PM at a few SaaS, one Enterprise SaaS, and then a few years as CTO of a consumer business, then bootstrapped my start up and now back in Enterprise SaaS.\n\nI am at a great company to continue building my product, perfect place actually, I float between a Product Dir role mixed with some hands on IC PM and some Engineering work, I have been here about 9 months now, but I am looking to link up with a few PMs in Enterprise SaaS just for a chat, or you can always post as a reply I guess. But I want to get a picture of what a typical day / week / month looks like for you as a PM (seniority, tenure aside) - tools are you using, how you set yourself and team up, the cadence of customer calls, roadmap calls, joining sales calls, delivery cadence. Basically I want to see how you get your work done, that maybe the simple way to put it. DM if your up for a chat or share some of your wisdom in a reply.\n\nMuch appreciated (and hope this isn’t breaking the rules)",

Mornings are usually stakeholder syncs, roadmap tradeoffs, unblock this now conversations. Afternoons are deeper work if you protect them docs, PRDs, reviewing designs, thinking through sequencing. Customer calls come in waves usually tied to deals or escalations rather than a clean cadence.\n\nTool wise it’s usually a messy stack. Jira and Confluence for execution and docs, some form of product analytics, spreadsheets that refuse to die, and a higher level planning layer to keep capacity and timelines honest once things get big. I’ve seen teams use things like Aha, Productboard, Smartsheet, or Celoxis in that middle space when Jira alone stops being enough.\n\nWhat surprised me most at enterprise scale is how much of the job is just creating clarity. Making sure people agree on what problem we’re solving this quarter, what is explicitly not happening, and who actually owns what. The work doesn’t move because of tools, it moves because you keep forcing alignment back into the system.\n\nHappy to chat if you want to compare notes. DM is fine.",

It's boring, repetitive, and it should feel a bit heavy. Here is the 'workout' that actually moved the needle for me:\n\n1. Forensic Strategy: Don’t just read the news. When a company like Slack changes its pricing or Netflix buys a gaming studio, don't just say 'cool.' Force yourself to map out exactly what they are giving up to make that move. What are they deprioritizing? Who are they willing to piss off?\n\n2. The 'Where Not to Play' Rule: Pick a product you use every day. Write down three features they should build, and then force yourself to pick the two they should never touch—and defend why. Strategy shows up in the 'no's.'\n\n3. Paper Trading: Write your logic down. If you don't commit it to paper, your brain will trick you into thinking you 'knew it all along' once the results come in.\n\nForget the lectures. You don't need another framework; you need reps. You need to pressure-test your judgment until the trade-offs start feeling obvious.",

But let me turn it around; are you surprised that PMs are expected to have experience in areas that are significantly growing? Despite what your personal beliefs are, there's no denying that AI is on the rise and products become more technical. \n\nIt feels very similar to what happened in Marketing not too long ago, where all of a sudden every marketeer needed social media knowledge and experience.

I typically write an initial story in our software project management system (we use Atono). Using MCP I then begin working with Claude to create HTML versions of the pages I need by grabbing the story and some other product context I've assembled over time. If working on an existing screen I also provide a screenshot of the screen. I've tried doing all this with ChatGPT and Gemini, and I've found Claude to be the best at creating solid HTML representations of what I want that resemble my current product well enough to show to UX, Eng and stakeholders for initial feedback.

If collecting and reporting feedback is slowing you down that much, you're probably over-indexing on analysis and under-indexing on action.\n\nMost good PMs I know keep feedback gathering lightweight - talk to users, identify patterns, make a call, move on. Not build elaborate decks for every decision. Leadership doesn't need to see every piece of feedback, they need to know what you decided and why.\n\nAlso \"I can't let stakeholders force me into making a decision\" sounds like you're avoiding making calls. Sometimes you need to make a decision with incomplete info. That's literally the job.\n\nNot trying to be harsh but it sounds like you're using \"gathering feedback\" as a way to avoid making tough calls.",

You can respond to the stakeholders with something like \"Unless we believe new feedback could materially change the decision, I think it’s responsible to place the bet and monitor outcomes\".\n\nI agree that deep user feedback is critical — but one thing that’s helped me is being explicit about **when feedback is “directionally sufficient” vs. when it’s still exploratory**.\n\nI try to separate three phases clearly with stakeholders:\n\n**1) Discovery → are we learning anything new?**  \nOnce feedback starts repeating and new inputs no longer change the decision set, I treat that as *signal saturation*. At that point, more feedback increases confidence marginally but delays action materially.\n\n**2) Decision readiness → do we have enough to place a bet?**  \nI anchor on a small set of decision criteria up front (user impact, business impact, risk, reversibility). If additional feedback wouldn’t change the choice against those criteria, we move forward.\n\n**3) Validation → what will we monitor post-decision?**  \nInstead of extending discovery, we shift feedback collection into leading indicators and guardrails after launch.\n\nThis framing has helped reset expectations: the goal isn’t *maximum* feedback, it’s *sufficient* feedback to make a responsible decision and learn forward.\n\nFor future, you could create a decision criteria upfront and then you can use \"We agreed on the decision criteria upfront. At this point, additional feedback isn’t changing how the options score against those criteria.”\n\nHope this is helpful! This is a common topic in PMclub conversations — especially around defining when feedback is directionally sufficient vs. decision-blocking.",

Now I already have a thought in mind of what problem space looks like and how we might go about addressing it. I present a pitch of the problem space, why it is important to solve, and what is the financial upside. If leadership wants more data, I go get it later, but they usually don't.\n\n2. If it is taking so much time for you to validate your opportunities or analyze the data, either work more closely with data team / request data team resources / request a business analyst to support you.

You can recite OKRs, discovery, alignment, and outcomes like a catechism. The problem is fluency can turn into product management theater.\n\nWhat’s missing are the blind spots you’ve been quietly tip-toeing around like creaky floorboards.\n\nI’ve watched engineers-turned-PMs, myself included, walk into exec meetings swinging tech jargon when the room wanted unit economics. That’s not courage. That’s showing up to a gunfight with a foam pool noodle and insisting it’s “technically superior.” Markets don’t care. Pricing definitely doesn’t care. Funding cares even less.\n\nI’ve watched strategy-first PMs learn that strategy without delivery is just astrology for adults. Execution isn’t beneath strategy. It’s where strategy gets cross-examined by reality.\n\nI’ve seen designers and support folks graduate from backlog babysitting to real product leadership. Prioritization under constraint. Feature-hostage negotiations where “not yet” lands without detonating trust. Empathy, yes. But empathy with a balance sheet duct-taped to its forehead.\n\nI’ve watched sales and marketing backgrounds slow down long enough to learn how the sausage actually gets made. Why feasibility matters. Why promises decay. Why not everything persuasive is possible, and not everything possible is worth building.\n\nThat’s what good education does. It doesn’t give you new words. It gives you new scars. It exposes gaps you didn’t realize were load-bearing until something cracked.\n\nMost certifications do exactly what they’re designed to do.

But they won’t save you from becoming a very articulate feature-factory foreman.\n\nFull disclosure: I teach product now, after decades as a PM who waited far too long to fill some very expensive business-side gaps. I’ve lived most of these mistakes personally.\n\nHappy to share specific course recommendations over DM so this thread doesn’t turn into a billboard and get nuked from orbit.\n\nTL;DR: fill gaps. Don’t polish the badge wall.",

          "text": "After 8 years as a PM, here's my honest take: certifications aren't your best ROI at this stage.\n\nWith your experience level, you already know the fundamentals. You've shipped products, worked cross-functionally, and made real-world trade off. The bottleneck most experienced PMs face isn't knowledge. Rather structured communication.\n\nHere's the reality: most PMs become good at the job before they become good at interviewing for the job. Good PMs get promoted internally. Good PMs who are also strong interviewers? They get hired, often with significant salary bumps.\n\nYour next role isn't decided by how well you perform day-to-day-it's decided in 4-5 hours of interviews. Yet most experienced PMs spend hundreds of hours improving their craft and almost no time practicing how to articulate their impact, structure their stories, or navigate difficult interview scenarios.\n\nLet’s PM our own career, shall we? :)\n- Certifications: $500-$3,000, marginal hiring impact at your level\n- Interview coaching: $1,000-$20,000, but can result in $20K to $50K+ salary increases (plus compounding over your career)\n\nI run a PM career coaching business (full disclosure), but I'm not pitching my services here. I genuinely believe that at 8 years of experience, your best investment is learning to tell your story better, structure your product thinking in interviews, and negotiate effectively.\n\nIf you're set on formal learning, consider tactical skills that differentiate you: data analysis (SQL, analytics), technical depth (working with APIs, system design basics), or specialized domain knowledge (AI/ML, fintech, healthcare). But even these work best when you can clearly articulate them in interviews.\n\nHappy to answer questions if this perspective is helpful.",

If someone is already doing a related action and you surface “hey, there’s a faster way now,” it feels helpful instead of noisy. Progressive exposure based on usage tends to outperform big announcements.\n\nWhat backfires most often are full screen announcements and forced walkthroughs. Existing users especially hate being interrupted for something they didn’t ask for, and many will just dismiss it on reflex and never revisit the feature.\n\n“New” badges can work, but only if they decay quickly. If everything is marked new for weeks, users stop seeing them altogether.\n\nIn app release notes are underrated. Not as a primary driver, but as a safe place for curious users to self educate without being pushed.\n\nThe pattern I’ve seen succeed is gentle, contextual, and easy to ignore. If adoption matters, the feature itself still has to earn it.",

New features would ship, users wouldn't find them, then they'd complain we didn't have features we literally just built.\n\nBefore we tried different approaches, we actually recruited like 15-20 users to do quick interviews about how they discover new features. Used CleverX to get the right user segments fast - worked well for getting specific types of users quickly. Learned that most people just don't read announcements or changelogs at all.\n\nWhat actually worked after that research: contextual \"new\" badges where the feature lives. Not fullscreen announcements (people swipe those away in under 2 seconds). Show the hint when users are doing something related, not randomly.\n\nAlso selective emails to existing users worked okay. We did one for a major feature and got decent adoption. But you can't do that for every feature or people tune out.\n\nReal talk though - sometimes features just take time to get discovered organically. If it's genuinely useful, people will find it eventually.",

Sprint Scope Contribution**\n\n* PM’s contribution to sprint planning\n* Perceived impact and/or complexity of the work included in the sprint\n\n**3. Responsiveness & Execution During Sprint**\n\n* Proactiveness in responding to Jira comments and queries\n\n**4. UAT & Quality Control**\n\n* PM ownership of UAT before release\n* Any major issue that bypasses UAT is treated as a **negative**\n\n**5. Scrum Master Responsibilities (Rotational) (Each PM acts as a Scrum Master)**\n\n* Evaluation includes:\n* Requirement readiness\n* Standup quality and cadence\n* Sprint tracking and coordination\n* On-time delivery (maximum 1-day delay allowed)\n\n**6.

          "text": "These are all PM competencies.  But when it comes to being evaluated on these? Two main critiques here:\n\n(1,2,3,6) is trying to make a science out of a qualitative observation.  If you truly wanted to optimize for what’s outlined here, your best route is to overly and needlessly nurture relationships with each individual engineer so they give you good marks.  Ultimately this is framing things in a vacuum.  (1) PRD Quality is 99% of the time not the reason why a sprint might go over in my experience - this is not very measurable - how unclear was the PRD? How much exactly did that lack of clarity contribute to the delay? (2) Sprint scope contribution - how close you are with the tech lead? How exactly were your contributions meaningful? It might almost bias you to forcefully contribute when you have no idea what you’re talking about.  (3) Responsiveness - are your notifications on and do your engineers like you. (6) Do your engineers like you\n\n(4,5) These motivate you to overestimate sprints and initiatives.  If you’re only measured by if a sprint has completed, might as well sandbag and get “100% sprint completion and on time delivery” every time.  This also only works well for incredibly mature products which have very far line of sight and deep team understanding.  This would be ridiculous to measure for any greenfield product or at a startup - you don’t know what you don’t know and that’s ok.  Be antifragile and deal with new information properly.  Delays happen, but you should push towards a business result. \n\nAll in all I think the only way to properly measure a PM is by their ability to drive impact.  Have them set an OKR, make sure it’s specific, relevant, and measurable.  Make sure they’re not sand bagging by breaking down assumptions.  And track the teams performance against that OKR.  Ultimately the PM is responsible for the success or failure of a product.  You could be 100% sprint complete for the whole quarter, have the clearest PRD, run scrums like a machine and deliver a failed product - you shouldn’t reward or optimize for this.\n\nI’ve never seen a scorecard system like this before (fintech 2 large cos and 2 startups) and quite frankly think it misses the essence of what a PM is responsible for.",

Who's perceiving it? What if you're working on unglamorous but necessary tech debt?\n\nThe real question: does this actually make the product better, or does it just create a bunch of defensive behavior where PMs over-document everything and avoid hard conversations because it might hurt their scorecard?\n\nHow common is it?

Everyone will score very highly and then get laid off in the next downcycle.**\n\n**1) waste of time;  \"a shared document is not a shared understanding\"** (Jeff Patton, user story mapping)  \nIndividuals interacting is what matters, not verbose detail.  If you need verbose detail, split the story.  Remember when we used 3x5 index cards?  That constraint was there for a good reason.  Bloated verbose stories NEVER work and always have errors.  Small slicing feels less efficient but has fewer slips, lapses, mistakes and rework.\n\n2) **No such thing as Sprint Scope; you have a Sprint Goal that is based on a (measurable) business outcome,**  Measure that outcome, and use that as the basis for performance.  That's the only thing that matters.  Deliver multiple times within a Sprint to get feedback on your progress towards the goal.  Ruthlessly improve your DveOps and XP practices until that's a reality.   \n  \n**3) waste of time.**  STOP using JIRA as a communication channel.  Talk to each other, a lot.  Involve the developers in user story mapping.  Don't give them solutions to implement.  Written communication is always less effective, with delays and comprehension layers.  If you work is so unsafe you need to CYA, fix that first.   \n  \n**4) Kind of agree on this**;  UAT is your last-line-of-defense as part of your layered \"shift left, build quality in\" mindset.  But it's the whole team here, not the PM - escaped defects bad is a good idea though.  Don't blame the goal keeper because the attackers, midfield and defenders didn't keep control of the ball.   \n  \n**5) utter bollocks.** This is nothing to do with Scrum or effectiveness in the role.  Allowing this kind of bollocks into your org is already a red flag that the SMs are not effective at educating or influencing the org,  Where's the stuff on team learning and growth?  Nah.   \n  \n6) **I like this better** but it really should be something you as a team talk about in your retrospectives, always \n\n**7) \"Post release activities\"  lol.**  \nMeasure the value you created within the Sprint.  Release continually.",

Is 10% based on the problem set I can address now? How big will that customer base slice become once I move beyond the MVP?\n2. How do customers solve the problem today? What painpoints they have with existing solutions?\n3. What are other vendors doing? What will you do that is unique, differentiated from what's available in the market?\n4.

Ideally the founder has the first best idea, ie the vision.  What I think I have become better at is execution. Synthesis, being the glue, connecting the functions and seeing the patterns.

Basically, I run e-vals using the AI to get a score on different criteria. The tricky part is that if I run these evaluations multiple times, I often get different results each time. For example, one run might flag certain issues and another run will catch a completely different set of issues or give me a different pass rate.\n\nThis leaves me in a weird spot because I’m not sure if I’m actually improving the product or just seeing random variance in the AI’s scoring. Other than running the AI multiple times and averaging the results (or taking a union of all the different failures it spots), I’m not sure how to get a consistent measure.\n\nHas anyone else faced this kind of inconsistency when using AI for evaluation? I’d love to hear if there are smarter ways to stabilize the scores or any best practices to make sure I can trust the results over time. Thanks!",

If you treat the output like a deterministic test, it’ll drive you a bit mad.\n\nA few things that usually help in practice:\n\nFirst, tighten the evaluation prompt way more than feels natural. Explicit rubrics, scoring scales with definitions, and examples of what a “good” vs “bad” answer looks like reduce variance a lot. Vague criteria almost guarantee drift run to run.\n\nSecond, fix everything you can. Temperature as low as possible, same model version, same prompt ordering, same input formatting. Small differences compound more than people expect.\n\nThird, stop thinking of a single run as truth. What tends to work better is treating evals as trend signals. If scores move consistently over time across multiple runs, you’re improving. If they bounce randomly, you probably aren’t. Averaging or majority voting is boring, but effective.\n\nFourth, separate discovery from measurement. Let the model be loose and exploratory when you want to find issues. Then lock down a stricter eval for tracking progress. Mixing those two goals in one judge usually causes confusion.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen eventually accept that AI judges are closer to noisy sensors than unit tests. Once you design around that reality, confidence comes from consistency of direction, not identical scores every run.",

That’s where the noise creeps in.\n\nOn the discovery vs measurement point, think of it like this. In discovery mode, you let the evaluator be opinionated and loose. You ask things like “what’s weak here,” “what feels off,” or “what would confuse a PM.” You expect variance because you’re learning. Those outputs are for insight, not scoring.\n\nMeasurement mode is much narrower. You freeze the criteria and only ask things that can be judged consistently. For example, instead of “is this a good product question,” you score specific dimensions like clarity of prompt, presence of a real tradeoff, and whether there’s enough context to make a decision. Each dimension should be something the evaluator can say yes or no to with minimal interpretation.\n\nIf I were to improve one eval, I’d start by removing any language that asks the model to infer intent or quality holistically. Replace it with concrete checks. Does the question force a prioritization decision. Does it include constraints. Is there a clear failure mode. Those tend to be much more stable run to run.\n\nOnce you separate those two modes, the system usually feels a lot saner. You explore with one prompt, then measure progress with a much stricter, almost boring one.",

You will start to spot whether there’s a correlation, and you can refine your prompt if not. Keep doing this until you have an acceptable level of agreeability between human and AI.

Did you research the problem statement before building the solution? If yes, go to the same research sample (target users) and ask them to test the product and share their feedback. This can do 2 things - help you get organic users, get early feedback and window to iterate before product gets adopted by larger audience\n2. Can you define two sided marketplace product? Is it something like an amazon which has apps for buyers as well as sellers?\n\n  \nFor marketplace applications, following factors shall be considered to achieve PMF -\n\n1. First, you need to very careful and analytic to clear in validating / rejecting your hypothesis. Ensuring that no assumptions were made while solving for the problem statement. As often times companies end up building solution that they only thought will solve a problem, that never existed.\n2. Instead of planning to acquire users through paid traffic, focus on building a community around your product. \n3. Define a metric that can make you strongly say that this is the moment when the product can be considered as PMF. A lot signs are when you start getting referred customers, or constant feedbacks or feature requests. \n\n\n\nChanging the value proposition, the leadership will ask why was it at the first place present? what assumptions were considered, what insights were validated? and why do you think it is not working? do you need to completely scrap it or you require an enhancements? if yes why? So basically you need to find answers to these questions and it will surely help you convince them! Though this time they would want you to come up with even stronger insights on why the next feature shall now be the core offering.\n\nThe time that clearly states that a product is not working is when you figure out that even after making multiple iterations in the product, GTM strategies, the users are just not sticking or using the product.",

From what I see, that tension is incredibly common, especially when timelines get aggressive and delivery becomes the only visible success metric. The hard part is that discovery work is invisible until it goes wrong, so it is the first thing to get cut even though it is doing real risk reduction. I have seen strong PMs burn themselves out thinking this is a personal gap, when it is really a structural one. If you can, even carving out small, protected pockets of discovery can help you regain some control and confidence. You are not imagining the tradeoff, and you are not alone in it.",

          "text": "Senior PM at a mature small company in Insuretech. Our product is very much still growing and developing, but if we did nothing to it for the entirety of 2026 we'd still likely see growth in all of our important metrics. I have an in-house dev team and though I'm not the only PM, I'm predominantly focused on TOF and Acquisition. \n\nLogistically speaking, I work remote from pacific time zone and the company is based in Chicago in central time, though we have people all over the country. Everyone is remote, though we do have office space we periodically go to for team events and such. I've not worked more than an hour or so in an actual office since February 2020. \n\nMy day almost universally starts with a PowerBI dashboard, Trustpilot dashboard, and the nightly sales report. I usually ping the director of customer acquisition (my primary stakeholder) around this time and talk shit about politics or just small talk for a bit. I talk to her more than anyone else at my company. Between that convo and the dashboards, I'm mostly looking to see if there's any weirdness or anything that catches my attention. I'll read the TP reviews and follow-up with customer service folks on previous ones. Lately a lot of my focus has been on a growing trend I'm seeing in our reviews. \n\nAfter that, it's usually reviewing my plans for the day. I (try to) do a weekly \"last week and next week\" type update for some folks that have interest in it, and it's what I use to keep the ball rolling on my end. I'll make a few notes, maybe block some time if I can, and adjust if necessary. \n\nThen it's standup. For me, it's 9:30am but for my team it's basically leading into lunch time so it's where I'll learn if anything screwy is going on in the engineering dimension. If I have to adjust things to change some expectations for stakeholders, this is usually when/where I'm getting that sorted. \n\nAfter standup, things go off the rails and it varies. Some days, especially earlier in the week, it's what I call \"Fallout meetings\"...the meetings that happen as a result of something happening the week prior. They're a mixture of post-mortems, action planning, etc. I try not to commit to more than a few of these a week, and generally avoid committing to anything concrete that I've not already discussed with my boss or engineering. By Wednesday, I'm not rearranging anything anymore....which is maybe why the fallout meetings happen. Whatever. \n\nMid week is usually when I'm doing discovery type stuff. Interviews, reviewing customer behavior data (reviews, reports from customer facing folks, Clarity recordings, testing results, etc), and competitive research....though I do less of that these days now that we've got a great, competent BA. Wednesday and Thursday are typically my busiest scheduled days. Discovery can be super highly regimented, or completely guerilla. Compiling it all is usually the most time consuming bit, so I block time for it when i can.\n\nLate week is finishing up things I started or need done, and getting stuff ready for the next week. This is usually when I'm making tickets and working of prioritization for the next sprint/future sprints. It's also typically when I'm dealing with data and looking at current performance of stuff. I try to do check-ins on various features later in the week too. \n\nSince I'm 2 hours behind my developers, my mornings tend to be dev related while my afternoons tend to be the more independent contributor work like documentation and such. \n\nThe tools I'm using are JIRA and Confluence (immediate prioritization and documentation), Monday (medium/long prioritization and intake), Clarity (Customer insight), PowerBI (reports), Lovable and sometimes Miro, and Claude ever so often. The latter three are usually used during discovery. I treat AI like having an 13 year old intern that can draw pretty well and occasionally write up a skeleton to work from for a new document. They're strictly for internal use and only 2 or 3 people will see their output typically. I take meeting notes in a Rhodia A4 80g notebook and my general notes go in a small A6 sized Tomoe River 68g notebook (I prefer lined, though I use grid pretty often these days). The general notebook goes in a Lochby journal thing where I have individual notebooks for everything in my life. It goes everywhere with me these days and is helpful for those moments when I need to get something noted down while I'm thinking about it. One of my most successful feature launches got more or less planned out on the top of Mount Langley back in July, for instance. I flip between a Kaweco AL Sport and a Lamy AL-star. I use their own branded carts, typically in blue. Most days I take 20mg of Vyvanse and drink decaf, but sometimes I opt for normal coffee if it's not a particularly dense day or I have afternoon plans.\n\nMy standard meetings include: \n\n* Daily Standup with my engineers. On monday, it's a bigger group (we include content and SEO for visibility) but for the rest of the week it's just product, QA, engineering, and one or two more involved stakeholders. 5-15 minutes in the morning.\n\n* Weekly internal product catchup. Product + Design + BA. Sort of like a standup for us. Go over things we're working on, any junctions we might be encountering that'd involve another PM/team/etc. 15 minutes once a week. \n\n* Weekly Contractor Standup. We have a contractor team (I don't interface with them as much) that we do a weekly standup with towards the end of the week. Frequently involves more enterprise level work, though my various requests are included as well. 15-30 minutes a week.\n\n* Weekly Tech/product meeting. Mostly a standing meeting where product, design, and engineering can discuss things. Good time to ask technical \"hey, how does this work?\" or \"Is this idea outside the realm of possibility?\" Also a chance for engineering to float up concerns or tech debt that we need to prioritize. 15-20 minutes a week. \n\n* Content/SEO Update (biweekly). Since most of my feature and product work involves this group, I meet with them every other week so we can discuss ongoing stuff, feature prioritization, etc. Easier to just take 30 minutes with everyone that's relevant than try and sync up ad hoc. 30 minutes every 2 weeks. \n\n* Grooming/Sprint Planning every 2 weeks. I move grooming around a lot just based on needs. Some weeks we'll groom a ton of stuff. Sometimes we skip it entirely. Sprint planning is mostly just \"Here's what Product and Engineering are planning. Anyone got something else they need/want?\"...lasts like 5 minutes typically. \n\n* 1 on 1. Just a standard weekly meeting with my boss. Talk through new stuff, review old, questions, answers, shoot the shit. 30 minutes once a week.\n\nEverything else is pretty ad hoc and as-needed. I do regular meetings with a small group to review a change-log for a feature we built and verify/sanity check things before we update configurations, and there's usually some monthly and quarterlys that happen sometimes.",

Nothing really replaces just talking to actual users, listening with empathy, and understanding what's genuinely frustrating them in their own words.
