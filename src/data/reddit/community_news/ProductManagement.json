Is the job not good enough where they then want to take learning funds from the rest of the Fortune 500 just to teach them stuff that is freely available on YouTube?\n\nI'm all for courses if valuable and self learning, but if you're getting paid 300K ten years in to be a semi-fluffy PM doing talks all week, and have the time to work on a course...how busy is your day job really?",

Our company is not a startup anymore, and the product been out for 4-5 years. \n\nHowever, for every features or enhancements I’m required to write a fully-detailed PRD that will go into Confluence as the source of truth that include the context of why we need this, the business goals, the UI description (what does each screen have and what are the different states that button goes through - again, source of truth) the functional requirements in detail of all happy and edge cases and their outcomes - like if a required field not input then it will be in error state when clicking the main CTA. \n\nIt’s frustrating because the devs will never ever go through this prd line by line, only the testers will and our testers like this level of detail. We will go through a refinement session in a sprint but that is not for going into details of prd of the next sprint, only to confirm the items we have lined up are aligned with our OKRs still. The planning session is hell because now the devs are forced to read the prd in whole and only then they push back on the requirements that are written like no we shouldn’t show a dialogue here a toast will do or no we shouldn’t redirect on the same tab let’s navigate user to a new tab etc. And now it takes hours to go through all the tickets (and plus we do planning for mobile app separately to the web app so planning takes a whole day just for a 2-week sprint). \n\nIt all comes back to the rationale of recording the source of truth, a document that anyone can come back and read at anytime to know exactly the requirements and the flow and the UI of a feature, and I understand it but it’s just exhausting. Anyone been through this or have similar experience? Is what our team doing normal?",

While the QA reads EVERY WORD and pulls a dozen of bugs due to this inconsistency  \n  \n5- gemini is great, chatgpt is sometimes better as i find it more capable at phrasing in a more humane and polite manner but then given how much im tied to the gemini's SOTA canvas, i dont go to chatgpt unless really needed / temp chat\n\nyes im trying to get outta this place\n\nalso, we are required to write the BRD for each module as well which is an utter waste of time as its read just by 1 line manager whos essentially the VP now. I use AI for that as well while everyone else takes anywhere from a day to a week to write it manually",

Sometimes what the customer said and you wrote down made sense two weeks ago and doesn’t anymore.\n\nI’ve found that what creates the most “friction” in software requirements and writing them is from saying “this is the process and it has to be followed” and spending too long trying to fit pieces together that don’t need to be fit.",

Often I find a “one pager” format to get alignment plus issues it GitHub/linear/jira is all is needed. If you’re working with a designer they are likely going a level deeper into solution. You should stay out of that if you’re doing a PRD, otherwise you’re doing a spec. \n\nI use AI. Claude and chatGPT heavily. Give it a lot of context and have it create a draft and iterate on it.

                  "text": "I didn't design it. It evolved.\n\nThe starting point was frustration. I had context scattered between JIRA tickets, Confluence pages, Slack threads, meeting notes, half-baked strategy docs. So every time someone asked me a question, I'd spend 20 minutes hunting for the thing I knew I'd written down somewhere.\n\nSo I started dumping everything into Obsidian. I used Tiago Forte's PARA method for structure - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Here's decent blog about it on the Todoist blog, though I don't actually use Todoist 😶\n\n[https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/para-method)\n\nI pointed Claude Code at the vault, which reads and writes local files. You give it a CLAUDE.md file that explains the vault - what the folders are, who the key people are, the rules. Never write to JIRA directly, etc., and I tell it things like \"when I paste a Slack message, summarize it, connect it to what we already know, and add to-do's for me as needed.\"\n\nThat CLAUDE.md file is the whole trick. Without it, the AI improvises and you get garbage. With it, the AI behaves. There's a good guide on writing one.\n\n[https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md)\n\nFor external tools - JIRA, Confluence - I don't use MCP servers.  I use things like this and tell the agent how to interact with it:\n\n[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)\n\nLike I said, you can create agent files for specific jobs - strategy review, competitive analysis, meeting prep. Each one loads additional context on top of the base instructions.\n\n[https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase](https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase)\n\nDay-to-day, it's pretty simple. I open a terminal in my vault. I paste a Slack message. I say \"what do we know about this?\" The agent searches my notes, JIRA tickets, decision logs, meeting notes, Confluence pages, and gives me a connected answer with links to the source files. If it finds something worth keeping, it writes a note in the right folder.\n\nI don't need to worry about complicated things like RAG or vector DB's, embeddings. The context window on current models is big enough that reading files directly works fine. For a PM-scale knowledge base (a few hundred notes) file search and grep is plenty. Other people are arriving at the same setup independently.\n\n[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/reviewing-my-vault-workflow-behaviours-using-ai-in-an-ide-or-cli-in-2025/109557)\n\nIf you want to try it: start with Obsidian and PARA. Just folders and markdown. Then install Claude Code (or Github Copilot CLI) and write a CLAUDE.md. After you start using it the system will shape itself around your actual work.\n\nGood luck!",

And as a PM in enterprise, I do it for my main big product with lots of context, and for smaller projects / products I just keep info in task tracker + use ChatGPT to help with task formulation and PRDs. It takes some time to set this up but I am happy with the results so far. I started with this guide: https://ccforpms.com \n\nI recently tried analyzing my user research data together with Claude having all this context, then vibecoded some simple prototypes from the emerged ideas to show customers and devs… It was awesome! The downside is that it can get expensive fast. So you have to wait inbetween seances for your subscription limit to recharge or pay for tokens spent via API, and here you have to be careful if you are on a budget. But overall this setup feels like a nice thinking partner for me, and i was able to do so much more on my own.",

          "text": "My approach:\n\nI had Claude Code go through thousands of call transcripts, synthesize them into batch insight reports, then build a holistic picture of patterns across all of it.\n\nThen in [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) I dictated my full context. Goals, projects, what I wanted help with. Had it interview me extensively, then help me build out a detailed project prompt based on everything I told it.\n\nFrom there I set up a Claude project. Put the instructions in, added insights as markdown files, uploaded all my artifacts. Dozens of files, frameworks, reference material. Gave it the full picture.\n\nTurning on memory for the project made a big difference. This is separate from project knowledge. Memory lets Claude retain context across conversations, so it remembers decisions you've made, preferences you've stated, things you've told it to track. Without it, every new conversation starts from zero even if your docs are loaded.\n\nBut you have to actively maintain it. I regularly check what Claude has stored, correct anything that's off, and add new context as things change. Set it and forget it doesn't work. Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nThe other habit that changed everything was prompting Claude to pull specific artifacts before answering. Instead of just asking a question and hoping it grabs the right context, I'll say \"reference this doc and then answer\" or \"pull up the framework before you respond.\" Sounds small but the difference in output quality is massive. Without that, Claude answers from general knowledge. With it, it answers from YOUR context.\n\nTo answer your specific question, I'm not doing a RAG setup. For most PM use cases that's overkill unless you're working with massive datasets that change constantly. What's working for me is the combo of a well-structured project prompt + uploaded reference docs + memory + Claude's built-in search. Handles 90% of what I need without any infrastructure.\n\nwhat actually matters in practice: spend the time on your project prompt and keep your memory clean. That's your foundation. I prob spent 4 hours just getting the initial context right, having Claude interview me, building the prompt collaboratively, uploading the right docs. If your instructions are vague, it doesn't matter how many files you upload. If your instructions are specific and your memory is current, even a basic setup works surprisingly well.\n\nThat's my approach today, but at this rate it'll all change in 30 days when the next model update comes out. :P",

I've been using Google Docs to keep track of PRDs (that were generated by Claude). That gave me the idea of creating a RAG setup. So I've created a setup that currently pulls from Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Adding Sheets + Slides was easy once I decided to add Docs. I use Voyage for embeddings and Haiku (to save money) for inference. And I added a Tiptap editor with some premade prompts (eg: write a PRD or tell me what to build next) that also uses the context and then gives an output. It's a super-duper basic setup and I'm still refining it, but I'm hoping to get it working really well for my own app.\n\nI'm going to add Jira and GitHub, but at this point I need feedback from some real users so I've reached out to some PM friends. Two of them work in big tech so I'm not sure they'll get approval to try it at work but fingers crossed. If anybody specifically uses Google Docs/Sheets/Slides and would like to try my app out please send me a DM!\n\nI think Claude projects feels a bit weird because it makes sense for persistent context (like coding standards), but otherwise you don't want persistent context for product background (like PRDs) and the project-level memory feels opaque in terms of how it's populated and not really a RAG setup.\n\nSomething else I heard a friend do is just use Cursor and dump everything in there.

My main product is currently only about 60K lines of non-blank, non-comment Swift (maybe 25% of that being tests, haven't measured in a while).\n\nI am worried about agentic tooling cost blow outs especially mixing docs into this.\n\n## Current docs\nI typically write *essays* in Markdown text documents checked in alongside the code. These often contain diagrams - originally pure DOT GraphViz format, PlantUML in recent years and I'm now considering Mermaid as it seems to be rising in popularity. It's not directly integrated but [can be used](https://github.com/tttapa/doxygen-mermaid).\n\nI also have long _Code change diaries_ and _Design Decisions diaries_ as text alongside the code. This ensures the _trail of why_ ends up in git, without archaelogical effort to recreate thinking.\n\n\n\n## MCP thoughts\nI have been thinking about ways to include the above docs into the context of agents without them being rescanned to provide context.\n\nOne idea was to run a local MCP server which has been built with a database indexing all the text docs. At the very least, have it indexed on class and symbol names currently in the code. That could possibly be a pathway to design discussions.",

The stakeholder says the problem is the wheels. Very bad, buggy wheels. In order to get rid of those bugs and release sooner, you will direct the engineers to disable or remove all wheels immediately.\"\n\nThe product manager tries to explain: \"OK, let's talk about this. You know the car cannot move or operate without wheels, right? Removing or disabling all wheels will cause catastrophic damage to the product. It'll break the car. We'll lose at least 50% of all current passengers.\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck,\" snarls the Sr. Director: If you do not send this directive to the public Slack channel by 5 pm today, you will be in big, big trouble.

It's a decision-making structure where the person with the most context gets overruled by the person with the most authority, and when it blows up the authority claims nobody could have known. That's not a personality problem. That's how most orgs actually work under the Agile vocabulary.\n\nYou raised the issue. Got berated in front of the team. Raised it again. Got dismissed. Your skip had to step in. That sequence tells you everything you need to know. Your boss isn't going to suddenly start listening because he was wrong once. He's going to find a way to make this your fault or nobody's fault and keep the same dynamic running.\n\nWhat actually works here. First, write a short post-mortem. Not a blame document. Frame it as \"here's what happened, here's when it was flagged, here's the cost of the delay, here's how we avoid it next time.\" Put it in writing. Send it to your skip and your boss. The facts protect you better than any conversation.\n\nSecond, start sending short written recommendations before key decisions. One paragraph. \"Here's what I recommend and why. Flagging risk X if we go the other way.\" When you're right, the paper trail exists. When you're wrong, nobody cares because you were transparent about uncertainty. The point isn't to say \"I told you so.\" The point is to make the pattern visible so it can't be rewritten later.\n\nThe real problem isn't this one decision. It's that your org has someone making product calls who berates the person with better information instead of listening. No retro fixes that. No framework fixes that. That's a power structure question, and the only move is to make your judgment visible enough that the right people notice the pattern.",

It’s clear there’s a 1–2 year vision in their head.\n\nOn one hand, I appreciate it. Knowing where we *might* go helps avoid painting ourselves into a corner.\n\nOn the other hand, every time we try to scope V1, those future ideas creep back in:\n\n* “We should design this so it supports X later.”\n* “What if in a year we want to do Y?”\n* “Let’s structure it in a way that won’t block Z.”\n\nAnd suddenly our “simple first version” becomes a semi-abstract, overly flexible thing that takes twice as long to build. I’m struggling with the balance between being strategically responsible vs. over-engineering for a future that might not happen\n\nWhere’s the line? Is this:  \nA) A VP asking for too much too early  \nB) A normal tension that good PMs know how to manage  \nC) A skill gap on my side (modular thinking? better framing? better pushback?)\n\nI don’t want to just say “not now” to someone two levels above me. I’d rather level up if there’s a better way to absorb long-term vision without slowing short-term delivery.\n\nFor those who’ve navigated this:\n\n* How do you separate “future-proofing” from “future-fantasizing”?\n* Do you explicitly document what you’re *not* solving yet?\n* Are there frameworks/books that helped you architect in phases instead of trying to build the final form from day one?\n\nWould genuinely appreciate experienced takes.

          "text": "Oh boy, my favorite question that I’ve encountered continuously throughout my career and addressed based on context, but by following these same patterns, sorry if my answer is a little wordy.\n\nSo I’m also a VP (and have over a decade of PM experience) and I operate this way for one primary reason. I try to spare my team what I call deferred complexity. \n\nProduct is hard because we’re solving for now and later at the same time. If we only optimize for the immediate use case, we often create structural constraints that force expensive rework 6 to 12 months down the road. That said, there’s a difference between:\n\nDesigning clean seams that allow future expansion AND Building future features into V1\n\nOnly the first one is responsible architecture. The second is scope creep.\n\nA simple example I love to reuse 😂:\n\nYou are building role-based permissions for a single user type.\n\nIf you hardcode logic around that one role because “that’s all we need today,” it feels faster.\n\nBut 12 months later, when you introduce multi-role access or enterprise hierarchies, you now have permission logic embedded everywhere. You aren’t adding a feature. You’re untangling your own shortcuts.\n\nThat’s deferred complexity. And it’s painful. The better middle ground:\n\n• Build for one role in V1\n• But structure permissions as a service or abstraction layer\n• Document explicitly: “We are not solving multi-role yet.” - create the future epics as shells.\n\nNow you’ve preserved speed without boxing yourself in. If your VP is constantly expanding scope, that’s a problem. If they’re asking for clean extensibility without feature expansion, that’s architectural maturity.\n\nA tactic that works well:\n\nWhen long-term ideas come up, say:\n“Let’s capture that as an architectua constraint and confirm we’re only building the minimal implementation for V1.”\n\nBy doing this you acknowledge vision, protect delivery, and make tradeoffs and dependencies explicit. The tension itself isn’t a red flag, imo. The lack of clarity about what’s architectural runway vs. feature scope is.\n\nSorry for the wall of text but I also teach and write on the side. 😊",

Don’t add dropdowns, role switchers, or empty states for things that don’t exist yet.\n\nBut behind the scenes, we confirm:\n• The layout system can scale\n• The navigation model can accommodate expansion\n• We aren’t hardcoding assumptions that block multi-role later\n\nIn other words:\n\nUI should optimize for clarity today.\nArchitecture should preserve optionality for tomorrow.\n\nIf a designer hands me a V1 that feels bloated because it’s anticipating hypothetical roles, that’s over-design. If they hand me a crisp V1 and can articulate how it scales later without rework, that’s maturity.\n\nYou’re exactly right that “optimal V1” and “multi-role future” can be at odds.

Are you more of a Facebook \"move fast and break things\" culture, or a \"stable reliable growth\" culture?",

If you are bold enough, you can simply ask also for their (the stakeholders') justifications because oftentimes when features start popping up, it is a stakeholder solutionizing without fully understanding the problem, and invariably the solution is wrong.\n\nIf, however, there is strong indication that these things have been vetted for future development and the VP of Product brings up X, Y, and Z future enhancements with the questions you stated, it is because she is seasoned and has already experienced the fallout of failing to consider future enhancements with current development.  She is being pro-active and in the process will save money and time. Your VP is wanting you to show that you are listening to her on the risk, and that specific in-process work has notations on these future items that could be impacted.\n\nI do understand though how annoying it might be if you have already noted these future enhancements, and where they affect the requirements, and that engineers are aware of these things currently while coding.  All you have to do is set her mind at ease once or twice when she brings up these same things, and hopefully she will get the picture.  ",

I ingest granola meeting transcripts from cache to map them to themes in my work stream.

Conversation to validated solution with spec doc in about 5 minutes. \n\nYes, it’s not out of the box solution but it solves my workflow. Sonnet 4.5 was capable of building it all in an afternoon just using plan mode. It runs on flask and SQLite everything stays on the company machine. The front end dashboard has the meeting context and aligned opportunities and a mind map of the entire jira space to see connections from product to engineering (I hate navigating jira). You could literally copy and paste this message into the chat and ask for plan mode and it will build it after a few tweaks.",

Overall, I am still enjoying the move because of all the things I had to learn along the way (introducing processes, aligning with founders, building and sharing the vision and strategy, etc.). However, the main challenge I haven't overcome yet is dealing with junior devs, who are basically the whole dev team at this start-up.\n\nTo be clear, there are definitely some advantages compared to the more senior devs I used to work with at my previous company: these junior devs are more ambitious, they are AI-native and they have no problem with working long hours. Main downsides are: terrible at estimating work and they don't like to do \"the boring work\" like implementing tests and reviewing code.\n\nAt the same time, since AI is already taking over a lot of the coding work and they don't like to do the boring admin work, they are now spending more and more of their time playing PM and/or designer, minus actually doing product work, like talking to customers or doing market research. They are constantly making random product decisions based on their own personal assumptions, often with complete disregard for what the product designer and I had already prepared.\n\nWhen we push back on these ideas, they become extremely defensive and even rebellious. So much of my time is now spent debating with devs about product decisions (showing the data, explaining the vision, using customer testimonials) instead of doing actual product work like talking to customers.\n\nAny ideas on how to navigate this?

          "text": "This sounds like a role clarity issue masquerading as a personality problem. You're dealing with a common startup dynamic where people step outside their swim lanes because the lanes were never clearly marked in the first place.  \n  \nThe good news is that you can actually fix this. The bad news is it requires a conversation that might feel uncomfortable at first.  \n  \nStart by establishing what each role is actually accountable for. In empowered product teams, collaboration is not consensus or democracy. It's about deferring to expertise. If the decision pertains to technology, you defer to the tech lead. If it pertains to customer experience, you defer to the designer. If it pertains to business constraints and value, that's where you own the decision as PM.  \n  \nRight now your junior devs are making product decisions because nobody told them that's not their job. They probably think they're being helpful. So have a direct conversation with them about how decisions get made. Walk through a few recent examples and explain the rationale you and the designer used, including the customer data, market research, and business context they didn't have access to.  \n  \nThen set up a regular discovery cadence where they're actually involved early, not after decisions are made. Sit around prototypes together. Let them see the customer conversations. Give them context on the business constraints. This way they get to contribute their technical insights where they matter most, and they understand why certain product decisions were made.  \n  \nWhen disagreements happen, run a test. Make it cheap and fast. Prototype it, test it with real users, collect data. This shifts the conversation from opinion to evidence.  \n  \nThe defensiveness you're seeing is probably coming from two places. First, they feel like their ideas are being shot down without being heard. Second, they don't have enough context to understand why your decisions are better informed. Fix both of those and the pushback should ease up considerably.  \n  \nOne more thing: if they're spending this much time on product work, they're either avoiding the hard engineering work they don't like, or they genuinely don't have enough hard engineering problems to solve. Make sure you're giving them technically challenging work that requires their actual expertise. Junior devs who are bored will absolutely wander into someone else's job.",

It is because the 95% interact well with tech people, but typically do not have the patience for politics, do not enjoy or have the aptitude for \"consistent\" communications and interactions with stakeholders (i.e., managing them, trawling for, validating and prioritizing requirements for the project) and when doing PM work as well, will leave unfinished edges to the work, filling in requirements gaps with their unvalidated intuition and opinion.

If this is not truly new behavior and they've always done PM work, then it is more than insubordinate employees, it is learned behavior that has been supported by executive management.  Without executive management coming in and laying down the new law, you will never get buy-in and support.  If that is what is going on, I would explain this to the management.\n\nYou pointed out the pros in having junior devs, but you failed to point out the very important disadvantage in failing to have a senior dev in a manager role.  They need to be managed by one of their own, and that role is almost your co-lead in the product on the technical side.  Of course, you interact with, take questions, review the UI, do all those things you would normally do, but when they are out-of-line . . . not doing the \"boring\" work as they describe which is absolutely essential, their engineering manager is dealing with that.\n\nHOWEVER, if they have never done PM work, and now because of your arrival they are taking that on, it is because they lack respect for you, or the management that made the decision to bring you on, or both.\n\nIt is absolutely amazing to me how many start-ups load up their company with nothing but devs and no PM people, likely because they are doing that work, and then realize they don't have the time to do it well.  Every organization, even startups should have non-executive PMs from the start or at least a small team of BAs that they manage.\n\nYou are dealing with the fallout of poor planning, a weak understanding of the importance of PM, especially in the initial stages of a new product.\n\nGet your leadership to hire an engineering manager.  Get your leadership to have a team meeting, explaining your role and theirs (the junior devs) and push back on any product work they do.  If they make product decisions without consulting you, keep track of them, because it may be a long list that goes into a PIP later, if they fail to change.",

Now that you’re there, from their perspective it can feel like someone just showed up and started saying no to ideas they used to run with.\n\nMaybe it’s not your case, but often the conflict is less about seniority and more about ownership.\n\nWhat usually helps is making the decision boundaries very explicit, instead of debating every idea case by case:\n- Product defines which problems and metrics matter.\n- Engineering decides how to solve them.\n- Anyone can participate in the process and suggest ideas, but they’re treated as hypotheses, not decisions.\n\nWithout that clarity, every feature discussion you have turns into an argument about who gets to decide what, and that gets exhausting very quickly.\n\nThe other practical thing is to stop debating solutions and anchor everything on one or two core problems, especially if your team still doesn’t trust you. Junior devs, as you said, have a lot of ideas but understand less about the consequences of those choices. They feel less of the burden of actually being responsible for moving the metric.\n\nYou can change the conversation from “should we add this feature or that feature,” where everyone has opinions, to something like: “our activation is 20% and we need it at 35%.” When the discussion is anchored on a metric, the space for random decisions from junior devs gets much smaller.\n\nBut honestly, if there’s no engineering manager or technical lead setting expectations on their side, this will keep happening.

The case study is a good proxy. \n\n\nWe can see what sort of questions you ask, we can see how you interact with other partners (in our case study, we have ux partners and product partners and often data partners), we can see how you lead a conversation, we can see how you think in real time. \n\n\nIs this perfect, certainly not. But it does give us a glimpse of how you behave in more of a \"real\" product environment.\n\n\nThe advice for cases I have is to have some sort of logical progression you're going to take everybody through. Typically it starts with some sort of customer problem exploration, at this stage I don't want you to zero in on one problem, typically I want to see you think through all the different customer problems that you can given the case is complexity and have some sort of ranking system where you bring everybody in the case study along to align on what the right problem to solve is. There's no real right answer here, but I want to see some sort of logic to why one of these problems should be solved versus all the others. This could involve some made-up business data severity of use case urgency of problem customer demand for feature, it really varies on the case, but the point is you have some way of prioritizing one problem above all the others and you bring everybody along.\n\n\nNext is potentially the most fun, you can start thinking about solutions now that you have a problem. Again, I don't want you to zero in on one solution, and if this is kind of a group case study, I want to see you ask other people's opinion, but you need to center around two or three reasonable solutions that limited in scope technically feasible and defensible in terms of rough CX for the problem you're solving. \n\n\nIf there's an engineer involved, I want to see you ask about feasibility, if there's a designer involved, I want you to ask their opinion about customer patterns, if there's a data person involved, I want you to ask questions about how you would measure success or different key metrics that you would look for, the point is to involve people. \n\n\nCase studies are usually also pretty time limited, something I'm looking for is can you manage time in a stressful situation. If you only get through problem Discovery and not solution and alignment, not a great look. If one stakeholder seems to be really focusing on one aspect of a problem, I want to see how you gracefully pivot them towards moving to the next challenge. \n\n\nAgain these are all proxies for the real skills you leverage is approx manager, but interviewing is a terrible process and we have to do the best we can. \n\n\nTo me, the case study is probably one of the more enjoyable interview steps. I can't stand doing star responses to generic questions and I don't like hearing them either haha",

Those are just the means. \n\n\nI think a lot of current professional development around PMS hyperfixate on specific objects like prds, or customer interview questions, or some magic roadmap format. Honestly in my opinion none of that matters. Use whatever PRD you can to get your idea across. Have a roadmap that makes sense to your stakeholders. If you waste time on perfecting those artifacts versus actually having a clear vision, you're going to have a whole bunch of style and no substance. \n\n\nNow of course it's hard to find the time to work on the substance, I probably only spend like 15% of my time actually doing that, but it's my favorite time and it's the most value add time.",

It seems like a bunch of companies I’ve worked at want to invest a lot of time, money, and energy on “roadmap tools”. Dealing with these tools has always significantly increased my overhead and “busy work” and has never actually improved stakeholder visibility. \n\nMy new employer is going down this path right now and spending lots of time and human hours evaluating various tools. This is a small company that doesn’t have a dedicated IT or Security hire, but has decided now is the time to buy Aha. \n\nThe best roadmap tool I ever used was just Jira. Initiatives and Epics, organized in the backlog. Everyone has visibility. You never need to transcribe things in external systems. If a stakeholder wants more info on status, they can just drill down. And yet, without trying it, everyone seems convinced this is not going to meet our needs and we need to buy Aha. \n\nAre you this kind of person? What makes you think a growth-stage / immature company needs both Aha and Jira? Convince me! I truly don’t understand it. ",

The confluence page just points to the epics, so you see the current status, but the actual stack rank is in Confluence so it doesn't change.  Then when we do quarterly planning, we mark each one as \"commit\", \"stretch\" or \"won't do.\"   Now I have a list of all the epics that we think we will get done this quarter.  I usually then build a quick slide deck for sales and mktg so they don't have to dig through Jira which they won't understand.  Takes me a couple of hours per quarter total.  \n\nSo, yes?

          "text": "u/Ok-Appearance3478 I completely hear you. In fact, for a lot of internal only teams, Jira is enough. However, when I started to work at a software agency, my perspective changed a bit when I realized that Jira is can be really a developer tool that we try to force stakeholders to use and speak about lists. Non-technical stakeholders just don't understand it. Then we started to look for a solution to make our communication as efficient as possible for everyone no matter our stakeholders technical maturity. Our common language and shared understanding directed us towards user story mapping. We needed a visual explanation tool that anyone can join and make sence of any project we worked on. So we started to search for story mapping tools and we came across StoriesOnBoard and we use it for some years now. It changed everything. \n\nJira is a great bottom-up tool to track individual tasks. Even with advanced roadmaps, the view is linear and technical. For our clients, a flat list of 100 epics is a back hole. StoriesOnBoard gives us a horizontal, top-down view. We map the user journey (goals > steps > stories) on the story map and set our prioritize and slice releases. Then we simply push the result to Jira for our team to execute while the map syncs perfectly and keeps everyone up-to-date on a simple not tach heavy interface. When a client asks, \"Why are we building this?\", we don't show them a ticket in Jira, instead we show them exactly where it sits in the user's life on the story map so they can releate to it immediately. \n\nThe biggest risk isn't a bug for us it's more of a misunderstanding of scope. Jira doesn't make gaps obvious. In a story map, if you see a user step with only one story under it, but the other step has fifty, the imbalance is visual and immediate. Not to mention how extremly useful the user journey on the map. We use this to prevent over-engineering early on. We slice the map into releases visually. It makes the \"in vs. out\" conversation a collaborative design session rather than a defensive argument over a Jira backlog. So we keep everyone happy and this turned out to be really efficient for us. \n\nThis also let us overcome the fear of most stakeholders have as they are terrified of using Jira. They click the wrong thing, or see technical sub-tasks that trigger unnecessary panic. So Jira became where the devs work, talk tech, and manage technical debt. While we go to StoriesOnBoard to talk about value, journeys, and this becomes our roadmap plus they have roadmap for tracking epics or releases as well. We sync the two systems bi-directionally. When a dev closes a ticket in Jira, the status updates on the Story Map automatically along with other changes.   \n  \nDon't get me wrong, we're not transcribing anything. We're just viewing the same data through a lens that makes sense for someone who doesn't code. It is really the bridge that matters between buiness and tech folks. We maintain our story maps so they became the ultimate source of truth for everyone and makes communication much easier with our clients. \n\nFrom what you’ve described, switching to something like Aha really doesn’t make sense at that stage. Still, we’ve all seen cases where a top-down decision gets pushed because someone thinks it’s best for everyone ...even when it isn’t.",

      "text": "I’m a PM at a large tech company working on a strategic initiative (AI-adjacent, high visibility). I joined about a year ago and had a strong first year with good performance rating, above-average variable pay, stock refresher, and positive feedback from leadership. I’ve been called a “high agency PM” and someone expected to grow into owning a major work track.\n\nMy manager is relatively new to people management (promoted \\~2 years back). He’s genuinely a nice guy, supportive in appraisals and comp discussions, and I don’t believe there’s evil intent in anything mentioned below.\n\nBut day-to-day, I’m struggling.\n\nHe is extremely involved in execution:\n\n\\-- He's always in panic and anxiety mode, doing the job of even program managers, seeking alignment, chasing timelines, engineering/design commitments\n\n\\-- I have 3-4 syncs with him during the day (even when he's working from home he keeps messaging) where we discuss our work tracks, he tells me what to prioritise and what to keep aside\n\n\\-- If I’m creating a doc/artifact, he creates his own version before I’m done.\n\n\\-- If I’m drafting a response for another leader, he drafts his own version in parallel.\n\n\\-- He reaches out to engineering, design or marketing spocs directly instead of routing through me when I know most of the answers since I'm working with them on ground.\n\n\\-- In Slack threads, he often responds before I do, even when I’m clearly the owner.\n\n\\-- In leadership reviews, he presents most of the material and answers most questions.\n\nRecently, I prepared extensively for a high-level meeting with very senior leadership (including the business head). I knew every detail and could answer every question. But my manager and engineering leads answered everything before I could speak. I left the meeting without saying a word.\n\nWe’ve discussed ownership before. He says he sees me as high-agency and wants me to grow. He has said he’ll step back. But under pressure (which is mostly the case in our work charter), he seems to revert to high involvement. It's come to appoint where I wish he goes on a long break so I can work and deliver features peacefully.\n\nThe tricky part is:\n\n\t•\tHe has supported me strongly in compensation and performance reviews.\n\n\t•\tI’m working on strategic AI initiatives that are high impact.\n\n\t•\tI don’t think he’s intentionally blocking me.\n\n\t•\tI’m not being treated poorly in formal processes.\n\nBut the daily experience feels like I’m the thinker/executor while he remains the visible voice. In our review meetings he always says how \"the team\" has a lot to deliver and we've come a long way, how I'm a great value add to the team, but I feel I'm not operating at my true potential.\n\nAnother complication: my skip-level leader (his manager) is someone who forms perceptions quickly. I worry that discussing with him could unintentionally damage my manager’s reputation or promotion trajectory. That’s not something I want to do even slightly.\n\nAt the same time, I’m starting to lose work satisfaction because of the duplication, panic urgency, lack of clear authorship and this mom treatment (checking in on my work, suggesting me what to do, asking for updates multiple times during the day).\n\nSo I’m trying to think clearly about my options:\n\n\t1.\tHave a very direct confrontation about boundaries and duplication, maybe even call out his anxiety or panic issues?\n\n\t2.\tStay and design around this behavior (process clarity, ownership agreements, etc.) and keep bugging him till it's established?\n\n\t3.\tQuietly explore switching teams?\n\n\t4.\tReach out to skip-level?\n\n\t5.\tConsider leaving altogether?\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in similar situations:\n\nHow do you distinguish between first-time manager anxiety and a real growth ceiling?\n\nCan someone actually grow under a highly involved manager like this?\n\nIs this something that typically improves over time, or does it harden?\n\nAt what point is switching teams the smarter move?\n\nWould appreciate candid advice from experienced PMs or leaders who’ve seen both sides of this dynamic.",

          "text": "First off, I'm sorry you're in this situation.  \n  \nI've seen this pattern a lot. And the frustrating part is your manager probably isn't doing this on purpose. He's doing it because he's anxious, because he hasn't learned how to lead without doing, and because jumping in feels like helping. It's not. But it feels like it to him.\n\nHere's my take\n\nStop thinking about this as a confrontation. That word is already setting you up to come in hot. This is a partnership conversation.\n\nAnd don't just spring it on him. Nothing makes the air get sucked out of a room faster than \"hey, we need to talk.\" Instead, lead with exactly what the conversation is about: \"Hey, I want to have a conversation about how we work together day to day.\" Simple. Clear. No ambiguity. Then ask permission to share your observations. Something like \"I've noticed some patterns in how we're splitting work and I'd love to share what I'm seeing. Are you open to that?\" Getting that explicit yes before you go in lets you be honest without them feeling blindsided. Changes the whole dynamic.\n\nThen get specific. \"We're duplicating effort on docs, Slack responses, and stakeholder conversations and I think it's slowing us both down. Can we get clear on who owns what?\" No accusations. No \"you're micromanaging me.\" Just a clean practical framing about efficiency.\n\nDon't leave that conversation without concrete ownership agreements. Who owns first drafts. Who responds in Slack threads. Who leads which meetings. Write it down.\n\nOn the meeting thing, that one stings but you kinda let it happen. Next time you prep for a leadership meeting, tell your manager beforehand: \"I've got deep context here, I'd love to take the lead on questions.\" Don't wait for the mic. Claim it ahead of time.\n\nOn the skip level, hold off. You haven't had the real conversation with your manager yet. Have the direct version first. If nothing changes in 4-6 weeks then the skip level becomes a reasonable next step.\n\nFirst-time managers revert under pressure. That's not permanent but it means you're gonna have to re-establish boundaries more than once. The question isn't whether he reverts. It's whether he's open to the feedback and tries to correct.\n\nDon't leave yet. You've got a manager who supports you in comp and reviews, you're on high visibility AI work, and you haven't pushed on this hard enough to know if it can change. Try the direct conversation, set clear ownership, claim your space, and give it a real shot. If in 2-3 months you're still leaving meetings without saying a word, then start exploring. But right now you've got more leverage than you think.\n\nHappy to be a sounding board if you need help scripting out this conversation before you have it. Feel free to DM me.",

It was hell for a bit.\n\nI had an honest conversation with my new manager to check in and establish each other's expectations for our working relationship so we can be more productive moving forward.\n\nI started the checkin by being blunt about not knowing the best way to approach it (shows some vulnerability which helps build trust IMO) but that lately I've been feeling as though there may be a lack of trust given the amount of involvement they had in my day to day.  I mentioned I wasn't used to that under previous mgr and while I know everyone has their style I can't help but feel like I'm not meeting expectations somehow. Given my seniority I would have expected my d2d to be self managed and to just keep her informed through weekly updates or ad hoc notes as needed or if decisions or escalations are required.  I asked if that's her expectation too or if there was something I needed to work on more to get to that level of trust.\n\nShe then sang praises and sorta defended why she needed to be so involved and yatta yatta but we came to an understanding aligned more to my expectations and they did chill out quite a bit after that.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to approach it but I think this would be helpful for you too.  Just like in a romantic relationship, work relationships require alignment on expectations and how to work together if they're going to thrive",

A micro-manager behaves this way because they are inherently insecure. \n\n*Can someone actually grow under a highly involved manager like this?*\n\n* No. Right now, you are extremely valuable to him because he is new.  When the threat you offer to his career exceeds your value, he will sabotage you, and it may be through micro-managing by just wearing you down with the daily intrusions, in an effort to get you to move on your own, or it may be an attempt to undermine your confidence.  To be fair, he may not yet be there, but when he is you may just see the same type of behavior but worse.\n\n*Is this something that typically improves over time, or does it harden?*\n\n* It typically does not.  A manager that starts off this insecure or feels that he is the smartest person in the room usually remains that way because that is an inherent character flaw.\n\n*At what point is switching teams the smarter move?*\n\n* That would be a smart move now, if you do your research and do not switch to a team with a worse manager, or a worse project.",

It was a workflow tool used by internal employees, catered to roles, so that every person could navigate the UI according to their role and path to perform steps in an implementation.  This executive convinced upper management that the entire product needed to be redesigned to have a layer that was a common process layer.  I argued against it because the users loved our tool as is, had not asked for this change, and if it added any complexity to their decision-making, it would fail.  The executive won.  They made the changes.  He demo'd it in front of the company leadership and got a promotion.  Within two years the tool was abandoned with complaints on day 1 when it was released.  I moved to another department before the redesign was even completed because I knew how it would turn out.  It was a disaster, and I think that guy went on to become a President at a startup.

      "text": "My argument...it needs a bit of explanation.\n\nFirstly, AI is deflationary. What that means is that, by design, it commoditises execution. This is something that every business needs to defend in order to remain profitable. \n\nWhat is inflation anyway? Inflation is when there is too much money chasing goods and services i.e more people with cash want goods than there are goods in the world. So, prices rise because there's more competition for goods.\n\nOn the flip side, deflation is when there are too many goods chasing money i.e the market is flooded with \"stuff\" and not enough people want to pay for it.\n\nFor every product manager and business, this is a critical concept. It's life or death for a product or a business. Inflation is the norm. Deflation is dangerous.\n\nStick with me.\n\nForget everything about the whole \"AI replaces humans\" for a moment, and instead think about what happens when the barriers or \"moats\" around technology disappear.\n\nCompanies that had spent vast sums of money to build software are starting to see their \"moats\" slowly get filled with concrete.\n\nIndividuals are now able to build things in an hour that use to take whole teams weeks to create. Yes it might not be perfect, yet, but you have to consider the rate of innovation, not its current state. Humans are resourceful and there is infinite resources being poured into solving these problems. The will to progress is there and happening.\n\nBut what about distribution, brand strength or proprietary data moats? The thing with AI is that it is prolific. It enters every part of the chain.\n\nSo, AI creates a value problem. If moats disappear then there will be an oversupply of services. This will impact business' ability to make a profit and could result in many collapsing under the weight of easy competition.\n\nThese sorts of things happen slowly at first, and then happen rapidly. In my view, it's not a case of if, but when.\n\nNot all companies will suffer, many will gain that genuinely manage to hold onto their moat. And for those, they'll capture the remaining margin. The thing that many don't realise, is that economies can't handle big shocks like this because it means that governments have to print money, which increases the debt burden. In a deflationary environment, that isn't affordable. But that's a different conversation.\n\nThe question is: when the value of 'building the thing' drops to zero, how do we justify our products' existence?",

The bottleneck moves up. From \"can we build it\" to \"should we build it.\" That's judgment and taste. Understanding your specific users in your specific market at this specific moment.\n\nAI commoditizes the stuff with right answers. Code compiles or it doesn't. But deciding *what* to build, which tradeoff to make, how to position it? That's pattern recognition trained on years of domain experience. LLMs can't replicate it because training compresses everyone's judgment into average judgment. And average judgment is no judgment. It's why every AI-generated strategy sounds plausible and none of it sounds like yours.\n\nProducts built on pure technical moats are in trouble, but they always were and also we can see so many OSS project taking over etc. But products built on deep user understanding, good niche context and sharp product thinking get *stronger*. Because now you can execute on good judgment instantly instead of waiting months for a team to ship it.\n\nThe companies that die aren't the ones whose moats get filled. They're the ones whose moats were only ever \"we built it first.\" The real moat was always knowing what to build. That just became the most valuable skill in the industry.\n\nSo imo PMs with good taste will become critical need.",

          "text": "I think you’re right that execution is getting cheaper. That part feels obvious. What I’m less convinced about is that cheaper execution automatically leads to products collapsing.\n\nWe’ve seen similar shifts before. When cloud infrastructure got dramatically cheaper, companies didn’t disappear en masse. When open source matured, it didn’t wipe out software businesses. When no-code tools lowered the barrier to building apps, it didn’t eliminate products — it multiplied them. What changed wasn’t the existence of products, but the basis of competition.\n\nMost successful products weren’t defensible purely because they were hard to build. They survived because they solved a real problem in a way people trusted, because they became embedded in workflows, because they built brand recognition, because they accumulated data and relationships over time. Those dynamics don’t vanish just because execution accelerates.\n\nAI absolutely compresses the cost of making things. That will erode thin wrappers and surface-level tools that existed mainly because building them required resources. But that’s not the same as killing products altogether. It just forces a separation between features that were artificially scarce and systems that create durable value.\n\nOversupply is a real risk, but supply has never been the only constraint. Attention is scarce. Trust is scarce. Distribution is scarce. Even if anyone can build something, not everyone can get it adopted, integrated, and relied upon. That friction still matters.\n\nIf building approaches zero marginal cost, the leverage shifts. The differentiator becomes problem selection, positioning, experience design, ecosystem strategy, and long-term value capture. In that environment, judgment compounds more than technical execution does.\n\nSo maybe the better question isn’t what happens when building becomes free. It’s what happens when everything becomes buildable. When that’s true, the scarce resource isn’t code. It’s clarity about what deserves to exist and why.",

But that’s not the real world is it? \n\nA more practical approach is to try the above but expect more of a win/lose compromise than a win/win collaboration. Set some context with your team’s key functional leads that you want to clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision making and draft a “working agreement” that captures which decisions each function owns and who makes decisions with regard to conflicts. The person who gets to carry the failure burden should make the case they’re ultimately accountable and _will_ have final say. \n\nNo one is going to love it but it does clear things up enough to reduce the number of conflicts by _some_ amount. Still, it’s more or less a bandage on a still weepy wound. \n\nThe harder play is a long term play that you need to do no matter what — you have to build a relationship with everyone. \n\nIt’s complicated because you’ll find that while it’s easier to trust some people you’ll also find it much harder with others for a variety or reasons that you mostly don’t control. When the trust is there, these conflicts tend to disappear in favor of having what feels like a normal conversation with friends deciding what bar to go to. When it isn’t, every conversation feels like a battle and that’s the kind of thing that just grinds both sides down. \n\nThe hard people is where you need to run _toward_ the problem. In my own career, I use the Johari window, Thomas-Kilmann conflict model, and the situational leadership framework and a heavy dose of facilitation techniques to work through those challenges. It’s rare that it solves the problem completely but it usually dramatically it improves things to the point my challenge colleagues become close enough to an ally that it’s all good. However, sometimes it just isn’t fixable or capable of being improved. If it’s a direct report, I get them off my team. If it’s a peer, I’ll compartmentalize them to keep their impact minimized. If it’s a senior leader, I’ll try to weave in points when I can but ultimately will exit myself from that situation. \n\nAnyhow, talk to your designer. Find out what they care about and why. Share the same for yourself. Ask them what they think they need to do to be successful in their role and you share the same. Try to build some common understanding of your roles. Then talk about concerns you both have with the way you’re working together. Look for some areas of agreement and build on that towards a decision. Honestly, this stuff is a lot of soft skills that most people are horrendous at but check out some books on facilitation techniques which will give you some tools.",

You probably are not asking the eng team to use a different tech stack or use different variable names. If the design solves the problems you laid out, then it should be okay (in theory). However, “taste” is increasingly important, and to me is critical in being just a PM vs a GOOD PM.

Here's what I've learned: the question \"who owns the final call\" is usually a symptom, not the actual problem.\n\nWhen collaboration works, you never need to pull rank. The real issue is almost always about how feedback is framed. \"Can you try something else\" feels like a taste call to a designer. \"This flow doesn't work because users need to do X before Y, and here's the support data\" gives them a problem to solve — which is what good designers actually want.\n\nIn practice, PM owns the outcome, designer owns the craft. But the best results I've seen come when you give designers the full business context upfront — the constraints, the user data, the strategic goals — and then let them explore solutions within that frame. When they understand *why* something matters, they design for it. When they don't, they design for aesthetics.\n\nOne thing that helped us a lot: never critique a design in terms of \"I don't like it.\" Always frame it as \"here's the user problem this doesn't solve yet.\" It completely changes the dynamic.",

Designers can tell the difference, and it’s probably why you’re getting pushback.\n\nFrame feedback as problems, not requests for alternatives. “Can you try something else” feels like a taste call. “I’m worried users will drop off here because X” is a collaboration. One makes a designer defensive. The other makes them curious.\n\nYour previous designer may not have been more collaborative — they may have just been more compliant. A designer who defends their decisions with rationale is a good designer. Learn to work with that instead of treating it as a problem.\n\nThe “too pushy” comment is a real signal. Even delivered as a joke, it means your designer feels their expertise isn’t being respected. Try leading with “I trust your judgment on the visual execution — I want to flag a concern about the flow from a business angle.” Small shift, big difference.\n\nWhen you’re truly stuck, depersonalize it. Suggest a usability test. Nobody’s opinion wins; user behavior does.\n\nThe instinct to care about UX is great. Just make sure you’re bringing evidence and problems to the table, not alternative design solutions.

Unless he got his way, he was delaying my decisions and being a bottle neck. Even the dev team said it should be the PM's call and we all got frustrated. It got so dragged out that I talked to my boss and let that design lead be the project owner.\n\nIn your case, since the designer is new, rank shouldn't be an issue. First chat with the designer about the collaboration style in their previous work and ask who they think own the product and responsibilities. If they says the PM owns the product metrics, the final decision should be yours. (This is to make them admit themselves that the PM own the product).   \nIf they are still being difficult, talk to their direct-report and ask for advice from your manager. Be careful approaching higher ups; they hate having problems brought to them. Instead of complaining, ask for advice, ask how they handled such situation in their career, and bring evidence why your decision is better than the designer.",

Still they should be able to communicate why this choice and how it aligns with the design system and overall best practices.\n\nI think as a PM your job is to communicate and cooperate with designers and developers alike, acting as the bridge and the glue in a sense of the product. So it's less about who should have the final say, and more how well you're able to communicate and cooperate with this designer. \n\nIf your relationship with this designer is unidirectional where you request something and they produce something, perhaps you can have a discussion with them regarding how you can have a more cooperative approach where you iterate together rather than work separately and simply judge the final design presented by the designer.\n\nOf course the art of communication is to maintain an open discussion and not let ego's and assumptions take the better of yourselves.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis may all sound obvious but in my experience good communication is hard to come by naturally and requires a lot of effort, when it doesn't happen issues like these drain everyone involved and the product suffers as a consequence.",

And if designer takes all my context/input into consideration and comes up with a design artifact I should respect the decisions made since they are the experts (unless I'm not coming from design with years of experience, but even in this case this might be disrespectful). Many times after working with a designer you know how much of this context you really need to exchange before in an alignment meeting or PRD, since I worked with such high profiles they do all of that context themselves and present as their thinking process. As an example; lets say I do 3 competitor benchmarks ahead; but she complements with another 3 analysis which may change the original boundries/insights so the expectations. So I would really try hard an perfect alignment ahead and not have designers do they job for days and weeks and we conflict in front of others.",

In the absence of this you can record the current time and the topic and calculate the timestamp in the recording from there. \n\nThe shorthand saves you a lot of time from having to listen to the whole recording, because transcriptions alone obliterate much of the nuance of how things are communicated. A transcription may work if you annotated the same day while the session was fresh, but I don’t like to rely on transcriptions alone. \n",

The root issue is usually that different stakeholders need different views of the same information, but most tools force you to recreate everything from scratch for each audience.  \n  \nThe teams that handle this best tend to pick one source of truth (usually where the actual work lives, like Jira) and then find ways to present that data differently rather than maintaining separate documents. Some use tools that can pull from Jira and automatically generate the visual presentations, others build lightweight dashboards that filter the same underlying data for different audiences. The key is avoiding manual updates across multiple systems.  \n  \nFor what you're describing - needing both high-level strategic views and detailed execution views from the same data - Easy Agile Roadmaps (full disclosure, I work for Easy Agile but just think it could be agood solution) might be worth looking at since it connects directly to your Jira work and can switch between those different levels of detail without you having to maintain separate versions.

You're new to the organization, so you don't want to create friction as a new employee. \n\nHOWEVER, while you're asking the standard \"what needs to be done?\" questions, also begin asking \"what are your goals and objectives for the year?\" and \"what does success for your department look like?\" This will allow you to begin to anchor the features and solutions they're asking for to the goals and objectives provided, and understand if they're aligned. Most often, they're not, if they can even provide clear goals and objectives. \n\nOnce you (hopefully) have an understanding of the goals and objectives, you can proactively pitch solutions/ideas to stakeholders instead of waiting for them to give you their ideas. Alternatively, when they ask for features, provide multiple options. Give them the option that they asked for, but also share 1-2 more options that solve the problem they're looking to address, assuming you feel there may be better ways to address the need. These can be ways to help shift the culture of the product team being order takers and winning trust back from stakeholders. ",

Early or execution-heavy teams tend to reward building, testing, and proving things with data. More process-heavy orgs lean on consensus, alignment, and stakeholder input before anything moves, especially if mistakes are expensive or visibility is high.\n\nWhat you’re seeing now is a place that optimizes for coordination over speed. That often shows up as lots of meetings and upstream validation. It can feel frustrating if you’re used to learning through shipping, but it’s also how some orgs manage risk and politics. Your manager may be trying to protect you or themselves by making sure stakeholders feel heard.\n\nOver time, strong PMs usually blend the two. They do the stakeholder work to earn trust, then quietly reintroduce small bets, experiments, and scoped tests once there’s cover. The autonomy you had before often has to be rebuilt in a new environment.\n\nThis isn’t a signal that you’re doing product wrong. It’s a signal that you’re learning how different orgs operate.

Especially if in the process of building start-ups you've read the same books as most PMs do (highly likely 😉). \n\nWHERE I SEE FOUNDERS WITH NON-PM EXPERIENCE STRUGGLING: I think that there's still one fundamental difference between founder experience and PM experience - one is much crazier than the other, and the two operate at different speeds. While as a founder you carry all the risk and respectively sufficient authority to move the needle into virtually any direction, as a PM you make the best out of the direction the ship is steered all while playing the political game to push company course to move 5 degrees to the right or to the left. The operating speed is also vastly different, requiring a lot more and different in nature alignment between functions and stakeholders. While on paper all of this seems clear (and seemed super clear to the people I've seen with your background), this is exactly where I felt the gap while we were having a conversation.\n\nThere is one more aspect - having an engineering team build a product for you at your 4-person start-up is very different from having an engineering team build a product WITH you at a larger company. I see my founder-experienced product leaders often miss the point here and sound like people who know nothing about product development in a real-world Product & Engineering organization. \n\n\nHope this helps!",

Either free or paid.\n\nRealistically, here are your options:  \n1. Research STAR method and broadly try to apply this to your own experiences. The problem with this is that you don't really know what GOOD looks like.  \n2. Use AI to help you. This will likely yield better results, but it will shave off all of the things that make you unique, which are the very things that convert in this market. Companies want specialists, not generalists right now. Additionally, you've likely already tried this and it isn't working.  \n3. Ask someone with specific experience to help you.

If they can't demonstrate clear communication in their own posts, move on. Referrals from people in roles you want to be in are usually more reliable than cold searches.\n\nBeyond hiring a coach, one underrated approach is recording yourself. Presentations, calls, even casual conversations if the other person is okay with it. Most people have never actually heard how they come across and it's the fastest feedback loop available.\n\nThis is actually the core problem we built CoachScribe around, just applied to the sports world. Coaches at every level, Premier League, F1, NCAA, think they communicate one way and the data shows something different. The gap between perception and reality is almost always surprising.\n\nSame principle applies to executive presence. You can't improve what you're not measuring.\n\n[coachscribe.ai](http://coachscribe.ai) if you're curious about the approach.",

Try this for a week and see if there is an improvement.\n\n\"I want to improve my executive communication and presence. Act as my personal communication coach for the next 10 minutes.\n\nBefore we start, ask me these three quick questions and wait for all my answers before continuing:\n\n1. What is your current communication style - are you naturally direct, diplomatic, detailed, or informal?\n2. Is English your first language or second language? If second, what is your first language?\n3. What is one word someone who works with you would use to describe how you communicate today?\n\nOnce I answer, ask me about a real communication challenge I am facing right now - a meeting, a presentation, a difficult conversation, or a message I need to send.\n\nThen help me reframe how I would approach it with more clarity, confidence, and executive presence. Adapt your coaching specifically to my communication style and language background. If English is my second language, help me sound natural and confident without losing my authentic voice.\n\nAlso give me 3 power words I can consciously use today in conversations, emails, or meetings. For each word tell me what it signals to others and give me one example sentence using it in a professional context. Choose words that feel natural for my communication style.\n\nAfter we work through my challenge, give me one communication habit I can practise this week that will make the biggest difference to how I come across to senior stakeholders.\n\nFinally, give me one phrase I should stop using in executive meetings and explain exactly why it weakens my presence.\"\n\nFeel free to modify the prompt to your needs. Initially, as the AI tool is gathering all the details, it will take more than 10 mins.  \nI hope this helps.",

I'm currently stuck on a modernization project for a legacy system with full process preservation, and I could really use some perspective.\n\nWe're about a year in with no clear end in sight, and leadership patience is wearing thin. A lot of the blame is being directed at me as the sole PO, with the criticism being that developers are spending time on business/systems analysis work that should fall under my responsibility.\n\nThe core challenge is that we're finding out functionality as we develop, and I'm finding it nearly impossible to capture everything upfront. So much of the existing workflow is driven by undocumented business practices and unwritten rules that don't surface often times until dev starts digging in. As a result, my developers are regularly catching things I missed which is creating tension.\n\nHas anyone navigated a similar situation? I'm especially curious how others have handled the documentation gap on heavily undocumented legacy systems. Any advice is appreciated!",

Is there a way to get more help from the business side of things to uncover stuff earlier and get their contributions to catch things? The more that you can create a unified sense of \"this is our mission and here's what we're trying to do,\" The last pushback you will likely get. \n\n**Team morale**: are your developers upset about having to help you dig through all of this, or are your developers all right with the current way of working? \n\n**Leveraging milestones**: how much are you using milestones to deliver value even as the project gets delayed and timelines grow longer? If leadership can feel like you have hit certain milestones and are making progress against a very large and complicated initiative, that might also help them develop a little bit more patience. If they're having to wait three years until they can actually see any of the value of this investment, it's a lot harder for them to play along patiently. \n\n**User research**: How are you currently figuring out what is going on today with these systems? Is there a way for you to watch users use these systems as you are writing up your materials? Or other ways to get closer to the people actually in the business who are the ones that need this functionality working in a particular way? When there is very little documentation, the best thing you can do is find patterns of how people are actually using it. In an ideal world, if you then found out that nobody was using a particular piece of functionality, you could even drop it. \n\nKeep us posted!",

I get it - you need it to tell a fundraising story, and these guys need *some* form of product vision to hang on to for broader business context.  So just do it….give them your best guess.  \n\nA roadmap isn’t a promise, it’s always and only:  “given what we know now, this it was I think we should do”.  \n\nAnd if your CEO is the uptight type who gets her panties in a wad….frame the roadmap not in terms of “features”, but instead “problems we will try to solve”.  These tend to be more long lasting and fits with iterative development.  Product wise - What we want to do shouldn’t change much, but the How we accomplish it definitely will.",

However, if you are pushing back on the whole idea of a year-long roadmap in the first place, then you are in the wrong.  A year-long roadmap is something every company should do . . . it doesn't mean the product is going live in a year.\n\nIf your problem with the CEO is a result of the former, have you identified the **specific risks,** and put a number to it?  Sometimes it is a financial number that is easy to pin down, and sometimes it is a bit more esoteric, like going live prematurely results in market-place rejection that could snowball in a whole different way negatively with long-term effects.\n\nFor example, although your company has identified and validated a business problem to solve, and has scoped out the high-level requirements, the detailed requirements have yet to be fleshed out, and no market analysis has occurred.  In other words, you do not know how big your true market is, whether there is an appetite at a large enough scale to warrant your investment, and what mitigating factors or constraints exist that could be roadblocks. Imagine you are building a product, for example, for the airplane manufacturing industry that is a better solution for what they have now.  But you fail to understand that there are only about 6 global companies that would be a target for your expensive product, and that one will never use a product outside of its country, and two are locked into decades long contracts with a third-party.  You spend millions building your product thinking you had these sales opportunities and the only one that comes to fruition is one company whose purchase doesn't even cover your R&D costs.",
