The real life business strategies are reliable. The writing styles aren’t all the exact same. \n\nWhen Claude doesn’t understand the prompt, it asks clarifying questions. When recalling past conversations, it doesn’t forget half of it.\n\nClaude is so much more reliable for everything besides image creation, which let’s be honest are only for memes at this point, and deep research. Now I will say, I think the deep research is a lot better with chatgpt, and makes the case to keep the subscription for that single application mode.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Disagree?",

When the PO prioritised a feature, however big or small, it was my job to dig into what that actually meant. What was the impact on the wider product, how would we break it down into individual user stories, what would those stories look like? This allowed the PO to focus on the **why** and **when** of what was being delivered, while I as the BA focused on the **how**. Not in terms of project delivery, timelines, or cost, but the low level detail of the feature, into user stories, acceptance criteria etc.\n\nYears later, having moved onto being a PO, and now Sr. PO, it seems rare that companies even bother with BAs any more. More and more POs are spending time focusing on low level requirements, writing jira tickets, UAT testing, leading backlog refinements to answer detail on edge cases, as BAs are often missed out of the entire structure.\n\nIs SAFe to blame? As that doesn't have BAs at all.\n\nIt's not all companies, but it feels like an increasing number of companies are removing the BA role and expecting the PO to do it.\n\nMaybe it's a UK thing and other countries are different?",

The work previously done by business analysts still needs to be done, which means someone is doing it, and being paid.  Generally speaking, that person was hired to do something else, and hired because they were good at the thing they were hired to do.  Often they aren't very interested in (or particularly good at) doing things a BA would do, but the work still needs to be done.  So, it gets done less well and/or slower than before.  As a result, capacity decreases and problems increase.  In the interest of \"eliminating a position\", we often make our teams less efficient, less effective, and less happy.\n\nWhile I'm on a rant, DevOps doesn't mean saving money by making your developers responsible for your Ops functions.  It means reducing friction by connecting your dev people and your ops people to create overlaps and insight where there were once gaps and a wall that people were chucking problems over.\n\nI've spent years fighting with people (often fueled by consultants) who don't understand the purpose of Agile, of DevOps, of Product, or even Cloud, and think everything is supposed to be a cost cutting measure.  That isn't the purpose of any of these, and every time I've seen someone sell these transformation as cost-saving initiatives, they've failed to deliver either cost savings or the benefits those transformations should actually deliver.",

Thinking about long term strategy and benefit, ensuring the right thing is being built now as opposed to the wrong thing, building stakeholder relationships.

The PMs stay at the surface level of everything so they can navigate and direct us where to go (areas of opportunity). BAs dive deep into the water - they work from the surface of the lake to the bottom. They partner with PMs to identify anything that may trip us up as we move forward. PMs should rarely have to dive deep into every aspect of the work. If this is happening, they have lost focus on what/why/customer.\n\nBeen using this model for 10 years and it works.

If you can’t do those things, you aren’t building towards being a great product manager. \n\nNot saying you have to, but you should know HOW to and be ABLE to because it makes your work more efficient with others.

See the *Founder Mode* essay from *Paul Graham* or various interviews with *Brian Chesky*.\n3. Companies are more picky about the engineers they hire - and have increased their expectations. It is becoming more common for **engineers to write their own tickets** and think about the product-impact of what they are building.\n4. In some orgs (for example *Linear*), **Product Designers** have taken on more responsibility when it comes to making nitty gritty product decisions.\n5.

If you can't answer that in under 5 words, then all you're doing is agentic tool tourism.\n\nApologies for going full curmudgeon mode this morning, but I'm getting a bit worn out by product management influencers peddling various RPA+AI tools and then pimping them as strategic agent building for product managers.\n\nNope, not against building agents. Nope, not against getting real PM sh!t done with Ai tools. But that's not product management. Value delivery is.\n\nSo let me throw this challenge down: which business model or operational model levers are you pulling when you prioritize which opportunity to exploit, and which to leave in the dustbin of 'good but not great ideas?'\n\nPut another way, when you explain to your executive sponsor why to invest in an agent, are you able to explain the how your agent helps you compete by increasing revenue, growing market share, or nurturing LTV?\n\nWhen you have to convince the Head of Change Management why you should agentify a part of their operating model, can you explain it in increased productivity, cost savings, or safety & compliance enforcement?\n\nIf you can, would love to hear your stories. If not, be aware that agents ... and any automation for that matter ... intrinsically does not add value. All they do is amplify specific leverage in how you compete or how you operate ... warts and all ... meaning:  \n\\- No leverage = no value.  \n\\- Wrong leverage = wasted budget.  \n\\- Leveraged dysfunction = disaster at scale.\n\nAnyway, my point is, don't get suckered into the time suck that is gaining Mastery with tools like n8n, LangFlow, Make/com, ZapierAI, CrewAI, etc ... Fluency is enough.\n\nPut another way:  \n\\- Stop building agents because you can.  \n\\- Start building them because they move metrics that matter.\n\nTLDR: Know your levers. Then build the agent.\n\n</curmudgeonmode>\n",

It's more like \"a show of progress\" to make higher ups happy.

Even if it doesn't solve corporate politics issues, data is ammo that savvy PMs can use. And the thought process itself of coming up with more experiment hypotheses is really useful. It helps to show that things are always more nuanced than snake oil-selling PMs make them seem.\n\nShitty PMs used to be able to coast by for years by sounding convincing and bringing \"data\" to conversations.

So yes, it will help you build the wrong things faster.\n\nAn embedded systems team I worked with adopted LLMs into their workflow pretty early on. They didn't have much experience in either field and were working on a pretty poorly defined problem. Those who relied on the LLMs didn't tend to understand the relationship between their designs and the requirements or desireable qualities of the project. It was a big hassle that resulted in more design review rounds since they weren't applying critical thought beyond what the LLM was spitting out. \n\nWe would have done with more talking with the client and thinking about what we actually needed to build. A good lesson I've taken for our future work. Then perhaps we could have applied LLMs, but honestly I find I spend more time herding and explaining context than getting useful work done.",

It's surprisingly accurate and lets me zero in on what I need without relying on Onedrive's search function or viewing it manually.\n\nI also use ChatGPT as a news aggregator and to trawl competitor events and functionality on a weekly basis.\n\nFinally, Replit's prototyping can save me a bunch of time if I feed it a detailed enough prompt and a few screenshots.

      "text": "I watched this podcast episode between Peter Yang and Teresa Torres, which walks us through her Claude Code setup: [https://youtu.be/uBJdwRPO1QE](https://youtu.be/uBJdwRPO1QE)\n\nI don't know how the task management system shown in the demo really boosts productivity. I thought the whole point of tools like Clickup, Asana, and Trello was that they were visual and super easy to add and manage task cards.   \n  \nWe're going back to a command-line interface model because it's somehow faster?\n\nShe argues that going on a web browser, creating a new card, adding a due date etc. is slower than the command line interface. Perhaps - but I have Asana desktop I'm a tab-switch away from adding a new task.\n\nI also didn't get how the \"/today\" command makes life easier. Like I just look at my calendar or Asana board for cards due today and tomorrow (or maybe create a custom view). It feels like an awful lot of new structures to build / learn to do something as basic as task management.\n\nWhat I did like was the research function - apparently, she's automated a subagent to go fetch all the latest research from a set of links and then distill them to what's relevant for her. That's smart. Although I could do the same with a custom GPT or a simple [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) agent. \n\nNot being sarcastic here - everyone's raving about Claude Code on X and I'm genuinely trying to figure out what the groundbreaking upside is. Could you explain it to me in simple terms?\n\n",

          "text": "I'll share a little more about why I chose to use Claude Code for my task management. I'll also share I don't think it's the right solution for everyone. By demoing this, I'm not trying to convince you to do the same. I'm simply sharing what works for me and trying to show what is possible.\n\nHere are my reasons:  \n\\- My trello board is a mess. I have data-baed tasks and evergreen projects. I've tried keeping separate board, separate lists, and a variety of other solutions. But I wasn't able to find a solution within their GUI that worked for me. No matter how I sliced it, my view was too complex. It was hard for me to figure out what to work on next.  \n\\- Most task management tools rely on keyword search. This means if I don't remember exactly what I named my task, it's hard to find it. Claude gives me fuzzy search. When I ask if I have already have a task for my January webinar and it can't find one, it's smart enough to search for related terms like January event. It can even look through all of my tasks and find anything that is remotely similar to \"January webinar\" semantically and suggest it as an option. I've never seen a SaaS tool do this well (yet).  \n\\- I'm comfortable in the terminal. I type fast without thinking and prefer text-based interfaces. I know this is not universal and this is exactly why I'm not trying to convince you this is the right solution for you.  \n\\- I context switch a lot. I have a lot of ideas. I want somewhere where I can capture everything without thinking about how to organize it. Claude helps by tagging everything for me. This allows me to ask, \"What are all the ideas I've had related to my interview coach?\" Claude can find them. No matter how I titled them. This means I can create dynamic views on the fly just by asking questions.  \n\\- By giving Claude access to all my to dos, I can now ask Claude \"What's on my list that you can help with?\" This helps me explore the boundaries of what AI can do. It alleviates the burden of always having to ask \"Can AI help with this?\" It allows Claude to offer, \"I can help with this.\" I like that.  \n\\- I like that my data is portable. It's not locked into a tool. I am concerned about how many of my ideas, thoughts, notes, etc. are locked into Trello. This allows me to extract it and put it into a system that works better for me. That I can take anywhere.\n\nI don't think moving your task management system to Claude magically makes you more productive. Task management is idiosyncratic. We all have our preferred ways of working. That's why there are dozens (if not hundreds) of reasonably successful task management tools and none that have taken the majority of the market. I like that it allows me to design a system that works exactly the way I want to work.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about this. I have nothing to sell related to using AI for task management or productivity. I'm simply having fun exploring and experimenting. And I like sharing.",

In other words, it's a mess. \n\nWhat Claude Code brings to the table is a UI + some level of discernment. It's not about being able to more quickly create an issue; it's about having a robot brain that looks through _all_ the issues as often as I need and does a reasonable job of applying some kind of intelligence to them.\n\nHere's the kinds of things I ask:\n\n    \"Find all the issues added in the last week and check if they're duplicates of previously entered issues.\"\n\n    \"Label all issues without labels as either 'Bug' or 'Feature' requests\"\n\n    \"Give me a list of issues resolved in the last 24 hours that had anything to do with the email notification system\"\n\n    \"Create a new issue for each of these modules, assign it to [name]\" \n\n    \"Compare PRs merged into production for the past week and the existing open issues and see if we missed closing any\"\n\n    \"Create a new weekly dev work issue assigned to me, move over uncompleted issues from last week and add all new exceptions to it as sub-issues\"\n\nA few notes on my setup:\n\n1. I've found MCP's in general to be not great. Claude Code does really well using command line tools (like Github's CLI) and it's much faster. \n\n2. For anything I do semi-regularly I have Claude create a bash script for it.\n\n3. I do also have a few actual Claude skills (these are just markdown documentation files that I also have Claude create). These help for things like having Claude remember to set custom fields we have on issues, etc. \n\n4. I'm also using SuperWhisper for most of this where I'm speaking aloud and it's \"typing\" for me into Claude code (which is awesome). \n\n5. I have scripts that pull down issues, the screenshots (bug reports + UI stuff), descriptions, and comments, and just immediately put all of that into the Claude Code context and launch into fixing them.\n\nHope that helps.",

Lots of \"Okay, I did my part...now do yours\" happens in business and unfortunately trust in that handoff is low pretty often.\n\nCustomer Service teams don't pick up the phone or respond to emails. Marketing teams botch an announcement. Google changes its mind and buries you on Page 4 for a couple weeks. An executive goes off script at a conference, lies about the product, and then says a racial slur. The tech debt you were very vocal about resolving first, but told not to concern yourself with because it was someone else's to manage. Delays you had no hand in. So many ways a product can fail that you have ZERO control over and no amount of contingency plan, failsafe, redundancy protocol, or blood sacrifice will prevent it. \n\nWe do our best to be 100% confident in our work, but we realize that we're all mostly taking educated guesses and then placing a bet without posted odds.",

There are a lot of certifications out there, but I’m wondering which ones really provide the skills that are most useful on the job.\n\nHave any of you done an online product management course that you felt was actually hands-on and gave you something to use in the real world? I’m interested in practical, actionable content that I can apply immediately, not just theory.\n\nAlso, how long did it take you to finish the program, and do you think it made a noticeable difference in your career?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\n\n**Update:** Thanks for the advice, everyone! I went with [**Pragmatic Institute**](https://redditsafe.click/pragmatic-institute) for my product management certification. It’s been super practical and full of real-world tools I can use right away. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for actionable training!\n\n",

But a product management certification is totally useless in my view unless you’re already a product manager. \n\nWhy? Because a class is always theoretical because what’s needed is different all the time. So unless you are practicing in the real world, you’re spending thousands of dollars to learn the same stuff as you can learn in any number of product management books that cost less than $30. \n\nCertificates are only worth while if your employer eats the cost after already having hired you as a junior PM - and then only if they have education budget to blow and you want to spend your time in a certificate program and not just reading a book.",

I spent the past year feeling stuck and overwhelmed with the scale and volume of problems that I am trying to solve.\n\nAfter a lot of thought I feel what I need is to talk to a senior product professional that has a strong grasp of product fundamentals to help me stay grounded in what matters and in delivering value where it counts the most. Have you been in such a position before? Any recommendations for me on how to go about finding such mentorship opportunity? \n\nAlso if you feel it is worth it, I would be open to paid product coaching type sessions as well so feel free to share any experiences that you have with this.

I checked LinkedIn profiles of people who were in similar roles, and if anyone was generous enough to mention type of product problems they solved in their bio and that resonated with me , I made a connection request. I am guilty of not going ahead with follow ups when initial messages were unanswered though.   \n3. ADPList was suggested to me by a friend who did find a mentor on that platform after much trial and error. You can try that  \n4. As of today, I am heavily relying on LLM (I use perplexity) as my guide/mentor and so far the bond has been going good (:P). I keep dumping context to it and at least an action plan is cooked, however imperfect.   \n5. I have also started believing in 'do good, get good'. I'll soon start mentoring people, and hope the universe hands back mentorship",

This requires a LOT of communication, which is an important part of the job.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, as long as your meetings are bringing you closer to finding that solution, I’d rather you had more meetings than less. The part where you do solo work as a PM, researching something or writing backlogs is much lower value work than solution discovery, launch planning with others and influencing.\n\nI’m not saying execution is unimportant, it is, but execution shouldn’t be taking such a huge proportion of your time that you don’t have time to talk to others.",

An example might be Amazon—someone responsible for search, someone responsible for the cart, and someone responsible for order history. \n\nThis works, but leads to messy results when we’re trying to accomplish something that might cut across all number of functions. Does each product manager implement the new feature independently? What if that’s not the highest priority for “search”? How do ensure alignment?\n\nSo I’ve been thinking a lot about JTDB or outcome-driven domains. Rather than have someone be responsible for search, have someone be responsible for “user wants to quickly find a product”. \n\nI think it does three things:\n1. It lets the scope of the solution stretch to all corners of the tooling. “User wants to quickly find a product” could be better search, but could also be smarter recommendations on the homepage. \n2. It provides really easy KPIs for success. “Reduce time to order by 10%.”\n3. It makes prioritization more direct. It’s not “are we working on search or the product page” it’s “are we maximizing order efficiency or are we fulfilling customer needs for more product better\n\nHowever, it also adds new complexities…\n1. Assuming each of the “functions” are on different stacks, you may be asking one engineering team to string together five different code bases (whereas before each code base had an engineering owner).\n2. It assumes you have a great list of JTBD or outcomes to even start from. \n\nI’m really curious how other folks have handled this. I have a strong opinion here and that worries me. I know “fall in love with the problem not the solution” but I have a crush on my solution 😀",

Ask *why* they built certain products — and just as importantly, **what they chose not to do**. Strategy shows up in the no’s.\n\n**2. Build business model fluency**  \nLearn how your company really makes money:  \npricing, packaging, costs, margins.  \nSpend time with Finance. Strategy without economics is just storytelling.\n\n**3. Practice thinking in bets**  \nFrame decisions as trade-offs:  \nWhere to play, where not to play, what assumptions must hold, and what happens if you’re wrong.\n\nProduct strategy is:\n\n* high-cost or irreversible trade-offs\n* allocating scarce resources over time\n* connecting product bets to business outcomes\n\nThat’s the work.

It's boring, repetitive, and it should feel a bit heavy. Here is the 'workout' that actually moved the needle for me:\n\n1. Forensic Strategy: Don’t just read the news. When a company like Slack changes its pricing or Netflix buys a gaming studio, don't just say 'cool.' Force yourself to map out exactly what they are giving up to make that move. What are they deprioritizing? Who are they willing to piss off?\n\n2. The 'Where Not to Play' Rule: Pick a product you use every day. Write down three features they should build, and then force yourself to pick the two they should never touch—and defend why. Strategy shows up in the 'no's.'\n\n3. Paper Trading: Write your logic down. If you don't commit it to paper, your brain will trick you into thinking you 'knew it all along' once the results come in.\n\nForget the lectures. You don't need another framework; you need reps. You need to pressure-test your judgment until the trade-offs start feeling obvious.",

At that point, more feedback increases confidence marginally but delays action materially.\n\n**2) Decision readiness → do we have enough to place a bet?**  \nI anchor on a small set of decision criteria up front (user impact, business impact, risk, reversibility). If additional feedback wouldn’t change the choice against those criteria, we move forward.\n\n**3) Validation → what will we monitor post-decision?**  \nInstead of extending discovery, we shift feedback collection into leading indicators and guardrails after launch.\n\nThis framing has helped reset expectations: the goal isn’t *maximum* feedback, it’s *sufficient* feedback to make a responsible decision and learn forward.\n\nFor future, you could create a decision criteria upfront and then you can use \"We agreed on the decision criteria upfront. At this point, additional feedback isn’t changing how the options score against those criteria.”\n\nHope this is helpful! This is a common topic in PMclub conversations — especially around defining when feedback is directionally sufficient vs. decision-blocking.",

Progressive exposure based on usage tends to outperform big announcements.\n\nWhat backfires most often are full screen announcements and forced walkthroughs. Existing users especially hate being interrupted for something they didn’t ask for, and many will just dismiss it on reflex and never revisit the feature.\n\n“New” badges can work, but only if they decay quickly. If everything is marked new for weeks, users stop seeing them altogether.\n\nIn app release notes are underrated. Not as a primary driver, but as a safe place for curious users to self educate without being pushed.\n\nThe pattern I’ve seen succeed is gentle, contextual, and easy to ignore.

Not fullscreen announcements (people swipe those away in under 2 seconds). Show the hint when users are doing something related, not randomly.\n\nAlso selective emails to existing users worked okay. We did one for a major feature and got decent adoption.

If you truly wanted to optimize for what’s outlined here, your best route is to overly and needlessly nurture relationships with each individual engineer so they give you good marks.  Ultimately this is framing things in a vacuum.  (1) PRD Quality is 99% of the time not the reason why a sprint might go over in my experience - this is not very measurable - how unclear was the PRD? How much exactly did that lack of clarity contribute to the delay? (2) Sprint scope contribution - how close you are with the tech lead? How exactly were your contributions meaningful? It might almost bias you to forcefully contribute when you have no idea what you’re talking about.  (3) Responsiveness - are your notifications on and do your engineers like you. (6) Do your engineers like you\n\n(4,5) These motivate you to overestimate sprints and initiatives.  If you’re only measured by if a sprint has completed, might as well sandbag and get “100% sprint completion and on time delivery” every time.  This also only works well for incredibly mature products which have very far line of sight and deep team understanding.  This would be ridiculous to measure for any greenfield product or at a startup - you don’t know what you don’t know and that’s ok.  Be antifragile and deal with new information properly.  Delays happen, but you should push towards a business result. \n\nAll in all I think the only way to properly measure a PM is by their ability to drive impact.  Have them set an OKR, make sure it’s specific, relevant, and measurable.  Make sure they’re not sand bagging by breaking down assumptions.  And track the teams performance against that OKR.  Ultimately the PM is responsible for the success or failure of a product.  You could be 100% sprint complete for the whole quarter, have the clearest PRD, run scrums like a machine and deliver a failed product - you shouldn’t reward or optimize for this.\n\nI’ve never seen a scorecard system like this before (fintech 2 large cos and 2 startups) and quite frankly think it misses the essence of what a PM is responsible for.",

Everyone will score very highly and then get laid off in the next downcycle.**\n\n**1) waste of time;  \"a shared document is not a shared understanding\"** (Jeff Patton, user story mapping)  \nIndividuals interacting is what matters, not verbose detail.  If you need verbose detail, split the story.  Remember when we used 3x5 index cards?  That constraint was there for a good reason.  Bloated verbose stories NEVER work and always have errors.  Small slicing feels less efficient but has fewer slips, lapses, mistakes and rework.\n\n2) **No such thing as Sprint Scope; you have a Sprint Goal that is based on a (measurable) business outcome,**  Measure that outcome, and use that as the basis for performance.  That's the only thing that matters.  Deliver multiple times within a Sprint to get feedback on your progress towards the goal.  Ruthlessly improve your DveOps and XP practices until that's a reality.   \n  \n**3) waste of time.**  STOP using JIRA as a communication channel.  Talk to each other, a lot.  Involve the developers in user story mapping.  Don't give them solutions to implement.  Written communication is always less effective, with delays and comprehension layers.  If you work is so unsafe you need to CYA, fix that first.   \n  \n**4) Kind of agree on this**;  UAT is your last-line-of-defense as part of your layered \"shift left, build quality in\" mindset.  But it's the whole team here, not the PM - escaped defects bad is a good idea though.  Don't blame the goal keeper because the attackers, midfield and defenders didn't keep control of the ball.   \n  \n**5) utter bollocks.** This is nothing to do with Scrum or effectiveness in the role.  Allowing this kind of bollocks into your org is already a red flag that the SMs are not effective at educating or influencing the org,  Where's the stuff on team learning and growth?  Nah.   \n  \n6) **I like this better** but it really should be something you as a team talk about in your retrospectives, always \n\n**7) \"Post release activities\"  lol.**  \nMeasure the value you created within the Sprint.

He has individual 1:1s with each of us but no regular group sync, and largely expects us to self-organise.\n\nOn day one, he shared a document outlining responsibilities:\n\t•\tSenior PM: strategy and stakeholder relationships\n\t•\tMe: Scrum process and delivery\n\t•\tJunior PM: coordination and release support\n\nI started by running discovery workshops to understand current team practices and then gradually introduced Scrum cadence, with the aim of reducing change fatigue and bringing teams along through retrospectives and workshops.\n\nThe problem is that the other two PMs keep interfering with the areas I am meant to own:\n\n\t•\tThey attend Scrum ceremonies and publicly challenge or derail meetings with questions and suggestions\n\t•\tIn 1:1 conversations, they talk about plans to coach teams on estimation and process\n\t•\tThe senior PM now wants to do a “big bang” presentation telling all teams to follow a strict Scrum process immediately as she is not able to collect meaningful data from current state of Jira. \n\nShe also wants to change how I set up Scrum ceremonies and plans to announce during her presentation instead of discussing with me (this is what she told me). She is not my boss though. We both report to the same director and he told me clearly that each of us were individual contributors with not much overlap in our responsibilities.\n\nTeams are already tired of constant change, and having three PMs pushing different ideas is clearly making things worse. Engagement is dropping.\n\nI’ve directly raised this with both PMs and even revisited the original responsibility document together. They acknowledged it in the moment but continued behaving the same way the following week.\n\nI actually asked my manager about potential overlap during my first week in this company and he said he didn’t see much overlap between us. However, in practice, it feels like a competition over ownership of delivery and process.\n\nI’m UK-based, while my manager, the other PMs, and most teams are offshore. I’m worried about escalating too hard and being seen as “difficult” or as rocking the boat, but the current setup isn’t working and is actively harming delivery.\n\nHow would you handle this?",

Either you’re misjudging the urgency of this effort, you’re misinterpreting the strictness of boundaries between roles, or you are missing other context. \n\n\nDo you have a friend at this job you can talk this through with candidly? Some extremely varied ideas for what might cause this sort of problem, off the top of my head: the manager is expecting to leave soon, and the senior PM will be taking their role; there’s a pending reorg that will totally reshuffle responsibilities; senior PM is a problem everyone ignores; there’s a strategic reason you have to deliver these scrum changes urgently that the senior PM isn’t telling you; manager is actually incompetent and you’ve been hired onto a dysfunctional team; cultural differences between you and the rest of the team mean something is lost in translation. those are some possibilities that all might explain part of why your approach of doing things the “right” way isn’t working and why the others are stepping on your toes, and none of them are necessarily correct. but i think you need to talk to more people and get a better lay of the land in order to proceed. \n\n\nThe senior PM demanding “big bang” scrum because she can’t get data from Jira seems like a big hint, to me. If that senior PM thinks she urgently needs information to deliver to stakeholders, and can’t get that information from Jira, then i can imagine why doing discovery sessions and gradually introducing scrum wouldn’t meet her needs. If you’re accountable for process and delivery, she might think that means helping get her that information in a usable form. I don’t agree with her approach, but I understand why she might get a bit overzealous, if she can’t get what she needs from you or the team right now.",

Basically, I run e-vals using the AI to get a score on different criteria. The tricky part is that if I run these evaluations multiple times, I often get different results each time. For example, one run might flag certain issues and another run will catch a completely different set of issues or give me a different pass rate.\n\nThis leaves me in a weird spot because I’m not sure if I’m actually improving the product or just seeing random variance in the AI’s scoring. Other than running the AI multiple times and averaging the results (or taking a union of all the different failures it spots), I’m not sure how to get a consistent measure.\n\nHas anyone else faced this kind of inconsistency when using AI for evaluation? I’d love to hear if there are smarter ways to stabilize the scores or any best practices to make sure I can trust the results over time. Thanks!",

If you treat the output like a deterministic test, it’ll drive you a bit mad.\n\nA few things that usually help in practice:\n\nFirst, tighten the evaluation prompt way more than feels natural. Explicit rubrics, scoring scales with definitions, and examples of what a “good” vs “bad” answer looks like reduce variance a lot. Vague criteria almost guarantee drift run to run.\n\nSecond, fix everything you can. Temperature as low as possible, same model version, same prompt ordering, same input formatting. Small differences compound more than people expect.\n\nThird, stop thinking of a single run as truth. What tends to work better is treating evals as trend signals. If scores move consistently over time across multiple runs, you’re improving. If they bounce randomly, you probably aren’t. Averaging or majority voting is boring, but effective.\n\nFourth, separate discovery from measurement. Let the model be loose and exploratory when you want to find issues. Then lock down a stricter eval for tracking progress. Mixing those two goals in one judge usually causes confusion.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen eventually accept that AI judges are closer to noisy sensors than unit tests. Once you design around that reality, confidence comes from consistency of direction, not identical scores every run.",

That’s where the noise creeps in.\n\nOn the discovery vs measurement point, think of it like this. In discovery mode, you let the evaluator be opinionated and loose. You ask things like “what’s weak here,” “what feels off,” or “what would confuse a PM.” You expect variance because you’re learning. Those outputs are for insight, not scoring.\n\nMeasurement mode is much narrower. You freeze the criteria and only ask things that can be judged consistently. For example, instead of “is this a good product question,” you score specific dimensions like clarity of prompt, presence of a real tradeoff, and whether there’s enough context to make a decision. Each dimension should be something the evaluator can say yes or no to with minimal interpretation.\n\nIf I were to improve one eval, I’d start by removing any language that asks the model to infer intent or quality holistically. Replace it with concrete checks. Does the question force a prioritization decision. Does it include constraints. Is there a clear failure mode. Those tend to be much more stable run to run.\n\nOnce you separate those two modes, the system usually feels a lot saner. You explore with one prompt, then measure progress with a much stricter, almost boring one.",

          "text": "Senior PM at a mature small company in Insuretech. Our product is very much still growing and developing, but if we did nothing to it for the entirety of 2026 we'd still likely see growth in all of our important metrics. I have an in-house dev team and though I'm not the only PM, I'm predominantly focused on TOF and Acquisition. \n\nLogistically speaking, I work remote from pacific time zone and the company is based in Chicago in central time, though we have people all over the country. Everyone is remote, though we do have office space we periodically go to for team events and such. I've not worked more than an hour or so in an actual office since February 2020. \n\nMy day almost universally starts with a PowerBI dashboard, Trustpilot dashboard, and the nightly sales report. I usually ping the director of customer acquisition (my primary stakeholder) around this time and talk shit about politics or just small talk for a bit. I talk to her more than anyone else at my company. Between that convo and the dashboards, I'm mostly looking to see if there's any weirdness or anything that catches my attention. I'll read the TP reviews and follow-up with customer service folks on previous ones. Lately a lot of my focus has been on a growing trend I'm seeing in our reviews. \n\nAfter that, it's usually reviewing my plans for the day. I (try to) do a weekly \"last week and next week\" type update for some folks that have interest in it, and it's what I use to keep the ball rolling on my end. I'll make a few notes, maybe block some time if I can, and adjust if necessary. \n\nThen it's standup. For me, it's 9:30am but for my team it's basically leading into lunch time so it's where I'll learn if anything screwy is going on in the engineering dimension. If I have to adjust things to change some expectations for stakeholders, this is usually when/where I'm getting that sorted. \n\nAfter standup, things go off the rails and it varies. Some days, especially earlier in the week, it's what I call \"Fallout meetings\"...the meetings that happen as a result of something happening the week prior. They're a mixture of post-mortems, action planning, etc. I try not to commit to more than a few of these a week, and generally avoid committing to anything concrete that I've not already discussed with my boss or engineering. By Wednesday, I'm not rearranging anything anymore....which is maybe why the fallout meetings happen. Whatever. \n\nMid week is usually when I'm doing discovery type stuff. Interviews, reviewing customer behavior data (reviews, reports from customer facing folks, Clarity recordings, testing results, etc), and competitive research....though I do less of that these days now that we've got a great, competent BA. Wednesday and Thursday are typically my busiest scheduled days. Discovery can be super highly regimented, or completely guerilla. Compiling it all is usually the most time consuming bit, so I block time for it when i can.\n\nLate week is finishing up things I started or need done, and getting stuff ready for the next week. This is usually when I'm making tickets and working of prioritization for the next sprint/future sprints. It's also typically when I'm dealing with data and looking at current performance of stuff. I try to do check-ins on various features later in the week too. \n\nSince I'm 2 hours behind my developers, my mornings tend to be dev related while my afternoons tend to be the more independent contributor work like documentation and such. \n\nThe tools I'm using are JIRA and Confluence (immediate prioritization and documentation), Monday (medium/long prioritization and intake), Clarity (Customer insight), PowerBI (reports), Lovable and sometimes Miro, and Claude ever so often. The latter three are usually used during discovery. I treat AI like having an 13 year old intern that can draw pretty well and occasionally write up a skeleton to work from for a new document. They're strictly for internal use and only 2 or 3 people will see their output typically. I take meeting notes in a Rhodia A4 80g notebook and my general notes go in a small A6 sized Tomoe River 68g notebook (I prefer lined, though I use grid pretty often these days). The general notebook goes in a Lochby journal thing where I have individual notebooks for everything in my life. It goes everywhere with me these days and is helpful for those moments when I need to get something noted down while I'm thinking about it. One of my most successful feature launches got more or less planned out on the top of Mount Langley back in July, for instance. I flip between a Kaweco AL Sport and a Lamy AL-star. I use their own branded carts, typically in blue. Most days I take 20mg of Vyvanse and drink decaf, but sometimes I opt for normal coffee if it's not a particularly dense day or I have afternoon plans.\n\nMy standard meetings include: \n\n* Daily Standup with my engineers. On monday, it's a bigger group (we include content and SEO for visibility) but for the rest of the week it's just product, QA, engineering, and one or two more involved stakeholders. 5-15 minutes in the morning.\n\n* Weekly internal product catchup. Product + Design + BA. Sort of like a standup for us. Go over things we're working on, any junctions we might be encountering that'd involve another PM/team/etc. 15 minutes once a week. \n\n* Weekly Contractor Standup. We have a contractor team (I don't interface with them as much) that we do a weekly standup with towards the end of the week. Frequently involves more enterprise level work, though my various requests are included as well. 15-30 minutes a week.\n\n* Weekly Tech/product meeting. Mostly a standing meeting where product, design, and engineering can discuss things. Good time to ask technical \"hey, how does this work?\" or \"Is this idea outside the realm of possibility?\" Also a chance for engineering to float up concerns or tech debt that we need to prioritize. 15-20 minutes a week. \n\n* Content/SEO Update (biweekly). Since most of my feature and product work involves this group, I meet with them every other week so we can discuss ongoing stuff, feature prioritization, etc. Easier to just take 30 minutes with everyone that's relevant than try and sync up ad hoc. 30 minutes every 2 weeks. \n\n* Grooming/Sprint Planning every 2 weeks. I move grooming around a lot just based on needs. Some weeks we'll groom a ton of stuff. Sometimes we skip it entirely. Sprint planning is mostly just \"Here's what Product and Engineering are planning. Anyone got something else they need/want?\"...lasts like 5 minutes typically. \n\n* 1 on 1. Just a standard weekly meeting with my boss. Talk through new stuff, review old, questions, answers, shoot the shit. 30 minutes once a week.\n\nEverything else is pretty ad hoc and as-needed. I do regular meetings with a small group to review a change-log for a feature we built and verify/sanity check things before we update configurations, and there's usually some monthly and quarterlys that happen sometimes.",

Devs work in GitHub, PMs work in Linear, and the \"handshake\" between them (status updates, comments) often lags or breaks.\n\nRegarding AI, Linear’s features are currently mostly \"text polishers\" (rewriting descriptions) rather than actual workflow agents.\n\nIf you are already heavy on GitHub, have you considered just sticking to **GitHub Projects**? It has zero learning curve for devs. We actually moved *away* from Linear back to GitHub for this reason, and are building a custom layer (Draftlog) just to handle the \"AI/Docs\" part on top of it.\n\nSometimes the best integration is just not having a separate tool at all.",
