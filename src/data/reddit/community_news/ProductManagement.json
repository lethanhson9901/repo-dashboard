For a lot of us, you have to really force \"the PM lifestyle\" on your company if that's what you want. This is especially the case once you get out of tech companies and into other industries. Hell, I find it preferrable to PM in an environment where I'm supporting/enabling the core business....but not actually being the core business. It gives me room to think about problems and address them properly, without also destroying my life. Companies pay handsomely for people to make it easier for them to do their core business. When someone makes $10B a year selling something, making that 10% more efficient is SUPER valuable and waaaaay easier then trying to figure out how to make their flagship product 10% more valuable/better.",

Switch to a place that uses the PM title but actually means project manager, product owner, etc. The smaller the company the more hats you have to wear and PMs (good ones) have to wear more hats than most other roles. Some companies do ask PMs to cover too much ground as a company is growing, though. If that's you, you may simply be understaffed or need to hire dedicated Product Marketing, or simply focus the company's priorities better. But guess what, that realization and advocacy for fixing it is ALSO your job. 😅 Welcome to being a leader. It can never be just a job. But you may be confusing an impossible amount of work with focusing on the work that matters.",

There was this internal conflict. \n\nIt’s hard for a PM to just be a job imo. It’s not tasked based and theres always something on the horizon. That said, I feel like the best thing to do is drawing boundaries and accepting that boundary for yourself no matter what other PMs are doing. \n\nNot sure how helpful this is.

I’m back to being an SE, same company for the last 6 years with the same pay, don’t have to grind trying to figure out the product for the next year at a new job. I can rebound from the burnout. I think I was good at the SE roles, going back to SE has been great, I can do this job in my sleep\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Just to follow up since this is getting a good amount of views for being this deep into the comments. I wish I had seen such a comment so that it didn't feel like I was taking a step back.\n\nI had been thinking about doing this move for 2+ years, but my own ego wouldn't let me tell myself that I needed to move back down into a \"sales\" role. \n\nI always hated that I was just in \"sales\". I hated that I grew up poor and I was just a community college dropout. Even though I had worked at some amazing companies, and made it to a FAANG, and quit on my own accord. \n\nI still always felt that I needed to be more than just a \"sales\" person. I always got great feed back, and constantly put on high priority projects, did the extras, and I was always one of the most technical SEs anywhere I went. \n\nOne day I just finally said it out loud to myself. \"I need to go back to being an SE.\" Which turned into thinking about the SEs I work with, and there are great one and there are bad ones. I don't look down on the good ones, so why am I thinking of this as a backwards step. \n\nI started looking at other companies, and got an offer nearly immediately. I told my current company that I was putting in my two weeks. They were shocked, and pretty much offered me anything I wanted, even got a small pay bump, and 6 month ramp up, so guaranteed OTE paid out monthly instead of quarterly. With a better upside to make even more money with hitting my quota.\n\nMoral of the story; do what you think will make you happy, you may end up getting a better outcome than you envisioned.",

What you see are features becoming less important and then prioritized again in light of the restriction. If the “but it must be in” really is that important- then it would bump above the other “must haves”. With a time restriction you have to become ruthless with scope to decide what actually is important and worth spending time on. Now with AI, the pressure to release even quicker compounds the PMs thought process because it “appears so easy to build now”, but that does not inherently make this better or usable.\n\nIf they don’t have restrictions, then scope becomes an elastic band of “just one more thing”. This also becomes highlighted of the dev team don’t have a good liaison to help say “ that’s too large - decide what you want, feature A or B or A and C”. ",

How can the PM think of this sooner.  I get this approach. Makes sense.\n\n\nMight I offer one perspective to simply lean into this.  What if you leaned into the way they do the work?  Is it thorough and do they deliver?  Can you as their leader coach the org and stakeholders to adapt to an \"agile\" and \"continuous discovery\" way of doing things?  Some orgs do. Why not yours?\n\n\nI've been in positions where i can work with UX, thoroughly have something designed out. Write out stories to perfection (some devs love it). Devs validate, perhaps come back with a few little things but usually I've thought of everything at that point.\n\n\nI've also been in positions where i get it close enough and just throw it into a sprint and we work in through. Definitely more backend processes, new APIs and such just made it easier.  Perhaps a dev needs to really think something through or once they get into something then they learn.\n\n\nHonestly I think the later is better for software development even though I have more control over the thorough preparation process.  I think everyone thinks they want so much preparation and everything is thought out but software development feels smoother when you prepare enough, have \"enough\" thought but you simply go and move.  I find it reduces unnecessary scope and keeps the team thinking in smaller delivery.\n\n\nBut orgs hate that and want to burden you will all the bureaucracy.  But I'd consider coaching the org to embrace the faster more agile, last minute approach.  Smaller faster delivery IMO works better because it's just hard to properly think everything through until a few people can just dive into it.\n\n\nThis is what scrum is SUPPOSED to be btw but no one hardly ever does it",

Documenting in this way allows you to virtually walk through the use of the system and determine what information is needed for the user to achieve their task and what the system will need to do in response to user input. If you have a strong UCD or UX team, you can create wireframes or prototypes at a good-enough fidelity to walk through your use cases and understand if you're missing anything.

The coaching conversations should be as soon as possible after the requirement emerges.\n\n\nStart the conversation by clearly stating your expectations, how this scenario didn't meet them, and what the impacts are.\nGet their side of the story.\n\n\nEstablish the root cause together - work out why the gap emerged. E.g. if it was a compliance gap, were compliance engaged at all? Was it the right person engaged? Did they understand what they were signing up for? Etc\n\n\nThen, have a coaching discussion framed around \"what can we do differently next time to ensure this doesn't happen again\".\nYour role is not to tell them what to do, but to coach them towards deciding for themselves what they need to do differently next time.\nYou need to come out of the conversation with a specific action that they've agreed they'll do in the future, and that you agree will prevent similar classes of problems happening in future. The action should never be \"I'll try harder\".\n\n\nDocument what they've agreed to do next time (in writing). \n\n\nIf they do it consistently, the level of similar gaps should reduce over time as you go through a few of these conversations on different misses and agree on actions / frameworks to prevent them in future.\n\n\nIf they don't do what they've agreed to, move on to formal performance management / PIP etc.",

I'd still say I'm pretty green as a PM compared to some OGs, but my first 6 years were a joy vs the last 5 (though my current role has been the best one post-pandemic). Sometimes I wonder if it's because I was more junior and naive back then, but at the same time every company seemed to buy into the growth at all costs philosophy during/after the pandemic.\n\nIn my experience, this has turned a lot of tech into extreme top-down strategy orgs with very short sighted in roadmap construction (initial investors/founders wanting to cash out quickly). That's not conducive to building products with staying power. Product may not be able to predict waves, but a lot of our ability to steady the ship has been stripped.",

Right after that, SVPG wrote about the product coaching and AI. \n\nAnd then I heard a podcast with Boris Cherny (the Claude Code creator) where he basically said coding is probably solved now, so engineers should spend more time doing product work like talking to customers and validating hypotheses.\n\nThis topic is super hot right now, but in my experience it feels more like a process or skill problem than a tool problem. A lot of what people want seems like it could already be done with Cursor (or other AI tools). \n\nI’ve even built a few tools around this myself, but I’m not sure it’s actually a common enough pain to build yet another “PM copilot”.\n\nIs this a real unmet need, or just hype catching up to what’s already possible?",

Couple that with massive AI slop coming from all fronts, it can make a PM overwhelmed.\n\nPMs + engineers could technically build this as a tool in-house, with integrations that work with apps they currently use. While I understand that some teams may lack these resources and may be willing to pay for an external solution (\"PM copilots\"), I have a feeling that this may lead to more overheads, and eventually a race to the bottom.\n\nTons of PM influencers have jumped on this bandwagon, calling it PM copilot/PM OS and generating needlessly complicated setups. This is just hype in my opinion. More often than not, it is a shill to sign up for their course on Maven, or subscribe to their newsletter on substack by generating FOMO.",

Then I realized those were costing me context and often weren't worth it, so I culled the list and landed on a relatively simple system where the backlog in Linear just linked to markdown spec files in the repo, and most of the work happened from web fetch or reading the local files.\n\nI slowly organized a structure around industry references, customer comments, interview transcripts, and backlog ideas. From there I just asked Claude Code questions and guided it to certain areas of that md structure.\n\nAs things grew, I realized that it was hard to query without sending agents on a context burning goose chase. Long story long, I realized that structured artifacts were the key: one pagers from interviews, key insights in a normalized format (with citations to original sources from the messy world), summaries of the competitive landscape with differentiation points, and even a structure for the feature specs themselves. This lends itself well to a proper tool with a database, but the interface is still ideally an agent. So now I have a set of repeatable workflows with structured outputs that store to a database that holds all the structured data. Then I prompt Claude Code to talk to it via my MCP server. Building all this took a long time, so I'm wondering if that is a useful product: a product specific artifact generation and storage platform that existing agents can read from and even trigger via MCP.\n\nWhen we're prototyping things with agents, there are often a lot of decisions to be made, and it's actually kind of handy to give the agent tools like \"query_customer_insights\" and \"find_evidence_for_assumption\".\n\nAt the end of the day I feel like my biggest problem is still \"how valuable is this thing I'm prototyping to my customers?\" and the answer to that question isn't super helpful if it's just an LLM's hot take without any way to compare more than one option.\n\nAnyone else out there feeling this one?",

It’s a signal-to-noise problem. The real bottleneck is that raw thinking is expensive to turn into something other people or even ourselves can act on. If you could dump messy thoughts frequently and have them structured into whatever format your engineers or stakeholders need that changes the game more than another PRD template or “PM copilot.”\nMost of the AI-for-PM tools I’ve seen are solving the artifact problem (better docs, better specs).

Mostly what has happened is that PMs are moving away from things like PRDs and towards things like prototypes.  In some shops, PMs are expected to be able to take an idea all the way to prototype before bringing it to eng.  Smaller organizations are more aggressive, of course, but we are seeing that feature teams are getting smaller as AI allows them to ship more code faster.\n\nClaude code is one of the more popular choices but we saw Gemini, ChatGPT and others being used actively.\n\n",

I’ve been building a side project that integrates with existing SaaS stacks and provides some extra analysis/automation layers on top, but in a lot of instances even that could be building a new house on a bad foundation. Layering tools on top of other tools is rarely sustainable, but I would like to get it to where it’s an extra layer that functionally hides the bloat of the lower layers. In my testing so far, it’s been useful for some workflows, but I’m still early on it. \n\nIn terms of strategic decisions/coaching, I think I’m just generally weary of offloading any deeply human skills to AI. It’s useful for gathering, sorting, analyzing, etc, but I would still always want to get raw outputs from it and then layer in my experience/intuition/style to actually move forward with something. \n\nMy other hesitation is just that the PM function is going to look dramatically different in a year, 3yrs, etc. Our traditional inputs, workflows, and outputs are likely going to be totally different in the near future.",

It's that product context is inherently team-level, but every AI workflow today is built for an individual. Claude/Cursor/MCP setups are great for the PM who built them - but that context doesn't live anywhere the rest of the team can access or build on.\n\n\n\nSo you end up with this situation: one PM has a sophisticated Claude setup that knows the product inside out. Another PM on the same team starts fresh every conversation. An engineer wants to understand a decision from 3 weeks ago - there's no trail. A new joiner tries to get up to speed - they're reading stale Confluence docs.\n\n\n\nThe real gap isn't individual AI productivity. It's that product knowledge doesn't persist at the team level.\n\n\n\nThe teams that figure this out aren't building another copilot. They're thinking about it more like infrastructure: where does product context live, who can query it, how does it stay current when specs change or decisions get made in Slack?\n\n\n\nThat's a harder problem than PRD generation, but it's also the one worth solving. Individual AI workflows will commoditize fast. Shared, persistent product memory that the whole team can rely on - that's actually differentiated.",

It’s lack of structured gating.\n\nWhat’s interesting to me is not “PM copilots,” but tools that:\n\n* Force hypothesis clarity\n* Define measurable success criteria\n* Validate data readiness\n* Compare rule-based vs ML baselines\n* Make ROI explicit before engineering starts\n\nThat’s less about generative assistance and more about decision infrastructure.\n\nCursor can help you write a PRD.  \nIt doesn’t tell you whether the project should exist.\n\nI’m curious how many people here have seen AI/ML projects fail not because the model was bad — but because the problem wasn’t well defined or economically justified?\n\nIf that failure mode is common, then this category is real.  \nIf not, it’s probably hype.\n\nWould love to hear others’ experiences.",

Then, make sure to provide a template of the output you want. \n\nI’m not hosting thing on cloud, so I have to turn on my laptop to run it in the morning or anytime I want really. It will do a lot of internet research so it will take a while. \n\nSome important tip is, I always keep a record of the last few output so that it doesn’t show me things I’ve already known. \n\nYou don’t have to use Claude.

This will include coding prototypes and maybe shipping code on occasion. \n\nBut I think it's less about being able to code in prod as much as 10x what you can do with your effort. \n\nI started working with an agentic terminal tool a few days ago. It was incredible. It was like working with a very different form of computing. \n\nThe right tool can query different systems, create content and spar ideas with you. You get ideas for the spec, work on them together and then it creates a draft that you refine together. \n\nIt allows you to complete tasks faster and parallelize them. \n\nSo, what might the future look like? \n\nYou are tasked with solving a problem. You get your agent system to contact twenty customers to book interviews. Three accept overnight and it sorts out scheduling. \n\nYou work together on how the structure of the interview will go. You talk to the customers and it collects the transcripts and recordings and then three more are booked overnight. \n\nYou update the interview structure with the subsequent calls and a few more come in from your first contacts. \n\nYou revise the findings together and align on the implications for what you need to build. You figure out the structure of a report and ask it to write in your style. \n\nYou proofread, update the introduction, conclusion and a few other sections and then share with the team. \n\nYou have a workshop to look at how you might solve the problem. You all code up prototypes (designers, engineers and product) and use your design system so it looks pretty good. You work together discussing options and have agents explore the code to figure out where feasibility is tough.\n\nThe meeting is recorded and your agents share relevant ideas you explored. The PM shares a meeting summary that pulls from all relevant sources and presents options, challenges and next steps. \n\nEngineers spend a few hours spiking and a direction is quickly found. Now the team focuses on the key UX challenges that weren't considered and the architectural approach. \n\nI think this is very likely to happen. \n\nThe key differences is that people are guiding AI, much like our search guides Google, but at a higher level of abstraction. \n\nThis will also require smart humans. You need higher order thinking to guide the AI effectively and need to be able to think broadly and a few steps ahead. \n\nIt will also be more technical but I don't see everyone just coding everything. It's more than that.",

They call them Hotspots and there are a lot of them now.\n\nThis feels like the kind of request most teams see and keep saying no to because it doesn’t really fit the model. Delivery systems are usually built around validated addresses, density, and repeatable logistics. Random outdoor locations are kind of the opposite of that.\n\nBuilding something like this probably means stepping outside the optimized flow most teams spend years refining. It’s not the cleanest thing to support operationally, and it doesn’t scale the same way as the core use case.\n\nBut it does let them handle situations most delivery products aren’t designed for.\n\nIt made me think about how often “edge cases” show up like this. Not impossible, just awkward enough that they never get prioritized because they don’t match how the system is supposed to work.\n\nCurious how others think about this. Would you build for it or keep saying no?",

We record coordinates and any addresses inputted are translated into coordinates before they're plotted and stored.\n\nIn my mind this is just creative thinking and taking advantage of low-hanging fruit. Effort wise, this probably is < sprint of work and wouldn't be more than a small enhancement on the roadmap.\n\nSo, Yes - always say yes to low-hanging fruit that is cheap from a dev standpoint.

They can deliver it next door or on the street and still be within the “footprint” of the delivery to avoid being caught by automatic comparisons with the delivery pin. \n\nDomino’s likely already using GPS for home deliveries for similar reasons and just decided to expose that and introduce it as a new feature. ",

Hell, I think that Domino's might be one of our clients (it is a business with thousands of clients).\n\nLots of data providers sell address data + geocodes for each address. Companies like Domino's usually use the address as entry key for validating the order, but the delivery itself is done by geocodes. Historically, this type of customers,  requested we return lat/long centroid (center of roof) coordinates. Now more and more want front-door geo coordinates (lat/long).\n\nDownstream, the delivery guys just dump the lat/long into google maps and it takes them wherever they need.\n\nMy point is, using lat/long is nothing new for Domino's. Expanding the use case is probably as difficult as making a UI that allow consumer selecting a pin in a map. \n\nProbably in the backend some validation is performed to confirm the lat/long is in a given area. This validation is easy as it is math operation. They just check if lat/longs are within given ranges and not within others.",

The problem is not the time in Slack per se, it is that Slack was designed for communication, not for storing and surfacing information. When it becomes both, the only way to stay informed is to be always-on in every channel.\n\n\n\nWhat I have seen help teams actually cut this down:\n\n\n\nFirst, make a real distinction between channels that are for real-time conversation and channels that are basically async mailing lists. If you are in both types and treating them the same, you will feel like you need to read everything immediately even if most of it does not require a response from you.\n\n\n\nSecond, the updates you are consuming in Slack are usually a symptom of something else: there is no other place where a reliable summary of what happened lives. If your team had a lightweight end-of-day digest in Confluence or even a pinned Slack message per project that got updated a few times a week, you would not need to read through 200 messages to figure out if anything relevant happened. Someone has to own creating that, and it is usually the PM by default.\n\n\n\nThird, context-moving from point A to point B is often a sign that two teams or functions are not talking directly. If you are a relay station for information, the fix is usually not efficiency but structure. Who should be in the same channel? Who should have read access to what? The moving-knowledge-around work disappears when the right people can see the right information directly.\n\n\n\nThe nitty gritty question is a good one to keep asking. Not all of it is avoidable, but a big chunk of it is friction that accumulated without anyone deciding it should work that way.",

This isn't just something I'm getting; it's used in many places, but it's getting to the point where my job is at risk because leadership buys into it. Makes for a great tool when the management method is finding someone to blame. \n\nI've been doing this 8 years now, 4 with this company, and haven't had this problem before. I tend to try to partner with the devs and protect them from the business but that doesn't work when i have to dodge the busses they're trying to throw me under. \n\nIf I get adversarial then it will be even harder to get anything done and I don't want to foster that kind of environment. But I'm not sure what else to do. My boss says to let them stumble but he also buys into it so I don't believe he'll back me up if I did that. \n\nThoughts?

I recently started a new role (with my existing job), and I'm finding it tough to manage burnout, excessive meetings, and the constant demands from people on remote teams.\n\nA bit of background: My team is quite inexperienced, and only 2 out of 10 people on my team are based in the same office as me. I spend about 70% of my week in meetings, which creates two big issues:\n\n1.      It destroys my ability to focus and actually get things done because I'm constantly moving between meetings and can't give people the attention they need to get up to speed. I cannot think.\n\n2.      Since my teammates haven't been able to get up to speed (not blaming them—they're new to the company and area), things only get done when I jump in and do them myself.\n\nThe area of the business we're in is difficult and full of jargon. I've been with the company for eight years, so I know how to navigate it, but most of the others don't.\n\nI'm wondering: How do others deal with meeting fatigue and remote work fatigue in other companies?\n\nI'm a very personable, in-person kind of person—I like to explain things with whiteboards and face-to-face conversations. I really dislike this fragmented, remote world. I had eight hours of back to back Teams meeting Tuesday, and genuinely think it made me sick.\n\nAny tips or experiences that could help would be much appreciated!

Default meeting time is 30mins. Most things can be done in that time. Doesn’t mean you can’t have a longer one where it makes sense but helps keep the meeting focussed and productive. \n2. Every meeting has an agenda, goal or format. \n3. Every 6 months have a company wide meeting free week. This helped force a reset and remind people how to work without having a meeting. \n4. This sounds counterintuitive but having a regular fixed meeting for some things helped reduce additional meetings. \n5. Having some meetings cameras off helped with the zoom fatigue. Looking at yourself is way more exhausting than in person meetings. We made cameras optional for all tech team meetings. \n6. Slack updates - move update style meetings to slack instead where appropriate. We created channels for projects where anyone who was interested could follow along and save attending a meeting each week. Helpful if there’s a lot of projects that you want / need to stay across. \n7. Train team how to work async. For people who prefer verbally explaining or want to show and tell, get them to record a loom or a video and share it. Help team learn how to improve their communication to make meetings unnecessary or at least run better. \n8. Have a good repository of info (I like notion) that is accessible to everyone. Have everything documented in there which everyone can access helps keep everyone on the same page and can self serve info. This includes a jargon / acronyms directory.",

Creating a little friction can go a long way sometimes. \n\nFor slack we had different channels so everything stayed focussed to a specific project. And used naming conventions to keep them organised. So #project-project name. And then folks used threads to keep things organised nicely within each. So you could skim the major updates and when there was one you needed more context on you could click to the thread to see more info. We also encouraged tagging of people and never expected anyone to stay across everything unless they were tagged in it. So you could mute channels and just get notified when/if they needed your eyes or input. \n\nMeeting free was always wonderful. We had a strong remote first culture so most people were experienced working async and appreciated the extra time in their calendars to think and get stuff done. As part of each one all meeting organisers and leaders were encouraged to review all their meetings and cancel any that no longer felt necessary permanently which free’d up time. \n\nAdditionally attendance at meetings was never enforced. You could always say no if it didn’t feel like you needed to be there. And there was no pressure to say no, just an expectation that you’d decline the invite so people knew not to expect you. For important meetings these would be recorded and transcripts shared incase anyone couldn’t make it or simply preferred to just skim the transcript. \n\nA lot of this was driven top down which helped obviously, but we also had a strong culture of if you could demonstrate a better way of working, folks were always onboard to listen and try it. \n\nAt the end of the day, less meetings is generally better for everyone. Sometimes you just need to show people the impact it can have to convince them.",

To address that you have to forget about people and start with the \"work\". What is the job to do and what outcomes do you need. Once you clarify what the work is, you can define the job. Once you define the job you can work out if the people currently doing the job have the right skills. Sounds harsh, but this is a cold reality.\n\nIf you do that and discover that you have the right skills for the work, then you have to go up the chain and assess the strategy, both technical and propositional. If the strategy is causing the issue, then you have a leadership skills issue. If it's a technical issue, then you probably have a budget problem, because technical usually means some level of investment is required.\n\nGood luck",

          "text": "A few things that actually help with this, from experience:\n\n\n\nThe core problem isn't too many meetings - it's that meetings are doing the wrong job. When a team is new and context-light (your words), meetings become the primary mechanism for transferring knowledge that should live in written form. Every sync reconstructs what happened last week because it's not written down anywhere reliable. So the fix isn't necessarily fewer meetings - it's making meetings no longer necessary for people to stay informed.\n\n\n\nPractical things that reduce meeting load without abandoning the team:\n\n\n\n1. Weekly written update, 5 bullets max. What got decided, what's blocked, what changed. You write it, they read it. This alone can eliminate a 1hr sync per week because people arrive with context instead of needing to be briefed.\n\n\n\n2. Distinguish between meetings that require real-time input vs. ones that are just status. Status meetings are almost always replaceable with async. Decision meetings often aren't. If you audit your 70% of week, I'd guess a majority are status or handoff, not genuine decision-making.\n\n\n\n3. When you jump in and do things yourself, document the process after. You're carrying tribal knowledge. Every time you do the thing for someone, add one line to a doc explaining why + how. This compounds - within a few months your team gets up to speed faster because the context is accessible rather than living only in your head.\n\n\n\n4. Protect 2-3 hour focus blocks on your calendar explicitly. Not as \"busy\" - as named blocks (e.g., \"Deep Work: Roadmap\"). People will fill whatever unblocked time you have with meetings. Visible blocks communicate that your calendar isn't a free-for-all.\n\n\n\nOn the in-person vs. remote friction: what you're feeling is real. But I'd reframe it slightly - it's not that remote is inherently worse, it's that remote requires more intentional information architecture to work. The whiteboard and face-to-face conversations encode context extremely efficiently. Remote doesn't have that natural channel, so you have to build the equivalent deliberately.",

When your team sees one another in the hallway this rarely happens. \"Oh! Shoot, I forgot to tell you,\" doesn't happen in Slack, or email, because your nervous system treats them as \"shit to do\" (annoyance) rather than actual humans that walk the earth and relate to one another.\n\nAnyhow.

Their title will be product manager, credit cards or product manager, transaction account.

The Director/VP reports to the Head of Product/General Manager who looks after a full domain eg everyday banking, mortgages or consumer finance. \n\nThis is the standard structure for banks globally.

I am currently in the middle of a beta for my first 0-to-1 product, and it's a niche problem space/user. From day one I have told leadership I don't expect this to be a money maker, based on market pricing and the fact that it’s not necessarily netting us new users, but I do expect it to be popular with our existing customer base, and after a slow ramp up, be a steady stream of income. \n\nOur leadership team, in the meantime, expects this to be a huge money maker, and heads are about to roll as they realize their price point and market sizing are way off. Even though I have documentation of my initial expectations that I had shared, I was put in a position where I was told to just build and \"stop complaining\" (aka asking to run a pricing study with marketing and revisit market sizing), and I worry that is going to come bite me in the ass. \n\nHow do you all handle when leadership operates under incorrect assumptions about your product space, and it causes issues?

Building it was nonnegotiable, but when I did my due diligence and built the business case, I learned that my price point was much lower because what I am building is usually a feature add-on for other tools, but they were looking at it as though it was the main functionality these tools served. So think looking at the cost of the Microsoft suite and assuming that the entire price is based on the value of Outlook.\n\nI tried to address that disconnect, but was told the price was not my concern. So what I did was just document a compare/contrast feature analysis between what we are building + what the competitors who served as the basis for the price point have, trying to clearly outline the discrepancy and left it there.\n\nMy concern is that it is point 3, and there has been an unsaid expectation that we just build for feature parity, which would have been undoable on our time frame.

You called the shot early, got told to shut up and build, and now the thing you predicted is playing out exactly how you said it would. That's frustrating as hell.\n\nBut you're actually in a better position than you think. You have documentation. Most PMs in your situation don't have receipts. You do. So let's talk about what to do with them.\n\nDon't go in with \"I told you so\" energy. The second you make leadership feel stupid, you lose. Even if you're right. Especially if you're right. To put your PM hat on, what is the deeper \"customer motivation\" driving these leader's actions? (They need to drive a narrative with the board) More than likely, the leadership made some pitch to the board and that's the resistance your facing. \n\nSo, help fix that narrative: reframe the conversation around what's next, not what went wrong. Before your next leadership touchpoint, write up a one-pager: here's what the beta is telling us, here's where our assumptions were off, and here's 2-3 options for how we adjust (pricing changes, repositioning to existing customers, narrowing the target segment, whatever makes sense) AND your personal recommendation. Walk in with that and then you're not the PM who's complaining again. You're the PM who saw reality first and came with a plan.\n\nGet ahead of the narrative before heads start rolling. If you wait for leadership to come to you with \"why isn't this working,\" you're playing defense. Go to your boss proactively with what you're seeing, what the data says, and your recommendation. You want to be the person who saw it coming and brought solutions.\n\nThe honest truth is, sometimes you do everything right and still end up in a tough spot because leadership made bad assumptions. But the PMs who survive are the ones who drive the narrative on the way in and on the way out.\n\nWhat does your relationship with your direct manager look like? That's gonna determine a lot of how you play this.",

We realized we were treating surveys like static data collection instead of a user flow, and we had no visibility into where people were actually dropping.\n\nSo we changed how we approached surveys:\n\n1. **No grids or matrices.** Asking someone on mobile to rate multiple items on a scale in one screen created instant friction. We broke questions into single-focus, tap-friendly steps.\n2. **Per-question drop-off tracking.** We started analyzing surveys like funnels instead of forms. We used a form tool with per-question drop-off (dotForm in our case), which made it obvious that one demographic question (company size) was causing most abandonment. Making it optional improved completion immediately.\n\nThe main takeaway for me as a PM was that feedback collection itself has UX and funnel dynamics. We spend a lot of time optimizing product journeys but often treat surveys as neutral instruments, when they’re really another experience with friction points.\n\nCurious how others here approach this:  \nDo you instrument surveys to see where users drop, or rely more on session recordings / qualitative signals to diagnose survey friction?",

To show how your skills are a fit for their need.  \n  \nProblem is that this takes hours for each application, always with the risk that it still gets rejected.\n\nBut I’m also into vibe coding, and experimenting, so figured why not try to build a tool that helps with creating such a value-first application much more efficiently.\n\nSo I built 0job1 to make that workflow faster and more repeatable. The tool generates:\n\n* A company briefing memo to give strategic context\n* A fit analysis (applicant CV to job description)\n* OKR-style role playback\n* 6 use-case ideas mapped to 3 KRs (2 per KR)\n* Video recording flow, to record a pitch video of yourself\n* tailored CV + cover letter\n* outreach message with links\n* free integration with a separate job-tracking CRM I built\n\nImportant caveat: presentation + prototype are still built outside the tool (e.g. Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Claude Code, Codex), then added back via URL/file upload.\n\nIf you want to try it:  \n[https://0job1.com](https://0job1.com/)\n\nEveryone gets 1 free run.  \nIf you do a run and fill this feedback form, I’ll give you 10 additional free runs:  \n[https://tally.so/r/kdYRN1](https://tally.so/r/kdYRN1)  \n  \nI’m building this in public and would really value blunt feedback.",

          "text": "I've just released an app that I built to solve my own needs as product founder - it connects to Help Scout, Intercom, Zendesk; ingests your customer support conversations and context, and then creates bug reports and feature requests (and general trends) from them that are all grouped together, de-duplicated, summarized, and automatically prioritized based on your product context and goals. Then it's a one-click publish to Linear, or Github Issues (for smaller teams).\n\nIt's changed my workflow entirely for how I run my own SaaS businesses, I know this sort of tool exists on an enterprise level but I think the smaller market doesn't have a good tool like this yet, so I'm really excited to see how it works!!\n\nThe app is Jetson: https://jetson.help/\n\nWe have a free audit tool if you want to plug your support data in and get an idea of all the bugs/features/insights we find from the past 30 days :) \n\nWould love any feedback!! Happy to hop on a demo and give an extended free trial to anyone who DMs me :)",

          "text": "We built a form and survey tool focused on product workflows (dotform)\n\nMost form tools we tried were built for marketing or generic data collection. For PM use cases like PRD intake, user research or feedback loops, we kept running into the same issues: messy inputs, no per-step drop-off visibility and hard to map responses into product docs.\n\nSo we started using dotform internally to structure things like:  \n– PRD intake from stakeholders  \n– feature request funnels  \n– user feedback surveys  \n– research screeners\n\nWhat made the biggest difference for us was per-question abandonment tracking. We could see exactly where stakeholders or users dropped and fix the friction, similar to funnel analytics.\n\nThere’s a free tier if anyone wants to try it for PM workflows: [https://dotform.app/](https://dotform.app/)\n\nWould genuinely love feedback from other PMs on how you’re structuring inputs before docs or research synthesis.",
