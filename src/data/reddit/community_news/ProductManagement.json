I used to play guitar, do photography, all kinds of new fun hobbies. Since starting as a PM though I never have the energy to. I get home from work, maybe do a workout, and then do nothing until I sleep. Anyone else have strategies for not exhausting your brain?",

For me the worst part isn't any single new system or tool - it's the constant context switching.\n\n  \nIn a typical day I'll go from a customer escalation thread (need to understand their setup, their history, what they've already tried) to a roadmap planning meeting (completely different mental model, different stakeholders, different time horizon) to reviewing a spec (switch to technical context, edge cases, implementation details). Every transition means rebuilding my working memory from scratch.\n\n  \nBy 4pm my brain is just... done. Not because any individual thing was hard but because I switched contexts 15 times and each switch costs more energy than the actual work.\n\n  \nThe only thing that's helped is aggressively batching similar work together. All customer-related stuff in the morning, all strategy stuff after lunch, all reviews in the late afternoon. Doesn't always work but on days I can pull it off the fatigue is noticeably better.",

          "text": "Full agreement on this full thread. I also happen to work in a company that is being aggressive ( but thoughtful) about AI adoption.   Here are a few things I’ve learned/ implemented that helped lower the cognitive load day to day. Mostly it’s personal product operations automation.  1-3 will help anywhere. #4 is only if you work with 1/2 decent org. \n\n1. I have a ‘chief of staff’ agent that lets me mostly ignore slack most of the day.  This will summarize conversations with the things I need to know AND track action items/key discussion points from the Gemini notes.  The end result is I get to mostly ignore slack. The only notifications I get are from my Eng team or an aggressively curated list of VIPS.  Any action items or responses then come into #2. \n\n2. Using AI to write my prompts to speed up context switching/ getting things out of my head. . This alone helps with any document writing. Then combine with voice to text brain dumping and something like Glean that has had at least a few months of training against company docs speeds up ANY writing INCLUDING pre-reads and memos briefing. Context. Which are huge in my company. \n\n3. The Faux meeting. Hour to 90 min meetings titled as one of the features I’m working on.  Makes it looks like my calendar is booked. This forces people to slack me about little shit or meetings that should have been a slack. Which means it gets caught in #1. \n\n4. Fully empowering my staff and senior engineers. These people are FULL briefed by me and UX about all the context. It means most of the time, they can tackle 80-90% of the issues. Come up with a solution and then walk me through it. I get to provide feedback rather the do all the thinking.   It takes time to build the trust but these are skilled professionals. Once they understand the context, they mostly make right choices and just need confirmation.  I have worked places where this would not be viable, which.. sucks so much.",

Basic, but genuinely just works!\n* **Learning can often be a hidden form of procrastination.** So it’s worth asking yourself honestly: *Is what I’m doing truly helping me grow, or is it just consuming time without moving me forward?*\n\nI know it all sounds ridiculously simple, but in my experience it works in about 90% of cases.",

Here's another angle you might need to watch out for.\" etc. (AI as a thinking partner)\n\nMy curious nature: follows the white rabbit down the rabbit hole (cognitive drift).\n\nMy tip, if I can even call it that, is to trust my instincts more and/or listen to the voice of reason in my head that says, \"psychedelic singing flowers, smoking caterpillars, and merry unbirthdays\" are a waste of time. (do the work I was trying to, at least experimentally, offload)\n\nI think the trap might be that better prompting, more context, would produce better results.\n\nPreemptively I should go back to my trusted whiteboard and work things out for myself - to trust my experience and system knowledge. (move AI more downstream, into a less trusting role)\n\nThere isn't a single one thing I've used AI to do that didn't fall into this category. (analysis, coding, strategy, discovery, planning, measurement, optimization)\n\nNow, when I do turn to AI, it's very limited: specific work/tasks that has a clear outcome (like organizing data, writing a short reply, debating small scoped/risk ideas). Even then it has a tendency to assume.\n\nI have found that it does help me refresh my memory about frameworks and references that have slipped my memory and sketch out rough ideas that I then force myself to diverge on my own or validate with real people.

          "text": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital product management, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and content creation has birthed a new paradigm of though leadership. \n\nAs we pivot toward a more automated future, the discourse surrounding \"AI slop\" highlights a critical inflection point for PM leaders and stakeholders alike. We must leverage synergistic frameworks to ensure that our high-frequency outputs remain aligned with core user personas and value propositions.\n\nThe recent observation of Aakash Gupta’s content strategy—producing roughly 10,000 words in a mere 30-minute window—serves as a masterclass in scalable operational efficiency. From a product perspective, this isn't just \"slop\"; it’s an MVP (Minimum Viable Post) iteration cycle. By utilizing generative models to provide \"takes\" on viral trends, creators are essentially performing real-time A/B testing on audience engagement. This \"spray and pray\" methodology is, in many ways, an agile approach to capturing the attention economy.\n\nKey Pillars of the Automated PM Strategy\n\nVelocity as a Feature: In a saturated market, speed is often the ultimate differentiator.\n\nBeing the first to comment on a trend—even via an AI-generated quote—allows for maximum visibility within the algorithm’s honeymoon period.\n\nData-Driven Iteration: By generating 10+ quotes in a row, creators can analyze which specific \"hooks\" or \"takes\" resonate with the target demographic, allowing for a pivot in the next batch of content.\n\nContent Arbitrage: Taking a viral post and expanding it by 400-800 words is a form of value-add that rewards the consumer with depth (or the illusion of it) while minimizing the creator's overhead.\n\n\"True disruption occurs when the cost of production drops to near-zero, while the perceived value remains high enough to trigger a click.\" — Anonymous PM Visionary\n\nHowever, we must remain cognizant of the signal-to-noise ratio. While the volume is impressive, the long-term sustainability of \"AI slop\" depends on its ability to solve the user's \"Job to be Done\"—which, in this case, is professional entertainment and micro-learning.\n\nAs we look toward Product-Led Growth (PLG) in 2026, the question isn't whether we should use AI to write our takes, but how we can optimize the human-in-the-loop process to ensure that the \"slop\" eventually evolves into \"gold.\" We are witnessing the democratization of insight, where the barrier to entry is no longer talent, but the capacity to prompt.\n\nWould you like me to generate a series of viral-ready \"hooks\" based on this PM slop style for your own social media feed?",

We will go through a refinement session in a sprint but that is not for going into details of prd of the next sprint, only to confirm the items we have lined up are aligned with our OKRs still. The planning session is hell because now the devs are forced to read the prd in whole and only then they push back on the requirements that are written like no we shouldn’t show a dialogue here a toast will do or no we shouldn’t redirect on the same tab let’s navigate user to a new tab etc. And now it takes hours to go through all the tickets (and plus we do planning for mobile app separately to the web app so planning takes a whole day just for a 2-week sprint). \n\nIt all comes back to the rationale of recording the source of truth, a document that anyone can come back and read at anytime to know exactly the requirements and the flow and the UI of a feature, and I understand it but it’s just exhausting.

It has a logic layer that learns my specific tone and technical vocabulary, so I can feed it my research and it spits out a high quality draft that sounds exactly like me. It honestly feels like having a senior PM draft the first version for you so you can just focus on the strategy. It's way better than standard AI tools that give you that generic, robotic output. Do your devs usually complain about the length of your specs or the clarity of the requirements?",

That stuff doesn't come back.\n\n  \nWe had a feature request resurface as a \"new\" priority. Scoped it from scratch with \"fresh context\" like you described. Shipped it.

We basically built the wrong version because we treated it as new when it wasn't.\n\n  \nNow I do what you do - kill the ticket - but I keep a lightweight doc with the raw customer signal.

The team changed, the system changed, the priorities changed.

They trust me and my data; I own the success metrics.\n2. I trust them (and their data if they have it); they own the success metrics.\n\nFor me, it's that simple.

The stakeholder says the problem is the wheels. Very bad, buggy wheels.

We'll lose at least 50% of all current passengers.\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck,\" snarls the Sr. Director: If you do not send this directive to the public Slack channel by 5 pm today, you will be in big, big trouble.

We identify gaps in PRDs, highlight the edge cases and even decide the priority of features. At that point I wonder: would no PM actually be more efficient? At least the respective teams would self-organize. \n\nCurious where PMs in this community stand on this - is a PM who does half the work still a net positive, or can it become net negative?",

They can be out of touch with the users of their product, the low-level processes, and make rash decisions or mandates of Product Management that eventually undermine the success.  You can set priorities and boundaries all you want with this type of stakeholder, but if your management bends the knee to them, if you are not empowered to speak the whole truth, if you have not been in the role long enough to prove yourself, or if there are hidden personal biases at play with powerful stakeholders, then it can be an uphill battle.\n\nSo, your post has some good points identifying some real issues, but underlying the whole post is that the fault is solely on the shoulders of the PM.  There could be some real powerful factors within your company's own management structure and the Stakeholder client apparatus that makes their job difficult, and if they are the only person in PM doing the rolled up tasks of a BA, a Product Manager and a Project Manager, while having to accommodate internal Sales and Executive demands, I would say they have never been empowered to do their job well.\n\nWhat is often the case in almost all IT organizations or a lot of organizations' IT departments is there is a general mindset (that is wrong) that resources and investment need to occur in the design/build space, but not in the upfront business needs and requirements space.  THIS IS THE REASON WHY up to 90% of IT projects fail.  PM doesn't have the proper and right amount of resources and are not given the right amount of time to do their job.  There is a constant push to be \"coding\" something even if the requirements are not fully fleshed, validated, etc.",

It's not ideal, but it's clear.\nIn the second case, however:\n– decisions appear to be made, but aren't\n– priorities shift indiscriminately\n– work is done twice\n– responsibility is dispersed.\nThe problem is that no one can intervene, because \"the PM is there,\" even if only formally...\n\nThe real question, in my opinion, isn't whether it's better to have a mediocre PM or none at all, but rather if design and development are already doing discovery, prioritization, and scoping, then the PM's role isn't governing the product but merely formalizing it after the fact.\nIn that case, it's not a question of the person, but of an unclear role.\nA good PM is one who creates direction, makes decisions, and maintains focus. If these three things aren't happening, the role is decorative and weighs more heavily than a void.\n\nCurious to hear the PMs' perspective here: when have you seen a team function better without a PM? And what was really missing when the PM was there?",

Overall, I am still enjoying the move because of all the things I had to learn along the way (introducing processes, aligning with founders, building and sharing the vision and strategy, etc.). However, the main challenge I haven't overcome yet is dealing with junior devs, who are basically the whole dev team at this start-up.\n\nTo be clear, there are definitely some advantages compared to the more senior devs I used to work with at my previous company: these junior devs are more ambitious, they are AI-native and they have no problem with working long hours. Main downsides are: terrible at estimating work and they don't like to do \"the boring work\" like implementing tests and reviewing code.\n\nAt the same time, since AI is already taking over a lot of the coding work and they don't like to do the boring admin work, they are now spending more and more of their time playing PM and/or designer, minus actually doing product work, like talking to customers or doing market research. They are constantly making random product decisions based on their own personal assumptions, often with complete disregard for what the product designer and I had already prepared.\n\nWhen we push back on these ideas, they become extremely defensive and even rebellious. So much of my time is now spent debating with devs about product decisions (showing the data, explaining the vision, using customer testimonials) instead of doing actual product work like talking to customers.\n\nAny ideas on how to navigate this?

          "text": "This sounds like a role clarity issue masquerading as a personality problem. You're dealing with a common startup dynamic where people step outside their swim lanes because the lanes were never clearly marked in the first place.  \n  \nThe good news is that you can actually fix this. The bad news is it requires a conversation that might feel uncomfortable at first.  \n  \nStart by establishing what each role is actually accountable for. In empowered product teams, collaboration is not consensus or democracy. It's about deferring to expertise. If the decision pertains to technology, you defer to the tech lead. If it pertains to customer experience, you defer to the designer. If it pertains to business constraints and value, that's where you own the decision as PM.  \n  \nRight now your junior devs are making product decisions because nobody told them that's not their job. They probably think they're being helpful. So have a direct conversation with them about how decisions get made. Walk through a few recent examples and explain the rationale you and the designer used, including the customer data, market research, and business context they didn't have access to.  \n  \nThen set up a regular discovery cadence where they're actually involved early, not after decisions are made. Sit around prototypes together. Let them see the customer conversations. Give them context on the business constraints. This way they get to contribute their technical insights where they matter most, and they understand why certain product decisions were made.  \n  \nWhen disagreements happen, run a test. Make it cheap and fast. Prototype it, test it with real users, collect data. This shifts the conversation from opinion to evidence.  \n  \nThe defensiveness you're seeing is probably coming from two places. First, they feel like their ideas are being shot down without being heard. Second, they don't have enough context to understand why your decisions are better informed. Fix both of those and the pushback should ease up considerably.  \n  \nOne more thing: if they're spending this much time on product work, they're either avoiding the hard engineering work they don't like, or they genuinely don't have enough hard engineering problems to solve. Make sure you're giving them technically challenging work that requires their actual expertise. Junior devs who are bored will absolutely wander into someone else's job.",

It is because the 95% interact well with tech people, but typically do not have the patience for politics, do not enjoy or have the aptitude for \"consistent\" communications and interactions with stakeholders (i.e., managing them, trawling for, validating and prioritizing requirements for the project) and when doing PM work as well, will leave unfinished edges to the work, filling in requirements gaps with their unvalidated intuition and opinion.  The engineers I know that have both Engineering and Product skillsets AND like to use them both consistently are absolutely amazing, but they are unicorns.",

If this is not truly new behavior and they've always done PM work, then it is more than insubordinate employees, it is learned behavior that has been supported by executive management.  Without executive management coming in and laying down the new law, you will never get buy-in and support.  If that is what is going on, I would explain this to the management.\n\nYou pointed out the pros in having junior devs, but you failed to point out the very important disadvantage in failing to have a senior dev in a manager role.  They need to be managed by one of their own, and that role is almost your co-lead in the product on the technical side.  Of course, you interact with, take questions, review the UI, do all those things you would normally do, but when they are out-of-line . . . not doing the \"boring\" work as they describe which is absolutely essential, their engineering manager is dealing with that.\n\nHOWEVER, if they have never done PM work, and now because of your arrival they are taking that on, it is because they lack respect for you, or the management that made the decision to bring you on, or both.\n\nIt is absolutely amazing to me how many start-ups load up their company with nothing but devs and no PM people, likely because they are doing that work, and then realize they don't have the time to do it well.  Every organization, even startups should have non-executive PMs from the start or at least a small team of BAs that they manage.\n\nYou are dealing with the fallout of poor planning, a weak understanding of the importance of PM, especially in the initial stages of a new product.\n\nGet your leadership to hire an engineering manager.  Get your leadership to have a team meeting, explaining your role and theirs (the junior devs) and push back on any product work they do.  If they make product decisions without consulting you, keep track of them, because it may be a long list that goes into a PIP later, if they fail to change.",

Now that you’re there, from their perspective it can feel like someone just showed up and started saying no to ideas they used to run with.\n\nMaybe it’s not your case, but often the conflict is less about seniority and more about ownership.\n\nWhat usually helps is making the decision boundaries very explicit, instead of debating every idea case by case:\n- Product defines which problems and metrics matter.\n- Engineering decides how to solve them.\n- Anyone can participate in the process and suggest ideas, but they’re treated as hypotheses, not decisions.\n\nWithout that clarity, every feature discussion you have turns into an argument about who gets to decide what, and that gets exhausting very quickly.\n\nThe other practical thing is to stop debating solutions and anchor everything on one or two core problems, especially if your team still doesn’t trust you. Junior devs, as you said, have a lot of ideas but understand less about the consequences of those choices. They feel less of the burden of actually being responsible for moving the metric.\n\nYou can change the conversation from “should we add this feature or that feature,” where everyone has opinions, to something like: “our activation is 20% and we need it at 35%.” When the discussion is anchored on a metric, the space for random decisions from junior devs gets much smaller.\n\nBut honestly, if there’s no engineering manager or technical lead setting expectations on their side, this will keep happening.

'here's what 15 users said about this exact workflow this month.' once the devs could see the real customer pain they mostly stopped pitching random ideas because their ideas couldn't compete with documented user frustration. the ambitious ones actually got really into it because now they felt like they were solving real problems instead of guessing. the key shift was from 'i'm the PM trust me' to 'here's what customers are telling us, let's solve this together.' also worth noting - some of their ideas might actually be good. the issue is they skip the validation step. channel that energy into lightweight user research instead of squashing it entirely.",

The areas where AI actually made me more productive were the ones I initially dismissed as too boring to automate - formatting specs, summarizing research notes, generating first drafts of competitive analysis. Stuff that used to take 2 hours of mechanical work and now takes 20 minutes.\n\n  \nBut the actual hard part of my job - figuring out what we should build based on contradictory customer feedback - AI hasn't touched that. I tried feeding it customer conversations and asking for patterns. The output looks impressive but misses the nuance that matters. Like, it'll tell you \"users want better reporting\" when the real insight buried in those conversations is that they don't trust the existing data and the reporting UI isn't the problem.\n\n  \nAI made me faster at the low-value stuff so I have more time for the high-value stuff. That's a genuine win. But anyone expecting it to replace the judgment part of PM work is going to be disappointed.",

I've seen a lot of intrapersonal career kerfuffles in folks at various age-ranges.\n\n\nIt seems most people want to be challenged. Even if they feel downtrodden or burnt out, they enjoy some conflict and some struggle, and change. But sometimes, people get really lost— both overconfidently blowing their net worth on a startup or hypoconfidently locking themselves away.\n\n\nIf you're in an extreme mental space, I very much recommend a therapist that's a life coach for people with your experience. Because it's work-centric, the average therapist isn't equipped to deal with our concerns, like: I don't even have to work; why am I putting up with this; I make more money from the stock market than my job; my equity pays out in the next 3 years and I can buy more houses. I've heard of, and experienced, multiple therapists that give just straight up bad advice because they can't understand the person's perspective.\n\n\nFor me personally, if you're confident you can reach the cliff, I'd stick it out for the year and meanwhile find a challenge and/or a change. I'm not big on specifics—don't like to narrow things down until I absolutely have to. So I'd look forward to the idea of change and kind of get that ball rolling. But be careful, I was too good last year at putting feelers out before the cliff and now some of my prior equity is up in the air.\n\n\nIt's also good to build hobbies.

Does anyone have experience building solutions using agentic AI in the healthcare operations context? How do you manage when it requires the use of PHI?

The practical approach most orgs are taking is sanitizing PHI before it hits an LLM. There's recent research on hybrid approaches using regex + NER models (like BERT-based classifiers) to strip identifiers before inference, then re-associate on the output side. This lets you use foundation models without them ever seeing raw PHI.\n\n\\- Agentic ≠ generative when it comes to compliance. A key distinction: the agent can use an LLM to understand intent (\"patient needs cardiology referral\") but the \\*action\\* (querying the EHR, sending the referral) runs through deterministic, auditable scripts hitting FHIR APIs. The LLM reasons, but secure code executes. This separation is what makes agentic AI actually viable in healthcare vs. just throwing GPT at patient data.",

The traditional PM who writes specs and throws them over the wall to engineering is the one getting squeezed, not the one thriving.\n\nThe real shift: AI doesn't make PM more essential.

Things like: who's your user, what's the actual pain point, what's your unfair advantage, and how do you know you're not just building what *you* want.\n\nThe tricky part is that most founders (myself included early on) skip validation because building feels more productive than talking to users. Having someone who forces that discipline — even part-time — makes a huge difference. Especially now that building is cheap, the cost of building the wrong thing is mostly time and focus, which are still expensive.\n\nIf you want to help founders, I'd say the most valuable thing is teaching them to kill ideas faster.

They analyze data, generate hypotheses, synthesize feedback, and propose options quickly and cheaply. It’s not hard to imagine a near future where large parts of discovery, prioritization, and early strategy run with very little human input.\n\nThe reason many AI-built products feel shallow right now has more to do with incentives and founder experience than a lack of PMs. Speed and novelty are rewarded, and many teams are still learning what good feedback loops look like. That gap will narrow as tools and practices mature.\n\nWhere humans still matter most is in influence. Getting alignment, building trust, navigating tradeoffs between teams, and turning insight into action inside real organizations are social problems. That work doesn’t scale the same way analysis does.\n\nSo the PM role doesn’t disappear, but it shifts. Less time spent deciding what’s “right” on paper, more time spent making things actually happen through people. Helping teams ship real products makes sense, as long as the value is rooted in execution and influence.",

          "text": "PM, design, and engineering co-own delivery but whomever is ultimately accountable for the _failure_ of the deliverables will understandably want to have veto power because they may feel their neck is on the line and want to do what they can to avoid shipping things that threaten their reputation or job. \n\nThat’s sort of your starting point — you need to get that concern out in the open. \n\nComplicating that concern is that if they do exercise that power, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re always right about their decisions. \n\nIf you have an unusually healthy team and org, you can discuss how to address it and implement clarifications to roles, responsibilities, and decision making and you’re golden. But that’s not the real world is it? \n\nA more practical approach is to try the above but expect more of a win/lose compromise than a win/win collaboration. Set some context with your team’s key functional leads that you want to clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision making and draft a “working agreement” that captures which decisions each function owns and who makes decisions with regard to conflicts. The person who gets to carry the failure burden should make the case they’re ultimately accountable and _will_ have final say. \n\nNo one is going to love it but it does clear things up enough to reduce the number of conflicts by _some_ amount. Still, it’s more or less a bandage on a still weepy wound. \n\nThe harder play is a long term play that you need to do no matter what — you have to build a relationship with everyone. \n\nIt’s complicated because you’ll find that while it’s easier to trust some people you’ll also find it much harder with others for a variety or reasons that you mostly don’t control. When the trust is there, these conflicts tend to disappear in favor of having what feels like a normal conversation with friends deciding what bar to go to. When it isn’t, every conversation feels like a battle and that’s the kind of thing that just grinds both sides down. \n\nThe hard people is where you need to run _toward_ the problem. In my own career, I use the Johari window, Thomas-Kilmann conflict model, and the situational leadership framework and a heavy dose of facilitation techniques to work through those challenges. It’s rare that it solves the problem completely but it usually dramatically it improves things to the point my challenge colleagues become close enough to an ally that it’s all good. However, sometimes it just isn’t fixable or capable of being improved. If it’s a direct report, I get them off my team. If it’s a peer, I’ll compartmentalize them to keep their impact minimized. If it’s a senior leader, I’ll try to weave in points when I can but ultimately will exit myself from that situation. \n\nAnyhow, talk to your designer. Find out what they care about and why. Share the same for yourself. Ask them what they think they need to do to be successful in their role and you share the same. Try to build some common understanding of your roles. Then talk about concerns you both have with the way you’re working together. Look for some areas of agreement and build on that towards a decision. Honestly, this stuff is a lot of soft skills that most people are horrendous at but check out some books on facilitation techniques which will give you some tools.",

The real issue is almost always about how feedback is framed. \"Can you try something else\" feels like a taste call to a designer. \"This flow doesn't work because users need to do X before Y, and here's the support data\" gives them a problem to solve — which is what good designers actually want.\n\nIn practice, PM owns the outcome, designer owns the craft. But the best results I've seen come when you give designers the full business context upfront — the constraints, the user data, the strategic goals — and then let them explore solutions within that frame. When they understand *why* something matters, they design for it. When they don't, they design for aesthetics.\n\nOne thing that helped us a lot: never critique a design in terms of \"I don't like it.\" Always frame it as \"here's the user problem this doesn't solve yet.\" It completely changes the dynamic.",

But if you’re frequently asking for “other options” because something doesn’t feel right to you — that’s art-directing, not product managing. Designers can tell the difference, and it’s probably why you’re getting pushback.\n\nFrame feedback as problems, not requests for alternatives. “Can you try something else” feels like a taste call. “I’m worried users will drop off here because X” is a collaboration. One makes a designer defensive. The other makes them curious.\n\nYour previous designer may not have been more collaborative — they may have just been more compliant. A designer who defends their decisions with rationale is a good designer. Learn to work with that instead of treating it as a problem.\n\nThe “too pushy” comment is a real signal. Even delivered as a joke, it means your designer feels their expertise isn’t being respected. Try leading with “I trust your judgment on the visual execution — I want to flag a concern about the flow from a business angle.” Small shift, big difference.\n\nWhen you’re truly stuck, depersonalize it. Suggest a usability test. Nobody’s opinion wins; user behavior does.\n\nThe instinct to care about UX is great. Just make sure you’re bringing evidence and problems to the table, not alternative design solutions. That’s the line between a PM who’s a great design partner and one who’s a frustrating backseat driver.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Make a call between us.”\n\nOur org later went under a restructure where design and product had different directors, and it got more combative until the directors got in a shouting match one day and the final veto power was given to Product. And then the design director quit a few months later. After I had already left. …I don’t believe this decision for product to have the final power was the reason people quit, but the fact that it came to a shouting match probably was. \n\nMy current designer and I have a “disagree but commit” agreement, where if it’s a “design decision”, unless I think it will impact KPIs, we document my disagreement but go with his decision.

It got so dragged out that I talked to my boss and let that design lead be the project owner.\n\nIn your case, since the designer is new, rank shouldn't be an issue. First chat with the designer about the collaboration style in their previous work and ask who they think own the product and responsibilities. If they says the PM owns the product metrics, the final decision should be yours. (This is to make them admit themselves that the PM own the product).   \nIf they are still being difficult, talk to their direct-report and ask for advice from your manager. Be careful approaching higher ups; they hate having problems brought to them. Instead of complaining, ask for advice, ask how they handled such situation in their career, and bring evidence why your decision is better than the designer.",

Still they should be able to communicate why this choice and how it aligns with the design system and overall best practices.\n\nI think as a PM your job is to communicate and cooperate with designers and developers alike, acting as the bridge and the glue in a sense of the product. So it's less about who should have the final say, and more how well you're able to communicate and cooperate with this designer. \n\nIf your relationship with this designer is unidirectional where you request something and they produce something, perhaps you can have a discussion with them regarding how you can have a more cooperative approach where you iterate together rather than work separately and simply judge the final design presented by the designer.\n\nOf course the art of communication is to maintain an open discussion and not let ego's and assumptions take the better of yourselves.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis may all sound obvious but in my experience good communication is hard to come by naturally and requires a lot of effort, when it doesn't happen issues like these drain everyone involved and the product suffers as a consequence.",

And if designer takes all my context/input into consideration and comes up with a design artifact I should respect the decisions made since they are the experts (unless I'm not coming from design with years of experience, but even in this case this might be disrespectful). Many times after working with a designer you know how much of this context you really need to exchange before in an alignment meeting or PRD, since I worked with such high profiles they do all of that context themselves and present as their thinking process. As an example; lets say I do 3 competitor benchmarks ahead; but she complements with another 3 analysis which may change the original boundries/insights so the expectations. So I would really try hard an perfect alignment ahead and not have designers do they job for days and weeks and we conflict in front of others.",

It was a workflow tool used by internal employees, catered to roles, so that every person could navigate the UI according to their role and path to perform steps in an implementation.  This executive convinced upper management that the entire product needed to be redesigned to have a layer that was a common process layer.  I argued against it because the users loved our tool as is, had not asked for this change, and if it added any complexity to their decision-making, it would fail.  The executive won.  They made the changes.  He demo'd it in front of the company leadership and got a promotion.  Within two years the tool was abandoned with complaints on day 1 when it was released.  I moved to another department before the redesign was even completed because I knew how it would turn out.  It was a disaster, and I think that guy went on to become a President at a startup.  LOL.  \n\nAnyway, yes, it happens a lot.  % of how much it happens?

If that's so, what is there for me to learn?\n\nFinally, he's also the guy that was impressed by [that shitty AI video game footage](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/footage-ai-generated-video-game-terrible).

Eventually, scope expanded to cover the AI assistant space. $5M funding, half of which is from 2020. \n\nI will give them credit for being ahead of the curve, they deserved their first round, but it appears that they did jack shit with that head start and now they compete in some of the most commodified and competitive spaces in AI with nothing to show for it.

I deal with:\n\n\n- Exceptionally complex proprietary data that base models aren't trained on and do not understand. \n- Very restrictive controls on data. \n- Regulatory compliance. \n- High-risk, safety critical work. \n- Decades old legacy systems.\n\n\nLetting loose some agentic AI on a customer support process or vibe coding together an online retail experience is one thing. \n\n\nBut when working in my type of environment everyone is going to be extra cautious, rules restrict what you can do and it takes more effort to get your AI to make sense of the information.\n\n\nWe do leverage AI and it's a big part of my job now to get it implemented. AI is also doing great for us in developing rapid prototypes. But there's also very real limitations that will take more work to overcome, and the nature of the work means that unless multiple different governments decide to change their regulations many core tasks simply must be done by humans because the rules simply say so. E.g. AI isn't allowed to sign off on aerospace engineering work (but: can speed up the engineering process).",

          "text": "What a gigantic essay to say nothing. Here’s a TLDR thanks to AI. So no revelation here or anything just more “it’s coming” noise \n\nHere’s the core message, stripped down:\n\nThe author compares today’s AI moment to February 2020 before Covid hit — when most people thought concerns were overblown, right before everything changed fast. He believes we’re in a similar “this seems exaggerated” phase with AI.\n\nHe works in AI and says the shift isn’t theoretical — it’s already happened in his own job. The latest models (like GPT-5.3 Codex from OpenAI and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic) can now independently complete complex, multi-hour technical work with little to no correction. In his experience, AI has moved from being a helpful assistant to effectively replacing much of his core work.\n\nKey points:\n- Progress is accelerating, not slowing.\nImprovements are compounding quickly. Models now complete multi-hour expert tasks end-to-end, and that capability is growing rapidly.\n- AI is helping build the next generation of AI.\nCompanies like OpenAI and Anthropic say current models are already contributing to training and improving their successors — creating a feedback loop.\n- White-collar disruption is imminent.\nHe argues that most computer-based jobs — law, finance, writing, coding, analysis, consulting, customer service — are exposed. Not in decades. In 1–5 years, possibly sooner.\n- Public perception is outdated.\nMany people are judging AI based on older or free versions. The cutting edge is far more capable than most realize.\n- This is different from past automation.\nAI is a general-purpose cognitive substitute. It improves across domains at once, leaving fewer “safe” retraining paths.\n\n\n\nWhat he advises:\n1. Start using advanced AI seriously, now.\nDon’t treat it like Google. Use it on real work. Push it hard.\n2. Become early and adaptable.\nThe advantage right now is being ahead of peers in understanding and applying AI.\n3. Build financial resilience.\nPrepare for potential disruption.\n4. Lean into harder-to-replace strengths.\nRelationships, trust, regulatory roles, physical-world work — these may buy time.\n5. Teach adaptability, not just credentials.\nFor the next generation, curiosity and fluency with AI tools matter more than traditional career paths.\n\n\n\nHe ends on a dual note:\n- Risk: Major job displacement and serious societal consequences.\n- Opportunity: Unprecedented leverage — individuals can build, learn, and create at levels previously impossible.\n\n\n\nBottom line:\nThis isn’t hype in his view. The disruption has already begun in tech, and he believes the rest of the economy is next — soon.",

He’s just saying AI is good at writing software?\n\n> Each new model wasn't just better than the last... it was better by a wider margin, and the time between new model releases was shorter.\n\nIs this true?, it seems like it’s taking longer between models these days, and Opus 4.5->4.6 has not been a wider margin of improvement than previous Opus models.\n\n> Then, and this is the part that would have been unthinkable a year ago, it opens the app itself\n\nMy AI tools have been doing that for over a year. I’m not sure the progress is going to move much further much faster.\n\nYou see ambiguity is still the enemy for working with LLMs, just like it was when working with humans. This is posted in a PM sub, but PMs are actually the ones best suited to excel with AI. If you were already good at communicating expectations and writing features then you’re in luck, because we still need the inputs to these systems. Ai is not autonomous and regardless of how good it gets it will need direction. Every choice it makes is a chance to do something you didn’t want it to do, no matter how smart it is, even if it is a human! As PMs the job is to remove those choices and provide requirements that will deliver exactly what is needed.\n\n> If AI can write that code, it can help build the next version of itself. A smarter version, which writes better code, which builds an even smarter version.\n\nI keep hearing this, but if it was true I’d actually expect a rapid increase in model performance. Instead we see incremental, and I would say diminishing, gains.\n\n> Let that land for a second. If AI is smarter than most PhDs, do you really think it can't do most office jobs?\n\nYes, because it is smarter in some ways and completely incapable in other ways. These are not autonomous agents. Power tools don’t build a house on their own.\n\n> A year ago, AI could barely write a few lines of code without errors\n\nAgain, I’ve got applications I started over a year ago that I’ve never written a line of code for. This is underestimating where the tech was a year ago.",

I often use too many qualifiers and don’t always finish my thoughts in a strong, strategic way.\n\nI’m looking for advice: Are there any books I can read daily to get more familiar with strategic phrasing?

          "text": "To be clear, there’s a difference between speaking well and being strategic in your thoughts, plans, and presentations. The former has to do with your ability to convey your ideas in a manner that makes sense to your audience, and often that includes your ability to articulate complex ideas eloquently, to speak concisely, and convey emotion and evoke feelings from your audience when appropriate. \n\nBeing strategic is different though. You can think and speak strategically, but be a poor speaker and communicator. Being strategic simply means that you’re thinking long term rather than short term. For example, one might present a new product idea and talk about how much revenue can be made. That’s tactical. A strategic communicator will talk about that new product’s long term impact on the rest of the product portfolio, the downstream market opportunities it opens, the moves it may force upon competitors, the regulatory hurdles one could face as the space matures, etc. \n\nSo speaking well and thinking strategically are two different skills. If you can master both, you’ll set yourself up for success as a senior PM.",

Take the audience who already understands the qualifiers, well then they’re patronising and boring. Take the audience who has no context of the qualifiers. Maybe it’s worth breaking that into a separate sentence, checking they first understand the context, and then continuing on (though I’d always use BLUF).",

Let's call it \"All\" or \"Nothing\". \n\nNOTHING: \n\nYou get hired as a PM with a mandate to launch a new product in a very specific timeframe. The company has never done this before and while you have some expertise in the domain, you're not an expert. The catch is you have no team, no data, no infrastructure...yet. Everyone is being hired from outside the company and yet - you must research, design, build and manage (aka invent) everything from production cadence to frameworks as you go. When new people come on board, you not only have to onboard them but then coordinate with them on how to move forward. Any budgetary issues - environment setup, software, HPC stack, etc.. must be vetted, approved and then reviewed before they can be implemented. Not to mention reviewed and approved by a compliance team and the COO. You onboard an entire team except UX/VD because engineering took over the budget and hired more back-end devs using the UX budget for themselves forcing you to do all of that on top of your own product role. Management doesn't care because again - the product leaders are all ex-engineering and there is very little UX representation around the company. \n\nALL: \n\nYou get hired as a PM to build out an AI powered ETL/Data Lake that ingests over 3000 different API sources to power a database with a search engine on top. Search is inference powered using GCP and there is zero standardization on any of the data inputs. REST? Yes. SOAP? Yes. XML and CSV manually sent over as a physical file attachment? Oh yes. Despite all of the data having the same overall purpose, you not only have very little consistency in data formatting but also specific redactions in the API called due to complicated and ever changing privacy rules. Then - two outsourced teams. One in Europe who are really good but disagree with everything and often build conflicting systems with zero oversight from management (don't upset the apple cart) and another in India who are woefully incompetent and break all security and engineering best practices just to make deadlines. Now have both teams fight on backlogs and any management of sprint planning or UAT is your problem with QA just rejected anything and everthing to cover their asses. \n\nThat was mine. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. ",

Most often, they're not, if they can even provide clear goals and objectives. \n\nOnce you (hopefully) have an understanding of the goals and objectives, you can proactively pitch solutions/ideas to stakeholders instead of waiting for them to give you their ideas.

He is prioritizing stakeholder input as an important source of data, and wants you to establish that relationship. It may be as much about the latter as the former given you are new to this company.\n\nWhen ideas come purely from intuition and backup research that is external to talking to your stakeholders, you are doing requirements trawling in a half-closed vacuum.  Sure, sometimes that makes sense if you find something that can improve existing workflow.  However, when you are talking new features or functions, it is always a good idea to validate the need first with your stakeholders, rather than spending any amount of time building anything.",

          "text": "Both patterns are common, and the difference usually comes down to company maturity and risk tolerance rather than “good” or “bad” product practice. Early or execution-heavy teams tend to reward building, testing, and proving things with data. More process-heavy orgs lean on consensus, alignment, and stakeholder input before anything moves, especially if mistakes are expensive or visibility is high.\n\nWhat you’re seeing now is a place that optimizes for coordination over speed. That often shows up as lots of meetings and upstream validation. It can feel frustrating if you’re used to learning through shipping, but it’s also how some orgs manage risk and politics. Your manager may be trying to protect you or themselves by making sure stakeholders feel heard.\n\nOver time, strong PMs usually blend the two. They do the stakeholder work to earn trust, then quietly reintroduce small bets, experiments, and scoped tests once there’s cover. The autonomy you had before often has to be rebuilt in a new environment.\n\nThis isn’t a signal that you’re doing product wrong. It’s a signal that you’re learning how different orgs operate. Figuring out how to move from “asked to coordinate” back toward “trusted to lead” is a big part of growing in product.",
