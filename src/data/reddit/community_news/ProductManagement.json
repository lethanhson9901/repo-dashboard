Which turned out to be mostly misinterpreted, misquoted, or even just completely hallucinated (as in, quoting from a person who doesn't exist, or a quote between quotation marks that is not in the referenced doc).\n\n\n\nI feel like this needs saying: professionals don't just make shit up, and using an LLM to help is no excuse.\n\n\n\nThis is not a dumb junior getting caught copying on the test for the first time. This is someone with a reputable 10+ year work history at a number of companies.\n\n\n\nThe problem with LLM is that the cost of generating bullshit now vastly undercuts the cost of detecting and correcting it. I probably spent more time following links and verifying sources than the author did asking some bot to put together the reference section of their doc.\n\n\n\nAs with similar situations, I feel this calls for punitive consequences. I am curious if anyone has implemented policies that if you pass off LLM work as your own uncritically, you suffer automatic career consequences.",

But the citation is good and it finds documentation more efficiently than the old search functions we used.   \n  \nI just am not sure how it gets better if there's so much LLM garbage going into the knowledge base though. The LLMs will output bad info because of bad documentation. There's more documentation now so it's going to take longer for me to manually sift through and read it.

Here are a few things I’ve learned/ implemented that helped lower the cognitive load day to day. Mostly it’s personal product operations automation.  1-3 will help anywhere. #4 is only if you work with 1/2 decent org. \n\n1. I have a ‘chief of staff’ agent that lets me mostly ignore slack most of the day.  This will summarize conversations with the things I need to know AND track action items/key discussion points from the Gemini notes.  The end result is I get to mostly ignore slack. The only notifications I get are from my Eng team or an aggressively curated list of VIPS.  Any action items or responses then come into #2. \n\n2. Using AI to write my prompts to speed up context switching/ getting things out of my head. . This alone helps with any document writing. Then combine with voice to text brain dumping and something like Glean that has had at least a few months of training against company docs speeds up ANY writing INCLUDING pre-reads and memos briefing. Context. Which are huge in my company. \n\n3. The Faux meeting. Hour to 90 min meetings titled as one of the features I’m working on.  Makes it looks like my calendar is booked. This forces people to slack me about little shit or meetings that should have been a slack. Which means it gets caught in #1. \n\n4. Fully empowering my staff and senior engineers. These people are FULL briefed by me and UX about all the context. It means most of the time, they can tackle 80-90% of the issues. Come up with a solution and then walk me through it. I get to provide feedback rather the do all the thinking.   It takes time to build the trust but these are skilled professionals. Once they understand the context, they mostly make right choices and just need confirmation.  I have worked places where this would not be viable, which.. sucks so much.",

Here's another angle you might need to watch out for.\" etc. (AI as a thinking partner)\n\nMy curious nature: follows the white rabbit down the rabbit hole (cognitive drift).\n\nMy tip, if I can even call it that, is to trust my instincts more and/or listen to the voice of reason in my head that says, \"psychedelic singing flowers, smoking caterpillars, and merry unbirthdays\" are a waste of time. (do the work I was trying to, at least experimentally, offload)\n\nI think the trap might be that better prompting, more context, would produce better results.\n\nPreemptively I should go back to my trusted whiteboard and work things out for myself - to trust my experience and system knowledge. (move AI more downstream, into a less trusting role)\n\nThere isn't a single one thing I've used AI to do that didn't fall into this category. (analysis, coding, strategy, discovery, planning, measurement, optimization)\n\nNow, when I do turn to AI, it's very limited: specific work/tasks that has a clear outcome (like organizing data, writing a short reply, debating small scoped/risk ideas). Even then it has a tendency to assume.\n\nI have found that it does help me refresh my memory about frameworks and references that have slipped my memory and sketch out rough ideas that I then force myself to diverge on my own or validate with real people.

This was days ago, unknown to me. I finish up the PRD and I’m chatting with him. He says oh that stuff is already in QA. None of it is to spec. None of it makes practical sense or covers any real use cases. Turns out he doubled, if not tripled his work. \n\nI sent him three bullet points, very plain English (we aren’t building rockets here) of X, Y, Z. He took that message and fed it into an LLM and gave me a 160 line markdown file asking “does this cover the ask”\n\nI’m getting really, really, really, exhausted at people using AI without any thought or practical knowledge of what they are building. I took 5 minutes to explain why the product should function how I outlined and how it would be used. He was upset he “spent days upon days and 23 new files” to do it how he thought was right. Rude awakening to not take AI notes, skip Product, and start coding.",

          "text": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital product management, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and content creation has birthed a new paradigm of though leadership. \n\nAs we pivot toward a more automated future, the discourse surrounding \"AI slop\" highlights a critical inflection point for PM leaders and stakeholders alike. We must leverage synergistic frameworks to ensure that our high-frequency outputs remain aligned with core user personas and value propositions.\n\nThe recent observation of Aakash Gupta’s content strategy—producing roughly 10,000 words in a mere 30-minute window—serves as a masterclass in scalable operational efficiency. From a product perspective, this isn't just \"slop\"; it’s an MVP (Minimum Viable Post) iteration cycle. By utilizing generative models to provide \"takes\" on viral trends, creators are essentially performing real-time A/B testing on audience engagement. This \"spray and pray\" methodology is, in many ways, an agile approach to capturing the attention economy.\n\nKey Pillars of the Automated PM Strategy\n\nVelocity as a Feature: In a saturated market, speed is often the ultimate differentiator.\n\nBeing the first to comment on a trend—even via an AI-generated quote—allows for maximum visibility within the algorithm’s honeymoon period.\n\nData-Driven Iteration: By generating 10+ quotes in a row, creators can analyze which specific \"hooks\" or \"takes\" resonate with the target demographic, allowing for a pivot in the next batch of content.\n\nContent Arbitrage: Taking a viral post and expanding it by 400-800 words is a form of value-add that rewards the consumer with depth (or the illusion of it) while minimizing the creator's overhead.\n\n\"True disruption occurs when the cost of production drops to near-zero, while the perceived value remains high enough to trigger a click.\" — Anonymous PM Visionary\n\nHowever, we must remain cognizant of the signal-to-noise ratio. While the volume is impressive, the long-term sustainability of \"AI slop\" depends on its ability to solve the user's \"Job to be Done\"—which, in this case, is professional entertainment and micro-learning.\n\nAs we look toward Product-Led Growth (PLG) in 2026, the question isn't whether we should use AI to write our takes, but how we can optimize the human-in-the-loop process to ensure that the \"slop\" eventually evolves into \"gold.\" We are witnessing the democratization of insight, where the barrier to entry is no longer talent, but the capacity to prompt.\n\nWould you like me to generate a series of viral-ready \"hooks\" based on this PM slop style for your own social media feed?",

It’s that distribution systems still assume effort equals signal. So formatted reactions start to look like earned insight.\n\nBut I’m not sure the solution is “optimize for quality” either.

Or the 3 hours you spend reading through support threads trying to understand if something is a pattern or an outlier. Or explaining to stakeholders why you're NOT building the thing the loudest customer is asking for.\n\n  \nThat's the job. It's messy and ambiguous and you're wrong half the time. But it doesn't make good LinkedIn content so instead we get \"5 frameworks for prioritization\" posts that assume the hard part is choosing a scoring method and not, you know, actually understanding what your customers need.",

Every customer conversation that referenced the issue, every edge case someone mentioned in the thread, every \"oh and this also breaks X\" comment that someone added 3 months ago. That stuff doesn't come back.\n\n  \nWe had a feature request resurface as a \"new\" priority. Scoped it from scratch with \"fresh context\" like you described. Shipped it. Then someone found the original killed ticket and it had 3 customer conversations attached that completely changed how we should have approached it. We basically built the wrong version because we treated it as new when it wasn't.\n\n  \nNow I do what you do - kill the ticket - but I keep a lightweight doc with the raw customer signal.

If it doesn't come back it never mattered. The fresh context point is the part people miss. A ticket written 8 months ago has assumptions baked in that probably aren't true anymore. The team changed, the system changed, the priorities changed. But the ticket still says \"as discussed in Q2\" referencing a conversation nobody remembers.\n\nThe real question is why Agile frameworks treat the backlog as sacred in the first place.

      "text": "  \n👀 Here’s my thinking: The same over-the-top AI hype that’s pushing PMs to learn more and do more is also giving them an out.  \n  \nThe PM role was already extremely demanding before the AI hype: you need to be part psychologist to understand users, part strategist to set direction, part salesperson to pitch your ideas, part analyst to make sense of data, part designer to have a vision for the experience, part project manager to keep things moving, and part diplomat to navigate stakeholder politics.   \n  \nIt’s A LOT of different skills just to do the baseline job well. All while managing people who don’t report to you and taking responsibility for outcomes you don’t fully control.  \n  \nNow on top of all that there’s this whole new layer of expectations where PMs need to prove they’re AI people too. Already there are product leaders out there who are demanding that PMs MUST show side projects, vibe coding skills, GitHub activity and prompt libraries just to get hired. Like... their actual work isn’t already hard enough.  \n  \nMeanwhile most product managers are not having good day-to-day experiences on their jobs. Most scaling organisations are struggling to figure out how to give autonomy without losing alignment. How to move fast without creating chaos. How to make decisions without needing multiple layers of approvals. How to stay agile without constant reorgs. These tradeoffs on their own are genuinely hard to balance… and now there’s the AI FOMO in the mix too.   \n  \nSo here’s my logic:  \n  \nPMs already have most of what they need to build products. They know how to find problems, talk to users, figure out what to build, and design decent experiences. The missing piece to complete ownership was needing engineers to actually ship.  \n  \nBut the new AI tools that they’re now asked to learn remove that blocker.  \n  \nSo I bet these multitalented people will soon realise they can build their own thing without needing anyone’s approval or budget or roadmap sign-off.   \n  \nActual autonomy. Real speed. Freedom to execute.  \n  \nSo the best PMs - the frustrated PMs - are going to be facing a dilemma: keep doing the extremely demanding job with all the stakeholders and politics and meetings, or go build something they’re excited about on their own terms.  \n  \nSome will stay. But many are going to try their own thing. And companies with uninspiring missions, unclear strategies and poor operating systems are going to have a hard keeping them.",

          "text": "In B2B industrial and engineering software, the constraint was never just \"can someone write the code\". The hard parts are domain depth, legacy integrations, compliance, safety, procurement cycles, change management, and proving ROI to risk-averse buyers. AI tools dont remove those constraints - they mostly compress parts of execution, not the whole system around it. And this is not even mentioning hardware PMs, where you deal with supply chains, physical constraints, certifications, and timelines where one mistake costs millions. Thats a completly different game.\n\nAlso, \"PMs can now just build their own thing\" glosses over what a real business is. A product is not a demo. Its distribution, trust, support, SLAs, security reviews, contracts, industry relationships, and the stamina to survive 12-24 month sales cycles. That is a very different skill stack and also risk profile vs employment. Many people underestmate this part.\n\nAI absolutely lowers the cost of prototyping. It does not magically give product-market fit, credibility in regulated industries, or access to buyers. In many non-consumer sectors, the moat is context, relationships, and operational maturity - not who can vibe-code fastest.\n\nGenerally, I also feel consumer/app/saas PMs are the most vocal part of the PM crowd online, but I dont think they are the biggest part of the profession. A lot of PM work happens in less visible, more complex environments where the constraints are just different.\n\nSo yes, some PMs will go solo. But the idea that large numbers of experienced PMs in complex B2B environments can simply peel off and outbuild companies because of AI tools feels overstated to me. The leverage AI provides is real, but the bottlenecks in these markets are mostly human, organizational, and structural - and those didnt get automated.",

If the site isn't super complicated and you're an experienced PM you can probably build it yourself.\n\nMy personal prediction is a little short of this.  I think that product teams just get smaller.  You still have a tech lead to keep an eye on things and you still have a visual designer type person (perhaps that's just the PM if they're good a visual design) but you don't have this huge team with two scrum teams, a dedicated design group, etc....  My last startup was 50 people which seemed insanely small at the time.  Today, I could build that entire product with three people easily.  \n\nOf course, sales and marketing are another thing.

All while managing people who don’t report to you and taking responsibility for outcomes you don’t fully control.\n\n(1) This is the best summary description of our work I have read but I don’t land at the same result. \n\n(2) Maybe I’m just at a better org, but our problems are not really AI driven at this point.\n\n(3) I hit pretty quick roadblocks on my vibe coded projects still hit frustrating roadblocks that I couldn’t clear on my own. Had these been work sponsored projects, I could have cleared the with borrowed expertise.\n\n(4) ultimately, PM is a good role for me because I like using all the skills you outline, but I also like being at an org where I don’t have to do literally every type of work.",

You can be the best pm ever by purist definitions of the job but still fail miserably, vice versa.\n\nSo start by asking yourself what your goal is. Do you want to become a great builder or just climb corporate ladder? \n\nYou can do both but most of the time it’s a push and pull in between.\n\nAfter a decade, I would say great product manager optimizes for what they want. Figuring out what you want is the half of the journey - it also changes with you along the way. \n\nOne rule is never to stop improving yourself, rest you will figure out in time. There is no one great form of a PM. It’s agile (pun intended).",

Do the PM work around it: who it’s for, what problem, what you shipped first, what changed after feedback.\n* Volunteer for product ownership wherever you are. Own a feature, a workflow, an experiment. Titles don’t matter as much as ownership.\n* Do real teardowns. Pick a product you use and write a one-pager: user goal, friction, metric, hypothesis, experiment.\n* Freelancing can work, but only if you’re actually making product decisions, not just taking orders.\n\nConfidence in PM comes from shipping, being wrong, and adjusting.

Try it with people who you run into during your day (coffee shops, grocery stores, etc) and imagine what solutions might look like for them.

I have a PM I partner with regularly (a couple times a week) to help validate and prioritize the problems to work on. This always involve technical feasibility and sequencing on my part. I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. But being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

We identify gaps in PRDs, highlight the edge cases and even decide the priority of features. At that point I wonder: would no PM actually be more efficient? At least the respective teams would self-organize. \n\nCurious where PMs in this community stand on this - is a PM who does half the work still a net positive, or can it become net negative?",

They can be out of touch with the users of their product, the low-level processes, and make rash decisions or mandates of Product Management that eventually undermine the success.  You can set priorities and boundaries all you want with this type of stakeholder, but if your management bends the knee to them, if you are not empowered to speak the whole truth, if you have not been in the role long enough to prove yourself, or if there are hidden personal biases at play with powerful stakeholders, then it can be an uphill battle.\n\nSo, your post has some good points identifying some real issues, but underlying the whole post is that the fault is solely on the shoulders of the PM.  There could be some real powerful factors within your company's own management structure and the Stakeholder client apparatus that makes their job difficult, and if they are the only person in PM doing the rolled up tasks of a BA, a Product Manager and a Project Manager, while having to accommodate internal Sales and Executive demands, I would say they have never been empowered to do their job well.\n\nWhat is often the case in almost all IT organizations or a lot of organizations' IT departments is there is a general mindset (that is wrong) that resources and investment need to occur in the design/build space, but not in the upfront business needs and requirements space.  THIS IS THE REASON WHY up to 90% of IT projects fail.  PM doesn't have the proper and right amount of resources and are not given the right amount of time to do their job.  There is a constant push to be \"coding\" something even if the requirements are not fully fleshed, validated, etc.",

It's not ideal, but it's clear.\nIn the second case, however:\n– decisions appear to be made, but aren't\n– priorities shift indiscriminately\n– work is done twice\n– responsibility is dispersed.\nThe problem is that no one can intervene, because \"the PM is there,\" even if only formally...\n\nThe real question, in my opinion, isn't whether it's better to have a mediocre PM or none at all, but rather if design and development are already doing discovery, prioritization, and scoping, then the PM's role isn't governing the product but merely formalizing it after the fact.\nIn that case, it's not a question of the person, but of an unclear role.\nA good PM is one who creates direction, makes decisions, and maintains focus. If these three things aren't happening, the role is decorative and weighs more heavily than a void.\n\nCurious to hear the PMs' perspective here: when have you seen a team function better without a PM? And what was really missing when the PM was there?",

The areas where AI actually made me more productive were the ones I initially dismissed as too boring to automate - formatting specs, summarizing research notes, generating first drafts of competitive analysis. Stuff that used to take 2 hours of mechanical work and now takes 20 minutes.\n\n  \nBut the actual hard part of my job - figuring out what we should build based on contradictory customer feedback - AI hasn't touched that. I tried feeding it customer conversations and asking for patterns. The output looks impressive but misses the nuance that matters. Like, it'll tell you \"users want better reporting\" when the real insight buried in those conversations is that they don't trust the existing data and the reporting UI isn't the problem.\n\n  \nAI made me faster at the low-value stuff so I have more time for the high-value stuff. That's a genuine win. But anyone expecting it to replace the judgment part of PM work is going to be disappointed.",

Even if they feel downtrodden or burnt out, they enjoy some conflict and some struggle, and change. But sometimes, people get really lost— both overconfidently blowing their net worth on a startup or hypoconfidently locking themselves away.\n\n\nIf you're in an extreme mental space, I very much recommend a therapist that's a life coach for people with your experience. Because it's work-centric, the average therapist isn't equipped to deal with our concerns, like: I don't even have to work; why am I putting up with this; I make more money from the stock market than my job; my equity pays out in the next 3 years and I can buy more houses. I've heard of, and experienced, multiple therapists that give just straight up bad advice because they can't understand the person's perspective.\n\n\nFor me personally, if you're confident you can reach the cliff, I'd stick it out for the year and meanwhile find a challenge and/or a change. I'm not big on specifics—don't like to narrow things down until I absolutely have to. So I'd look forward to the idea of change and kind of get that ball rolling. But be careful, I was too good last year at putting feelers out before the cliff and now some of my prior equity is up in the air.\n\n\nIt's also good to build hobbies. Gym, volunteering, local government, home automation, really anything",

Does anyone have experience building solutions using agentic AI in the healthcare operations context? How do you manage when it requires the use of PHI? As an example thinking about solutions that could help with care navigation and closing the referral loop. \n\nSorry if this is a ramble but like so many others I just feel so “behind” and I’m struggling to really figure out how realistic is it is to take advantage of this type of technology in the healthcare space.

For practical purposes the sonographers needed to be able to see this data so they knew which patient they were dealing with.\n\nI think an LLM would need to be agnostic to any PHI and only deal with the facts for analysis.",

Most had not even a basic understand of what the job is and how to actually create a successful product/service.

If I suspect there’s more material out there to draw from, I turn on deep research and flip on email, sharepoint, Atlassian connectors, maybe practitest. Let ‘er rip. \n\nDon’t overthink it. CGPT 5.2 is ridiculously good at pulling together all the rando stuff you’ve loaded for weeks",

The ones who complain the loudest during a deprecation are often your most engaged users - they care enough to be angry.\n\n  \nThe PM skill nobody teaches in frameworks: how to kill a feature without killing user trust.

The former has to do with your ability to convey your ideas in a manner that makes sense to your audience, and often that includes your ability to articulate complex ideas eloquently, to speak concisely, and convey emotion and evoke feelings from your audience when appropriate. \n\nBeing strategic is different though. You can think and speak strategically, but be a poor speaker and communicator. Being strategic simply means that you’re thinking long term rather than short term. For example, one might present a new product idea and talk about how much revenue can be made. That’s tactical. A strategic communicator will talk about that new product’s long term impact on the rest of the product portfolio, the downstream market opportunities it opens, the moves it may force upon competitors, the regulatory hurdles one could face as the space matures, etc. \n\nSo speaking well and thinking strategically are two different skills. If you can master both, you’ll set yourself up for success as a senior PM.",

Something that might help you out with that is the book *Cracking the PM Interview*. There's also *Case in Point*, which is actually more for consulting but might still help with preparing for case interviews. And it might already be obvious, but try practicing with a friend, better if it's someone who's not a PM/doesn't have the technical background so you're forced to simplify your language and be clearer, more concise. Lastly, practice with real PM interview questions (I can recommend a compilation of this!) and time and record yourself to sort of simulate the interview environment.",

AI is also doing great for us in developing rapid prototypes. But there's also very real limitations that will take more work to overcome, and the nature of the work means that unless multiple different governments decide to change their regulations many core tasks simply must be done by humans because the rules simply say so.

          "text": "What a gigantic essay to say nothing. Here’s a TLDR thanks to AI. So no revelation here or anything just more “it’s coming” noise \n\nHere’s the core message, stripped down:\n\nThe author compares today’s AI moment to February 2020 before Covid hit — when most people thought concerns were overblown, right before everything changed fast. He believes we’re in a similar “this seems exaggerated” phase with AI.\n\nHe works in AI and says the shift isn’t theoretical — it’s already happened in his own job. The latest models (like GPT-5.3 Codex from OpenAI and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic) can now independently complete complex, multi-hour technical work with little to no correction. In his experience, AI has moved from being a helpful assistant to effectively replacing much of his core work.\n\nKey points:\n- Progress is accelerating, not slowing.\nImprovements are compounding quickly. Models now complete multi-hour expert tasks end-to-end, and that capability is growing rapidly.\n- AI is helping build the next generation of AI.\nCompanies like OpenAI and Anthropic say current models are already contributing to training and improving their successors — creating a feedback loop.\n- White-collar disruption is imminent.\nHe argues that most computer-based jobs — law, finance, writing, coding, analysis, consulting, customer service — are exposed. Not in decades. In 1–5 years, possibly sooner.\n- Public perception is outdated.\nMany people are judging AI based on older or free versions. The cutting edge is far more capable than most realize.\n- This is different from past automation.\nAI is a general-purpose cognitive substitute. It improves across domains at once, leaving fewer “safe” retraining paths.\n\n\n\nWhat he advises:\n1. Start using advanced AI seriously, now.\nDon’t treat it like Google. Use it on real work. Push it hard.\n2. Become early and adaptable.\nThe advantage right now is being ahead of peers in understanding and applying AI.\n3. Build financial resilience.\nPrepare for potential disruption.\n4. Lean into harder-to-replace strengths.\nRelationships, trust, regulatory roles, physical-world work — these may buy time.\n5. Teach adaptability, not just credentials.\nFor the next generation, curiosity and fluency with AI tools matter more than traditional career paths.\n\n\n\nHe ends on a dual note:\n- Risk: Major job displacement and serious societal consequences.\n- Opportunity: Unprecedented leverage — individuals can build, learn, and create at levels previously impossible.\n\n\n\nBottom line:\nThis isn’t hype in his view. The disruption has already begun in tech, and he believes the rest of the economy is next — soon.",
