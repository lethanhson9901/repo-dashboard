Which turned out to be mostly misinterpreted, misquoted, or even just completely hallucinated (as in, quoting from a person who doesn't exist, or a quote between quotation marks that is not in the referenced doc).\n\n\n\nI feel like this needs saying: professionals don't just make shit up, and using an LLM to help is no excuse.\n\n\n\nThis is not a dumb junior getting caught copying on the test for the first time. This is someone with a reputable 10+ year work history at a number of companies.\n\n\n\nThe problem with LLM is that the cost of generating bullshit now vastly undercuts the cost of detecting and correcting it. I probably spent more time following links and verifying sources than the author did asking some bot to put together the reference section of their doc.\n\n\n\nAs with similar situations, I feel this calls for punitive consequences. I am curious if anyone has implemented policies that if you pass off LLM work as your own uncritically, you suffer automatic career consequences.",

Here are a few things I’ve learned/ implemented that helped lower the cognitive load day to day. Mostly it’s personal product operations automation.  1-3 will help anywhere. #4 is only if you work with 1/2 decent org. \n\n1. I have a ‘chief of staff’ agent that lets me mostly ignore slack most of the day.  This will summarize conversations with the things I need to know AND track action items/key discussion points from the Gemini notes.  The end result is I get to mostly ignore slack. The only notifications I get are from my Eng team or an aggressively curated list of VIPS.  Any action items or responses then come into #2. \n\n2. Using AI to write my prompts to speed up context switching/ getting things out of my head. . This alone helps with any document writing. Then combine with voice to text brain dumping and something like Glean that has had at least a few months of training against company docs speeds up ANY writing INCLUDING pre-reads and memos briefing. Context. Which are huge in my company. \n\n3. The Faux meeting. Hour to 90 min meetings titled as one of the features I’m working on.  Makes it looks like my calendar is booked. This forces people to slack me about little shit or meetings that should have been a slack. Which means it gets caught in #1. \n\n4. Fully empowering my staff and senior engineers. These people are FULL briefed by me and UX about all the context. It means most of the time, they can tackle 80-90% of the issues. Come up with a solution and then walk me through it. I get to provide feedback rather the do all the thinking.   It takes time to build the trust but these are skilled professionals. Once they understand the context, they mostly make right choices and just need confirmation.  I have worked places where this would not be viable, which.. sucks so much.",

(analysis, coding, strategy, discovery, planning, measurement, optimization)\n\nNow, when I do turn to AI, it's very limited: specific work/tasks that has a clear outcome (like organizing data, writing a short reply, debating small scoped/risk ideas). Even then it has a tendency to assume.\n\nI have found that it does help me refresh my memory about frameworks and references that have slipped my memory and sketch out rough ideas that I then force myself to diverge on my own or validate with real people.

We must leverage synergistic frameworks to ensure that our high-frequency outputs remain aligned with core user personas and value propositions.\n\nThe recent observation of Aakash Gupta’s content strategy—producing roughly 10,000 words in a mere 30-minute window—serves as a masterclass in scalable operational efficiency. From a product perspective, this isn't just \"slop\"; it’s an MVP (Minimum Viable Post) iteration cycle. By utilizing generative models to provide \"takes\" on viral trends, creators are essentially performing real-time A/B testing on audience engagement. This \"spray and pray\" methodology is, in many ways, an agile approach to capturing the attention economy.\n\nKey Pillars of the Automated PM Strategy\n\nVelocity as a Feature: In a saturated market, speed is often the ultimate differentiator.\n\nBeing the first to comment on a trend—even via an AI-generated quote—allows for maximum visibility within the algorithm’s honeymoon period.\n\nData-Driven Iteration: By generating 10+ quotes in a row, creators can analyze which specific \"hooks\" or \"takes\" resonate with the target demographic, allowing for a pivot in the next batch of content.\n\nContent Arbitrage: Taking a viral post and expanding it by 400-800 words is a form of value-add that rewards the consumer with depth (or the illusion of it) while minimizing the creator's overhead.\n\n\"True disruption occurs when the cost of production drops to near-zero, while the perceived value remains high enough to trigger a click.\" — Anonymous PM Visionary\n\nHowever, we must remain cognizant of the signal-to-noise ratio. While the volume is impressive, the long-term sustainability of \"AI slop\" depends on its ability to solve the user's \"Job to be Done\"—which, in this case, is professional entertainment and micro-learning.\n\nAs we look toward Product-Led Growth (PLG) in 2026, the question isn't whether we should use AI to write our takes, but how we can optimize the human-in-the-loop process to ensure that the \"slop\" eventually evolves into \"gold.\" We are witnessing the democratization of insight, where the barrier to entry is no longer talent, but the capacity to prompt.\n\nWould you like me to generate a series of viral-ready \"hooks\" based on this PM slop style for your own social media feed?",

It’s that distribution systems still assume effort equals signal. So formatted reactions start to look like earned insight.\n\nBut I’m not sure the solution is “optimize for quality” either. Engagement is still a proxy. The deeper question is: how do platforms reward demonstrated experience instead of well-articulated opinion?\n\nBecause right now, someone shipping quietly gets less visibility than someone summarizing loudly.\n\nAI didn’t create the incentive problem.

That stuff doesn't come back.\n\n  \nWe had a feature request resurface as a \"new\" priority. Scoped it from scratch with \"fresh context\" like you described. Shipped it. Then someone found the original killed ticket and it had 3 customer conversations attached that completely changed how we should have approached it. We basically built the wrong version because we treated it as new when it wasn't.\n\n  \nNow I do what you do - kill the ticket - but I keep a lightweight doc with the raw customer signal.

If it doesn't come back it never mattered. The fresh context point is the part people miss. A ticket written 8 months ago has assumptions baked in that probably aren't true anymore. The team changed, the system changed, the priorities changed.

You can be the best pm ever by purist definitions of the job but still fail miserably, vice versa.\n\nSo start by asking yourself what your goal is. Do you want to become a great builder or just climb corporate ladder? \n\nYou can do both but most of the time it’s a push and pull in between.\n\nAfter a decade, I would say great product manager optimizes for what they want. Figuring out what you want is the half of the journey - it also changes with you along the way. \n\nOne rule is never to stop improving yourself, rest you will figure out in time. There is no one great form of a PM. It’s agile (pun intended).",

Do the PM work around it: who it’s for, what problem, what you shipped first, what changed after feedback.\n* Volunteer for product ownership wherever you are. Own a feature, a workflow, an experiment. Titles don’t matter as much as ownership.\n* Do real teardowns. Pick a product you use and write a one-pager: user goal, friction, metric, hypothesis, experiment.\n* Freelancing can work, but only if you’re actually making product decisions, not just taking orders.\n\nConfidence in PM comes from shipping, being wrong, and adjusting.

I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. But being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

      "text": "  \n👀 Here’s my thinking: The same over-the-top AI hype that’s pushing PMs to learn more and do more is also giving them an out.  \n  \nThe PM role was already extremely demanding before the AI hype: you need to be part psychologist to understand users, part strategist to set direction, part salesperson to pitch your ideas, part analyst to make sense of data, part designer to have a vision for the experience, part project manager to keep things moving, and part diplomat to navigate stakeholder politics.   \n  \nIt’s A LOT of different skills just to do the baseline job well. All while managing people who don’t report to you and taking responsibility for outcomes you don’t fully control.  \n  \nNow on top of all that there’s this whole new layer of expectations where PMs need to prove they’re AI people too. Already there are product leaders out there who are demanding that PMs MUST show side projects, vibe coding skills, GitHub activity and prompt libraries just to get hired. Like... their actual work isn’t already hard enough.  \n  \nMeanwhile most product managers are not having good day-to-day experiences on their jobs. Most scaling organisations are struggling to figure out how to give autonomy without losing alignment. How to move fast without creating chaos. How to make decisions without needing multiple layers of approvals. How to stay agile without constant reorgs. These tradeoffs on their own are genuinely hard to balance… and now there’s the AI FOMO in the mix too.   \n  \nSo here’s my logic:  \n  \nPMs already have most of what they need to build products. They know how to find problems, talk to users, figure out what to build, and design decent experiences. The missing piece to complete ownership was needing engineers to actually ship.  \n  \nBut the new AI tools that they’re now asked to learn remove that blocker.  \n  \nSo I bet these multitalented people will soon realise they can build their own thing without needing anyone’s approval or budget or roadmap sign-off.   \n  \nActual autonomy. Real speed. Freedom to execute.  \n  \nSo the best PMs - the frustrated PMs - are going to be facing a dilemma: keep doing the extremely demanding job with all the stakeholders and politics and meetings, or go build something they’re excited about on their own terms.  \n  \nSome will stay. But many are going to try their own thing. And companies with uninspiring missions, unclear strategies and poor operating systems are going to have a hard keeping them.",

The hard parts are domain depth, legacy integrations, compliance, safety, procurement cycles, change management, and proving ROI to risk-averse buyers. AI tools dont remove those constraints - they mostly compress parts of execution, not the whole system around it. And this is not even mentioning hardware PMs, where you deal with supply chains, physical constraints, certifications, and timelines where one mistake costs millions. Thats a completly different game.\n\nAlso, \"PMs can now just build their own thing\" glosses over what a real business is. A product is not a demo. Its distribution, trust, support, SLAs, security reviews, contracts, industry relationships, and the stamina to survive 12-24 month sales cycles. That is a very different skill stack and also risk profile vs employment. Many people underestmate this part.\n\nAI absolutely lowers the cost of prototyping. It does not magically give product-market fit, credibility in regulated industries, or access to buyers. In many non-consumer sectors, the moat is context, relationships, and operational maturity - not who can vibe-code fastest.\n\nGenerally, I also feel consumer/app/saas PMs are the most vocal part of the PM crowd online, but I dont think they are the biggest part of the profession. A lot of PM work happens in less visible, more complex environments where the constraints are just different.\n\nSo yes, some PMs will go solo. But the idea that large numbers of experienced PMs in complex B2B environments can simply peel off and outbuild companies because of AI tools feels overstated to me. The leverage AI provides is real, but the bottlenecks in these markets are mostly human, organizational, and structural - and those didnt get automated.",

If the site isn't super complicated and you're an experienced PM you can probably build it yourself.\n\nMy personal prediction is a little short of this.  I think that product teams just get smaller.  You still have a tech lead to keep an eye on things and you still have a visual designer type person (perhaps that's just the PM if they're good a visual design) but you don't have this huge team with two scrum teams, a dedicated design group, etc....  My last startup was 50 people which seemed insanely small at the time.  Today, I could build that entire product with three people easily.  \n\nOf course, sales and marketing are another thing.

As per the framework, the team is the \"guide\" and the user/customer the hero. Therefore, you need to extend the framework by \"what is the personal reward for the guide?\" aspect. \n\nAlso: Get kids :-). You become an amazing storyteller if you try an \"opt-in\" approach with activities; the huge benefit: difficulty scales automatically. It is simple to get a 3 year old to be excited, however the final boss is a 14 year person who is slightly addicted to social media with a raging hormonal imbalance.... Also, you can rent kids from family members for free or even better: they might pay you for your service. You are welcome.\n\n",

It’s about helping people understand *why* something matters and *what to do next*.\n\nA few concrete ways to improve it:\n\n* Start with the decision, not the background. Lead with “We should do X because Y,” then explain how you got there. Most PMs bury the point.\n* Anchor everything to a user problem. If you can’t explain the pain in one sentence, the story isn’t ready.\n* Use before/after framing. What’s broken today, what changes if we ship this, what stays the same if we don’t.\n* Practice one-minute summaries. If you can’t explain the idea clearly in a minute, it’s probably not clear yet.\n* Watch where people interrupt. Confusion shows up as questions in the middle of your story. That’s your feedback loop.\n\nYou’ll know it’s working when meetings get shorter, fewer people argue past each other, and decisions happen faster.",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

I know this sounds obvious but most PMs write great docs and then stumble through presenting them. the story that reads well isn't the same as the story that sounds good.\n\nfor measuring improvement - are people remembering what you said? are they repeating your framing back to you? that's the real signal.\n\nwhat context are you usually storytelling in? exec presentations? sprint planning? roadmap reviews? the approach shifts a bit depending on audience.",

          "text": "Communication = Alignment. It goes both ways \n\nUntil it comes more naturally, it might be helpful to write down your talking points. It sounds pretty basic but you need to be really clear to identify what are your goals that you plan to communicate. That usually comes in the form of thoughtful planning, supporting data and ultimately a talk track. Take some time to write down your core goal and work backwards how you can get there - AI can help get you started or unstuck here. This is the same for nearly all kinds of communication. \n\nNow it gets different depending on who your audience is:\nThe number 1 communication skill I’ve learned is knowing your audience. Who are they, what do they care about and how you can add value. Sometimes your message is inspirational, strategy based (resource/output management) or performance (KPI, engagement or financial). Don’t be afraid to ask what they think is important or what their goals are. \n\nThe life hack here is to strategically meet with each of your stakeholders 1-1 before your group meeting. Ask them what their needs are, hesitations with your plan. Share your ideas on how everyone could win. Hear them out. Get their feedback solo, and then you have time to message based on everyone’s core input. \n\nAlso…Many times, a PM is a moderator. State the goal of your communication- hold that as a North Star if someone derails. There was a great post here recently on how to manage moderation while you’re trying to communicate. I’ll look up the post and post a reply.",

I discovered I say \"um\" way more than I thought and bury my main point 3 minutes in.\n\ncoming from QA/BA/dev you probably already have the technical vocabulary. the PM shift is more about adapting your style to different audiences - engineers want different info than execs want different info than customers.\n\nwhat specific situations are tripping you up? async vs sync? presentations vs 1:1s? stakeholder updates?",

I've seen a lot of intrapersonal career kerfuffles in folks at various age-ranges.\n\n\nIt seems most people want to be challenged. Even if they feel downtrodden or burnt out, they enjoy some conflict and some struggle, and change. But sometimes, people get really lost— both overconfidently blowing their net worth on a startup or hypoconfidently locking themselves away.\n\n\nIf you're in an extreme mental space, I very much recommend a therapist that's a life coach for people with your experience. Because it's work-centric, the average therapist isn't equipped to deal with our concerns, like: I don't even have to work; why am I putting up with this; I make more money from the stock market than my job; my equity pays out in the next 3 years and I can buy more houses. I've heard of, and experienced, multiple therapists that give just straight up bad advice because they can't understand the person's perspective.\n\n\nFor me personally, if you're confident you can reach the cliff, I'd stick it out for the year and meanwhile find a challenge and/or a change. I'm not big on specifics—don't like to narrow things down until I absolutely have to. So I'd look forward to the idea of change and kind of get that ball rolling. But be careful, I was too good last year at putting feelers out before the cliff and now some of my prior equity is up in the air.\n\n\nIt's also good to build hobbies.

Does anyone have experience building solutions using agentic AI in the healthcare operations context? How do you manage when it requires the use of PHI? As an example thinking about solutions that could help with care navigation and closing the referral loop. \n\nSorry if this is a ramble but like so many others I just feel so “behind” and I’m struggling to really figure out how realistic is it is to take advantage of this type of technology in the healthcare space.

We use client side KMS in AWS to encrypt PHI to be shared between users. This data was embedded in DICOM images and we had to strip it out, encrypt and serve it encrypted.\n\nThis can be HIPAA compliant.\n\nSo long as it is encrypted at rest and in transit and only unencrypted for users whom have the privilege level to see PHI then you're good. For practical purposes the sonographers needed to be able to see this data so they knew which patient they were dealing with.\n\nI think an LLM would need to be agnostic to any PHI and only deal with the facts for analysis.",

Our packaged offering includes:\n\n\\- Data warehouse\n\n\\- Data administration application\n\n\\- Reporting tool\n\nThe company’s strategic direction is to move analytical workloads and customer reporting off the warehouse and instead bet on a Lakehouse offering (Amazon S3 Tables (Iceberg) + Athena to be precise). In this new model, there would be no traditional data warehouse - all analytical data would live on S3 tables and be queried directly.\n\nCustomer use cases today:\n\n\\- Customers ingest data from multiple sources into the platform\n\n\\- We provide out-of-the-box data products (enriched tables, views, dashboards, etc.)\n\n\\- Customers can build their own transformations, reports, and dashboards on top of this delivered content\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this shift primarily through a product lens, not just an infrastructure or cost lens.\n\nFor PMs who’ve been involved in similar transitions:\n\n\\- Have you built or owned a data platform without a traditional data warehouse?\n\n\\- What worked well, and what didn’t?\n\n\\- Where did this show up for customers (performance, flexibility, trust, usability)?\n\n\\- Any things PMs tend to underestimate in “warehouse-less” architectures?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences and lessons learned from a Product perspective.",

          "text": "Platform and Data PM here for a multi-tenant solution sold to customers in highly regulated industries. Hosted in our cloud or theirs (hyper scalers) which made all of this so much fun. \n\nFor the customers we hosted in our cloud (AWS)\n\nI started with a data warehouse. We had several sources (relational and non relational DBs, runtime resources logs, server logs, etc) for a complex solution that was generating up to 1 TB of data from the largest customer and it needed proper ETL pipelines to give us all the Parquet format files in S3 and queried internally using Athena at the start. \n\nI had up to 2k customers. Think of every bank in the world, health providers, governments, logistics and even defence companies. They all used our previous solution (client server self hosted) and had developed a myriad of dashboards tailored to their business. \n\nI had pressure from my stakeholders to provide dashboards for customers to view their data but I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to find a one size fits all solution and I didn’t want to be a PowerBI PM. My approach was to prioritize solutions to give customers access to data via APIs so they could all do what they want. I eventually added UIs to manage the data they had in our cloud (set retention periods, create archives, etc)\n\nCustomers were fine with this approach. I had to put some effort on defining rules to manage costs. External data transfers of the volumes we run are expensive so I had to put cooldowns on some of the endpoints. \n\nAt this stage I’m working on a solution to stream/share some of the operational data we get in AWS for monitoring customer runtime resources health, status, etc We use this internally just for a health dashboard but customers need this too (we already have a UI they can check but they want real time data to be consumed by applications they developed to track and alert)\n\nMy advice. Have a warehouse, build customer facing dashboards only if you know they’ll be usable for all and keep customisation to a minimum or you’ll be building a BI platform. Implement and enforce retention periods to manage costs (if the volumes will make even S3 a burden). Consider giving access to customers via APIs for specific use cases. ",

          "text": "To answer 1:\nI was a data engineer when I built a data lake (Cloudera directly on HDFS with Hive as DB engine to load these parquets/avro files as external tables). At some point I migrated them to Azure HDInsight (ugh, top-down decision bc of “networking”).\n\nAs a PM I have managed a few “data warehouse” like redshift.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts on it, but keep it mind that I wasn’t a PM during data lake period.\n\n2. For data lake, as you might have already know, it “can” be cheaper, and powerful as in you can make decisions on low level things. This is a double edge sword because it’s shifting the cost from infrastructure to operation/maintenance.\n\nFor an instance, schema evolution can be quite complicated. Altering a table shape involves modifying the data files which is a very expensive operation. It might as well be creating a new external table. This is very different from redshift where the DB engine manages these things for you. Modern tool like Iceberg solves this issue, but it means it’s another tool and complexity you need to deal with.\n\nAnother example, you get to decide a storage format specifically optimized for  your own use case. Like parquet vs avro for an example. Redshift does have its own read optimization which most of the time probably is more efficient. But for some specific cases parquet can be more efficient.\n\nThere are some other advantages for data-lake for its file-based storage like, exporting is a lot easier since the file format is universally accepted and can be directly sent, while redshift requires you to query and export.\n\nIf I want to summarize into one thing, it would be the cost advantage as long as you are aware that the cost is shifted to operations & maintenance, not magically disappeared.\n\nAnd operations and maintenance is something you can control based on how much you want to optimize the performance and efficiency. Which leads to your next question.\n\n3. Where did this show up for customers:\nPerformance, can be as good or better in niche cases, based on how much effort your team put to optimize these. (Again, cost)\n\nFlexibility, depends on what you meant by this, like can your customers easily modify a table? Not as easy as redshift (but, should they even?). To ingest the data? Probably easier and more flexible as I mentioned above.\n\nTrust, the governance will be more on your team to integrate and maintain a tool to manage the governance, again, pushing cost to operation and maintenance. But if you meant trust as in compute accuracy, that probably be the same. Usability, if it’s UI dashboard tooling, the same if you are able to manage the data catalog underlying it. If you are talking about ingestion, probably easier and more efficient “technically”. If they export the results from a UI tool or a query then the same.\n\n\n4. Underestimates.\nHmm, this is where I’m not sure I can answer. I wasn’t a PM when I built data lake. But it’s gonna be the same thing I mentioned (again): cost doesn’t magically disappear, you shift it to operation and maintenance which you can control.\n\n- governance: now you have to built or integrate a tool for governance layer by yourself. \n- performance now is more on you.\n- your team will get exposed to much more complexity than redshift. I hope my examples can give you some ideas, but there will be a lot more. Many unknown unknowns. It will be a long term project where your team will discovers more issues and improvements to do.\n\nI kept all these on high level, feel free to shoot any follow up questions. I’ll answer if I know.",

          "text": "My biggest recommendation is immediately identifying your scalability and latency requirements then partnering with your architect on a structured evaluation. I’ve inherited transformations like this where those details werent factored in, which ultimately led to a rewrite the entire product.\n\nYou mentioned Athena, but you need to be sure this choice is validated by meeting your requirements at scale under the particular conditions of your customers while meeting both your SLAS and staying at an effective cost. This is where the real tradeoffs really show up and can lead to more complex solutions or leveraging technologies like redshift spectrum or snowflake. Ex. \nDo you have interactive workloads for online users or scheduled workloads? Maybe a mix where you can request to run now or schedule for a specific time?\nAre these able to be lazily delivered just in time, or are they required for automated data pipelines on the customer side and always need to be generated exactly on time based on data that may only arrive x minutes before the schedule.\nHow does late arriving data get handled? Does it regenerate previous reports and notify the customer or require requery? \nIs there a latency sla where you may need to autoscale within x minutes/seconds to handle workloads scheduled to run at 4am after a batch job uploads data at 3am but before their business starts at 7am?\nDo you have controls in place to cost manage customer queries? When you ran these workloads in postgres you had a fixed cost in the size of your db, with serverless/on-demand you are often charged based on data scanned not returned. a customer could query 1000s of columns over years of data to aggregate their top 5 most sold products and every time they load this table cost you $20, while adding a 30 day lookback or aggregations at the monthly level for historical data could cut that cost to pennies.\n\nIn cloud the usual gotchas are a lack of real world cost controls on the queries and service scalability limits by cloud providers where you can only run X jobs per cloud account/region. You can mitigate these by 1. Partner early with architecture and make sure you have a pressure tested plan on resource scalability, latency, cost tradeoffs that doesnt open up existential vulnerabilities 2. Work with your cloud service provider so that they can help you cost out the solution and raise/work around various service limits. There are entire PS teams of people that your aws account exec can give you free credits to support this analysis if requested. They’ll throw free expert support at you because they’re ultimately motived by influenced revenue + potential to use you as a customer reference after your migration.",

          "text": "Yup, worked for a couple years in B2B/B2C for a company with split teams. 2 onshore devs + a QA and then 4-5 offshore devs + a QA. I had an offshore 'counterpart' that I spoke with daily during the couple of overlapping hours I had. \n\nNow, the truth is I imagine this depends HEAVILY on the organization you're working with. Talking to other stateside folks that've gone through the experience, it can vary significantly. Some folks said their offshore team was more or a less a black box with a single point of contact. They'd send over requirements in PDF format and do all the back and forth over estimates and questions and delivery via email/chat with that single POC. On the flipside, others (like myself) it was more like any other development experience. They'd get on standup, attend grooming, etc. Our onshore devs and them would work together on stuff. Etc etc. The only big difference was there was a 2 hour window in the morning where our schedules overlapped so if they asked a question at 8am....and I answered at 8:05, it wasn't getting 'done' until the next day. It did heavily impact timelines as a result. \n\n> what surprised you\n\nThey did everything they could to appear westernized. They used American names on calls (which got funny because they chose ones like \"Elvis\" and \"Vinnie\"). When one of them would have a kid, they'd give them a western name (in addition to a Sichuanese one). Any attempt on our end to try and learn their Sichuanese names was rebuffed. This also extended to even things like talking about their food and culture. They did everything they could to essentially hide anything about their personal culture, but they did it by putting up a western facade. They'd never mention any of the foods they liked or ate unless it was something stereotypically western. \n\nThey took all the normal Chinese holidays you're familiar with, but never spoke about it at all. Like we'd all talk about Christmas or Diwali or Hannukah, and they'd ask questions and such about those holidays, but if we asked about what their plans were or what have you, they'd clam up. It was kind of wild. \n\n> what was harder than expected\n\nLearning how to write requirements that worked for them. Obviously there were linguistic aspects I had to be mindful of, but also dissecting even the most technical language required a bit of trial and error. Add in the time difference and yeah, it got complicated. I'd write a requirement and send it over to them. Onshore, it'd take 5 minutes. Because because they were offshore and 12 hours apart, it was a full day turnaround. And if they had a question, it doubled the time...because again, I didn't get the question until the next day and they didn't see my answer until 12 hours later. Even when my schedule changed and I had more overlap in the evening instead (ie: They were starting their day in my evening), it was time consuming and challenging to sort out requirements with them.\n\n> what was better than expected\n\nTheir ingenuity. I assumed they'd be more like typical contractors where they'd build exactly what I asked for (or close enough) and nothing else. If I told them to build a wheel but only described 330* of it, I'd get a wheel missing 30* type stuff, ya know? \n\nThey made a serious effort to understand the product, the customer, etc. They REALLY liked when I included them in discovery. We got some great solutions from them. They also tended to play with ideas if they were light on work, which was neat. They were genuinely pretty skilled engineers, though they sometimes went rogue and instead of getting a full 360* wheel...I'd get a tank tread. \n\nThey were also really approachable and friendly. I got to know my counterpart pretty well, or at least as well as she felt was okay. They'd hop on calls with their kids and their kids knew who we were and such. We even had a sort of happy hour not long after COVID hit. They were in Chengdu so they were in like HARD lockdown, but we all hopped on a party call and talked about it over drinks. \n\nThey came over here a couple times prior to COVID too which was cool.\n\n> whether you’d do it again\n\nWhile I ultimately did enjoy working with them, and would do so if they were onshore, I wouldn't do offshore again if I could help it. There were always knowledge transfer issues, and since they were contractors we were also somewhat hamstrung on how much they could impact. Additionally, there WAS a certain amount of territorialism at play at all times. It was less that we didn't want them to have the 12 herbs and spices, but more that we didn't want to be in a position where we didn't have the 12 herbs and spices if that makes sense. It made planning things challenging because sometimes I'd have to slice up work in an illogical way because we wanted onshore devs working on the core pieces, even though it may have made more sense from a productivity standpoint to slice it up differently. \n\nAlso, ultimately they had their own marching orders and such and they'd periodically get shuffled around, frequently despite our requests for certain devs to remain on certain teams. \n\nAnd I'm 95% sure when they added \"Ethan\" to our team as a 5th dev during COVID, it was actually just Elvis with two logins and a pay bonus to push out front end work for 2.",

Let's call it \"All\" or \"Nothing\". \n\nNOTHING: \n\nYou get hired as a PM with a mandate to launch a new product in a very specific timeframe. The company has never done this before and while you have some expertise in the domain, you're not an expert. The catch is you have no team, no data, no infrastructure...yet. Everyone is being hired from outside the company and yet - you must research, design, build and manage (aka invent) everything from production cadence to frameworks as you go. When new people come on board, you not only have to onboard them but then coordinate with them on how to move forward. Any budgetary issues - environment setup, software, HPC stack, etc.. must be vetted, approved and then reviewed before they can be implemented. Not to mention reviewed and approved by a compliance team and the COO. You onboard an entire team except UX/VD because engineering took over the budget and hired more back-end devs using the UX budget for themselves forcing you to do all of that on top of your own product role. Management doesn't care because again - the product leaders are all ex-engineering and there is very little UX representation around the company. \n\nALL: \n\nYou get hired as a PM to build out an AI powered ETL/Data Lake that ingests over 3000 different API sources to power a database with a search engine on top. Search is inference powered using GCP and there is zero standardization on any of the data inputs. REST? Yes. SOAP? Yes. XML and CSV manually sent over as a physical file attachment? Oh yes. Despite all of the data having the same overall purpose, you not only have very little consistency in data formatting but also specific redactions in the API called due to complicated and ever changing privacy rules. Then - two outsourced teams. One in Europe who are really good but disagree with everything and often build conflicting systems with zero oversight from management (don't upset the apple cart) and another in India who are woefully incompetent and break all security and engineering best practices just to make deadlines. Now have both teams fight on backlogs and any management of sprint planning or UAT is your problem with QA just rejected anything and everthing to cover their asses. \n\nThat was mine. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m a senior PM and I’m looking to improve my strategic articulation. Basically, speaking in a way that sounds strategic, both at work and in interviews. I know that sounding strategic signals professionalism and seniority, and it’s something I really want to get better at.\n\nI’ve been practicing with ChatGPT, and the feedback I’m getting is that I have the capabilities, but I struggle with how I explain things. I often use too many qualifiers and don’t always finish my thoughts in a strong, strategic way.\n\nI’m looking for advice: Are there any books I can read daily to get more familiar with strategic phrasing? Any YouTube videos, speakers, or people I should follow to develop this skill?",

          "text": "To be clear, there’s a difference between speaking well and being strategic in your thoughts, plans, and presentations. The former simply has to do with your ability to convey your ideas in a manner that makes sense to your audience, and often that includes your ability to articulate complex ideas eloquently, to speak concisely, and comvey emotion and evoke feelings from your audience when appropriate. \n\nBeing strategic is different though. You can think and speak strategically, but be a poor speaker and communicator. Being strategic simply means that you’re thinking long term rather than short term. For example, one might present a new product idea and talk about how much revenue can be made. That’s tactical. A strategic communicator will talk about that new product’s long term impact on the rest of the product portfolio, the downstream market opportunities it opens, the moves it may force upon competitors, the regulatory hurdles one could face as the space matures, etc. \n\nSo speaking well and thinking strategically are two different skills. If you can master both, you’ll set yourself up for success as a senior PM.",

Since you mentioned a strategic approach, you can start with recognizing the common types of questions you'll encounter and frameworks to use. Something that might help you out with that is the book *Cracking the PM Interview*. There's also *Case in Point*, which is actually more for consulting but might still help with preparing for case interviews. And it might already be obvious, but try practicing with a friend, better if it's someone who's not a PM/doesn't have the technical background so you're forced to simplify your language and be clearer, more concise. Lastly, practice with real PM interview questions (I can recommend a compilation of this!) and time and record yourself to sort of simulate the interview environment.",
