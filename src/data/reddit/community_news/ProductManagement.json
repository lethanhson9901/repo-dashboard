But I'm curious why people who seem to have stable 300K jobs in big tech are out piggy backing those names to sell courses on Maven and elsewhere.  Is the job not good enough where they then want to take learning funds from the rest of the Fortune 500 just to teach them stuff that is freely available on YouTube?\n\nI'm all for courses if valuable and self learning, but if you're getting paid 300K ten years in to be a semi-fluffy PM doing talks all week, and have the time to work on a course...how busy is your day job really?",

We will go through a refinement session in a sprint but that is not for going into details of prd of the next sprint, only to confirm the items we have lined up are aligned with our OKRs still. The planning session is hell because now the devs are forced to read the prd in whole and only then they push back on the requirements that are written like no we shouldn’t show a dialogue here a toast will do or no we shouldn’t redirect on the same tab let’s navigate user to a new tab etc. And now it takes hours to go through all the tickets (and plus we do planning for mobile app separately to the web app so planning takes a whole day just for a 2-week sprint). \n\nIt all comes back to the rationale of recording the source of truth, a document that anyone can come back and read at anytime to know exactly the requirements and the flow and the UI of a feature, and I understand it but it’s just exhausting.

Please serve as my expert consultants. I don't know what I don't know so please guide the conversation. Once you have the information you need to make a comprehensive PRD, please output it in this format: (User Story, Summary, Core User Flow, Functional Requirements, Expected Behavior, Design/Ul Components, Acceptance Criteria, Success Metrics).\n \n  2. SPEAK (voice dictation) to answer each question from your team of Al PM's. Speaking gets you a lot more nuance translated over to your Al and is so much faster than typing out an 800 word reply for every question.\n \n 3. They'll ask you about 15 - 30 questions. It's truly a journey and you'll be surprised at how much you actually missed in your initial assumptions. I've had a Q&A sesh go 114 questions once - but my god were we thorough.\n \n 4. Your GPT team will only ever produce an 80% complete/accurate PRD. Audit the final output of your PRD. Sanity check it, and make sure all the jargon is translated into something that actually makes sense for your team.\n \n 5. Have a dev/designer give it a final check.",

It's a decision-making structure where the person with the most context gets overruled by the person with the most authority, and when it blows up the authority claims nobody could have known. That's not a personality problem. That's how most orgs actually work under the Agile vocabulary.\n\nYou raised the issue. Got berated in front of the team. Raised it again. Got dismissed. Your skip had to step in. That sequence tells you everything you need to know. Your boss isn't going to suddenly start listening because he was wrong once. He's going to find a way to make this your fault or nobody's fault and keep the same dynamic running.\n\nWhat actually works here. First, write a short post-mortem. Not a blame document. Frame it as \"here's what happened, here's when it was flagged, here's the cost of the delay, here's how we avoid it next time.\" Put it in writing. Send it to your skip and your boss. The facts protect you better than any conversation.\n\nSecond, start sending short written recommendations before key decisions. One paragraph. \"Here's what I recommend and why. Flagging risk X if we go the other way.\" When you're right, the paper trail exists. When you're wrong, nobody cares because you were transparent about uncertainty. The point isn't to say \"I told you so.\" The point is to make the pattern visible so it can't be rewritten later.\n\nThe real problem isn't this one decision. It's that your org has someone making product calls who berates the person with better information instead of listening. No retro fixes that. No framework fixes that. That's a power structure question, and the only move is to make your judgment visible enough that the right people notice the pattern.",

      "text": "Serious question.\n\nIs a half-ass product manager better than no product manager?\n\nI’m talking about PMs who:\n\n• Write vague and incomplete PRDs\n\n• Don’t fully align stakeholders or teams \n\n• Prioritize everything and nothing all at once\n\n• Don’t understand or even attempt to understand the product\n\nSince they rely so heavily on inputs from others, it feels like design and development teams are doing the PM job anyway. We identify gaps in PRDs, highlight the edge cases and even decide the priority of features. At that point I wonder: would no PM actually be more efficient? At least the respective teams would self-organize. \n\nCurious where PMs in this community stand on this - is a PM who does half the work still a net positive, or can it become net negative?",

Aligning stakeholders becomes a wild-goose chase because the stakeholders are bad at *their* jobs.

They can be out of touch with the users of their product, the low-level processes, and make rash decisions or mandates of Product Management that eventually undermine the success.  You can set priorities and boundaries all you want with this type of stakeholder, but if your management bends the knee to them, if you are not empowered to speak the whole truth, if you have not been in the role long enough to prove yourself, or if there are hidden personal biases at play with powerful stakeholders, then it can be an uphill battle.\n\nSo, your post has some good points identifying some real issues, but underlying the whole post is that the fault is solely on the shoulders of the PM.  There could be some real powerful factors within your company's own management structure and the Stakeholder client apparatus that makes their job difficult, and if they are the only person in PM doing the rolled up tasks of a BA, a Product Manager and a Project Manager, while having to accommodate internal Sales and Executive demands, I would say they have never been empowered to do their job well.\n\nWhat is often the case in almost all IT organizations or a lot of organizations' IT departments is there is a general mindset (that is wrong) that resources and investment need to occur in the design/build space, but not in the upfront business needs and requirements space.  THIS IS THE REASON WHY up to 90% of IT projects fail.  PM doesn't have the proper and right amount of resources and are not given the right amount of time to do their job.  There is a constant push to be \"coding\" something even if the requirements are not fully fleshed, validated, etc.",

It's not ideal, but it's clear.\nIn the second case, however:\n– decisions appear to be made, but aren't\n– priorities shift indiscriminately\n– work is done twice\n– responsibility is dispersed.\nThe problem is that no one can intervene, because \"the PM is there,\" even if only formally...\n\nThe real question, in my opinion, isn't whether it's better to have a mediocre PM or none at all, but rather if design and development are already doing discovery, prioritization, and scoping, then the PM's role isn't governing the product but merely formalizing it after the fact.\nIn that case, it's not a question of the person, but of an unclear role.\nA good PM is one who creates direction, makes decisions, and maintains focus. If these three things aren't happening, the role is decorative and weighs more heavily than a void.\n\nCurious to hear the PMs' perspective here: when have you seen a team function better without a PM? And what was really missing when the PM was there?",

They talk to users, they read support tickets, they sit in on sales calls. It's messy and inefficient but the feedback reaches the people making decisions. The signal is unfiltered.\n\n  \nWhen there's a half-ass PM, everyone assumes \"the PM is handling that.\" The PM becomes a black box that absorbs customer feedback and outputs vague requirements. Nobody questions whether the PM actually understood the customer or just forwarded a request. The team stops talking to users because that's \"the PM's job\" now.\n\n  \nThe result: you go from imperfect-but-real customer signal to no signal at all, wrapped in the appearance of process. Teams build features based on a game of telephone where the PM didn't actually understand the original conversation.\n\n  \nAt least with no PM, the gap is visible. With a half-ass PM, the gap is hidden behind PRDs that look professional enough to ship but are completely disconnected from what users actually need.",

Overall, I am still enjoying the move because of all the things I had to learn along the way (introducing processes, aligning with founders, building and sharing the vision and strategy, etc.). However, the main challenge I haven't overcome yet is dealing with junior devs, who are basically the whole dev team at this start-up.\n\nTo be clear, there are definitely some advantages compared to the more senior devs I used to work with at my previous company: these junior devs are more ambitious, they are AI-native and they have no problem with working long hours. Main downsides are: terrible at estimating work and they don't like to do \"the boring work\" like implementing tests and reviewing code.\n\nAt the same time, since AI is already taking over a lot of the coding work and they don't like to do the boring admin work, they are now spending more and more of their time playing PM and/or designer, minus actually doing product work, like talking to customers or doing market research. They are constantly making random product decisions based on their own personal assumptions, often with complete disregard for what the product designer and I had already prepared.\n\nWhen we push back on these ideas, they become extremely defensive and even rebellious. So much of my time is now spent debating with devs about product decisions (showing the data, explaining the vision, using customer testimonials) instead of doing actual product work like talking to customers.\n\nAny ideas on how to navigate this?

          "text": "This sounds like a role clarity issue masquerading as a personality problem. You're dealing with a common startup dynamic where people step outside their swim lanes because the lanes were never clearly marked in the first place.  \n  \nThe good news is that you can actually fix this. The bad news is it requires a conversation that might feel uncomfortable at first.  \n  \nStart by establishing what each role is actually accountable for. In empowered product teams, collaboration is not consensus or democracy. It's about deferring to expertise. If the decision pertains to technology, you defer to the tech lead. If it pertains to customer experience, you defer to the designer. If it pertains to business constraints and value, that's where you own the decision as PM.  \n  \nRight now your junior devs are making product decisions because nobody told them that's not their job. They probably think they're being helpful. So have a direct conversation with them about how decisions get made. Walk through a few recent examples and explain the rationale you and the designer used, including the customer data, market research, and business context they didn't have access to.  \n  \nThen set up a regular discovery cadence where they're actually involved early, not after decisions are made. Sit around prototypes together. Let them see the customer conversations. Give them context on the business constraints. This way they get to contribute their technical insights where they matter most, and they understand why certain product decisions were made.  \n  \nWhen disagreements happen, run a test. Make it cheap and fast. Prototype it, test it with real users, collect data. This shifts the conversation from opinion to evidence.  \n  \nThe defensiveness you're seeing is probably coming from two places. First, they feel like their ideas are being shot down without being heard. Second, they don't have enough context to understand why your decisions are better informed. Fix both of those and the pushback should ease up considerably.  \n  \nOne more thing: if they're spending this much time on product work, they're either avoiding the hard engineering work they don't like, or they genuinely don't have enough hard engineering problems to solve. Make sure you're giving them technically challenging work that requires their actual expertise. Junior devs who are bored will absolutely wander into someone else's job.",

Effectively, this is demonstrating your product sense.\n\nNext, point out what gaps exist from the research / etc. that aren’t being covered.

If this is not truly new behavior and they've always done PM work, then it is more than insubordinate employees, it is learned behavior that has been supported by executive management.  Without executive management coming in and laying down the new law, you will never get buy-in and support.  If that is what is going on, I would explain this to the management.\n\nYou pointed out the pros in having junior devs, but you failed to point out the very important disadvantage in failing to have a senior dev in a manager role.  They need to be managed by one of their own, and that role is almost your co-lead in the product on the technical side.  Of course, you interact with, take questions, review the UI, do all those things you would normally do, but when they are out-of-line . . . not doing the \"boring\" work as they describe which is absolutely essential, their engineering manager is dealing with that.\n\nHOWEVER, if they have never done PM work, and now because of your arrival they are taking that on, it is because they lack respect for you, or the management that made the decision to bring you on, or both.\n\nIt is absolutely amazing to me how many start-ups load up their company with nothing but devs and no PM people, likely because they are doing that work, and then realize they don't have the time to do it well.  Every organization, even startups should have non-executive PMs from the start or at least a small team of BAs that they manage.\n\nYou are dealing with the fallout of poor planning, a weak understanding of the importance of PM, especially in the initial stages of a new product.\n\nGet your leadership to hire an engineering manager.  Get your leadership to have a team meeting, explaining your role and theirs (the junior devs) and push back on any product work they do.  If they make product decisions without consulting you, keep track of them, because it may be a long list that goes into a PIP later, if they fail to change.",

Now that you’re there, from their perspective it can feel like someone just showed up and started saying no to ideas they used to run with.\n\nMaybe it’s not your case, but often the conflict is less about seniority and more about ownership.\n\nWhat usually helps is making the decision boundaries very explicit, instead of debating every idea case by case:\n- Product defines which problems and metrics matter.\n- Engineering decides how to solve them.\n- Anyone can participate in the process and suggest ideas, but they’re treated as hypotheses, not decisions.\n\nWithout that clarity, every feature discussion you have turns into an argument about who gets to decide what, and that gets exhausting very quickly.\n\nThe other practical thing is to stop debating solutions and anchor everything on one or two core problems, especially if your team still doesn’t trust you.

'here's what 15 users said about this exact workflow this month.' once the devs could see the real customer pain they mostly stopped pitching random ideas because their ideas couldn't compete with documented user frustration. the ambitious ones actually got really into it because now they felt like they were solving real problems instead of guessing. the key shift was from 'i'm the PM trust me' to 'here's what customers are telling us, let's solve this together.' also worth noting - some of their ideas might actually be good. the issue is they skip the validation step. channel that energy into lightweight user research instead of squashing it entirely.",

I use it to help draft specs, but I often spend a fair amount of time editing it afterwards. \n\n  \nThe new use case Opus 4.6 crushed was QA. We are a small company (40ish people) without dedicated a dedicated QA team, so everyone pitches in. I generally like that model, but I’m refactoring our permissions structure which means our automated tests are less consistent and there is A LOT to regress. \n\n  \nMy go-to LLM chat receptacle is Cursor, which has a brows but kept requiring input from me to continue, which defeats the point. However, having Cursor create a QA doc from the spec, along with stream of consciousness description from me of what I would qa, has resulted in strong qa docs I can then feed to Claude, which can qa with their chrome extension. \n\nIt churns through the whole doc while I do other work and then I can come back and check what areas it found issues in and focus more on those myself. I am not yet at the point where I trust it to send the issues it finds to eng, but it clear it’ll get there soon. \n\n  \nIt’s been an interesting if slightly spooky experience. ",

Stuff that used to take 2 hours of mechanical work and now takes 20 minutes.\n\n  \nBut the actual hard part of my job - figuring out what we should build based on contradictory customer feedback - AI hasn't touched that. I tried feeding it customer conversations and asking for patterns. The output looks impressive but misses the nuance that matters. Like, it'll tell you \"users want better reporting\" when the real insight buried in those conversations is that they don't trust the existing data and the reporting UI isn't the problem.\n\n  \nAI made me faster at the low-value stuff so I have more time for the high-value stuff. That's a genuine win. But anyone expecting it to replace the judgment part of PM work is going to be disappointed.",

This is a small company that doesn’t have a dedicated IT or Security hire, but has decided now is the time to buy Aha. \n\nThe best roadmap tool I ever used was just Jira. Initiatives and Epics, organized in the backlog. Everyone has visibility. You never need to transcribe things in external systems. If a stakeholder wants more info on status, they can just drill down. And yet, without trying it, everyone seems convinced this is not going to meet our needs and we need to buy Aha. \n\nAre you this kind of person? What makes you think a growth-stage / immature company needs both Aha and Jira? Convince me! I truly don’t understand it. ",

The confluence page just points to the epics, so you see the current status, but the actual stack rank is in Confluence so it doesn't change.  Then when we do quarterly planning, we mark each one as \"commit\", \"stretch\" or \"won't do.\"   Now I have a list of all the epics that we think we will get done this quarter.  I usually then build a quick slide deck for sales and mktg so they don't have to dig through Jira which they won't understand.  Takes me a couple of hours per quarter total.  \n\nSo, yes?

Strategy alignment, prioritization context, and organizing customer feedback usually end up scattered across docs and threads.\n\nThat’s where something like Aha comes in. It connects goals, initiatives, and feedback before work turns into epics, so roadmap decisions have clearer grounding. Otherwise teams often recreate that layer by stitching together multiple Atlassian tools.\n\nIt’s less about replacing Jira and more about separating planning from delivery. Jira tracks the work. Roadmapping tools help decide which work is worth tracking.",

The traditional PM who writes specs and throws them over the wall to engineering is the one getting squeezed, not the one thriving.\n\nThe real shift: AI doesn't make PM more essential.

Things like: who's your user, what's the actual pain point, what's your unfair advantage, and how do you know you're not just building what *you* want.\n\nThe tricky part is that most founders (myself included early on) skip validation because building feels more productive than talking to users. Having someone who forces that discipline — even part-time — makes a huge difference. Especially now that building is cheap, the cost of building the wrong thing is mostly time and focus, which are still expensive.\n\nIf you want to help founders, I'd say the most valuable thing is teaching them to kill ideas faster.

They analyze data, generate hypotheses, synthesize feedback, and propose options quickly and cheaply. It’s not hard to imagine a near future where large parts of discovery, prioritization, and early strategy run with very little human input.\n\nThe reason many AI-built products feel shallow right now has more to do with incentives and founder experience than a lack of PMs. Speed and novelty are rewarded, and many teams are still learning what good feedback loops look like. That gap will narrow as tools and practices mature.\n\nWhere humans still matter most is in influence. Getting alignment, building trust, navigating tradeoffs between teams, and turning insight into action inside real organizations are social problems. That work doesn’t scale the same way analysis does.\n\nSo the PM role doesn’t disappear, but it shifts. Less time spent deciding what’s “right” on paper, more time spent making things actually happen through people. Helping teams ship real products makes sense, as long as the value is rooted in execution and influence.",

But that’s not the real world is it? \n\nA more practical approach is to try the above but expect more of a win/lose compromise than a win/win collaboration. Set some context with your team’s key functional leads that you want to clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision making and draft a “working agreement” that captures which decisions each function owns and who makes decisions with regard to conflicts. The person who gets to carry the failure burden should make the case they’re ultimately accountable and _will_ have final say. \n\nNo one is going to love it but it does clear things up enough to reduce the number of conflicts by _some_ amount. Still, it’s more or less a bandage on a still weepy wound. \n\nThe harder play is a long term play that you need to do no matter what — you have to build a relationship with everyone. \n\nIt’s complicated because you’ll find that while it’s easier to trust some people you’ll also find it much harder with others for a variety or reasons that you mostly don’t control. When the trust is there, these conflicts tend to disappear in favor of having what feels like a normal conversation with friends deciding what bar to go to. When it isn’t, every conversation feels like a battle and that’s the kind of thing that just grinds both sides down. \n\nThe hard people is where you need to run _toward_ the problem. In my own career, I use the Johari window, Thomas-Kilmann conflict model, and the situational leadership framework and a heavy dose of facilitation techniques to work through those challenges. It’s rare that it solves the problem completely but it usually dramatically it improves things to the point my challenge colleagues become close enough to an ally that it’s all good. However, sometimes it just isn’t fixable or capable of being improved. If it’s a direct report, I get them off my team. If it’s a peer, I’ll compartmentalize them to keep their impact minimized. If it’s a senior leader, I’ll try to weave in points when I can but ultimately will exit myself from that situation. \n\nAnyhow, talk to your designer. Find out what they care about and why. Share the same for yourself. Ask them what they think they need to do to be successful in their role and you share the same. Try to build some common understanding of your roles. Then talk about concerns you both have with the way you’re working together. Look for some areas of agreement and build on that towards a decision. Honestly, this stuff is a lot of soft skills that most people are horrendous at but check out some books on facilitation techniques which will give you some tools.",

Here's what I've learned: the question \"who owns the final call\" is usually a symptom, not the actual problem.\n\nWhen collaboration works, you never need to pull rank. The real issue is almost always about how feedback is framed. \"Can you try something else\" feels like a taste call to a designer. \"This flow doesn't work because users need to do X before Y, and here's the support data\" gives them a problem to solve — which is what good designers actually want.\n\nIn practice, PM owns the outcome, designer owns the craft. But the best results I've seen come when you give designers the full business context upfront — the constraints, the user data, the strategic goals — and then let them explore solutions within that frame. When they understand *why* something matters, they design for it. When they don't, they design for aesthetics.\n\nOne thing that helped us a lot: never critique a design in terms of \"I don't like it.\" Always frame it as \"here's the user problem this doesn't solve yet.\" It completely changes the dynamic.",

But if you’re frequently asking for “other options” because something doesn’t feel right to you — that’s art-directing, not product managing. Designers can tell the difference, and it’s probably why you’re getting pushback.\n\nFrame feedback as problems, not requests for alternatives. “Can you try something else” feels like a taste call. “I’m worried users will drop off here because X” is a collaboration. One makes a designer defensive. The other makes them curious.\n\nYour previous designer may not have been more collaborative — they may have just been more compliant. A designer who defends their decisions with rationale is a good designer. Learn to work with that instead of treating it as a problem.\n\nThe “too pushy” comment is a real signal. Even delivered as a joke, it means your designer feels their expertise isn’t being respected. Try leading with “I trust your judgment on the visual execution — I want to flag a concern about the flow from a business angle.” Small shift, big difference.\n\nWhen you’re truly stuck, depersonalize it. Suggest a usability test. Nobody’s opinion wins; user behavior does.\n\nThe instinct to care about UX is great. Just make sure you’re bringing evidence and problems to the table, not alternative design solutions. That’s the line between a PM who’s a great design partner and one who’s a frustrating backseat driver.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

After I had already left. …I don’t believe this decision for product to have the final power was the reason people quit, but the fact that it came to a shouting match probably was. \n\nMy current designer and I have a “disagree but commit” agreement, where if it’s a “design decision”, unless I think it will impact KPIs, we document my disagreement but go with his decision.

It got so dragged out that I talked to my boss and let that design lead be the project owner.\n\nIn your case, since the designer is new, rank shouldn't be an issue. First chat with the designer about the collaboration style in their previous work and ask who they think own the product and responsibilities. If they says the PM owns the product metrics, the final decision should be yours. (This is to make them admit themselves that the PM own the product).   \nIf they are still being difficult, talk to their direct-report and ask for advice from your manager. Be careful approaching higher ups; they hate having problems brought to them. Instead of complaining, ask for advice, ask how they handled such situation in their career, and bring evidence why your decision is better than the designer.",

It’s important to be neutral and only answer fact based questions. I would then pass the feedback to the designer (good and bad).\n\nIt’s not uncommon for designers to give 2-3 options at the wireframe stage. Perhaps you can set the expectations ahead of time?

Still they should be able to communicate why this choice and how it aligns with the design system and overall best practices.\n\nI think as a PM your job is to communicate and cooperate with designers and developers alike, acting as the bridge and the glue in a sense of the product. So it's less about who should have the final say, and more how well you're able to communicate and cooperate with this designer. \n\nIf your relationship with this designer is unidirectional where you request something and they produce something, perhaps you can have a discussion with them regarding how you can have a more cooperative approach where you iterate together rather than work separately and simply judge the final design presented by the designer.\n\nOf course the art of communication is to maintain an open discussion and not let ego's and assumptions take the better of yourselves.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis may all sound obvious but in my experience good communication is hard to come by naturally and requires a lot of effort, when it doesn't happen issues like these drain everyone involved and the product suffers as a consequence.",

And if designer takes all my context/input into consideration and comes up with a design artifact I should respect the decisions made since they are the experts (unless I'm not coming from design with years of experience, but even in this case this might be disrespectful). Many times after working with a designer you know how much of this context you really need to exchange before in an alignment meeting or PRD, since I worked with such high profiles they do all of that context themselves and present as their thinking process. As an example; lets say I do 3 competitor benchmarks ahead; but she complements with another 3 analysis which may change the original boundries/insights so the expectations. So I would really try hard an perfect alignment ahead and not have designers do they job for days and weeks and we conflict in front of others.",

I argued against it because the users loved our tool as is, had not asked for this change, and if it added any complexity to their decision-making, it would fail.  The executive won.  They made the changes.  He demo'd it in front of the company leadership and got a promotion.  Within two years the tool was abandoned with complaints on day 1 when it was released.  I moved to another department before the redesign was even completed because I knew how it would turn out.  It was a disaster, and I think that guy went on to become a President at a startup.  LOL.  \n\nAnyway, yes, it happens a lot.  % of how much it happens?  I think you won't get good data on that unless you divide it by levels:\n\n* Whole new project\n* Redesign of existing project's core navigation model\n* Feature \n* Function",

At my last company I spent almost a full quarter building the case to NOT pursue an integration that our CEO was convinced would unlock a new market segment. He'd heard about it at a dinner with another founder and came back on Monday morning ready to put two engineers on it.\n\nThe data clearly showed the segment was too small and the integration partner had terrible retention numbers. But \"killing\" it directly would have been career suicide. So instead I reframed it as \"let's validate the demand first\" and set up a lightweight landing page test. Three weeks, almost zero signups. The project quietly disappeared from the roadmap and nobody had to be the villain.\n\nI think the real skill isn't proving something should die. It's creating the conditions where the person who proposed it can walk away from it without losing face.",

I deal with:\n\n\n- Exceptionally complex proprietary data that base models aren't trained on and do not understand. \n- Very restrictive controls on data. \n- Regulatory compliance. \n- High-risk, safety critical work. \n- Decades old legacy systems.\n\n\nLetting loose some agentic AI on a customer support process or vibe coding together an online retail experience is one thing. \n\n\nBut when working in my type of environment everyone is going to be extra cautious, rules restrict what you can do and it takes more effort to get your AI to make sense of the information.\n\n\nWe do leverage AI and it's a big part of my job now to get it implemented. AI is also doing great for us in developing rapid prototypes. But there's also very real limitations that will take more work to overcome, and the nature of the work means that unless multiple different governments decide to change their regulations many core tasks simply must be done by humans because the rules simply say so.

So no revelation here or anything just more “it’s coming” noise \n\nHere’s the core message, stripped down:\n\nThe author compares today’s AI moment to February 2020 before Covid hit — when most people thought concerns were overblown, right before everything changed fast. He believes we’re in a similar “this seems exaggerated” phase with AI.\n\nHe works in AI and says the shift isn’t theoretical — it’s already happened in his own job. The latest models (like GPT-5.3 Codex from OpenAI and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic) can now independently complete complex, multi-hour technical work with little to no correction. In his experience, AI has moved from being a helpful assistant to effectively replacing much of his core work.\n\nKey points:\n- Progress is accelerating, not slowing.\nImprovements are compounding quickly. Models now complete multi-hour expert tasks end-to-end, and that capability is growing rapidly.\n- AI is helping build the next generation of AI.\nCompanies like OpenAI and Anthropic say current models are already contributing to training and improving their successors — creating a feedback loop.\n- White-collar disruption is imminent.\nHe argues that most computer-based jobs — law, finance, writing, coding, analysis, consulting, customer service — are exposed. Not in decades. In 1–5 years, possibly sooner.\n- Public perception is outdated.\nMany people are judging AI based on older or free versions. The cutting edge is far more capable than most realize.\n- This is different from past automation.\nAI is a general-purpose cognitive substitute. It improves across domains at once, leaving fewer “safe” retraining paths.\n\n\n\nWhat he advises:\n1. Start using advanced AI seriously, now.\nDon’t treat it like Google. Use it on real work. Push it hard.\n2. Become early and adaptable.\nThe advantage right now is being ahead of peers in understanding and applying AI.\n3. Build financial resilience.\nPrepare for potential disruption.\n4. Lean into harder-to-replace strengths.\nRelationships, trust, regulatory roles, physical-world work — these may buy time.\n5. Teach adaptability, not just credentials.\nFor the next generation, curiosity and fluency with AI tools matter more than traditional career paths.\n\n\n\nHe ends on a dual note:\n- Risk: Major job displacement and serious societal consequences.\n- Opportunity: Unprecedented leverage — individuals can build, learn, and create at levels previously impossible.\n\n\n\nBottom line:\nThis isn’t hype in his view. The disruption has already begun in tech, and he believes the rest of the economy is next — soon.",

He’s just saying AI is good at writing software?\n\n> Each new model wasn't just better than the last... it was better by a wider margin, and the time between new model releases was shorter.\n\nIs this true?, it seems like it’s taking longer between models these days, and Opus 4.5->4.6 has not been a wider margin of improvement than previous Opus models.\n\n> Then, and this is the part that would have been unthinkable a year ago, it opens the app itself\n\nMy AI tools have been doing that for over a year. I’m not sure the progress is going to move much further much faster.\n\nYou see ambiguity is still the enemy for working with LLMs, just like it was when working with humans. This is posted in a PM sub, but PMs are actually the ones best suited to excel with AI. If you were already good at communicating expectations and writing features then you’re in luck, because we still need the inputs to these systems. Ai is not autonomous and regardless of how good it gets it will need direction. Every choice it makes is a chance to do something you didn’t want it to do, no matter how smart it is, even if it is a human! As PMs the job is to remove those choices and provide requirements that will deliver exactly what is needed.\n\n> If AI can write that code, it can help build the next version of itself. A smarter version, which writes better code, which builds an even smarter version.\n\nI keep hearing this, but if it was true I’d actually expect a rapid increase in model performance. Instead we see incremental, and I would say diminishing, gains.\n\n> Let that land for a second. If AI is smarter than most PhDs, do you really think it can't do most office jobs?\n\nYes, because it is smarter in some ways and completely incapable in other ways. These are not autonomous agents. Power tools don’t build a house on their own.\n\n> A year ago, AI could barely write a few lines of code without errors\n\nAgain, I’ve got applications I started over a year ago that I’ve never written a line of code for. This is underestimating where the tech was a year ago.",

          "text": "I'm an interviewer at a fang. We do case studies. \n\n\nWe know the case study is not a real example of how you do product development, but product development is pretty tricky to interview for. The case study is a good proxy. \n\n\nWe can see what sort of questions you ask, we can see how you interact with other partners (in our case study, we have ux partners and product partners and often data partners), we can see how you lead a conversation, we can see how you think in real time. \n\n\nIs this perfect, certainly not. But it does give us a glimpse of how you behave in more of a \"real\" product environment.\n\n\nThe advice for cases I have is to have some sort of logical progression you're going to take everybody through. Typically it starts with some sort of customer problem exploration, at this stage I don't want you to zero in on one problem, typically I want to see you think through all the different customer problems that you can given the case is complexity and have some sort of ranking system where you bring everybody in the case study along to align on what the right problem to solve is. There's no real right answer here, but I want to see some sort of logic to why one of these problems should be solved versus all the others. This could involve some made-up business data severity of use case urgency of problem customer demand for feature, it really varies on the case, but the point is you have some way of prioritizing one problem above all the others and you bring everybody along.\n\n\nNext is potentially the most fun, you can start thinking about solutions now that you have a problem. Again, I don't want you to zero in on one solution, and if this is kind of a group case study, I want to see you ask other people's opinion, but you need to center around two or three reasonable solutions that limited in scope technically feasible and defensible in terms of rough CX for the problem you're solving. \n\n\nIf there's an engineer involved, I want to see you ask about feasibility, if there's a designer involved, I want you to ask their opinion about customer patterns, if there's a data person involved, I want you to ask questions about how you would measure success or different key metrics that you would look for, the point is to involve people. \n\n\nCase studies are usually also pretty time limited, something I'm looking for is can you manage time in a stressful situation. If you only get through problem Discovery and not solution and alignment, not a great look. If one stakeholder seems to be really focusing on one aspect of a problem, I want to see how you gracefully pivot them towards moving to the next challenge. \n\n\nAgain these are all proxies for the real skills you leverage is approx manager, but interviewing is a terrible process and we have to do the best we can. \n\n\nTo me, the case study is probably one of the more enjoyable interview steps. I can't stand doing star responses to generic questions and I don't like hearing them either haha",

Being a PM is having a vision, having a roadmap, looking at the customer problems and your data and charting a course for what the future should look like. \n\n\nOf course you have to manage stakeholders to make your vision a reality, you have to work with engineers, you have to understand the technical debt, you have to have a pretty PowerPoint, but those are not the focus. Those are just the means. \n\n\nI think a lot of current professional development around PMS hyperfixate on specific objects like prds, or customer interview questions, or some magic roadmap format. Honestly in my opinion none of that matters. Use whatever PRD you can to get your idea across. Have a roadmap that makes sense to your stakeholders. If you waste time on perfecting those artifacts versus actually having a clear vision, you're going to have a whole bunch of style and no substance. \n\n\nNow of course it's hard to find the time to work on the substance, I probably only spend like 15% of my time actually doing that, but it's my favorite time and it's the most value add time.",

You discover segments you didn't realize existed. People using the product in ways you never designed for. The ones who complain the loudest during a deprecation are often your most engaged users - they care enough to be angry.\n\n  \nThe PM skill nobody teaches in frameworks: how to kill a feature without killing user trust. Give enough notice, make the migration dead simple, and actually listen to the complaints - some of them will reveal things about your product you need to hear.",

The root issue is usually that different stakeholders need different views of the same information, but most tools force you to recreate everything from scratch for each audience.  \n  \nThe teams that handle this best tend to pick one source of truth (usually where the actual work lives, like Jira) and then find ways to present that data differently rather than maintaining separate documents. Some use tools that can pull from Jira and automatically generate the visual presentations, others build lightweight dashboards that filter the same underlying data for different audiences. The key is avoiding manual updates across multiple systems.  \n  \nFor what you're describing - needing both high-level strategic views and detailed execution views from the same data - Easy Agile Roadmaps (full disclosure, I work for Easy Agile but just think it could be agood solution) might be worth looking at since it connects directly to your Jira work and can switch between those different levels of detail without you having to maintain separate versions.

Early or execution-heavy teams tend to reward building, testing, and proving things with data. More process-heavy orgs lean on consensus, alignment, and stakeholder input before anything moves, especially if mistakes are expensive or visibility is high.\n\nWhat you’re seeing now is a place that optimizes for coordination over speed. That often shows up as lots of meetings and upstream validation. It can feel frustrating if you’re used to learning through shipping, but it’s also how some orgs manage risk and politics. Your manager may be trying to protect you or themselves by making sure stakeholders feel heard.\n\nOver time, strong PMs usually blend the two. They do the stakeholder work to earn trust, then quietly reintroduce small bets, experiments, and scoped tests once there’s cover. The autonomy you had before often has to be rebuilt in a new environment.\n\nThis isn’t a signal that you’re doing product wrong. It’s a signal that you’re learning how different orgs operate. Figuring out how to move from “asked to coordinate” back toward “trusted to lead” is a big part of growing in product.",

Either free or paid.\n\nRealistically, here are your options:  \n1. Research STAR method and broadly try to apply this to your own experiences. The problem with this is that you don't really know what GOOD looks like.  \n2. Use AI to help you. This will likely yield better results, but it will shave off all of the things that make you unique, which are the very things that convert in this market. Companies want specialists, not generalists right now. Additionally, you've likely already tried this and it isn't working.  \n3. Ask someone with specific experience to help you.

'how many customers want this' ends up being whoever talked to sales last week or whoever screamed loudest in the support queue. the real problem isn't the framework, it's that most teams don't have a systematic way to capture and aggregate customer signals in the first place. like you're trying to prioritize based on 'themes' but the themes themselves are probably someone's interpretation of a handful of conversations. what actually worked for me was getting way more rigorous about tagging and categorizing every customer touchpoint - support tickets, session feedback, feature requests, complaints - and then letting the volume speak for itself. when you can literally say 'here are the top 10 things customers struggled with this month, ranked by frequency' the prioritization kind of does itself. the signals don't get lost when you have a system that captures them before anyone has a chance to filter or reinterpret them. most of the 'should we build X or Y' debates i've seen would've been answered instantly if both sides had access to the same customer data instead of arguing from memory.",

Having a value model and problem statements helps a lot as well.\n\nNow, it becomes actually simple: you get a clear \"not in scope\" and can reduce the amount of signals you might want to analyse. With the value. model you can organise the signals and usually it becomes obvious  what topics you want to focus on.\n\n**Prioritisation**:\n\nI found the best approach is to come up with your own score.\n\nHow to do it? Together with stakeholders, pick 3-7 dimensions for an opportunity.\n\nTypical dimensions can be:  \nAssumption of complexity/external dependencies  \nAssumption of scope of work  \nLevel of Alignment with Product Vision  \nBusiness Value (increase in customer value or revenue/cost)\n\nFor each dimension use a scale 1-5 for the Score.\n\nNow, it is very quick to score each opportunity quickly with a group of 3-5 people (PM/Sales/DEV/UX...) representing different roles.\n\nTip: A score becomes outdated after 3-6 months and might need to get re-evaluated, as the team has evolved as well as the understanding of the domain.",

Ultimately I think this is somewhat of a sixth sense that a senior PM will develop over a long career. But fundamentally it often comes down to addressing the biggest pain point, but that pain point may be a customer pain, a user pain, a business/revenue pain, an operations pain, a sales pain, a maintenance pain, an engineering pain, etc. Once you have a list of all the pain points, you can stack rank the value of solving each pain. Is the cost of losing customers due to the lack of feature X worth more than the operational savings that could be had with internal tool Y? Does building new feature A bring about more revenue than fixing the engineering backlog item B that’s substantially slowing down engineering and will result in more slow downs later? Ultimately this all comes down to your ability to value initiatives accurately which comes down to your ability to understand all your stakeholders, the business, and to some degree, predict the future.",
