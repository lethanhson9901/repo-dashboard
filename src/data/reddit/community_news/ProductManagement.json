If it's too much, or too much of a blocker -- move on to another company with a different flavor of dysfunction.   But there is no magical company that doesn't have any.     \n  \nI have used this in interviews with companies i'm talking to --  i literally ask this question: \"every company has some dysfunctionally - what is the flavor here?\", when you ask various folks from same company it can be fascinating to hear the variety and/or consistency of answers.",

The first thing I've noticed as a night and day difference is that I need to plan way ahead, with a much more broader picture in mind than as a delivery manager. The first time I saw the offering development cycles I honestly got overwhelmed, because my default is to solve everything at once and asap. What strategy would you recommend to get over that, what is a healthy and effective mindset for a PM, what would you say I should research or do to avoid mistakes, what common traps should I expect and what did you do to avoid these? Also, any tips and tricks from your experience would be great.",

By that I mean learn about how the product is used, what problems it solves, why it is priced the way it is, how successful it is and with whom, what the macro and micro environment is i.e political, environmental, regulatory, usage data, sales data. Literally anything and everything. The more you know, the more right you'll be when you have an idea. BUT, just because you have a good idea, doesn't mean it will work so you need to be a master of tearing your ideas to shreds and validating it as best as you can, by speaking to customers, stakeholders, sales people, engineers, users etc. Engineers are critical because they'll tell you if it's even possible and affordable to build. Once you've done all that, you'll have the best possible arguments and you'll have confidence.",

Independence/Leadership -- Staff/Principal level can run the ship and guide all decisions pretty independently -- the best ones don't act this way necessarily, but if there was no VP, CPO, or CEO -- the staff/principal would keep on trucking, making the tough calls, tradeoffs, and taking the hit when it doesn't work, re-chart new course, etc.   A lot of this stems from the foundation of #1.\n3. Presence -- the combination of #1 and #2 create a strong personality inside the company.  If there is ever a question about anything related to the product space -- this person's name should first on everyone's tongue.  So act like a leader, act like a Staff before you get promoted, establish the relationships, establish your expertise while still being 100% collaborative and authentically interested in other peoples ideas and contributions.\n\nIf this all sounds nutty -- yep that's PM -- being the strong expert independent leader while also authentically including everyone else.

So it's difficult to say what one should be doing over another in any particular company because they are all different. The one thing I will say though, is that Product Managers are very very rarely responsible and accountable for the success of an actual product, despite the name. Usually it's the Head of Product who claims responsibility. In my view, someone should own a product when they are the most knowledgeable person to take active responsibility for a product's success. Sometimes products are the whole company. So, to me, the title \"Product Manager\" should mean exactly that, but the corporate world broke this.",

Some metrics are not in the purview so the hypothesis needs to be created in order to discover it. \n\nEssentially I see data as glowing lines illuminated from an idea you have about what's going on. Things don't tend to just pop out of a bunch of dashboards unless they're just hygiene metrics. \n\nBe a thinker. Ask, \"what if that impacts that? Or that means this? Let's look see\"",

I've done product management for 10+ years now across many industries, built many product 0>1 and I often feel like I want to get out of the field altogether. Every manager or company I've worked at/with has a different definition of what \"good\" product management actually is. I wrote about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does\\_anyone\\_think\\_that\\_the\\_expectations\\_for\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does_anyone_think_that_the_expectations_for_what/)\n\nWhat would be your mental model for determining whether someone (1) is good at product, but just not in the right company/industry; or (2) needs to move to a different function entirely? And how do you handle the fact that often, your job satisfaction as a PM relies quite heavily on the environment you're in?",

How do they add the most value?  (even ask folks for input) Then figure out how to excel at it.   A mentor can help, but not required.

Not good though.\n\nSo all we hear is: AI is going to create a new utopia and everyone needs to come on the journey or be left behind.\n\nWhilst I agree that everyone needs to learn AI, I don't believe it will save their jobs. It's specifically designed as a cognitive and administrative replacement. All jobs will be impacted eventually.\n\nThe question is, how much of the \"middle\" ground can the economy tolerate before we reach this utopia. I'm very negative about this. I see a middle ground where most roles gradually diminish in numbers. Not completely go away, but just go down. I mean, if it drops by only 10% we've got an economic crisis with indebted governments.\n\nSo, I think the redundancies will work up the experience chain until the most experienced are left running the show, doing more with less human support. As a consultant I'm already seeing this in real-time.\n\nOr, AI will be unsafe and unsecure and an event forces a pause. In which case, business as usual :)",

The type 1 startup I just joined is a night and day difference in all aspects, but I am having so much fun and loving it so far. Both companies were great but I think type 1 is where it’s at if you can find the right fit and growth stage and have the energy for it. You can always retire at a type 2 company.

My only framework has been my experience that I use to handle differing scenarios.\n\nFrameworks are good for things that are truly difficult to do without. How many of those can you name?

I know the answer, but my brain just skips right past the answer as it's \"common sense\" or \"they wouldn't ask this basic of a question\" , i give an answer later to find it's not what they were asking and I knew the answer they were looking for I just didn't say it out loud as it was too basic\n\n\nLike I'm have trained myself for speed and efficiency, as in dodging basic stuff to get to the core...\n\nHow do I unlearn this or rather how do I learn the basic stuff?

I didn't know anything about Marketing so I did a Masters in digital marketing. From there I was able to get into owning digital propositions which eventually led to product management, which I then did for 17 years. Each role I was in I was looking at how my skills could transfer to something else. Every move had a logical connection, but the key was moving and taking risks",

We would teach them, check their understanding and then a week or two later they would fall back into their original habit. There were 3 things at play here. The first was memory. We needed to ensure we were champions everyday and checking everyone remembered to do what they were supposed to. The second was gaps. When someone learns something and then goes back to their original work they sometimes encounter an edge case. They don't yet know how that edge case is solved in the new system and rather than check, they just do what they know using the old system. The third was command. If the leadership didn't understand fully or buy into it well enough they wouldn't hold their staff to account. We needed to ensure the management were mandating the new process otherwise people just do what they want.\nSounds like you're doing your best with 1 and 2, so maybe see if you can influence leadership to get some bossing",

You must have some element that is transferrable to another business of a similar type. \n\nIn terms of building domain knowledge, I don't think it's really possible to do it fully in the business sense because a lot of it will be about how they operate internally. But I have managed to go into a domain where I had no experience but I did have a personal interest. For example I love cars (My Dad was a car salesman) and I love mountain biking, and I ended up working for the first online car sales company and the largest cycle retailer.

This often means talking to engineers (feasibility) and and customers (desirability) to see if it's something that CAN be built and SHOULD be built. I then craft the findings into a playback so that the risks or opportunities can be understood. If you think it's a bad idea you want to play back the evidence to cover your ass. If the validation proves it's a good idea, then fine, it's just about how you break it down to delivery.

When you learn to play golf, you put your ball on the tee, aim down the fairway (basically anywhere where there's smooth grass) and thwack. The problem is, your aim is as wide as the fairway is and more often than not it goes 10% out to the left or right and ends in the rough. The trick is to very specifically aim at the flag. Nowhere else, just the flag (or similar tiny spot). That helps you focus your target area down and you're more likely to hit it.\nAnyways, when I apply this to somewhere I want to get to I look for the flag. In a Product sense, to me this is the Product itself. If I became an expert in the product and its experience, either by researching it or getting as much exposure as I could, then I'll already be talking the talk. It's no guarantee, and researching the iPhone isn't going to get you a job at Apple. But you'd be surprised how many people apply for jobs but provide absolutely no connection to the product at all. It's a standout thing to me. Shows passion too.\nOn the AI question, it's going to reduce the number of product roles I think. I don't believe there will be more jobs because more companies would just make business too competitive.\nAll you can do is your best. I wish you the best of luck. We all need it",

Wears a silver wrist watch. Usually has a blazer. Comes across as thinking they have more influence than they do. \n\n2. The \"startups really peaked in 2012\" PM. Jeans and an ill-fitting button-up shirt. Thinks that ping pong tables and smoothie bars are acceptable to mention in the benefits package, regardless of 401k matching. \n\n3. The \"wait how did I get here\" PM. Internal talent who climbed the ranks and ended up in product. They either love it or can't wait to get enough equity to bail. Almost exclusively works remotely. Energy of a nervous golden retriever– friendly but easily overwhelmed. \n\n(I say this knowing good and well I'm probably in the third camp.) \n\nDifferent businesses attract different PM archetypes.

      "text": "I see a lot of advice on how to prep ahead of a meeting, but not a lot of discussion on how to recover when the meeting inevitably doesn't go as planned.\n\nThe moment when you’re in the room, and...\n\nAn exec cuts you off with a dumb in the weeds unrelated question.  \nTwo stakeholders start debating each other.  \nSomeone says the timeline is impossible.  \nSuddenly, you’re managing people, not presenting.\n\nI've learned that trying to argue or defend myself usually ended badly, so here's how I adopted my strategy over time. Let me know if you have anything to add or disagree with.\n\n1. Pause the conversation. Get people to shut up and regain control for just a second.\n\nI use something like:\n\n“Hold on, let’s pause for a second.”  \n“I want to make sure I’m understanding the concern.”\n\n  \n2. I try to function like a PM and actually define the problem publicly\n\nI don't defend anything or try to explain, I just try to name the concern.\n\nSomething like:  \n  \n\"So to confirm, it sounds like the concern is related to delivery risk more than strategy risk, is that correct?\"\n\nIf it's not, I let them clarify and then try to repeat back by further defining it. Often, the most heated moments are messy because nobody’s named the problem cleanly. Once it’s stated in a sentence, the energy usually drops a notch. People relax when they feel heard.\n\n  \n3. I try to steer the conversation back in a product direction.\n\ne.g. if you say, \"thoughts?\", a meeting with fall apart.   \n  \nInstead, now that I've named the problem, I say somethin glike: \"ok, let's stay on the delivery risk for a moment.\"  \n  \n My goal here is to regain control and point the group in 1 constructive direction. People can still disagree, but at least it's within the confines of the topic (e.g. delivery risk) instead of all over the place.\n\n4. Lastly, it's on me as the PM to land the plane  \nAt some point, as the meeting get's closer to the close, I'll say:\n\n\"Here are the options I see...\"\n\nI'll then walk through options as presented in the meeting (intentionally giving credit to any stakeholders that brought them up. (e.g. As steve mentioned...\"XYZ path\"). This helps them feel like they contributed to the successful alignment.\n\nThen I'll make a hard recommendation:  \n\"Given the constraints, this is what I recommend\"\n\nAnd stop talking.\n\nThe silence feels long. Let it be long. That pause forces decisions. If you rush to fill it, the meeting drifts again.\n\nThis is the hardest part, but it works.\n\n  \nThese are usually the meetings where people have come back to me later and said that they were \"well run\"\n\nI'd love to hear you approach and if you'd add or take anything away from this.\n\n\n\n",

The more I read and The more I've experience it seems like you need to really have everybody on board before the actual alignment meeting happens. There may be many steps to getting there and it might require several different cycles of shifting governance, but this is the way to do it. Everyone should already be on board and essentially the meeting is a rubber stamp. Really seasoned product managers but also engagement managers have found ways to Ace this process. Everyone might not truly be aligned in the presessions since you can't have everybody together at the same time but you certainly have already captured all the concerns and at that point you are just triangulating and bringing the recommendation based on all the concerns. ",

Then link the discussion to the business goal. If an executive has created this ruckus they will be put on the backfoot immediately. The benefit of bringing/highlighting business objective is that everyone can start to visualize the outcome. If you are dealing with smart people with no ego then that would be the end of the discussion. They will either agree with you and let you continue or bring something that you may have missed.

What has helped me get promoted on multiple teams is communicating that I want to be promoted and building a plan together with my manager.  Then, I frequently report my progress. Typically I have this conversation about a year out. During the year I am aiming to get promoted, I make the items on this plan my top priorities. This helps with “doing less” to get promoted. Know your organization’s promotion cycles so you can plan well ahead. \n\nAlso, you mentioned visibility. This is a huge factor for promotions in large organizations. Take every opportunity to show off your work, especially to people outside of your team. \n\nLastly, ask around to better understand the promotion process in your organization. Ask what your colleagues did to earn their promotions. You are making some assumptions about what they are doing, but go ask them! Also tell them that you want to be promoted. It never hurts to have advocates!",

Stop being the safety net for everything and replace your \"yes\" with tradeoffs\n\nStop saying yes to random stuff. If it's not helping build your narrative or drive impact, so no with tradeoff framing.\n\nInstead of “I’ll try to fit it in,” you say,  \n“If we take this on, which initiative should slow down?”\n\nWrite down the last 10 things you handled. Circle the ones that could have been owned by someone else with clear expectations. Delegate them! The next time someone asks for something, respond with a priority tradeoff question instead of an automatic yes.\n\n  \n2. Pick the 2 highest visibility/leverage bets and let the rest be average\n\nYou can't be amazing at 10 things. Narrow your focus and drop, delegate, put in maintenance, the non visibile non high impact work.\n\nTry picking the 2 projects that would matter most in your next promo packet. Ask yourself honestly if your calendar reflects that priority. If not, fix the calendar.\n\n  \n3. Stop doing invisible work  \nA PM is basically invisible to leadership. 90% of what you do is with xfn teams that have no say in your promo. YOU have to drive your promo narrative.  \n\n\nDo this: once a week communicate at least 1 win to your boss (framed in terms of business outcomes)\n\n  \n4. Start declining meetings.   \nDo an audit and ask if this is helping or hurting your narrative and then start exiting them. \n\n\n\n5. Turn your narrative into sponsorship.\n\nPromotions are sponsor-driven. After you build the narrative, you have to deliberately align leaders around it ahead of the cycle. Most PMs skip this and hope impact speaks for itself. It doesn’t.\n\nThe mechanics of how to build sponsors and prep them is a bigger topic than fits in a comment. Happy to explain the mechanics if anyone wants it, just DM.  \n\n\n",

Don't manage tasks, manage the broader strategy and showcase the strategic efforts. This is important - you have to learn how to tell your story.

They get handed one or two initiatives that are already framed as company priorities and have exec attention. If it goes well, it is automatically visible and it maps cleanly to a promo story. From the outside it looks like deliberate restraint and strategy. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is just better positioning.\n\nIf you are not getting those opportunities, you compensate. You say yes to more things, you cover more surface area, you deliver in multiple less highlighted areas so your value is undeniable. That can be real impact, but it also brands you as the reliable workhorse who keeps everything moving. Promotions tend to go to the person who is seen as driving direction, not the person who is seen as catching everything.\n\nSo when someone says “work smarter, not harder,” what they usually mean in practice is “make sure your impact is tied to a top priority and is obvious to the people who decide promos.” If your wins are spread across a bunch of smaller lanes, you can end up doing more and getting less credit.",

Saying yes to everything signals you can't prioritize. Doing good work nobody upstream sees doesn't help you at all.\n\nYour reputation will take a hit when you start saying no. Some people will think you're slacking. But the people who matter for your promo won't if you do it right.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nBe explicit about priorities. \"I'm focused on X and Y because leadership flagged them. Happy to help with Z after those ship.\" Now you're strategic not lazy.\n\nDrop anything execs don't care about. Drop meetings where you're not deciding anything. Stop being the person who answers every Slack question instantly.\n\nDouble down on things with exec visibility and clear numbers. Cost savings with dollar amounts. Revenue. User growth. Vague \"launched initiative\" doesn't cut it.\n\nReal example from banking - two PMs, similar projects. PM A in every meeting, helped everyone with everything, shipped fine. PM B way more selective, made sure CTO knew every blocker they removed.\n\nPM B got promoted. PM A got told they needed more strategic thinking.\n\nThat sucks but it's reality. Being everywhere makes you look necessary but not promotable. Being selective makes you look ready for next level even if you're doing less.\n\nYou'll feel like you're slacking at first. But if you make the right 2-3 things visible to the right people you'll be way better positioned than drowning in everything.\n\nLast thing - PM who does everything can't be promoted because if they leave everything breaks. You're too valuable where you are. That's the trap.",

I'd try the following things if I were you:\n\n1. Revisit what the PM role actually is. Figure out what the expectations are for your role. It is reasonable for a product manager to be a generalist but unrealistic to ask of them to take over the roles that requires a specialist.\n\n2. There are ways of denying request or passing them on to someone better suited to do it. Saying \"I would love to do it, but I believe this is a job best suited for role A\"\n\n  \n3. Doing less should not hurt your reputation as long as you perform spectacularly on the tasks you put your hand in. You cannot be blamed for things you didn't take the responsibility for or were involved in.\n\n  \nHope it helps!",

Do not expect it to be a logical pathway to promotion by showing how excellent you are in your role.  Other people, and maybe even the ones that got the promotion, probably already advocated for themselves.\n\n(2) Stop taking every meeting, and every request.  Be selective.  There are people that just like to have meetings, but no real work is accomplished.  Block off time on your calendar in which you cannot be scheduled or interrupted to get your work done, and if you get requests for meetings that will not measurably contribute to your job or the project, ask to schedule later, or ask if you can get an email summary or agenda prior to scheduling a meeting.  If its a useless meeting, chances are the person requesting it will not even be able to do either one, or at the very least this will push it out for you.  \n\n(3) Stop being reactionary where you feel the pain alone.  If someone schedules something last minute, use the \"if-then\" acceptance, which sounds like, *\"I can take that meeting, if I can slide a 1/2 day on X deliverable.\"* Or, *\"I can do that research for you, but I will need to push off this project delivery to X date.\"*",

Instead of being in every meeting, they create the frameworks that let meetings happen without thme. Instead of answering every question, they build documentation and systems that answers 80% of questions before they're asked.  \n\nA recent example from my company-- a PM stopped attending weekly roadmap sync meetings (11 people - 90 minutes). Instead she create a lightweight scoring model that product, engineering and tech could use to prioritize 80% of issues. First month it felt risky—she wasn't \"in the room.\" But within a quarter, roadmap conflicts dropped by 60%, and leadership started asking her to scale the approach to other teams. \n\nThat's when she got promoted. What I find fascinating is the inverse relationship: the more visible you are in day-to-day execution, the less visible you are as a strategic multiplier. You delivered real impact, but if leadership saw you as the person doing the work rather than the person who made the work scalable, that's the signal we as a leadership team acted on. \n\nThis may work differently at different companies but if the leadership is paying attention this should be the norm.

I have a PM I partner with regularly (a couple times a week) to help validate and prioritize the problems to work on. This always involve technical feasibility and sequencing on my part. I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. Being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

          "text": "Communication = Alignment. It goes both ways \n\nUntil it comes more naturally, it might be helpful to write down your talking points. It sounds pretty basic but you need to be really clear to identify what are your goals that you plan to communicate. That usually comes in the form of thoughtful planning, supporting data and ultimately a talk track. Take some time to write down your core goal and work backwards how you can get there - AI can help get you started or unstuck here. This is the same for nearly all kinds of communication. \n\nNow it gets different depending on who your audience is:\nThe number 1 communication skill I’ve learned is knowing your audience. Who are they, what do they care about and how you can add value. Sometimes your message is inspirational, strategy based (resource/output management) or performance (KPI, engagement or financial). Don’t be afraid to ask what they think is important or what their goals are. \n\nThe life hack here is to strategically meet with each of your stakeholders 1-1 before your group meeting. Ask them what their needs are, hesitations with your plan. Share your ideas on how everyone could win. Hear them out. Get their feedback solo, and then you have time to message based on everyone’s core input. \n\nAlso…Many times, a PM is a moderator. State the goal of your communication- hold that as a North Star if someone derails. There was a great post here recently on how to manage moderation while you’re trying to communicate. I’ll look up the post and post a reply.",

I discovered I say \"um\" way more than I thought and bury my main point 3 minutes in.\n\ncoming from QA/BA/dev you probably already have the technical vocabulary. the PM shift is more about adapting your style to different audiences - engineers want different info than execs want different info than customers.\n\nwhat specific situations are tripping you up? async vs sync? presentations vs 1:1s? stakeholder updates?",

As per the framework, the team is the \"guide\" and the user/customer the hero. Therefore, you need to extend the framework by \"what is the personal reward for the guide?\" aspect. \n\nAlso: Get kids :-). You become an amazing storyteller if you try an \"opt-in\" approach with activities; the huge benefit: difficulty scales automatically. It is simple to get a 3 year old to be excited, however the final boss is a 14 year person who is slightly addicted to social media with a raging hormonal imbalance.... Also, you can rent kids from family members for free or even better: they might pay you for your service. You are welcome.\n\n",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

It’s about helping people understand *why* something matters and *what to do next*.\n\nA few concrete ways to improve it:\n\n* Start with the decision, not the background. Lead with “We should do X because Y,” then explain how you got there. Most PMs bury the point.\n* Anchor everything to a user problem. If you can’t explain the pain in one sentence, the story isn’t ready.\n* Use before/after framing. What’s broken today, what changes if we ship this, what stays the same if we don’t.\n* Practice one-minute summaries. If you can’t explain the idea clearly in a minute, it’s probably not clear yet.\n* Watch where people interrupt. Confusion shows up as questions in the middle of your story. That’s your feedback loop.\n\nYou’ll know it’s working when meetings get shorter, fewer people argue past each other, and decisions happen faster.",

Currently a Senior PM in a startup, with limited short-term salary growth and a very high-pressure environment. Planning to have my first child this or next year, but unsure about pausing my career now and the long-term consequences.\nMy current contract offers 4 months of paid parental leave and I am the main income provider at home. However, all women in my current company were let go after returning from maternity leave (around 6–7 months later), which gives me very low confidence about my future there.\nI have the option to try to land a better job first, earn more to save, but potentially lose the paid parental leave depending on the contract, or take the opportunity now and use the rights I currently have. I also feel that taking the leave after more time in the company might make me less vulnerable to a future layoff, so starting over in a new company also feels risky.\nAny advice from PM mothers? There are so many complexities in becoming a mom while trying to stay valued, financially safe, and mentally healthy, anything would help!",

If every woman at your company who took maternity leave ended up being let go 6 to 7 months later, that’s NOT a coincidence. That’s your company's BAD culture expressing itself.\n\nThere’s an old saying that \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\". Companies are the same. You don’t have to assign intent or argue whether it’s fair. You just look at repeated behavior and treat it as data.\n\nFrom a pure career risk standpoint, staying somewhere that has already shown how it handles returning mothers seems like a bigger gamble than starting fresh somewhere that hasn’t. At least in a new company, you’re evaluating a clean slate instead of walking into a pattern that already exists. That being said, the job market is tough, so this isn't an easy decision either way.\n\nI can’t speak to the emotional side of becoming a mother while managing a career. But from an organizational perspective, I’d treat this less as a motherhood timing question and more as a company quality question. The environment you’re in has already told you how they will likely respond... and that sucks... and I'm sorry.",

If that is a pattern and it happens to you — have a paper trail that shows you were not let go for cause, an employment attorney can help you navigate getting better terms from a severance package. If it’s a pattern, it’s an even better case.

I actually got promoted during my maternity leave, which I didn’t expect. The good thing is now I could still hop to the other employer (if I wanted) in my own time.

Just want to also point out that pregnancy may also not happen exactly when you want, so I would also account for that if you try to time your actions in a certain way.\nMy experience is that I am lucky to live in a country where I can get a lot of maternity leave, and thought I didn't want as much before birth (workaholic here!). Once the baby arrived though I realised I needed the time off. As much as you can only assume how things will go if you stay or find a new job, you should do the same in regards to birth/recovery/baby. Motherhood has been my hardest discovery journey so far - both physically and mentally. \nI ended up being let go after my maternity leave ended but I sadly already expected it to happen.  I can decisively say that my time management, negotiation, resource management and other skills have never been better since becoming a mother. It just a shame that society and most organisations don't seem to place much value in this experience.",

I joined a mid-size company with amazing maternity benefits but that was acquired by a large company with okay benefits. I ended up timing my first kid so that I could take advantage of the better benefits before they expired but then had my second when my husband school was taking us to an unknown state (previous state had great family benefits to top off company benefits with.)\n\nThat being said, neither pregnancy happened when I first started trying (first baby came just before 35) and despite the changes in our org, it’s remained a positive environment for mothers which is one of the biggest reasons I’ve stayed. If it’s at all possible to find a company that offers that kind of environment I would recommend getting out of your current company just for your own wellbeing.

There are more and more US companies with 4 months of maternity leave and with a shorter requirement in terms of how long you have to be there. For long term career prospects also, even if you get a shorter mat leave it might be worth the peace of mind of both job security and longer term career. \n\nYou can also start saving more money and see if you can self-fund a month or 2 of mat leave which would give you more options and bridge the gap with your current leave. \n\nNot exactly the same but I’m at a faang and switched teams internally right after my mat leave and even that was exhausting. A full blown job interview would be even more so and your brain is not working at 100% during or right after mat leave so that will be another hurdle. \n\nPersonally, I’d try to switch now but I’d keep the option open to stay if you get pregnant earlier and can’t find something new.",

Take on their challenges where tech can help grow their business or solve small business issues. \n\nBut build something you can show and tell that you’ve done something. Not just that you have a diploma.",

The bigger driver is the labor market flipping.\n\nCompanies built APM pipelines when there weren’t enough seniors to hire. They had to grow their own talent. After the layoffs, the market is flooded with experienced PMs, so firms can buy impact immediately instead of training from scratch. When that happens, junior seats get squeezed first. That’s basic supply and demand.\n\nAI isn’t the root cause, but it’s speeding things up. Teams are running leaner, expectations are higher, and there’s less patience for long ramp times.\n\nAnd this isn’t just a junior PM thing. It’s the whole market. Companies want people who already proved outcomes in the exact area they’re hiring for. Junior PMs just feel it harder because they have less history to point to. The ones who break in won’t look like trainees. They’ll look like small operators who already shipped something real. The title comes after the evidence now, not before.",

It really depends on the business goals of the organization.\n\nSome things that my research found:\n\n1) Startups are putting off hiring PM's longer than before.  A small team where the founder has a strong business vision used to hire one or two PMs just to do all the grunt work.  That is no longer happening.  PM first hire seems to be getting later than before AI.\n\n2) Larger companies are still hiring PMs and if anything they have MORE PM roles.  It used to be common to be up to 20-1 (20 Eng to each PM).  That is changing.  Engineering teams are getting smaller and PM teams are remaining the same size or growing.  \n\n3) Teams becoming more tightly integrated.  The old hard break between PM and eng is starting to fade a bit.  Not everywhere, but we are seeing teams that have both PM and eng reporting to the same leader.  Same with design.  This isn't necessarily a direct result of AI, but it becomes more reasonable as feature teams get smaller.\n\n  \nShort answer:  PM doesn't seem to be going anywhere but the overall structure of the product team is changing.  \n\n",

I still own the decisions and narrative, but it helps me get to a solid first draft way faster.\n\nSometimes I’ll use it to draft Jira/Linear tickets so they’re actually readable and not missing context.\n\nOn the coding side, it’s very light touch — mostly to understand unfamiliar code or help with small, low-risk refactors. No big architectural decisions or “ship this for me.”\n\nBiggest win for me isn’t speed, it’s clarity.

It can read codebase of your product, without you reading a line of code, and answer questions about features as detailed as you want. It can find bad user experience or usability issues, just from reading frontend and backend code.\nIt is literally a PM's magic wand.

Our packaged offering includes:\n\n\\- Data warehouse\n\n\\- Data administration application\n\n\\- Reporting tool\n\nThe company’s strategic direction is to move analytical workloads and customer reporting off the warehouse and instead bet on a Lakehouse offering (Amazon S3 Tables (Iceberg) + Athena to be precise). In this new model, there would be no traditional data warehouse - all analytical data would live on S3 tables and be queried directly.\n\nCustomer use cases today:\n\n\\- Customers ingest data from multiple sources into the platform\n\n\\- We provide out-of-the-box data products (enriched tables, views, dashboards, etc.)\n\n\\- Customers can build their own transformations, reports, and dashboards on top of this delivered content\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this shift primarily through a product lens, not just an infrastructure or cost lens.\n\nFor PMs who’ve been involved in similar transitions:\n\n\\- Have you built or owned a data platform without a traditional data warehouse?\n\n\\- What worked well, and what didn’t?\n\n\\- Where did this show up for customers (performance, flexibility, trust, usability)?\n\n\\- Any things PMs tend to underestimate in “warehouse-less” architectures?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences and lessons learned from a Product perspective.",

Hosted in our cloud or theirs (hyper scalers) which made all of this so much fun. \n\nFor the customers we hosted in our cloud (AWS)\n\nI started with a data warehouse. We had several sources (relational and non relational DBs, runtime resources logs, server logs, etc) for a complex solution that was generating up to 1 TB of data from the largest customer and it needed proper ETL pipelines to give us all the Parquet format files in S3 and queried internally using Athena at the start. \n\nI had up to 2k customers. Think of every bank in the world, health providers, governments, logistics and even defence companies. They all used our previous solution (client server self hosted) and had developed a myriad of dashboards tailored to their business. \n\nI had pressure from my stakeholders to provide dashboards for customers to view their data but I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to find a one size fits all solution and I didn’t want to be a PowerBI PM. My approach was to prioritize solutions to give customers access to data via APIs so they could all do what they want. I eventually added UIs to manage the data they had in our cloud (set retention periods, create archives, etc)\n\nCustomers were fine with this approach. I had to put some effort on defining rules to manage costs. External data transfers of the volumes we run are expensive so I had to put cooldowns on some of the endpoints. \n\nAt this stage I’m working on a solution to stream/share some of the operational data we get in AWS for monitoring customer runtime resources health, status, etc We use this internally just for a health dashboard but customers need this too (we already have a UI they can check but they want real time data to be consumed by applications they developed to track and alert)\n\nMy advice. Have a warehouse, build customer facing dashboards only if you know they’ll be usable for all and keep customisation to a minimum or you’ll be building a BI platform. Implement and enforce retention periods to manage costs (if the volumes will make even S3 a burden). Consider giving access to customers via APIs for specific use cases. ",

          "text": "To answer 1:\nI was a data engineer when I built a data lake (Cloudera directly on HDFS with Hive as DB engine to load these parquets/avro files as external tables). At some point I migrated them to Azure HDInsight (ugh, top-down decision bc of “networking”).\n\nAs a PM I have managed a few “data warehouse” like redshift.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts on it, but keep it mind that I wasn’t a PM during data lake period.\n\n2. For data lake, as you might have already know, it “can” be cheaper, and powerful as in you can make decisions on low level things. This is a double edge sword because it’s shifting the cost from infrastructure to operation/maintenance.\n\nFor an instance, schema evolution can be quite complicated. Altering a table shape involves modifying the data files which is a very expensive operation. It might as well be creating a new external table. This is very different from redshift where the DB engine manages these things for you. Modern tool like Iceberg solves this issue, but it means it’s another tool and complexity you need to deal with.\n\nAnother example, you get to decide a storage format specifically optimized for  your own use case. Like parquet vs avro for an example. Redshift does have its own read optimization which most of the time probably is more efficient. But for some specific cases parquet can be more efficient.\n\nThere are some other advantages for data-lake for its file-based storage like, exporting is a lot easier since the file format is universally accepted and can be directly sent, while redshift requires you to query and export.\n\nIf I want to summarize into one thing, it would be the cost advantage as long as you are aware that the cost is shifted to operations & maintenance, not magically disappeared.\n\nAnd operations and maintenance is something you can control based on how much you want to optimize the performance and efficiency. Which leads to your next question.\n\n3. Where did this show up for customers:\nPerformance, can be as good or better in niche cases, based on how much effort your team put to optimize these. (Again, cost)\n\nFlexibility, depends on what you meant by this, like can your customers easily modify a table? Not as easy as redshift (but, should they even?). To ingest the data? Probably easier and more flexible as I mentioned above.\n\nTrust, the governance will be more on your team to integrate and maintain a tool to manage the governance, again, pushing cost to operation and maintenance. But if you meant trust as in compute accuracy, that probably be the same. Usability, if it’s UI dashboard tooling, the same if you are able to manage the data catalog underlying it. If you are talking about ingestion, probably easier and more efficient “technically”. If they export the results from a UI tool or a query then the same.\n\n\n4. Underestimates.\nHmm, this is where I’m not sure I can answer. I wasn’t a PM when I built data lake. But it’s gonna be the same thing I mentioned (again): cost doesn’t magically disappear, you shift it to operation and maintenance which you can control.\n\n- governance: now you have to built or integrate a tool for governance layer by yourself. \n- performance now is more on you.\n- your team will get exposed to much more complexity than redshift. I hope my examples can give you some ideas, but there will be a lot more. Many unknown unknowns. It will be a long term project where your team will discovers more issues and improvements to do.\n\nI kept all these on high level, feel free to shoot any follow up questions. I’ll answer if I know.",

          "text": "My biggest recommendation is immediately identifying your scalability and latency requirements then partnering with your architect on a structured evaluation. I’ve inherited transformations like this where those details werent factored in, which ultimately led to a rewrite the entire product.\n\nYou mentioned Athena, but you need to be sure this choice is validated by meeting your requirements at scale under the particular conditions of your customers while meeting both your SLAS and staying at an effective cost. This is where the real tradeoffs really show up and can lead to more complex solutions or leveraging technologies like redshift spectrum or snowflake. Ex. \nDo you have interactive workloads for online users or scheduled workloads? Maybe a mix where you can request to run now or schedule for a specific time?\nAre these able to be lazily delivered just in time, or are they required for automated data pipelines on the customer side and always need to be generated exactly on time based on data that may only arrive x minutes before the schedule.\nHow does late arriving data get handled? Does it regenerate previous reports and notify the customer or require requery? \nIs there a latency sla where you may need to autoscale within x minutes/seconds to handle workloads scheduled to run at 4am after a batch job uploads data at 3am but before their business starts at 7am?\nDo you have controls in place to cost manage customer queries? When you ran these workloads in postgres you had a fixed cost in the size of your db, with serverless/on-demand you are often charged based on data scanned not returned. a customer could query 1000s of columns over years of data to aggregate their top 5 most sold products and every time they load this table cost you $20, while adding a 30 day lookback or aggregations at the monthly level for historical data could cut that cost to pennies.\n\nIn cloud the usual gotchas are a lack of real world cost controls on the queries and service scalability limits by cloud providers where you can only run X jobs per cloud account/region. You can mitigate these by 1. Partner early with architecture and make sure you have a pressure tested plan on resource scalability, latency, cost tradeoffs that doesnt open up existential vulnerabilities 2. Work with your cloud service provider so that they can help you cost out the solution and raise/work around various service limits. There are entire PS teams of people that your aws account exec can give you free credits to support this analysis if requested. They’ll throw free expert support at you because they’re ultimately motived by influenced revenue + potential to use you as a customer reference after your migration.",

I'd watch a video, then read a few articles, then watch another video, but the info doesn't seem useful or stay in my head because I can't make it feel applied or see the bigger picture.\n\nI'm not a technical dude by nature.

I am sure, 80% of the topic will be clear to you using the above approach. Then you can dive deeper if you want (with the LLMs only), as you will be in the position to understand.\n\n3.

          "text": "I think in general you should keep channels open with sales, but the feedback sales gives you is not always the right move to make from a product perspective. \n\nSales incentive is to close customers they see in front of them, in general they will ask for the things the client says they want. That's helpful. Feedback of course, but if clients could just ask for the things they wanted, a product managers and businesses often would not need to exist. Sometimes you to understand that with the client ask for is not actually what they want, if we gave them what they said they wanted it would actually not solve the problem. They're trying to solve, or the solution would be too complex and not worth the incremental effort required to build the complexity they're asking for. \n\nThe long story short as with many things and product, there's no clear answer. \n\nI could certainly understand that a jaded founder or product manager after having sales teams tell him to build things that he knows are not the right thing for many iterations, would simply decide to not communicate with sales. I don't think that's the right answer, but if you've been a successful entrepreneur, who am I to tell you you're wrong.",

You may have to  build good rapport with sales in order to get access to the users and customers so you can do discovery. Some sales people might understand the product well and can help you with discovery/ideation. \n\nSome additional pitfalls - sales tends to be more self interested than other professions and some will try to use you. I have had sales people demand that I go see every single customer in person to do the roadmap presentation ( I said no I don't want to be traveling 50% of the time to do a series of 1 hour presentations that I can easily do remotely and get the same level of feedback). They sometimes try to use product managers as bait so the customers will agree to meet so they can then try to sell something else to them. I've had sales people demand that I run a product training session for a customer just to add \"next level white glove treatment\". I find that the more you communicate with them, the more they ask of you and the more they try to co-opt you into silly things like this. \n\nAlso when I used to provide more details to sales about what the developers were building,  I would just get more nitpicky feedback about trivial details (because they need to say something in meetings to feel important and that is all they can think of to talk about).",

          "text": "Yup, worked for a couple years in B2B/B2C for a company with split teams. 2 onshore devs + a QA and then 4-5 offshore devs + a QA. I had an offshore 'counterpart' that I spoke with daily during the couple of overlapping hours I had. \n\nNow, the truth is I imagine this depends HEAVILY on the organization you're working with. Talking to other stateside folks that've gone through the experience, it can vary significantly. Some folks said their offshore team was more or a less a black box with a single point of contact. They'd send over requirements in PDF format and do all the back and forth over estimates and questions and delivery via email/chat with that single POC. On the flipside, others (like myself) it was more like any other development experience. They'd get on standup, attend grooming, etc. Our onshore devs and them would work together on stuff. Etc etc. The only big difference was there was a 2 hour window in the morning where our schedules overlapped so if they asked a question at 8am....and I answered at 8:05, it wasn't getting 'done' until the next day. It did heavily impact timelines as a result. \n\n> what surprised you\n\nThey did everything they could to appear westernized. They used American names on calls (which got funny because they chose ones like \"Elvis\" and \"Vinnie\"). When one of them would have a kid, they'd give them a western name (in addition to a Sichuanese one). Any attempt on our end to try and learn their Sichuanese names was rebuffed. This also extended to even things like talking about their food and culture. They did everything they could to essentially hide anything about their personal culture, but they did it by putting up a western facade. They'd never mention any of the foods they liked or ate unless it was something stereotypically western. \n\nThey took all the normal Chinese holidays you're familiar with, but never spoke about it at all. Like we'd all talk about Christmas or Diwali or Hannukah, and they'd ask questions and such about those holidays, but if we asked about what their plans were or what have you, they'd clam up. It was kind of wild. \n\n> what was harder than expected\n\nLearning how to write requirements that worked for them. Obviously there were linguistic aspects I had to be mindful of, but also dissecting even the most technical language required a bit of trial and error. Add in the time difference and yeah, it got complicated. I'd write a requirement and send it over to them. Onshore, it'd take 5 minutes. Because because they were offshore and 12 hours apart, it was a full day turnaround. And if they had a question, it doubled the time...because again, I didn't get the question until the next day and they didn't see my answer until 12 hours later. Even when my schedule changed and I had more overlap in the evening instead (ie: They were starting their day in my evening), it was time consuming and challenging to sort out requirements with them.\n\n> what was better than expected\n\nTheir ingenuity. I assumed they'd be more like typical contractors where they'd build exactly what I asked for (or close enough) and nothing else. If I told them to build a wheel but only described 330* of it, I'd get a wheel missing 30* type stuff, ya know? \n\nThey made a serious effort to understand the product, the customer, etc. They REALLY liked when I included them in discovery. We got some great solutions from them. They also tended to play with ideas if they were light on work, which was neat. They were genuinely pretty skilled engineers, though they sometimes went rogue and instead of getting a full 360* wheel...I'd get a tank tread. \n\nThey were also really approachable and friendly. I got to know my counterpart pretty well, or at least as well as she felt was okay. They'd hop on calls with their kids and their kids knew who we were and such. We even had a sort of happy hour not long after COVID hit. They were in Chengdu so they were in like HARD lockdown, but we all hopped on a party call and talked about it over drinks. \n\nThey came over here a couple times prior to COVID too which was cool.\n\n> whether you’d do it again\n\nWhile I ultimately did enjoy working with them, and would do so if they were onshore, I wouldn't do offshore again if I could help it. There were always knowledge transfer issues, and since they were contractors we were also somewhat hamstrung on how much they could impact. Additionally, there WAS a certain amount of territorialism at play at all times. It was less that we didn't want them to have the 12 herbs and spices, but more that we didn't want to be in a position where we didn't have the 12 herbs and spices if that makes sense. It made planning things challenging because sometimes I'd have to slice up work in an illogical way because we wanted onshore devs working on the core pieces, even though it may have made more sense from a productivity standpoint to slice it up differently. \n\nAlso, ultimately they had their own marching orders and such and they'd periodically get shuffled around, frequently despite our requests for certain devs to remain on certain teams. \n\nAnd I'm 95% sure when they added \"Ethan\" to our team as a 5th dev during COVID, it was actually just Elvis with two logins and a pay bonus to push out front end work for 2.",

      "text": "**Context**: I am an experienced Product Manager, worked across many high growth B2C companies. For personal reasons I joined a Non-FAANG Big Tech. I am failing to understand this role.\n\n**Role**: I am PM for a Platform Team, and it is from organisation \"A\". But I am part of organisation \"B\".  \nSo, my Manager and Skip are from \"B\" but my EM and engineers are from \"A\". To be very clear, my 'EM's Manager' has a different reporting line and he does not actively work with my Manager or my Skip.\n\nThis Platform Team works on many things, has 3 key customers and organisation \"B\" (I, my Manager, Skip are part of) is just one of the 3 customers. The major work still comes from other 2 key customers. (All key customers are internal orgs).\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. Within 4 months of joining, my EM starts to complain about me to my Skip and my Manager about things I am not doing, mistakes I am making etc. At that point I had not even understood if I should be working more for organisation B or for organisation A.\n2. My Skip directly provided the feedback to me as is about what EM complained about.\n3. Over a period of 1 year or so, this EM complained about me about 3 or 4 times, again, every time the Skip is involved.\n4. The communication channel has been that if EM has a feedback, they tell my Skip and my Manager and then either the Skip or my Manager convey it to me.\n5. I had a weekly with my EM for the first 8-9 months and then I gave up and removed it since the communication channel still was through my Skip. (I tried telling them a few times that please share feedback with me first, see if I am working on it and then involve my Skip but nothing changed).\n6. I tried to clarify my role multiple times from my Manager, she says many words but was not able to clearly explain to me.\n7. I clarified my role from Skip (multiple times), he mentions that I should focus on the needs of Organisation B while ensuring that I am also helping with other 2 customers of the platform. (Basically everything but B is important).\n\n**Manager's Absent Behavior:**\n\n1. Over a period of 1.5 years, I have created multiple documents, artefatcs etc, this person has not left a single comment on any of the documents.\n2. 80% of the times, is late for the 1 on 1. Never has a clear agenda for the 1 on 1, I try to have the agenda whenever I have key topics to discuss. (We are based in different continents).\n3. There are umpteen chats, slack threads where I leave questions for them and I get response from her about 10-15% of the times. Most of my messages in DMs also do not get any response unless it is regarding something they need, for example updates to leadership or something similar.\n\n**All Important Things Going Through EM:**\n\n1. For the bi-annual and annual review sessions, my Manager reaches out to EM to get the feedback and that feedback obviously is all negative. This person passes this to me as is without really putting any effort by themselves.\n2. I tried to push my Manager to define clear goals for myself and I received vague answers such as communication, being proactive, being involved in all projects of EM, keeping EM happy etc.\n3. More context: This EM has never had an experienced PM on the team before. The person before me was basically a Software Engineer doing the job of the PM (perhaps because they wanted to try), this PM was reporting to EM. Later on they moved back to being a Software Engineer in a different team / org.\n\n**Questions and Advice Needed:**\n\n1. Have any of you been in a situation like this? It almost seems that my EM is my pseudo Manager but nobody bothers to spell it out explicitly?\n2. How cooked am I to be in this role? I am confident that I cannot grow here but do you have any advice how should I navigate this?\n\nFor my personal reasons I cannot immediately quit and look for a new job (but if you think that is the only sane right solution, please mention that).",

I’d take the initiative and write a 1 or 2 page PM charter (customers, decision rights, success metrics, operating cadence) and share it with your manager/skip/EM so everyone aligns on expectations.\n\nAlso, in matrix setups, don’t let your manager become data starved. If you don’t proactively provide the right signals, they’ll naturally rely on someone else for those inputs and things can get lost in translation. What’s worked for me is a consistent update that covers what shipped/failed, impact/metrics, key decisions and tradeoffs, and the next set of priorities across customers.\n\nFinally, at a senior PM level, I’d expect leadership to focus on objectives and outcomes, not day-to-day execution details. They may not have time to read every artifact or follow every thread unless something is explicitly flagged! so make it easy for them by calling out what matters and what you need from them.\n\nEdit: Different continents + limited overlap can also amplify meeting fatigue. I’ve found it helps to start 5 mins late, end a couple mins early, keep a clear 1:1 agenda, and explicitly ask for feedback, review (or a Slack DM) when needed.",

You will be unable to deliver value without their support. Canceling your series of 1:1 meetings is a terrible sign. It looks like you're giving up.\n\nWe only see the one side here, but I'd lean towards this being an issue with the EM more than you. If it is true that they didn't even attempt to go to you first with feedback that looks bad to them. PM and EM need to be open with one another and constantly communicating.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a good fix. I was in a similar relationship with an EM. He just didn't see PM as playing the role I thought it played. We never clicked, and eventually both of us moved on to other teams. It might be a Hail Mary (that could backfire spectacularly) but if you have trust in your own manager you could lay those cards out: say that there is a fundamental disconnect between the two orgs regarding the PM role, and you'd like to work with a different team that will value a PM more.",

With you skip manager, have an honest talk about what kind of help you need. Be open, but polite and say that 'things aren't working as expected with the EM. I'm willing to work with the EM. However, if every single thing is escalated, it doesnt scale and it is impacting my motivation'. \nIf you dont agree with the feedback, be very specific about a couple of examples and why you dont agree. Be polite and do not come across as brushing aside the feedback. You can say 'i truly appreciate that the EM has passed on this feedback. Another perspective to it is, for them their Org is the top priority, while for me, I need to balance out the needs of 3 orgs. So sometimes the EM might feel that their org needs arent being met. I need your help in putting this across to the EM. Or if you want me to prioritize the needs of org B, let me know'.\n\n2.Also talk to your skip manager about how your manager is not providing you the help you need. You can ask for a mentor who can help you instead. Be specific and mention a couple of examples where your manager hasnt helped you and say 'there are other such exaples'.\n\n\n3. Talk to the EM. Set up a monthly or bi weekly 1x1 if not weekly, be open with them. You xan say 'my skip manager passed on the feedback. I appreciate the feedback. Do know that I'm always open to hearing them directly from you too. I want to work together for the success of the org B'. Every 1x1 ask him them if they have any feedback. Also use this to provide them feedback. \nKeep your skip manager posted on how this goes. Dont fail to mention that you drove this.\n\n4. Think if there is merit to the feedback, spend some time thinking and incorporating the feedback .\n\n5. If the toxicity continues, then quiet quit. Just do what you can and what you feel right. When they give feedback just say 'thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it and will try to work on it' but you do your work. This will need you to develop a thick skin. Sometimes this works well and in time, things fall in place (either the people involved makes peace with the fact that that is how things are, or the toxic people might leave before you do, or you will come across better opportunities within or outside).",

You also need to talk to your EM counterpart to make sure that your expectations are aligned. If they expect something of you that you're not doing, they will be disappointed. You NEED to align, regardless of what the reasons of the misalignment might be.\n\nAlso, regarding 1-1s with your manager, you shouldn't expect them to bring an agenda. It's normally your meeting and they are there to help you. You need to drive it.\n\nBeing a PM means being reasonably senior and self sufficient and you normally should not need your manager for day to day things and you should definitely not expect them to tell you what to do and how to do it. It sounds like you might be quite inexperienced and in need of a lot more guidance and coaching than you're getting. Have you brought this up with your manager?

I'm not surprised that your EM is providing feedback to your managers if you are not meeting their expectations and they have brought it up to you in the past.

They have their own job to do. \n\nIt sounds like you have a crap manager though. Do you have peers?

You're using the business conversation as your input and provide output based on what you say. You're smart, have good context, and come up with great solutions! You'll find the best path forward, great!\n\nUnfortunately, that's not quite what the job is.\n\nIt's important to remember that the business input you're getting is actually their own individual *outputs*, so to speak, and your job is to understand what *their* inputs are to have provided you the output in the meeting. People are notoriously bad at articulating their issues, but are really good at asking for things.\n\nTogether, *that (what they've said and WHY they said it)* becomes *your* input. If you start solutioning without understanding, it's the equivalent of prompting an AI to generate an image without clarifying what it is you're trying to build. And it's not necessarily *bad*, and probably a good approximation, but it's just easier to take a step back and spend that ADHD energy to get more details, and understand *why* people are saying what they're saying.\n\nThere's a lot of asking \"okay but WHY is what you're doing now not working\" and \"okay what are you optimizing for\".",

Document.**  \n\nTruly understanding a business problem typically requires a data gathering plan and depending on the business problem(s) to solve may be an extensive period of time.  You need to employ whatever methods are best to get the data you need . . . whether that is interviewing, focus group, shadowing, surveys, etc.  You need to do competitive research and analysis in a lot of situations.  Knowing who your stakeholders are and how to weight their feedback is a combo method of sound business and psychological analysis . . . being able to ferret out who is giving feedback that supports the project success, who gives feedback that supports themselves but screws others, who gives feedback with a hidden agenda, whose feedback is reliable, whose is not.\n\nWithout knowing these people very well that evaluation comes in part by volume.  When you get some of the same stakeholder users telling you the same thing and they are close to the process, work product, etc. that should mean more than a high-level executive who tells you the opposite.\n\nWhat you do NOT want to do ever, is off the hip, with the client or stakeholder, start suggesting or commenting on solutions after you've listened to them for a few minutes.  If you do, they will latch onto that and not let it go, even if later, you go down a path from your analysis that shows that spontaneous solutionizing to be wrong.\n\nYou may think that you have an understanding of the problem after one or two conversations with one or two stakeholders, but what is often the case, when you dig deeper, you will find that you only understand about half of the problem.\n\nIt is your job to understand the business goal, and business problems to solve, gather and synthesize data on these things, document the current state manual and automated processes, looking for process improvement opportunities (i.e., efficiencies, where you can automate, etc.), documenting future state workflows and requirements, features and functions. \n\nDepending on the complexity of the problem(s) to solve, I may be onsite for a few weeks, shadowing and interviewing stakeholders, re-interviewing and asking questions, getting survey responses as follow-up data, and then I go back document everything (requirements, workflows, etc.) and then I go back with that and review with the stakeholders for validation.\n\nBy and large, the main reason projects fail is due to rushing through this business problem requirements analysis and management process or skipping major steps, thinking you are wasting time, so that what ends up happening is you build the wrong thing, or something only 60% right, and have to rework, run up additional costs.",
