      "text": "I have been a PM for 10 years. During that time, I have gone through the full range of training: the Udemy basics, the Coursera specializations, and even a $1,000 Maven cohort ( company paid ofcourse). I see people asking for course recommendations here every week. Looking back on my own experience, I feel there is a significant gap in how we learn Product Management.\n\nMost courses teach you how to write a PRD, do product strategy, craft roadmaps or use RICE for prioritization. They do not teach you how to deal with a stakeholder who whose priority doesn't align with yours or how to communicate with the engineering team after an unavoidable scope creep. \n\nMost curriculums assume you have complete freedom and total autonomy to just \"do\" strategy. In reality, you are constantly navigating conflicting priorities from sales, marketing, engineering, other product teams and leadership.\n\nWatching videos is passive and cohort driven courses are generally anecdotal where the educator talks about their approach to product situations. Without real practice, the frameworks do not stick. You can follow every framework perfectly and still fail because you misread the room or lost the trust of your stakeholders. In PMing, almost everything is subjective.\n\nFor people trying to switch to PM or ace interviews, you are expected to have \"Product Sense.\" However, there is no way to build that muscle memory without already having the job. \n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts: For those who have taken the big-name courses, did you feel like they prepared you for the \"politics\" and soft skills of daily work? If you are trying to break into PM, does the lack of \"real-world practice\" feel like the biggest obstacle?\n\n",

I was apart of 4 cohorts for the Product Sense course. I think I paid $600.  \n\nThe last thing I’ll say about Sathish was that he wasn’t selling frameworks, he emphasized the work that needed to be done to have what I call “cool as a cucumber” product sense.  It’s the kind of product sense where you can walk into a room and someone can ask you to build a genAI product for Dolphins and you won’t bat an eye because you know exactly what to do.  3 frameworks, 13 product “themes”, and roughly 50 sub product types and he has you work through most, if not all of them. The magic is in doing the work.  Absolutely no shortcuts.  \n\nThis is the standard I hold all PM courses to now: thorough, actionable, solving high value problems, teaching real transformation, and indexing on providing outsized value to the student. \n\nYou can keep your 4 week, 6 hour AI Prompting course, taught by the PM from the hot AI company and charging $3000.  \n\nKick rocks, good sir.",

I have been planning for this break so I'm okay from a financial and healthcare POV, but I have found it hard to deal with the feeling of having to be productive.\n\nMy main goal when taking the sabbatical was to rest and just de-compress from the negativity of my job so I can start the new year with a clear mind and find the next role. I don't feel like traveling particularly since I have done a decent amount of travel in the last few year and have grown out of the solo-travel phase of my life (I much prefer traveling with my partner and family - but we can only do this a few times a year and not like traveling for months). The goal of my sabbatical is to get back to building, fall in love with product management again and use all the new AI tools to incorporate it into my day to day.\n\nI just finished my first month of sabbatical and honestly have quite enjoyed literally doing nothing (outside of the usual cooking, wandering around, exercising). I have gotten a number of outreaches from various PM roles and I thought I would be motivated to apply to jobs by now but I have felt 0 motivation in interview preparation. I'm starting to feel a bit anxious b/c I am aware of how bad the market is and how it might take at least 6 months to a year to find my next role. At the same time, I still feel a bit traumatized by my old job (like am I getting into the same toxic situation again) that is hard to shake and it makes me feel very unmotivated to get my resume/ story together.\n\nI am wondering if anyone has experienced this weird lull of transition and whether you have any advice for me to build up my spark for working/ being in product again.",

It gave me space to heal and not create pressure to be on the move. \n\n2. This lack of clarity or motivation is part of your body and mind letting go of the trauma of the last job. Within like the first 8 weeks of my time out of the industry I toyed with the idea of being a truck driver, postal worker, working in a trade because it was just my body rejecting the idea of working in another traumatic workplace. Indulge the fantasies, but don’t be hasty to act. \n\n3. Have a plan on getting back into the market. I made a decision that I would start actively looking after 6 months off and then it took me until the end of the year to get a new gig (so another 6 months). Work out your current financial runway and then work back from there to work out what you can afford to spend on job search and mental reconditioning and time off etc (I had 18 months of runway and burned 12). \n\n4. Have a plan on how you’ll fill your time. I renovated a part of my house. It was a different kind of mental workload, I got to see immediate results, and I worked with my hands. Did wonders for my mental health and also was a way to keep my soft skills sharp without having to go into the industry to keep my skills fresh. \n\n5. Be far more considered with your next role. Set boundaries on what you want to do and apply for roles that meet those boundaries or drive your passion. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding for me. I have returned to work, the place I’m at now is very immature in its process and operations and non clarified me would have snapped and rage quit within a week. Clarified me has a whole different outlook and perspective and so I’m able to see through that noise and do what I hope is my best work. \n\nGood luck my friend. Hopefully you’ll find what you’re searching for soon.",

I felt so overwhelmed by all that I had to do, but I also realized that most people were just coasting and maybe I also set the bar too high for myself-  other PMs on my team don't do as much and they were perfectly fine. So I was starting to feel scared of the person I was becoming and didn't want to blow up in meetings (I've seen some PMs who completely lost it in slack channel, meetings and got immediately laid off). So I am glad that I could take this time now. I was already trying to slow down before officially quitting, thinking that I would only need a month. I do feel a lot better now than before but I think the main blocker for me in interview preparation is the emotional residue I still have from thinking about my old workplace.

Not interview prep, not resumes, just small building energy. Reading a good product teardown, playing with a tool, or writing down what I would never tolerate again in a role. That reframed it from chasing the market to regaining some agency. Motivation usually followed action, not the other way around.\n\nAlso, being selective is a feature right now, not a bug.

I was also considering taking a longer break but nervous about what a work gap on my resume would look like. While you bide your time, I would suggest, take really high quality courses and certifications and learn new skills in areas you are interested in. I took some AI/ML courses on AWS, some design courses from Awwwards and considering courses from Scrum Alliance, IDEO, and School of Motion. I also started growing hydroponic lettuce and microgreens, learning plant based recipes, and locking in at the gym. These have all helped me fill my time with things that are worthwhile building towards for the long term and maybe provide a good story to tell to interviewers. \n\nI also built a fullstack app that I want to grow and develop over time. The idea here is if I can launch a product and have some healthy metrics to show, I can add it as work experience on my resume. \n\nNo answers but sharing my thought process and maybe you find something helpful.

Enjoying “doing nothing” is probably part of decompressing, not a failure to be productive. The anxiety usually shows up before the energy comes back.\n\nWhat I’ve seen help is lowering the bar. Don’t start with interview prep. Start with something low-stakes that reminds you why you liked product in the first place, like tinkering with a small idea, exploring AI tools casually, or writing down what you *don’t* want in your next role.\n\nThis feels like a transition phase, not a permanent loss of spark.

Have Claude pair write it or critique it. Got a bunch of research notes to make sense of and compare/contrast with market research? Have Claude synthetize and converse with you about the insights. Same goes for assumption mapping, creating context documents, and beyond. \n\nThen.. The same approach works for prototyping and vibe coding with either Claude Code, lovable or similar. Start with something small, get used to creating structured prompts (Product Requirement Prompts). \n\niterate on implementation, stumble and fail because you vibed too hard and ran out of token context, reflect, read a bit, digest, feel a tiny bit more competent and confident in that you are gonna be alright; repeat. \n\nIt's gonna feel awkward and overwhelming at first.

Create audio, images, videos, text, etc. \nThey can research documents, website and do things like summarize, contextualize, etc.\n\nThere are just a couple of strong LLM providers out there (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc). The rest is just a copy of those LLMs, or using at least these models.\n\nSome LLMs are hosted publically (like ChatGPT), so if you would want to host something local and private, use something like LLAMA. (Needs additional research and understanding)\n\nIf you stitch LLMs together, they can sort of automatically do things for you. We call that agents (ie: one system reads an email, connects to another system that validates against a data set and another system that compiles an answer)\n\nSince we are not sure if the outcome of ai is good, the new hot word is “evals”. Create evaluations that validate your outcome.\n\nThen, since an LLM is basically trained on all kinds of available, generic, broad data, sometimes you want it to be more specific to your case. This is where RAG comes in. A RAG allows you to specifically use only your files, content etc \n\nWhat if you want various LLMs to talk to eachother? APIs are not there yet, so we call that MCP. It’s a protocol that allows those LLMs to exchange info.\n\nAll of the above can also be learned through talking to LLMs.\n\nEdit: oh wait, since this is the PM thread: any AI implementation should start with a problem tonsolve :-) don’t start with adding for the sake of shiny tools",

Could by any of these or all of these:\n\n\\- If you want to learn about the latest developments in the technology, independent of what may or may not be useful for being a PM: I'd suggest tailoring your \"reading diet\" and making time each day to read + do some light convos with your favorite LLM to explain concepts you read about that you don't know. Try out some different newsletters about AI - subscribe to a bunch of them, read a couple of them in a week, and see which ones have the writing style you like. There are \\*so\\* many of these now. I personally like following TLDR AI.\n\n\\- If you want to learn how to use AI as a PM for PM work: Claude Code for PMs, as mentioned by u/Zokleen here, is a good resource. Once you read that, the big thing is to just give some of the prompts a try as you're doing your normal work. The great thing about LLMs is that you can ask them to do anything and they'll generally give a decent-but-not-amazing output the first time. The hard parts are 1) getting inspiration for what you can ask (which Claude Code for PMs can help with) and 2) learning how to improve the outputs (which you can dive into later as you begin to use AI more and more).\n\n\\- If you want to learn how to use AI as a PM but more going into coding: build the habit first by giving Claude Code (or, my new preference, Google Antigravity) a try. After you get more into a rhythm of that new way of approaching coding, look for online tips from others about how to go even deeper (eg incorporating agents).\n\nI will just warn that there's still a \\*lot\\* of hype out there about AI. So while it may seem like everybody's using AI to do absolutely magical things and we'll all be out of a job soon... a lot of that may be vaporware (for now). So don't be intimidated :)\n\n  \n(I am not affiliated with any of the products I mentioned here)",

I was so consumed with work that I completely missed out the AI wave. After the role elimination, I sat down and analyzed what is the fuss about. If you have money to join a course then you should. There are good ones out there. I wont mention any one as I have not taken any myself. Instead I have caught up on my AI learning at my own pace. After spending 6 months I feel ready. Here is how I got started\n\n1. Wasted few weeks to figure out the starting point. It didn't help. I also talked to friends at FAANG but they were of no use\n2. I started going through free courses offered by Google and other companies. Those were pretty basic and high level but AI started to make sense\n3. I finally decided to push myself and study for certification. I choose AWS AI Practitioner Certification. It was boring and I felt as if I was being punished. I somehow passed the exam and AI started to make more sense to me. The cost is $100 or in the same ballpark\n4. I then looked at my past projects and started looking for opportunities. For example, I have worked in eCommerce and AI can help eCommerce brands in various ways. I tried to answer the basic question for each scenario, do we need AI? if yes what will be the cost and the impact?\n5. Then I heard about something called Evals. It didn't make sense AT ALL. I mean it is the most boring thing in the world but apparently it is in high demand. So I started learning about it through LinkedIn learning. If you have paid LinkedIn then you can find tons of good courses on LinkedIn Learning\n6. Now I am using Claude Code, Cursor and Loveable to build apps. I have plans to build AI apps throughout 2026\n\nWhile learning AI, don't lose the core of Product Management. Consider AI as a smart tool in your toolbox and not the prayer to all of your problems. Good luck!",

          "text": "A very honest feeling shared by you. I bet many are also facing this Linkedin stress and disconnected feeling about learning AI. I went through it too. Here are some things for your consideration.  \n1. There is nothing called catching up on AI learning. As many others shared, the LLM frenzy and GenAI utilities are being oversold while also attracting a lot of well-deserved attention. These AI capabilities are still being developed and improved upon. Starting to learn today doesn't make you a laggard.  \n2. The product experts who sell podcasts/books/courses need AI to sell the \"PM is Great\" snake oil. So, you will see them heap praises on Claude Code, OpenAI, Gemini and everything else that allows you to create PRDs and roadmaps. As you know, all PMs hate doing these activities and what best than AI doing it for you.  \n3. Linkedin is a proxy for the good old days when people distributed business cards to get hired or look important. In meetings, you had to hold the card a certain way, place it on the desk a certain way, say its contents out loud a certain way and then head out for lunch/dinner to comply with the hierarchy. I am active on Linkedin on and off to just put things out but avoid reading too much into what people are sharing. It sounds like a bad idea, but I did assess my first-level connections and am confident that 99% of people I've met or worked with in the past don't care about my Linkedin updates or content. We have zombie-trained ourselves to hit the like button for everything.  \n4. To your actual question - what strategies are used to catch up on AI learning - the simple answer is, don't waste your time learning AI. Knowing how to use Lovable or Claude Code doesn't make you an AI practitioner or worse, an expert. Using OpenAI APIs to build solutions will exhaust your tokens and you end up paying money to maintain your \"cool\" solutions. Agentic AI is beautiful. Using n8n, as I did, doesn't make you an AI agentic force to reckon with. Tinkering with new things is a product manager's weak spot. You cannot stay quiet. So, you end up trying out the new stuff and then be overwhelmed by it since there is no end to the AI tunnel.\n\nIf you don't agree with the above points and still think AI is important because you are the kind of PM who never takes no for an answer, here is the best advice I can give - Don't learn AI outside of your job. Get a job in a company that does something related to the new-age AI (agentic AI shopping for example) and learn on the job. In your current company, move into a team/role that allows you to work in AI. That way, you show AI expertise, not self-declare it. Everything else is a waste of time and energy. Your feeling of overwhelm will disappear once you work in the AI-space and not just learn AI.",

What helped me was anchoring learning to a concrete problem, like onboarding friction, support load, or decision latency, and then exploring AI options that could help there. Tool-first learning felt overwhelming and disconnected, exactly like you described. You do not need to master Claude, agents, or anything else to be effective right now. Start with understanding what outcomes matter for your users and your business, then experiment narrowly.

Instead of “learning Claude / agents / tools” in isolation, I used them to solve actual work and side-project problems. Context makes learning stick.\n\nCourses can help at the very start, but only as a **jumpstart**, not the main path. The real learning comes from:\n\n* picking one problem,\n* trying to solve it with AI,\n* seeing where it breaks,\n* and refining your approach.\n\nAI learning isn’t about speed or keeping up with releases. It’s about **developing judgment** — when to trust it, when to constrain it, and when not to use it at all.\n\nIf LinkedIn is stressing you out, that’s a signal you’re consuming too much and building too little. Doing beats catching up.\n\n**One real example from my work:**\n\nWhile exploring a greenfield opportunity, instead of “learning AI in isolation,” I built a small internal tool using AI to **scan and classify prospect and customer call transcripts** to surface signals of intent.\n\nI didn’t take the AI output at face value. I went back to the verbatims and separated **true prospect asks** from **internal sales pitches**. That distinction mattered.\n\nThis gave me a much cleaner starting point — not a conclusion — to anchor discussions on whether the opportunity was real, how often it appeared, and what problem it was actually pointing to.\n\nThat’s been my pattern with AI learning:\n\nuse it to **compress discovery and pattern-finding**, then apply human judgment where it matters.",

First I would suggest to refine what you need:\n  - understand the technology to build features with AI in them\n  - and/or use AI to automatized some of your work (vibe coding prototype, automatise PRD writing ....)\nAnd then explore.\nFor vibe coding:\n  - Honestly the best is just to go at it and try. Use Lovable or Cursor and try building an app that you think can be useful for you. Try to break down the project like you would do with any product: MVP, second level of fonctionalities etc.\n- Everytime you get stuck just Google that precise problem - it avoids getting lost.\n - If you have a cold start problem then try to find one YouTube video that makes a simple example end to end and reproduce all the steps\n- Finally look at Tal Raviv and Colin Mathews content they have free videos with concrete walkthrough that I find good to start with \n\nFor AI automation:\n- I would suggest to use Claude. Anthropic as great documentation.\n- Claude Code or Claude App is not that different to begin with: ask what you want to achive to Claude, try to make it work and then you can ask Claude to build a skill for you (again refer to Claude documentation that explain very pedagogically what skills are)\n\nOverall my recommendation is to focus on one use case you have for yourself and test tools to solve it. Most of us learned this way: by doing :)\n\nI am sure you'll do great!",

Not enough to walk away, but enough to feel off.\n\n\\- The final interview was with the CEO. At the time, I thought it was a good sign. In reality, it was a red flag for heavy micromanagement.\n\n\\- When I first met the key people, you could tell something wasn’t right. They warned me about the product culture not being great, but said the Product Lead was acting as an “umbrella”, so I was good.\n\n\\- I was never formally introduced in the all-hands call, while new hires from other teams were.\n\n\\- Every product decision, no matter how small, had to be approved by the CEO.\n\nEnd of the story, the Product Lead was fired. Despite having some great product and engineering people, everyone was too scared to actually do their jobs properly. Once that “umbrella” was gone, all the issues became impossible to ignore. \n\nHonestly, I think I ignored the red flags because I really wanted it to work.  From the outside, it looked perfect: remote, good salary, great product, great press...\n\nAs a PM, what red flags do you look for when deciding whether to join or even stay at a company?",

If accountability sits with the PM but decisions are centralized, especially with the CEO, you usually feel the friction early. Priorities change fast, escalation is the default, and people sound careful instead of clear.\n\nOver time I have realised this has to be evaluated before joining, not discovered after. I don’t rely only on interviews anymore. I cold-message people on Linkedin, reach out through college or WhatsApp groups, or try to find someone who’s worked adjacent to the team. I am not looking for a perfect review, just a non-rehearsed one.\n\nThere will always be a few negative opinions, and that’s fine. What matters is the pattern and the context. Where is the feedback coming from, how consistent is it, and does it align with what you felt in interviews. Then you take a calculated call, not a hopeful one.\n\nCheers.",

Don't join.   \n2) How long do people stay there, look at LinkedIn. If people stick around for long it usually is a good sign. Reach out to people who worked there and left, understand how the place operates.   \n3) How do they give feedback? Usually, you'll need to do some sort of an assignment that will be reviewed. Notice how they give feedback and how they interact with you. Challenge some of their feedback, how do they react to it?   \n4) How much do they respect your time, if a company asks you to go through several interviews, several assignments, come for several reviews it means that they don't respect your time. If they don't do it before they pay you, they certainly won't do it after they pay.   \n5) Ask questions, challenging questions that make them say something negative. Ask about what should be improved culturally? Ask why that wasn't fixed till now. Ask which topics are most difficult to discuss with management etc'. Don't ask bullshit surface level questions.   \n  \nMake sure that they pay attention to detail, don't be an asshole, but don't fold for stuff especially in the beginning. Companies always talk about \"Hire quickly and fire quickly\" the same should come from employees, \"Join quickly, quit quickly\" if the workplace is dysfunctional.",

          "text": "Oh man, where to start?\n\nI have made some seriously boneheaded decisions in my career.  Learn from my stupidity, folks.\n\nIf they offer insane pay.  I once had a company offer to double my salary.  I was like, \"oh hell yes!\"  I didn't question why they had to offer so much.  Turns out, they burned through PM's like candy.  I didn't last long there.\n\nThere is a correct answer.  I once interviewed at a place where there was a standard set of PM interview questions and the interviewer was looking for the \"correct\" answer.  This isn't a technical interview folks, there aren't any correct answers.  OK, there are wrong answers.  But there isn't only one way.   The questions should be open ended, \"tell me about a time you faced a problem like this?  What did you do?  What would you do differently next time?\"\n\nThere is a study guide.  I was once sent a study guide for my interview.  \"Here is what we want you to know before you interview.\"  At first, I was like, hey super cool!  I assumed it was information about their company so I knew what they did and how they did it.  No, it was a \"here is how to be a good PM\" type thing.  Go study this framework, go memorize this PDF.  Yikes.  I declined the interview. \n\nThey expect work for free.  One time, a startup asked me to write a full on go to market plan and roadmap proposal for their existing product.  Um, what?  Are you going to pay me a consulting fee for the forty hours this will take me?  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE use case based interviews.  But make it a fictional case.  This is an exercise, don't expect me to fix your product for free.  I said, \"I don't really know anything about your business, your constraints or your current user feedback, how about we have a discussion about a theoretical company instead?\"\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  This one is more subtle, but I've interviewed with several teams who really wanted to improve results.  So, I started pushing on what they would need to change.  Features to kill, programs to defund, things to stop doing so we could get some room on the truck, etc..  Turns out, no, everything is critical and nothing can be killed.  So, you gonna double the size of engineering?  No.  Well, enjoy continued pain because nothing is going to change.  If the org won't let PM kill things, you're going to have a very frustrating time trying to fix an existing product.  It's our job to say no, if we're not empowered to do that, we can't do our job. \n\nLeadership (or lack thereof).  Who is running product?  Is that person an actual product person?  What have they built?  When I was a junior, I was just happy to have a job.  So, I didn't really ask too many questions about my leadership.  Later, I realized that some of these folks were completely incompetent (I know, shocker).  So, later I did research on the leadership of the org.  Who is running product?  Where do they come from?  Do they have any idea about how product should work?  Of course, if you are joining a startup, they will expect you to help fix all that, which is fine, but for a more mature company they should have senior leaders in place that actually know what the hell they are doing.  My last two gigs were the result of me finding good product leaders and following them.  I was happy both times. \n\n\n\nSorry for the rant, but you get the idea.  Go with your gut.  If you've been doing this for a while and the interview feels \"off\" it probably is.  If you're a junior, you may need to take your lumps.  I did, and my guess is that most of us have.  Not fun, but we learn from it.",

One of the biggest differentiators I've seen is how they ask questions.\n\nA common trap I see is the \"it'd be interesting to know X\" impulse. They ask data teams to pull numbers because they are curious. This creates motion (requests are generated, queries are run), but not progress.\n\nThe effective leaders I’ve worked with do the opposite. They ask sharp questions that cut straight to the core: *\"What evidence do I actually need to make this decision?\"* They work backward from the decision to find the specific evidence that would change it. If the answer to a data question won't change their roadmap, they don't ask it.\n\nI’m working on a resource for my internal team and peers to bridge the gap between Data and Product, based on the patterns I saw effective leaders use at my previous jobs. I want to make sure I'm not missing any major friction points.\n\n1. **Framing questions that drive decisions:** Asking \"What does the data say?\" (Passive) vs. \"What is the threshold to kill this feature?\" (Active).\n2. **Designing metrics that don't lie:** Using vanity metrics that look good vs. leading indicators that actually predict health.\n3. **Extracting Insights:** How to look at a mountain of charts and find the one \"signal\" that matters and ignore the noise.\n\n**My question to the group:** What other \"Data Disconnects\" do you see between Product and Data teams? Where do you see most people get stuck?",

What decision will it drive, or what change will they make because they can see the precise trace of their angle of approach over time?\"\n\nUsually the scientists have a hypothesis that maybe this data will correlate with some outcome of value, but most physicians are not researchers, and the researchers tell us that our data has to be coupled with quality clinical outcomes to be of any use. It's especially challenging because some of our leadership insists that \"surely data is valuable\" when they have no idea what that value might be.

I graduated from UCI as a ICS grad and my \"area of specialization\" was AI.  that just meant that I chose the AI track within the CS major.  So, it's not a new thing.\n\nBut, ya, I know what you mean.  Before GenAI and the new toolchain that PM uses.\n\nThere was definitely more labor.  So, today when I do a customer call, I always use an AI note taker.  I used to do that by hand.  I also kept a file with customer notes.  Today, I just push them into NotebookLM and ask it what customers are saying.  Back then I could not build my own prototypes, so we just didn't.  If I wanted to think about a new feature, I would just draw it out on a whiteboard or do a slideshow with rough sketches.  Then I would show that to my Design partner and they would build some mocks (usually in Figma, that hasn't changed).  We used Jira, Confluence, etc. so not much change there.\n\nNow I use Claude Code to build my own prototypes.  I would have needed an engineer to do that before.  I pretty much don't give PRDs or other documentation to engineering any more (HashiCorp for example required a long form PRD for EVERYTHING).  I just give them a working prototype.  Way faster.\n\nTBH, the core job of being a PM hasn't changed that much.  I still own the use case, I still talk to customers and I still worry about quality and velocity.  Of course, now I'm a Sr. Director so I don't do as much actual PM work as I used to do.\n\nHowever, the business of building software has changed quite a bit.  It's much faster now.\n\nWhen I joined MSFT (in 1996), I worked on Windows and Exchange Server.  Those products shipped about once every two years or so.  When I joined VMW, I was on the vSphere team.  vSphere shipped every 18 months.  Then I moved to the VMware Cloud team and we built a brand new SaaS product.  We shipped that product every sprint (every two weeks).  Then I joined HashiCorp and we shipped daily.  The last two years, I worked on AGNTCY (an AI toolchain product) and we shipped all the time.  New features are going from years, to hours to produce.\n\nI would say the most concrete change is velocity.  Things continue to speed up.  This isn't new, but the trend from my early days in the industry has been increasing velocity and I don't see that changing anytime soon.",

Therefore, your notion of using prototype as “PRDs” validates my intuition.\n\nQuestion - if a PM can make an idea tangible using AI as its “sparring partner” what is the role of Designers and/or Engineers in the solution discovery stage of product development?\n\nI can see Engineers still playing a valuable role in making sure something is built “the right way”. However, I’m unsure about the Designers role in this workflow. Seems they’ll feel constrained by the prototype and/or friction between PMs and Designers will emerge if Designers re-design or deviate too much from the prototype. Seems Designers ate facing the risk of getting pushed back to a “make it look pretty” role.",

I squeezed in my own heads-down work whenever I could - this could be anything from writing docs to summarizing notes to doing some data analysis, etc. etc.\n\nNow, to be honest I don't know if my calendar looks much different, but it feels like I'm squeezing more out of the heads-down time I can find. I use AI to speed up some of the more manual things, like summarizing a user research call into bullets I can share with the team. I may even be able to prototype something now in the non-meeting time I have.\n\nIt's definitely true that AI helps me be more efficient with a bunch of different IC tasks. But I find that the limiting factor is not just time (as it was before), but also my mental bandwidth to hold context and context switch. In other words, instead of squeezing 2-3 tasks into 1-2 hours of IC time I have in a day, I'm capable of squeezing in 5-6 tasks, or something like that.",

Why can’t we move fast and validate hypothesis faster?The reality is that in a b2b space things do t move that fast. We have our own hypotheses, yes. However big ticket customer s have a plethora of problems and it becomes a retention game rather than new customer acquisition or new revenue generation. This coupled with managers who do t have a clue and are mostly “GenAi” kids assuming a pm is just someone who can promote better into vercel is changing the job.

Now you have evidence of what problems your users agree are most pressing. \n\nThen quarterly,  interview 10 and redo the survey. \nThis process educates you and refreshes your problem list. \n\nIt won’t take long for everyone to realize you know things about users that no one else knows, as you should, as the PM.",

The assessment had all the sections of a detailed PRD. Starting from background, problem statement, detailed solution, priority ranking, go to market strategy, and change management.\n\nI spent \\~8 hours on it and it still didn't come out as polished and refined as I would have liked. But I drew a line at completion and submitted it. They setup a discussion panel interview with 4 team members. On the call, they admitted they hadn't had the time to read the doc :/ After my presentation, I got a generic we are not moving forward email.\n\nI blame myself that I didn't give 100%, and that was part of the reason. I also resent the fact that I put hours learning/onboarding into an assessment, where no feedback was given at all.\n\nMy thoughts on the process: This process seems like a lot of work for a potential job, for both hiring teams and candidates. If you want to make it part of the process, then keep the evaluation criteria transparent. I don't know where I fell short. The doc (the details, the language, the structure, the product depth, etc) or presentation (collaboration, presenting ideas, getting buy in, etc)?",

I ask them about how much time to spend on it and timebox myself, usually sacrificing a lot of details to make sure the overall story and strategy I'm pitching are clear.\n\nAnd I'll add that while I don't like them, I do think they're a better way to assess a candidate than a case interview or something very framework-heavy that is crammed into 30-45 minutes. A well conceived case actually does give you some insight into how a candidate assesses a problem space, approaches a solution, prioritizes amongst different options, and communicates effectively, all in a setting that is probably more relevant than some random hypothetical case about a feature in Spotify or Instagram.",

As in submit your written work and powerpoint and then MAYBE we'll invite you to move on, before I could even respond with a hell no, the recruiter came back and let me know that the salary range was also changing (lower) and that my salary requirements wouldn't be met, but she hoped I would continue on.

My last touchpoint was almost a decade ago when I transitioned over to the tech side from finance. \n\nBeyond the quant firms I mentioned like Jane Street, Hudson River trading or other more tech/quant focused firms, I would look to the hedge funds at an AUM over 10 (maybe $5B AUM). Point 72 is a firm that would def have a product manager role, citadel is another. Firms that act more like a market maker rather than a macro/long short/fundamental/single manager is where a tech skillset will be way more valued. There may be positions there but a firm that has high volume and touches lot of global markets will value you more. Quant shops are the golden goose.\n\nIf you have Sales Nav, do some research with LLM’s of Hedge Funds at this size. Plug in current and past company for what you are looking for and the title keyword of your choice. Just from my own experience running and being staffed on deals, the past company at firm is where you will get the most nuggets. \n\nHappy hunting friend!",

Contractor/fixed term contract is what we’re hiring for.\n\nAt the end of the day if you do get moved to another product that you don’t enjoy and there aren’t any other roles available for you to try, then that will be the time to start looking for a new job that is closer aligned with what you want to do. \n\nI don’t think there’s a ‘standard’ per se across the industry, will differ company by company and you’ll get a better idea as to how yours might be once you have these conversations with them.

What I've never seen happen though is to \"backfill\" the temporary absence. I think teams in the US are used to having people leave constantly (and on much shorter notice than a parental leave!) and being understaffed for months at a time.\n\nBut as many other folks said in their replies, on a one-year horizon, it's impossible to predict if your product will still be a priority for the company, if your manager will still be here, or depending on the size and stage of the company, if the company itself will still be here! And realistically there's not much you can do to prepare your return so far in advance, other than having a honest conversation with your manager (and your skip) and hope for the best.\n\nCongratulations on the upcoming addition to the family and wishing you a great bonding time with the little one 😊",

In smaller or fast moving teams, the product almost always gets absorbed or temporarily owned by another PM or a manager. After a year, things change enough that handing it straight back can be hard, even if everyone has good intentions. In more structured orgs, they plan a clear interim owner and a re onboarding path so you have a real shot at returning to the same space.\n\nOne thing that helps is framing the leave as planned coverage, not a gap. Clear docs, a roadmap snapshot, and defined decision boundaries before you go make a big difference. I have also seen people come back to a slightly reshaped version of their product, not a demotion but an evolution. It is reasonable to ask early what the return looks like and how ownership is handled. That conversation alone signals you care about continuity, not just the time off.\n\nIt is frustrating that there is no standard answer, especially on teams that have never dealt with this before. I would not assume bad intent, but I would assume the product will move while you are gone. The best outcome usually comes from aligning expectations upfront rather than hoping it freezes in place.",

For virtual teams its nice to have some chat but usually i take just the first minutes while everyone is connecting.  \n  \nIf you feel it´s a very disconnected team, they don´t know much about each other you can do separate social sessions. Might be one for introductions, sharing background, hobbies, family, etc or recurrent (in a team we used to play \"code names\" online. But this is a bit risky if the interest comes just from you and not from the team.  \n  \nFor retros it was already mentioned, but the key is not the retro, but what happens afterwards. If you identify 1, 2 or 3 actionables during the retro and you have owners for them, or created backlog tickets to follow-up on them and if after that there is real, measurable and perceived change.. then the team will value the meeting and therefore will participate more and engage more.  \nHaving said that, what i try to do to increase participation is:  \n\\- Only if it´s a new team start with a 5 minutes intro on why you do retros (continuous improvement). And if there are some conflicts inside the team remind them the premise: “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”  \n\\- Do an ice breaker at the beginning. They sound silly, but there is science behind them. They work, it´s easier to participate further in the meeting when you already did with a simple task like sharing a meme that describes your last sprint.  \n\\- You can switch from traditional boards (what went well, what could be improved, action items), the 4 Ls, start/stop/continue, to any other format (funretrospectives.com have some examples, i like the 3 little pigs one). I think this helps just a bit, specially if there are topics that are being repeated from retro to retro. Mixing the framework helps to bring new ideas.  \n\\- Give time to the team members to complete the board. Encourage to add ideas.  \n\\- Socialize and review them. Give the opportunity to ask or explain when it´s not clear.  \n\\- Group.  \n\\- Vote groups by relevance.  \n\\- Work on action items and owners (Again, here is not about how much you can take out of the retro. It can be just one) .  \n\\- You can start next retro reviewing what happened with the action items of the previous one.",

(2-min AI discovery chat)\n\nHey everyone 👋\n\nI’m a Product Manager exploring an idea, and I’m trying to validate whether this is a real pain for other PMs too.\n\n**Problem:** Feature requests that come in through static forms (or ticket portals) often capture *what* users ask for, but not *why*. The real context and underlying need gets lost, and we don’t always have the time or access to do deep discovery calls for every request.\n\n**Idea I’m validating:** An AI tool that helps PMs uncover the real need behind feature requests by asking a few smart follow-up questions at intake.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you do a **super quick \\~2-minute AI chat** to share whether you experience this problem and how you handle it today?\n\n[https://valiprfeedback.valipr.com/](https://valiprfeedback.valipr.com/)\n\nI’m using this chat only to understand things like:\n\n* Do you see this “feature request ≠ real need” gap in your work?\n* What do you currently do to uncover the “why”?\n* What would an AI-assisted intake need to do to be genuinely useful (or what would make it pointless)?\n\nIf you prefer, you can also just comment your thoughts, I’d love to learn from your process.\n\n**Note:** There’s an email field before the chat.\n\n* If you want me to share updates when/if I move forward with this idea, you can leave your email.\n* If not, a fake email is totally fine, I’m not collecting emails to market to you. I’m just gathering signal.\n\n**Personal note:** I used Valipr to set up this validation page + chat flow (it’s not my product). It’s been helpful for validating my own ideas, so if you’re doing idea validation, you might want to check it out too.\n\nThanks a lot 🙏",

This will still be a lot of work but narrowing in on a goal allows you to be pragmatic about what you spend your time learning.\n\nAlso, full stack isn’t really a skill set, it’s just two or three skill sets in a trenchcoat: frontend, backend, and infrastructure/deployment (if you’re looking to actually build things).\n\nYour original ask is understandably but unfortunately very overloaded with potential misconceptions and requirements you *probably* don’t need.

It's knowing what to learn and when. With AI tools now, you can build almost anything. But figuring out *what deserves your attention* is the hard part.\n\nWhat I've noticed: people who succeed aren't the ones who learn everything. They're the ones who get really good at filtering signal from noise in their domain.\n\nFor full-stack, maybe the question isn't \"can I learn this daily?\" but \"how do I stay focused on what actually matters as the landscape shifts constantly?\"\n\nI hope this helps. I too am pretty technical and have been wanting to learning full stack for 8+ years, but there is no need for that.
