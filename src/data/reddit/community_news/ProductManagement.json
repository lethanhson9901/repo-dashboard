      "text": "I have been a PM for 10 years. During that time, I have gone through the full range of training: the Udemy basics, the Coursera specializations, and even a $1,000 Maven cohort ( company paid ofcourse). I see people asking for course recommendations here every week. Looking back on my own experience, I feel there is a significant gap in how we learn Product Management.\n\nMost courses teach you how to write a PRD, do product strategy, craft roadmaps or use RICE for prioritization. They do not teach you how to deal with a stakeholder who whose priority doesn't align with yours or how to communicate with the engineering team after an unavoidable scope creep. \n\nMost curriculums assume you have complete freedom and total autonomy to just \"do\" strategy. In reality, you are constantly navigating conflicting priorities from sales, marketing, engineering, other product teams and leadership.\n\nWatching videos is passive and cohort driven courses are generally anecdotal where the educator talks about their approach to product situations. Without real practice, the frameworks do not stick. You can follow every framework perfectly and still fail because you misread the room or lost the trust of your stakeholders. In PMing, almost everything is subjective.\n\nFor people trying to switch to PM or ace interviews, you are expected to have \"Product Sense.\" However, there is no way to build that muscle memory without already having the job. \n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts: For those who have taken the big-name courses, did you feel like they prepared you for the \"politics\" and soft skills of daily work? If you are trying to break into PM, does the lack of \"real-world practice\" feel like the biggest obstacle?\n\n",

I was apart of 4 cohorts for the Product Sense course. I think I paid $600.  \n\nThe last thing I’ll say about Sathish was that he wasn’t selling frameworks, he emphasized the work that needed to be done to have what I call “cool as a cucumber” product sense.  It’s the kind of product sense where you can walk into a room and someone can ask you to build a genAI product for Dolphins and you won’t bat an eye because you know exactly what to do.  3 frameworks, 13 product “themes”, and roughly 50 sub product types and he has you work through most, if not all of them. The magic is in doing the work.  Absolutely no shortcuts.  \n\nThis is the standard I hold all PM courses to now: thorough, actionable, solving high value problems, teaching real transformation, and indexing on providing outsized value to the student. \n\nYou can keep your 4 week, 6 hour AI Prompting course, taught by the PM from the hot AI company and charging $3000.  \n\nKick rocks, good sir.",

Non-performance related realignment of the teams and no budget to accommodate me blah blah blah. \n\nI was honestly shattered and it really sucked. After being rejected from three Product Management interview rounds and not even interviewed for dozens more, I basically gave up on Product Management and decided to go do Tech Marketing again instead, which is what I was doing before switching to PM work. I took a role for a small company at a 25%+ base pay cut not even considering total comp, where the cut was deeper. This was basically a 5 year career rewind. Moreover, the health insurance benefits of the new place also sucked causing a deeper slash on the family's bottom line than I anticipated. To my surprise I was unable to bring my best work to this new role even though I was very experienced with it. This really threw me because I was already working at a pay cut in a role that I had outgrown years ago. \n\nI lasted in that role for a little over 60 days. A Product Management role I applied for in July contacted me for an interview in November and made an offer in December. The company is adjacent to the one that let me go and the product overlaps with the old one, but is more niche at this company. I took the role and I feel  a lot better about working every day. \n\n\"mojo\" is an emotional issue and you need to treat it as one. The layoff probably hurt more than you think and it probably shook your confidence more than you realize.",

So I reached out to the previous CPO at the company I used to work for before that job (so both of us had left that company) and asked if he’d be willing to meet and give me some mentorship and advice. I told him 20% of the situation and he stopped me before I could finish and said “Those people are crazy, get out of there as fast as you can. You are one of the most talented product people I’ve ever worked with in my career and you have to get out of there before they destroy your intuition.”  He absolutely did not have to say that, I didnt even ask him for his opinion of me - I had asked for the call to get feedback on whether or not the situation I was in was normal. He didn’t have to boost me up, but he did and I honestly know for a fact that I wouldn’t have landed the Director position I have today if it wasn’t for that conversation with him. \n\nSo reach out to someone you’ve worked with in the past that you trust (preferably someone a few levels senior to you that wasn’t your direct manager, but is familiar with your work) to be brutally honest and don’t be afraid to ask them “am I actually good at this”. I don’t know anything about you or your work - for all I know your new boss could be right - but the people you have worked with in the past and know your work are the best chance you have at answering that question.",

The spiral of sadness is real my friend and I say you let yourself feel the feels but also remind yourself that you get out of it. Processing the hurts is also very important - why you feel the hurt so deeply that it makes you question some of your major identity traits. Usually it is a close association of worth with a job.\n\nAs for interviews, practice and practice a lot. Record yourself answering questions, giving intro. Once you hear yourself ramble, you will know where to fix. Measure yourself like you would your product and tweak what needs fixing. I personally used chatgpt to run mock rounds and it helped a lot in grounding myself. \n\nLife is too short and too beautiful to work at a place that doesn't bring any joy.

I have been planning for this break so I'm okay from a financial and healthcare POV, but I have found it hard to deal with the feeling of having to be productive.\n\nMy main goal when taking the sabbatical was to rest and just de-compress from the negativity of my job so I can start the new year with a clear mind and find the next role. I don't feel like traveling particularly since I have done a decent amount of travel in the last few year and have grown out of the solo-travel phase of my life (I much prefer traveling with my partner and family - but we can only do this a few times a year and not like traveling for months). The goal of my sabbatical is to get back to building, fall in love with product management again and use all the new AI tools to incorporate it into my day to day.\n\nI just finished my first month of sabbatical and honestly have quite enjoyed literally doing nothing (outside of the usual cooking, wandering around, exercising). I have gotten a number of outreaches from various PM roles and I thought I would be motivated to apply to jobs by now but I have felt 0 motivation in interview preparation. I'm starting to feel a bit anxious b/c I am aware of how bad the market is and how it might take at least 6 months to a year to find my next role. At the same time, I still feel a bit traumatized by my old job (like am I getting into the same toxic situation again) that is hard to shake and it makes me feel very unmotivated to get my resume/ story together.\n\nI am wondering if anyone has experienced this weird lull of transition and whether you have any advice for me to build up my spark for working/ being in product again.",

It gave me space to heal and not create pressure to be on the move. \n\n2. This lack of clarity or motivation is part of your body and mind letting go of the trauma of the last job. Within like the first 8 weeks of my time out of the industry I toyed with the idea of being a truck driver, postal worker, working in a trade because it was just my body rejecting the idea of working in another traumatic workplace. Indulge the fantasies, but don’t be hasty to act. \n\n3. Have a plan on getting back into the market. I made a decision that I would start actively looking after 6 months off and then it took me until the end of the year to get a new gig (so another 6 months). Work out your current financial runway and then work back from there to work out what you can afford to spend on job search and mental reconditioning and time off etc (I had 18 months of runway and burned 12). \n\n4. Have a plan on how you’ll fill your time. I renovated a part of my house. It was a different kind of mental workload, I got to see immediate results, and I worked with my hands. Did wonders for my mental health and also was a way to keep my soft skills sharp without having to go into the industry to keep my skills fresh. \n\n5. Be far more considered with your next role. Set boundaries on what you want to do and apply for roles that meet those boundaries or drive your passion. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding for me. I have returned to work, the place I’m at now is very immature in its process and operations and non clarified me would have snapped and rage quit within a week. Clarified me has a whole different outlook and perspective and so I’m able to see through that noise and do what I hope is my best work. \n\nGood luck my friend. Hopefully you’ll find what you’re searching for soon.",

This is exactly how I felt - I was pretty much in a bad mood every day at work, and some random question from an innocent PMM would set me off (like why cant they just do their job and know this instead of asking me for the 100th time). I felt so overwhelmed by all that I had to do, but I also realized that most people were just coasting and maybe I also set the bar too high for myself-  other PMs on my team don't do as much and they were perfectly fine. So I was starting to feel scared of the person I was becoming and didn't want to blow up in meetings (I've seen some PMs who completely lost it in slack channel, meetings and got immediately laid off). So I am glad that I could take this time now. I was already trying to slow down before officially quitting, thinking that I would only need a month. I do feel a lot better now than before but I think the main blocker for me in interview preparation is the emotional residue I still have from thinking about my old workplace. Like I can't come up with a good answer for \"How do you resolve conflicts at work\" because I would just make me feel emotional and visceral about the conflicts I actually had to resolve at work.",

That makes total sense. Interview prep forces you to relive and package your past experience before you’ve fully processed it, so your brain is pushing back.\n\nYou’re not behind. You’re transitioning. And that phase often ends with clearer boundaries and much better instincts about what to say yes (and no) to next.",

The fact that doing nothing feels good is probably a signal you needed the break more than you realized. I have seen a few people rush back into interviews just to escape the anxiety, then end up in a very similar situation again.\n\nOne thing that helped me in a similar lull was lowering the bar on what “getting back into it” meant. Not interview prep, not resumes, just small building energy. Reading a good product teardown, playing with a tool, or writing down what I would never tolerate again in a role. That reframed it from chasing the market to regaining some agency. Motivation usually followed action, not the other way around.\n\nAlso, being selective is a feature right now, not a bug. The market is rough, but jumping into the wrong team costs way more than another few months of sabbatical. Curious if you have written a clear anti criteria list yet. For me, that was the thing that made interviews feel safer instead of threatening.",

The rest is just a copy of those LLMs, or using at least these models.\n\nSome LLMs are hosted publically (like ChatGPT), so if you would want to host something local and private, use something like LLAMA. (Needs additional research and understanding)\n\nIf you stitch LLMs together, they can sort of automatically do things for you. We call that agents (ie: one system reads an email, connects to another system that validates against a data set and another system that compiles an answer)\n\nSince we are not sure if the outcome of ai is good, the new hot word is “evals”. Create evaluations that validate your outcome.\n\nThen, since an LLM is basically trained on all kinds of available, generic, broad data, sometimes you want it to be more specific to your case. This is where RAG comes in. A RAG allows you to specifically use only your files, content etc \n\nWhat if you want various LLMs to talk to eachother? APIs are not there yet, so we call that MCP. It’s a protocol that allows those LLMs to exchange info.\n\nAll of the above can also be learned through talking to LLMs.\n\nEdit: oh wait, since this is the PM thread: any AI implementation should start with a problem tonsolve :-) don’t start with adding for the sake of shiny tools",

Could by any of these or all of these:\n\n\\- If you want to learn about the latest developments in the technology, independent of what may or may not be useful for being a PM: I'd suggest tailoring your \"reading diet\" and making time each day to read + do some light convos with your favorite LLM to explain concepts you read about that you don't know. Try out some different newsletters about AI - subscribe to a bunch of them, read a couple of them in a week, and see which ones have the writing style you like. There are \\*so\\* many of these now. I personally like following TLDR AI.\n\n\\- If you want to learn how to use AI as a PM for PM work: Claude Code for PMs, as mentioned by u/Zokleen here, is a good resource. Once you read that, the big thing is to just give some of the prompts a try as you're doing your normal work. The great thing about LLMs is that you can ask them to do anything and they'll generally give a decent-but-not-amazing output the first time. The hard parts are 1) getting inspiration for what you can ask (which Claude Code for PMs can help with) and 2) learning how to improve the outputs (which you can dive into later as you begin to use AI more and more).\n\n\\- If you want to learn how to use AI as a PM but more going into coding: build the habit first by giving Claude Code (or, my new preference, Google Antigravity) a try. After you get more into a rhythm of that new way of approaching coding, look for online tips from others about how to go even deeper (eg incorporating agents).\n\nI will just warn that there's still a \\*lot\\* of hype out there about AI. So while it may seem like everybody's using AI to do absolutely magical things and we'll all be out of a job soon... a lot of that may be vaporware (for now). So don't be intimidated :)\n\n  \n(I am not affiliated with any of the products I mentioned here)",

I was so consumed with work that I completely missed out the AI wave. After the role elimination, I sat down and analyzed what is the fuss about. If you have money to join a course then you should. There are good ones out there. I wont mention any one as I have not taken any myself. Instead I have caught up on my AI learning at my own pace. After spending 6 months I feel ready. Here is how I got started\n\n1. Wasted few weeks to figure out the starting point. It didn't help. I also talked to friends at FAANG but they were of no use\n2. I started going through free courses offered by Google and other companies. Those were pretty basic and high level but AI started to make sense\n3. I finally decided to push myself and study for certification. I choose AWS AI Practitioner Certification. It was boring and I felt as if I was being punished. I somehow passed the exam and AI started to make more sense to me. The cost is $100 or in the same ballpark\n4. I then looked at my past projects and started looking for opportunities. For example, I have worked in eCommerce and AI can help eCommerce brands in various ways. I tried to answer the basic question for each scenario, do we need AI? if yes what will be the cost and the impact?\n5. Then I heard about something called Evals. It didn't make sense AT ALL. I mean it is the most boring thing in the world but apparently it is in high demand. So I started learning about it through LinkedIn learning. If you have paid LinkedIn then you can find tons of good courses on LinkedIn Learning\n6. Now I am using Claude Code, Cursor and Loveable to build apps. I have plans to build AI apps throughout 2026\n\nWhile learning AI, don't lose the core of Product Management. Consider AI as a smart tool in your toolbox and not the prayer to all of your problems. Good luck!",

          "text": "A very honest feeling shared by you. I bet many are also facing this Linkedin stress and disconnected feeling about learning AI. I went through it too. Here are some things for your consideration.  \n1. There is nothing called catching up on AI learning. As many others shared, the LLM frenzy and GenAI utilities are being oversold while also attracting a lot of well-deserved attention. These AI capabilities are still being developed and improved upon. Starting to learn today doesn't make you a laggard.  \n2. The product experts who sell podcasts/books/courses need AI to sell the \"PM is Great\" snake oil. So, you will see them heap praises on Claude Code, OpenAI, Gemini and everything else that allows you to create PRDs and roadmaps. As you know, all PMs hate doing these activities and what best than AI doing it for you.  \n3. Linkedin is a proxy for the good old days when people distributed business cards to get hired or look important. In meetings, you had to hold the card a certain way, place it on the desk a certain way, say its contents out loud a certain way and then head out for lunch/dinner to comply with the hierarchy. I am active on Linkedin on and off to just put things out but avoid reading too much into what people are sharing. It sounds like a bad idea, but I did assess my first-level connections and am confident that 99% of people I've met or worked with in the past don't care about my Linkedin updates or content. We have zombie-trained ourselves to hit the like button for everything.  \n4. To your actual question - what strategies are used to catch up on AI learning - the simple answer is, don't waste your time learning AI. Knowing how to use Lovable or Claude Code doesn't make you an AI practitioner or worse, an expert. Using OpenAI APIs to build solutions will exhaust your tokens and you end up paying money to maintain your \"cool\" solutions. Agentic AI is beautiful. Using n8n, as I did, doesn't make you an AI agentic force to reckon with. Tinkering with new things is a product manager's weak spot. You cannot stay quiet. So, you end up trying out the new stuff and then be overwhelmed by it since there is no end to the AI tunnel.\n\nIf you don't agree with the above points and still think AI is important because you are the kind of PM who never takes no for an answer, here is the best advice I can give - Don't learn AI outside of your job. Get a job in a company that does something related to the new-age AI (agentic AI shopping for example) and learn on the job. In your current company, move into a team/role that allows you to work in AI. That way, you show AI expertise, not self-declare it. Everything else is a waste of time and energy. Your feeling of overwhelm will disappear once you work in the AI-space and not just learn AI.",

Tool-first learning felt overwhelming and disconnected, exactly like you described. You do not need to master Claude, agents, or anything else to be effective right now. Start with understanding what outcomes matter for your users and your business, then experiment narrowly.

Instead of “learning Claude / agents / tools” in isolation, I used them to solve actual work and side-project problems. Context makes learning stick.\n\nCourses can help at the very start, but only as a **jumpstart**, not the main path. The real learning comes from:\n\n* picking one problem,\n* trying to solve it with AI,\n* seeing where it breaks,\n* and refining your approach.\n\nAI learning isn’t about speed or keeping up with releases. It’s about **developing judgment** — when to trust it, when to constrain it, and when not to use it at all.\n\nIf LinkedIn is stressing you out, that’s a signal you’re consuming too much and building too little. Doing beats catching up.\n\n**One real example from my work:**\n\nWhile exploring a greenfield opportunity, instead of “learning AI in isolation,” I built a small internal tool using AI to **scan and classify prospect and customer call transcripts** to surface signals of intent.\n\nI didn’t take the AI output at face value. I went back to the verbatims and separated **true prospect asks** from **internal sales pitches**. That distinction mattered.\n\nThis gave me a much cleaner starting point — not a conclusion — to anchor discussions on whether the opportunity was real, how often it appeared, and what problem it was actually pointing to.\n\nThat’s been my pattern with AI learning:\n\nuse it to **compress discovery and pattern-finding**, then apply human judgment where it matters.",

Use Lovable or Cursor and try building an app that you think can be useful for you. Try to break down the project like you would do with any product: MVP, second level of fonctionalities etc.\n- Everytime you get stuck just Google that precise problem - it avoids getting lost.\n - If you have a cold start problem then try to find one YouTube video that makes a simple example end to end and reproduce all the steps\n- Finally look at Tal Raviv and Colin Mathews content they have free videos with concrete walkthrough that I find good to start with \n\nFor AI automation:\n- I would suggest to use Claude. Anthropic as great documentation.\n- Claude Code or Claude App is not that different to begin with: ask what you want to achive to Claude, try to make it work and then you can ask Claude to build a skill for you (again refer to Claude documentation that explain very pedagogically what skills are)\n\nOverall my recommendation is to focus on one use case you have for yourself and test tools to solve it.

      "text": "Not long ago, I joined a company as a PM. It didn’t work out.\n\nWhat still surprises me is that my instincts were screaming from day one (minus 1 actually). I ignored them and took the role anyway. \n\nLooking back, the red flags were pretty obvious:\n\n\\- During the interview process, they offered a salary and then reduced it slightly. Not enough to walk away, but enough to feel off.\n\n\\- The final interview was with the CEO. At the time, I thought it was a good sign. In reality, it was a red flag for heavy micromanagement.\n\n\\- When I first met the key people, you could tell something wasn’t right. They warned me about the product culture not being great, but said the Product Lead was acting as an “umbrella”, so I was good.\n\n\\- I was never formally introduced in the all-hands call, while new hires from other teams were.\n\n\\- Every product decision, no matter how small, had to be approved by the CEO.\n\nEnd of the story, the Product Lead was fired. Despite having some great product and engineering people, everyone was too scared to actually do their jobs properly. Once that “umbrella” was gone, all the issues became impossible to ignore. \n\nHonestly, I think I ignored the red flags because I really wanted it to work.  From the outside, it looked perfect: remote, good salary, great product, great press...\n\nAs a PM, what red flags do you look for when deciding whether to join or even stay at a company?",

          "text": "I’ve learned that most PM role failures aren’t about the product, they are about decision rights and trust. If accountability sits with the PM but decisions are centralized, especially with the CEO, you usually feel the friction early. Priorities change fast, escalation is the default, and people sound careful instead of clear.\n\nOver time I have realised this has to be evaluated before joining, not discovered after. I don’t rely only on interviews anymore. I cold-message people on Linkedin, reach out through college or WhatsApp groups, or try to find someone who’s worked adjacent to the team. I am not looking for a perfect review, just a non-rehearsed one.\n\nThere will always be a few negative opinions, and that’s fine. What matters is the pattern and the context. Where is the feedback coming from, how consistent is it, and does it align with what you felt in interviews. Then you take a calculated call, not a hopeful one.\n\nCheers.",

Reach out to people who worked there and left, understand how the place operates.   \n3) How do they give feedback? Usually, you'll need to do some sort of an assignment that will be reviewed. Notice how they give feedback and how they interact with you. Challenge some of their feedback, how do they react to it?   \n4) How much do they respect your time, if a company asks you to go through several interviews, several assignments, come for several reviews it means that they don't respect your time. If they don't do it before they pay you, they certainly won't do it after they pay.   \n5) Ask questions, challenging questions that make them say something negative. Ask about what should be improved culturally? Ask why that wasn't fixed till now. Ask which topics are most difficult to discuss with management etc'. Don't ask bullshit surface level questions.   \n  \nMake sure that they pay attention to detail, don't be an asshole, but don't fold for stuff especially in the beginning. Companies always talk about \"Hire quickly and fire quickly\" the same should come from employees, \"Join quickly, quit quickly\" if the workplace is dysfunctional.",

          "text": "Oh man, where to start?\n\nI have made some seriously boneheaded decisions in my career.  Learn from my stupidity, folks.\n\nIf they offer insane pay.  I once had a company offer to double my salary.  I was like, \"oh hell yes!\"  I didn't question why they had to offer so much.  Turns out, they burned through PM's like candy.  I didn't last long there.\n\nThere is a correct answer.  I once interviewed at a place where there was a standard set of PM interview questions and the interviewer was looking for the \"correct\" answer.  This isn't a technical interview folks, there aren't any correct answers.  OK, there are wrong answers.  But there isn't only one way.   The questions should be open ended, \"tell me about a time you faced a problem like this?  What did you do?  What would you do differently next time?\"\n\nThere is a study guide.  I was once sent a study guide for my interview.  \"Here is what we want you to know before you interview.\"  At first, I was like, hey super cool!  I assumed it was information about their company so I knew what they did and how they did it.  No, it was a \"here is how to be a good PM\" type thing.  Go study this framework, go memorize this PDF.  Yikes.  I declined the interview. \n\nThey expect work for free.  One time, a startup asked me to write a full on go to market plan and roadmap proposal for their existing product.  Um, what?  Are you going to pay me a consulting fee for the forty hours this will take me?  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE use case based interviews.  But make it a fictional case.  This is an exercise, don't expect me to fix your product for free.  I said, \"I don't really know anything about your business, your constraints or your current user feedback, how about we have a discussion about a theoretical company instead?\"\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  This one is more subtle, but I've interviewed with several teams who really wanted to improve results.  So, I started pushing on what they would need to change.  Features to kill, programs to defund, things to stop doing so we could get some room on the truck, etc..  Turns out, no, everything is critical and nothing can be killed.  So, you gonna double the size of engineering?  No.  Well, enjoy continued pain because nothing is going to change.  If the org won't let PM kill things, you're going to have a very frustrating time trying to fix an existing product.  It's our job to say no, if we're not empowered to do that, we can't do our job. \n\nLeadership (or lack thereof).  Who is running product?  Is that person an actual product person?  What have they built?  When I was a junior, I was just happy to have a job.  So, I didn't really ask too many questions about my leadership.  Later, I realized that some of these folks were completely incompetent (I know, shocker).  So, later I did research on the leadership of the org.  Who is running product?  Where do they come from?  Do they have any idea about how product should work?  Of course, if you are joining a startup, they will expect you to help fix all that, which is fine, but for a more mature company they should have senior leaders in place that actually know what the hell they are doing.  My last two gigs were the result of me finding good product leaders and following them.  I was happy both times. \n\n\n\nSorry for the rant, but you get the idea.  Go with your gut.  If you've been doing this for a while and the interview feels \"off\" it probably is.  If you're a junior, you may need to take your lumps.  I did, and my guess is that most of us have.  Not fun, but we learn from it.",

I’m thinking about this both short term and longer term.\n\nShort term the big thing is that I’d like to add some new active members to help with the day-to-day stuff. Recently, on top of all the usual garbage, there’s been a big increase in the number of AI and bot generated posts, and other types of spam. It’s been hard to keep up with.\n\nLonger term, I’m potentially looking for someone to take over as head mod. I’ve been doing this for quite a while now and would like to put more time into other things that I’m more excited about. I also think that it could be good to get a fresh perspective on what this place could be and how to get there.\n\nWhat you’d be doing:\n\n* Enforcing the existing rules – unfortunately, this is the biggest thing\n* Input on the direction of the community – providing input on what you think this place could be, and how to improve things, whether it’s a change in rules or how they’re enforced, or\n* Community growth activities – there are lots of opportunities here like AMAs or reference posts that have never been done\n\nWhat’s in it for you:\n\n* Unchecked power!\n* People love Reddit mods!\n* Fun thing to bring up at parties!\n\nIf you’re interested, send a modmail with something about why you’re interested and what you’d like to do.\n\nEdit: The response has been much bigger than anticipated.

One of the biggest differentiators I've seen is how they ask questions.\n\nA common trap I see is the \"it'd be interesting to know X\" impulse. They ask data teams to pull numbers because they are curious. This creates motion (requests are generated, queries are run), but not progress.\n\nThe effective leaders I’ve worked with do the opposite. They ask sharp questions that cut straight to the core: *\"What evidence do I actually need to make this decision?\"* They work backward from the decision to find the specific evidence that would change it. If the answer to a data question won't change their roadmap, they don't ask it.\n\nI’m working on a resource for my internal team and peers to bridge the gap between Data and Product, based on the patterns I saw effective leaders use at my previous jobs. I want to make sure I'm not missing any major friction points.\n\n1. **Framing questions that drive decisions:** Asking \"What does the data say?\" (Passive) vs. \"What is the threshold to kill this feature?\" (Active).\n2. **Designing metrics that don't lie:** Using vanity metrics that look good vs. leading indicators that actually predict health.\n3. **Extracting Insights:** How to look at a mountain of charts and find the one \"signal\" that matters and ignore the noise.\n\n**My question to the group:** What other \"Data Disconnects\" do you see between Product and Data teams? Where do you see most people get stuck?",

What decision will it drive, or what change will they make because they can see the precise trace of their angle of approach over time?\"\n\nUsually the scientists have a hypothesis that maybe this data will correlate with some outcome of value, but most physicians are not researchers, and the researchers tell us that our data has to be coupled with quality clinical outcomes to be of any use. It's especially challenging because some of our leadership insists that \"surely data is valuable\" when they have no idea what that value might be.

This is not a straight line path but a very curvy and iterative path. Can get a slightly better than MVP design from Figma Make out in 2-3 weeks for a new idea. Very function precedes form kind of design though. \n\nAt the same time, I have absolutely no problems with the similar aesthetic across vibe-coded apps. I just started using Material design as I liked the structure of it more. Very personal choice.",

I graduated from UCI as a ICS grad and my \"area of specialization\" was AI.  that just meant that I chose the AI track within the CS major.  So, it's not a new thing.\n\nBut, ya, I know what you mean.  Before GenAI and the new toolchain that PM uses.\n\nThere was definitely more labor.  So, today when I do a customer call, I always use an AI note taker.  I used to do that by hand.  I also kept a file with customer notes.  Today, I just push them into NotebookLM and ask it what customers are saying.  Back then I could not build my own prototypes, so we just didn't.  If I wanted to think about a new feature, I would just draw it out on a whiteboard or do a slideshow with rough sketches.  Then I would show that to my Design partner and they would build some mocks (usually in Figma, that hasn't changed).  We used Jira, Confluence, etc. so not much change there.\n\nNow I use Claude Code to build my own prototypes.  I would have needed an engineer to do that before.  I pretty much don't give PRDs or other documentation to engineering any more (HashiCorp for example required a long form PRD for EVERYTHING).  I just give them a working prototype.  Way faster.\n\nTBH, the core job of being a PM hasn't changed that much.  I still own the use case, I still talk to customers and I still worry about quality and velocity.  Of course, now I'm a Sr. Director so I don't do as much actual PM work as I used to do.\n\nHowever, the business of building software has changed quite a bit.  It's much faster now.\n\nWhen I joined MSFT (in 1996), I worked on Windows and Exchange Server.  Those products shipped about once every two years or so.  When I joined VMW, I was on the vSphere team.  vSphere shipped every 18 months.  Then I moved to the VMware Cloud team and we built a brand new SaaS product.  We shipped that product every sprint (every two weeks).  Then I joined HashiCorp and we shipped daily.  The last two years, I worked on AGNTCY (an AI toolchain product) and we shipped all the time.  New features are going from years, to hours to produce.\n\nI would say the most concrete change is velocity.  Things continue to speed up.  This isn't new, but the trend from my early days in the industry has been increasing velocity and I don't see that changing anytime soon.",

My first intuition when using AI to prototype ideas was a realization I was no longer constrained by Designers and/or Engineers to test & validate ideas. You can just do things now. Therefore, your notion of using prototype as “PRDs” validates my intuition.\n\nQuestion - if a PM can make an idea tangible using AI as its “sparring partner” what is the role of Designers and/or Engineers in the solution discovery stage of product development?\n\nI can see Engineers still playing a valuable role in making sure something is built “the right way”. However, I’m unsure about the Designers role in this workflow. Seems they’ll feel constrained by the prototype and/or friction between PMs and Designers will emerge if Designers re-design or deviate too much from the prototype. Seems Designers ate facing the risk of getting pushed back to a “make it look pretty” role.",

I squeezed in my own heads-down work whenever I could - this could be anything from writing docs to summarizing notes to doing some data analysis, etc. etc.\n\nNow, to be honest I don't know if my calendar looks much different, but it feels like I'm squeezing more out of the heads-down time I can find. I use AI to speed up some of the more manual things, like summarizing a user research call into bullets I can share with the team. I may even be able to prototype something now in the non-meeting time I have.\n\nIt's definitely true that AI helps me be more efficient with a bunch of different IC tasks. But I find that the limiting factor is not just time (as it was before), but also my mental bandwidth to hold context and context switch. In other words, instead of squeezing 2-3 tasks into 1-2 hours of IC time I have in a day, I'm capable of squeezing in 5-6 tasks, or something like that.",

Why can’t we move fast and validate hypothesis faster?The reality is that in a b2b space things do t move that fast. We have our own hypotheses, yes. However big ticket customer s have a plethora of problems and it becomes a retention game rather than new customer acquisition or new revenue generation. This coupled with managers who do t have a clue and are mostly “GenAi” kids assuming a pm is just someone who can promote better into vercel is changing the job.

Google has Gemini integrated into their notebooks so it’s nice for helping me generate graphs for exploratory data exploration and notebook-based mode training and offline evaluation.\n\nThe CTO is trying to build a culture of using LLMs to act as prototype mode architecture. Like in lieu of feature engineering and training a neural net, I do extremely light data fetching and pass it to the LLM to process into features I want and spit out structured outputs. I have mixed feelings on this. I feel like just using GenAI to build models with traditional model architectures is cheaper and probably performs better here, and I’m not sure doing many iterations on the prompt engineering is any faster.\n\nTl;dr much more expectation to be a “builder” not just do discovery and project management, which is where I’d usually spend most of my time as a PM.",

My idea is simple: take release notes, turn them into 20-40s vertical product reels (what changed + why it matters + quick CTA), and post them on LinkedIn + Shorts. Mostly to keep users aware and to make launches feel more alive without a huge production effort. But the issue is always the same: getting someone on camera, editing, captions, and doing it consistently every week. Right now I’m using Notion/Jira for the raw release notes, Claude for turning them into short scripts (way better than ChatGPT for this imo), Argil + ElevenLabs for a consistent presenter/voice layer when we don’t want to film, Loom or Screen Studio for quick screen capture when a UI clip helps, and Descript/CapCut for trimming + captions.  \nThoughts on this and how to improve it? Am I missing something? Please share with me if you have a similar workflow. Thanks in advance!",

My last touchpoint was almost a decade ago when I transitioned over to the tech side from finance. \n\nBeyond the quant firms I mentioned like Jane Street, Hudson River trading or other more tech/quant focused firms, I would look to the hedge funds at an AUM over 10 (maybe $5B AUM). Point 72 is a firm that would def have a product manager role, citadel is another. Firms that act more like a market maker rather than a macro/long short/fundamental/single manager is where a tech skillset will be way more valued. There may be positions there but a firm that has high volume and touches lot of global markets will value you more. Quant shops are the golden goose.\n\nIf you have Sales Nav, do some research with LLM’s of Hedge Funds at this size. Plug in current and past company for what you are looking for and the title keyword of your choice. Just from my own experience running and being staffed on deals, the past company at firm is where you will get the most nuggets. \n\nHappy hunting friend!",

      "text": "I’m a PM at a consumer app (~40 people total, ~16 devs). We have one designer who owns all solution design. There are no design reviews, no concept walkthroughs, no peer critique, and no formal research cadence. Designs are usually shared when they’re ready to hand off to engineering. Feedback is possible, but it’s very ad-hoc, and often dismissed with “you’re not the target market”, internal stakeholder review is entirely dismissed as irrelevant.\n\n\nAs PM, I’m explicitly told I should only work on:\n- problem framing\n- validation that a problem exists\n- defining success metrics\nBut I’m not allowed to explore or suggest solution approaches, because that’s considered “solutionising” and therefore part of design’s domain.\n\n\nExample of where this becomes confusing for me.\nLet’s say we’re discussing engagement features and the question is:\nShould a leaderboard be public (social competition) or private (personal progress)?\nI see that as a behavioural strategy decision,\nimpacts motivation, retention, and social dynamics.\nAffects backend architecture and analytics.\nBut I’m told that even framing that choice is “solutionising”, and therefore only design should decide that. My role is just to say “we need to improve engagement”.\n\n\nAnother example:\nMarketing suggests things like loyalty stores, spins, battle passes, etc (all very common mechanics in our space). Design vetoes all of them and proposes a single loyalty concept, which then goes straight to build. No alternative mechanics are explored, no concept testing is run, no prototypes are tested with users before engineering. Learning is basically: ship → watch metrics → maybe iterate later.\n\n\nAt the same time:\nI’m accountable for product outcomes.\nMarketing is frustrated about performance.\nBut neither of us can influence solution direction or scope.\n\nI’ve tried to push for:\nexploring 2–3 solution approaches before committing\nconcept testing without UI,\nlightweight prototypes before build,\nv2/v3 low-fi thinking so we don’t paint ourselves into technical corners.\nBut that’s consistently blocked as “invading design process”.\n\n\nTo be clear: the designer is talented at execution and UI. This isn’t about visual quality. It’s about:\nwho decides which solution strategies are even on the table,\nwho owns learning before build,\nand whether product is allowed to think about scope and mechanics at all.\n\n\nWe also only have one designer, so there’s:\nno peer critique,\nno design debate,\nno internal challenge to first ideas,\nWhich feels risky, but leadership currently sees design as “covered”.\nI’m honestly worried about my own growth as a PM in this setup, because I’m effectively prevented from\nshaping product strategy beyond problem statements\nthinking in systems or behavioural mechanics\ninfluencing roadmap direction in any meaningful way.\n\n\nSo I’m trying to sanity check with people who’ve worked in other orgs...\n\n\nQuestions.\nIn your experience, who should own scope and solution strategy vs UX execution?\nFor example: public vs private leaderboard, reward mechanic type, progression model, etc.\nIs it normal for PMs to be completely excluded from solution exploration, as long as design is involved?\nIn healthy product teams, is it expected that\nmultiple solution approaches are explored?\nsome form of pre-build validation happens?\nHow common is it to have no design review culture at all?\nWith ~16 devs and one designer, is that a normal ratio? Or does that usually push teams into delivery-only mode?\nIf you’ve seen similar setups, did they eventually change… or did PMs just adapt or leave?\n\n\nI’m genuinely not trying to bash design as a function. I care deeply about good UX and accessibility. I just feel like we’ve created a system where:\none role controls solution space,\nno one owns discovery rigor,\nand PM is accountable without authority\n\n\nWould really appreciate honest perspectives on whether this is normal, dysfunctional, or just a different operating model I need to accept. Founder/CEO is honestly a brilliant, bright, extremely passionate young lead, but they are inexperienced and hired this designer as one of their first hires and they have shaped his thinking into this is how high functioning product arms should function in B2C applications. Now that we've really grown rapidly, transitioning from start up to scale up, I'm extremely concerned that the product process in Discovery will inhibit us from reaching our BFH goals. \n\n\nI need a sanity check from other PMs who might have faced something similar. I have of course attempted multiple 121s to help steer the discovery and scoping process, I am at an impass where the CEO perceives this as a Product Vs Design issue, a newbie who's only been here less than a year Vs a trusted lieutenant who's been there from the start (1v1, yes that in of itself is a problem, we're in the process of hiring more product people; but honestly this worries me when these new candidates find out how locked off the processes are here with what's regarded as PM and what's design solutionising and ownership). I've been in PM for 8 years, working in orgs where designers are totally disrespected and told how to do their jobs like AI prompts, to this now pendulum swung in the other direction where product design has a chokehold on the process. \n\nWriting this in of itself has been therapeutic, thanks for reading my long post for those who got here.\n  ",

I want to investigate if social dynamics outside of personal friend groups will help long term retention, as a result I want to experiment with initially probing questions to prospective and current users, then eventually with V1/V2 prototypes to really test appetite. Designer sees this as app bloat and outside of my remit to suggest, his vision does not extend to this feature being used outside of the initial proposition. \nMy fear is that we build this without the proper architectural considerations for the future that lock us into this reduced scope as foundational refactors are extremely expensive. \n\nAm I wrong to push testing on hypotheses outside of the initial remit? As a designer would you think I'm stepping in your territory or is this kind of probing/experimentation part of my scope establishment responsibilities?\n\n2. Marketing lead wants to push several theories and concepts to our users, test it behaviourally to work out which ones generate the most appetite, similar but different to the above in that the solutions are a bit more defined (advent calendar, soft currency store,daily free rewards, plinko, etc). Designer isolated the core issue as a loyalty issue and positioned a loyalty stamp system as the one and only solution to be pushed forward. We were not allowed to test any additional theories/solutions, this was the only one allowed as he is \"the expert\". We cannot test this with prototypes, the defined process is to ship, monitor, and refine (god knows when as our schedule is packed) instead of doing more thorough Discovery.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two scenarios, I would sincerely appreciate your perspective given you are a designer. How would you feel working with another designer like this? Is it a red flag that we only have one in an org of 40 people and 16 Devs?\n\nAppreciate your time 🙏",

(that's probably part of why you get so much pushback)\n\nFor #1 it's a core question about potential users. My followup question to you would be \"Can we start with friends-only right now, monitor our usage pattern, and then extend the scope in a future release?\" I'd be a little worried you're in analysis paralysis instead of just releasing something, getting some signal, and making thoughtful decisions for a future release. If you say \"No, knowing this is a blocker for this initial release\" I'd 100% listen to you and start helping you come up with a research plan. I see you as the owner of the target market we're going after. Basically a \"is this a one way door or two way door decision\" discussion needs to happen.\n\nFor #2. (Same \"is this a one-way door or two-way door decision\" advice, but also....) I'd ask them for thoughtful reasons for why we shouldn't do some lightweight exploration and I'd also ask if marketing can lead the effort. Marketing has their own great research methodology and they should feel empowered to do it.",

Design is invited to critique your work on framing problems and priorities and Product is invited to critique solutions. Engineering is also involved in both so its not just you vs design, and if you have good Engineers they will have plenty of opinions / questions on both. It needs to be pitched as \"getting more eyes on all stages in the process will improve the outcome for the business.\" \n\nIf nobody cares after you give it your best shot and you dont feel like dying on this specific hill at that company then by staying you are paying the opportunity cost for your own growth and should not at all feel bad about trying to get your way to a better environment with a stronger team.",

What I've never seen happen though is to \"backfill\" the temporary absence. I think teams in the US are used to having people leave constantly (and on much shorter notice than a parental leave!) and being understaffed for months at a time.\n\nBut as many other folks said in their replies, on a one-year horizon, it's impossible to predict if your product will still be a priority for the company, if your manager will still be here, or depending on the size and stage of the company, if the company itself will still be here! And realistically there's not much you can do to prepare your return so far in advance, other than having a honest conversation with your manager (and your skip) and hope for the best.\n\nCongratulations on the upcoming addition to the family and wishing you a great bonding time with the little one 😊",

In smaller or fast moving teams, the product almost always gets absorbed or temporarily owned by another PM or a manager. After a year, things change enough that handing it straight back can be hard, even if everyone has good intentions. In more structured orgs, they plan a clear interim owner and a re onboarding path so you have a real shot at returning to the same space.\n\nOne thing that helps is framing the leave as planned coverage, not a gap. Clear docs, a roadmap snapshot, and defined decision boundaries before you go make a big difference. I have also seen people come back to a slightly reshaped version of their product, not a demotion but an evolution. It is reasonable to ask early what the return looks like and how ownership is handled. That conversation alone signals you care about continuity, not just the time off.\n\nIt is frustrating that there is no standard answer, especially on teams that have never dealt with this before. I would not assume bad intent, but I would assume the product will move while you are gone. The best outcome usually comes from aligning expectations upfront rather than hoping it freezes in place.",

The assessment had all the sections of a detailed PRD. Starting from background, problem statement, detailed solution, priority ranking, go to market strategy, and change management.\n\nI spent \\~8 hours on it and it still didn't come out as polished and refined as I would have liked. But I drew a line at completion and submitted it. They setup a discussion panel interview with 4 team members. On the call, they admitted they hadn't had the time to read the doc :/ After my presentation, I got a generic we are not moving forward email.\n\nI blame myself that I didn't give 100%, and that was part of the reason. I also resent the fact that I put hours learning/onboarding into an assessment, where no feedback was given at all.\n\nMy thoughts on the process: This process seems like a lot of work for a potential job, for both hiring teams and candidates. If you want to make it part of the process, then keep the evaluation criteria transparent. I don't know where I fell short. The doc (the details, the language, the structure, the product depth, etc) or presentation (collaboration, presenting ideas, getting buy in, etc)?",

They loved my presentation, but did not give me an offer. 4 months later, they shipped the exact feature I proposed, with the name, my wireframe design, and everything. It went on to receive several awards and become a leader in that little niche.... I'm still pissed about it.\n\n2. I hate doing a ton of work to prepare for a follow-up panel and have no one read it or remember the actual requirements they proposed in the case study, then proceed to ask me a ton of follow up questions that have nothing to do with the case study request.",

I told her in no uncertain terms that I was not interested and she seemed like she already expected the answer and was not surprised in the least. Ugh.",

Its major value prop was that when their customers leverage this service, the client saves on costs. And the service is the bridge between the client and the customer. However, there are two headwinds I’m facing:\n\n1.) Customers aren’t adopting this method as much as they have, simply because digital preferences have evolved over time. \n\n2.) The clients that we contract this service to believe they can solve this better internally. Therefore they are strongly steering their customers away from our service, sacrificing their own customer satisfaction. The saving grace here is that we aren’t losing to market competitors. There is no one else that does this. We are just losing through natural evolution.\n\nI have been jumping through a ton of different scenarios to breathe life back into it. IE: Changing the pricing structure, offering incentives, etc. There’s traction, but very little. \n\nI feel like I have to use the TAM to show leadership the potential here and ask for a large marketing assault on our client base to get them to understand that there’s still value here and that we’re willing to work with them to keep this service providing its value.

E.g. some industries like change and novelty while others are risk averse and prefer stability; so don't jump straight to changing the product.  **Sometimes, you don't have to build anything new at all to turn it around.**\n\nFor example, I inherited a similar legacy B2B product that had been declining for 3 years.  Users were plentiful and happy, but new sales slowed and churn increased.  After a lot of head scratching and talking to people, I discovered we were selling/marketing by comparing feature sets.  The users could infer the value of them, but the buyers (Dir of Finance, CFOs in this case) couldn't determine the ROI and competitors' marketing was stronger here.\n\nSo instead of building better dashboards or new features that buyers might like (you'd be surprised at how well an unused dashboard helps sales sometimes), I created an ROI calculator in excel and gave it to my sales team.  With some public data and characteristics, they could predict the revenue uplift for prospects if they used our product like our existing customers.  No one had calculated this before, and it turned out our ROI was 32x for most customers!\n\nAfter training the sales team on the simpler messaging, our sales freefall turned around and churn reduced.  And the 32x ROI gave me justification to raise prices and further increase margins.  That momentum then afforded me enough credibility and budget to hire the company's first data scientist and start revamping the product itself with ML (this was 10+ years ago) now that it was a growth story, not a sunset story.",

If its a \"let it die strategy\" then your approach completely changes as well and you could focus on minimizing costs (for maintaining or slightly enhancing) the product in the coming years. Alternatively if they are looking to regrow it, then you can take on that challenge a different way.",

If it’s still doing 30M at high margin, that’s not a failing product, it’s an under defended one. Leadership tends to dismiss anything that isn’t growing, even if it’s quietly funding the rest of the portfolio.\n\nThe B2B2C constraint is the real issue. If your direct buyer limits downstream usage, no amount of surface level marketing fixes that. I would frame options around where the friction actually lives: enablement for the buyer, incentives for them to allow usage, or narrowing the product to the subset of customers who already extract full value.\n\nGoing all in on marketing without fixing that dynamic usually just burns trust. A skeleton crew is risky too, unless you’re comfortable with slow decay. I’d bring leadership a few clear paths with tradeoffs, milk the margin, invest to unblock usage, or intentionally harvest while incubating a replacement. The key is making the choice explicit instead of letting it drift.",

Look at the business strategy of the company and understand the top priorities. Figure out 2-3 areas where you see that company can do better or in this case your BU can do better\n\n2. The product is making money at high margin. Look at the contribution of revenue and margin of the product to the BU's total Rev and margin. You said it is peanuts so I will assume that it both Revenue and margin share of this product is less than 2%\n\n3. Look at the trend. You mentioned that some customers are building the same product internally. My assumption is that you should be seeing decline in revenue or at least decline in growth (YoY)\n\n4. List the trade-off. You and your team are tied to the maintenance of this product. Can your squad be allocated to accelerate growth of other products in the BU?\n\n5. You mentioned you have a hunch that with good marketing the sale can be boosted. Prepare a report with data of this hunch. You also mentioned that there are no competitors. Isn't AI the competitor because you mentioned customers building this product in-house? \n\n6. Action time: Present both (4 and 5) to the your manager or senior management. They are clueless and you can guide them with proper research\n\n7. Most likely you will be asked to do more research about both or anyone of this. It will be a signal of management's willingness to do something about this product (Great!)\n\n8. If you are hushed away then it shows that they have made up their mind about this i.e. status quo. They have other priorities that you dont know or they dont want to share (Meh)\n\nAt this point you have to decide what do you want to do. If they are ignoring you then you will be just doing a routine job. If you want something exciting then you will have to look for something new internally or look outside.",
