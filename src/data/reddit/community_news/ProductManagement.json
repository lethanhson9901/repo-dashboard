I still missed that our competitor launched a major feature. Found out from a SALES CALL. Two weeks late.\n\nThe worst part is the anxiety. I subscribe to 12 newsletters. I skim maybe 2. I read 0 thoroughly. But I can't unsubscribe because *what if I miss something important?*\n\nI've tried everything:\n\n* RSS readers (dead)\n* Saved folders (never check them)\n* ChatGPT for research (doesn't know my context, gives generic answers)\n* Zapier automations (broke after 2 weeks, gave up maintaining them)\n* Just \"accepting I'll miss things\" (the anxiety won)\n\nMy evening doomscroll has become half \"staying current\" and half anxiety management. My partner thinks I'm addicted to my phone. Maybe I am. But it's not entertainment—it's fear of being the PM who missed the signal everyone else saw.\n\nI spend more time GATHERING information than actually THINKING about what to build.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?

What would anyone gain outside just having heard about it? You wouldn't be stopping the competitor release in any case.\n\nIf you are AS competitor driven as you are my gut tells me you're missing out on your own creativity. Be in the trenches with customers - actual paying customers - and find out what their needs are. And don't just build what they need, but challenge the status quo. Sometimes customers are unaware of hidden needs they might have. That's the magic of PM - be bold, be creative. That's why Henry Ford built a car instead of making a faster horse (as the people wanted).

      "text": "Not long ago, I joined a company as a PM. It didn’t work out.\n\nWhat still surprises me is that my instincts were screaming from day one (minus 1 actually). I ignored them and took the role anyway. \n\nLooking back, the red flags were pretty obvious:\n\n\\- During the interview process, they offered a salary and then reduced it slightly. Not enough to walk away, but enough to feel off.\n\n\\- The final interview was with the CEO. At the time, I thought it was a good sign. In reality, it was a red flag for heavy micromanagement.\n\n\\- When I first met the key people, you could tell something wasn’t right. They warned me about the product culture not being great, but said the Product Lead was acting as an “umbrella”, so I was good.\n\n\\- I was never formally introduced in the all-hands call, while new hires from other teams were.\n\n\\- Every product decision, no matter how small, had to be approved by the CEO.\n\nEnd of the story, the Product Lead was fired. Despite having some great product and engineering people, everyone was too scared to actually do their jobs properly. Once that “umbrella” was gone, all the issues became impossible to ignore. \n\nHonestly, I think I ignored the red flags because I really wanted it to work.  From the outside, it looked perfect: remote, good salary, great product, great press...\n\nAs a PM, what red flags do you look for when deciding whether to join or even stay at a company?",

          "text": "I’ve learned that most PM role failures aren’t about the product, they are about decision rights and trust. If accountability sits with the PM but decisions are centralized, especially with the CEO, you usually feel the friction early. Priorities change fast, escalation is the default, and people sound careful instead of clear.\n\nOver time I have realised this has to be evaluated before joining, not discovered after. I don’t rely only on interviews anymore. I cold-message people on Linkedin, reach out through college or WhatsApp groups, or try to find someone who’s worked adjacent to the team. I am not looking for a perfect review, just a non-rehearsed one.\n\nThere will always be a few negative opinions, and that’s fine. What matters is the pattern and the context. Where is the feedback coming from, how consistent is it, and does it align with what you felt in interviews. Then you take a calculated call, not a hopeful one.\n\nCheers.",

Don't join.   \n2) How long do people stay there, look at LinkedIn. If people stick around for long it usually is a good sign. Reach out to people who worked there and left, understand how the place operates.   \n3) How do they give feedback? Usually, you'll need to do some sort of an assignment that will be reviewed. Notice how they give feedback and how they interact with you. Challenge some of their feedback, how do they react to it?   \n4) How much do they respect your time, if a company asks you to go through several interviews, several assignments, come for several reviews it means that they don't respect your time. If they don't do it before they pay you, they certainly won't do it after they pay.   \n5) Ask questions, challenging questions that make them say something negative. Ask about what should be improved culturally? Ask why that wasn't fixed till now. Ask which topics are most difficult to discuss with management etc'. Don't ask bullshit surface level questions.   \n  \nMake sure that they pay attention to detail, don't be an asshole, but don't fold for stuff especially in the beginning. Companies always talk about \"Hire quickly and fire quickly\" the same should come from employees, \"Join quickly, quit quickly\" if the workplace is dysfunctional.",

          "text": "Oh man, where to start?\n\nI have made some seriously boneheaded decisions in my career.  Learn from my stupidity, folks.\n\nIf they offer insane pay.  I once had a company offer to double my salary.  I was like, \"oh hell yes!\"  I didn't question why they had to offer so much.  Turns out, they burned through PM's like candy.  I didn't last long there.\n\nThere is a correct answer.  I once interviewed at a place where there was a standard set of PM interview questions and the interviewer was looking for the \"correct\" answer.  This isn't a technical interview folks, there aren't any correct answers.  OK, there are wrong answers.  But there isn't only one way.   The questions should be open ended, \"tell me about a time you faced a problem like this?  What did you do?  What would you do differently next time?\"\n\nThere is a study guide.  I was once sent a study guide for my interview.  \"Here is what we want you to know before you interview.\"  At first, I was like, hey super cool!  I assumed it was information about their company so I knew what they did and how they did it.  No, it was a \"here is how to be a good PM\" type thing.  Go study this framework, go memorize this PDF.  Yikes.  I declined the interview. \n\nThey expect work for free.  One time, a startup asked me to write a full on go to market plan and roadmap proposal for their existing product.  Um, what?  Are you going to pay me a consulting fee for the forty hours this will take me?  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE use case based interviews.  But make it a fictional case.  This is an exercise, don't expect me to fix your product for free.  I said, \"I don't really know anything about your business, your constraints or your current user feedback, how about we have a discussion about a theoretical company instead?\"\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  This one is more subtle, but I've interviewed with several teams who really wanted to improve results.  So, I started pushing on what they would need to change.  Features to kill, programs to defund, things to stop doing so we could get some room on the truck, etc..  Turns out, no, everything is critical and nothing can be killed.  So, you gonna double the size of engineering?  No.  Well, enjoy continued pain because nothing is going to change.  If the org won't let PM kill things, you're going to have a very frustrating time trying to fix an existing product.  It's our job to say no, if we're not empowered to do that, we can't do our job. \n\nLeadership (or lack thereof).  Who is running product?  Is that person an actual product person?  What have they built?  When I was a junior, I was just happy to have a job.  So, I didn't really ask too many questions about my leadership.  Later, I realized that some of these folks were completely incompetent (I know, shocker).  So, later I did research on the leadership of the org.  Who is running product?  Where do they come from?  Do they have any idea about how product should work?  Of course, if you are joining a startup, they will expect you to help fix all that, which is fine, but for a more mature company they should have senior leaders in place that actually know what the hell they are doing.  My last two gigs were the result of me finding good product leaders and following them.  I was happy both times. \n\n\n\nSorry for the rant, but you get the idea.  Go with your gut.  If you've been doing this for a while and the interview feels \"off\" it probably is.  If you're a junior, you may need to take your lumps.  I did, and my guess is that most of us have.  Not fun, but we learn from it.",

One of the biggest differentiators I've seen is how they ask questions.\n\nA common trap I see is the \"it'd be interesting to know X\" impulse. They ask data teams to pull numbers because they are curious. This creates motion (requests are generated, queries are run), but not progress.\n\nThe effective leaders I’ve worked with do the opposite. They ask sharp questions that cut straight to the core: *\"What evidence do I actually need to make this decision?\"* They work backward from the decision to find the specific evidence that would change it. If the answer to a data question won't change their roadmap, they don't ask it.\n\nI’m working on a resource for my internal team and peers to bridge the gap between Data and Product, based on the patterns I saw effective leaders use at my previous jobs. I want to make sure I'm not missing any major friction points.\n\n1. **Framing questions that drive decisions:** Asking \"What does the data say?\" (Passive) vs. \"What is the threshold to kill this feature?\" (Active).\n2. **Designing metrics that don't lie:** Using vanity metrics that look good vs. leading indicators that actually predict health.\n3. **Extracting Insights:** How to look at a mountain of charts and find the one \"signal\" that matters and ignore the noise.\n\n**My question to the group:** What other \"Data Disconnects\" do you see between Product and Data teams? Where do you see most people get stuck?",

What decision will it drive, or what change will they make because they can see the precise trace of their angle of approach over time?\"\n\nUsually the scientists have a hypothesis that maybe this data will correlate with some outcome of value, but most physicians are not researchers, and the researchers tell us that our data has to be coupled with quality clinical outcomes to be of any use. It's especially challenging because some of our leadership insists that \"surely data is valuable\" when they have no idea what that value might be.

All the info already exists. It's in Jira, Linear, ProductBoard, GitHub. I'm just copying and pasting from 4 different tools and rewriting it into sentences.\n\nSprint reviews, status emails, leadership updates - same info, different format.

Some have details in confluence. Some in Figma boards. Some in PowerPoint. Some in Jira. Which I’m fine with because I want people to utilise things that work with their flows. But it makes my life 1000% more difficult, because I don’t have an easy way to find anything when I need to get answers, and it’s hard to easily stay on top of the overall state of things and know where I need to focus my attention. I cannot tell you how many times in the last few years I have thought “it would be so nice to just have an email from each product manager each week letting me know what’s going on.” And then I chastise myself. 😆 But honestly, I’m so close to asking for it. \n\nI know it sucks because when everything is fine, the report feels useless. But I need to know where things are fine vs where they’re not, or where I see dots that need connecting that aren’t, or any other number of factors I can see from a different perspective. I also get asked random questions from lots of folks, including the CEO, board members, and other VIPs that I’m expected to answer quickly. If that comes at 10pm, I don’t have the luxury of exploring 20 different sources and hoping I can figure out what different documents are saying. \n\nI would encourage you to find out who is really asking for your weekly reports, and ask them what would be useful within it. Hopefully you’ll find that someone is actually getting value, and it will make the exercise feel less pointless.",

That's not true, that's just performance art. Just look at how lawyers and politicians actually speak. They are firm when they are being proactive or have high conviction in their response, but that isn't always. They talk around when they are reacting and aren't quite sure.\n\nIn the long haul, people will respect you more if you are methodical and consistently prove to make good, rational choices. You won't do that if you are sacrificing your judgement for sake of responding on the spot. That's just reacting.\n\nLeaders want people who proactively improve the business. Not just order takers.

You're definitely not alone - there's something about high-stakes rooms that just flips a switch in our brains.\n\nWhat I see happen most is that people lose their anchor when the pressure ramps up. In your regular meetings, you've got familiar faces, established dynamics, and clear context about what everyone wants. But in stakeholder reviews or cross-functional sessions, suddenly there are all these competing agendas you're trying to read in real time. Your brain goes into people-pleasing mode because you can't quickly assess what's actually important versus what just sounds urgent.\n\nThe teams that handle this well usually do two things: they prep not just their content but their boundaries beforehand (literally writing down what they will and won't commit to), and they get comfortable with pausing conversations. Something like \"That's an interesting direction - let me think through the implications and circle back with you tomorrow\" buys you time to get back to your normal decision-making self instead of reactive mode.",

          "text": "Being able to fall back on good process can help give you more conviction. Start with good product discovery, requirement documentation, and data before you even get close to the roadmap review. Try to get more touch points earlier to avoid surprising people. \n\nRun proper product inceptions that include all of the stakeholders so they understand the problem being solved. Defining what is in and out of scope is possibly the most important aspect of this. Inviting stakeholders to this process will get ahead of future conflicts. \n\nWhen disagreements inevitably arise, you will have a paper trail of decisions and data. Different teams have varying levels of dysfunction, but in most cases having hard evidence and strong processes trump feelings and off the cuff remarks. \n\nIt’s always helpful to emphasize the “iron triangle” of software development. You have quality, scope, and speed — you can only pick two. \n\nOne trick I like to do is describe different scenarios to make them imagine the future based on different choices. If an exec wants speed of delivery, it’s certainly possible, but explain what that will mean for quality and scope reduction. Similarly if they want a laundry list of requirements, explain how much longer it will take. If they want both fast delivery and wide scope, really make them feel what a low quality product will be like. \n\nSo - do your homework. Communicate early. Be able to point back to process. Be confident in the plan, but leave options for flexibility. If there are disagreements, follow up individually to understand the problem. \n\nAs others have said, don’t be afraid of saying what you don’t know. Hopefully all of your prep makes that less uncomfortable. \n\nAnd finally, if you’re a nervous person, you just need to do the reps and practice. It’s a skill",

The assessment had all the sections of a detailed PRD. Starting from background, problem statement, detailed solution, priority ranking, go to market strategy, and change management.\n\nI spent \\~8 hours on it and it still didn't come out as polished and refined as I would have liked. But I drew a line at completion and submitted it. They setup a discussion panel interview with 4 team members. On the call, they admitted they hadn't had the time to read the doc :/ After my presentation, I got a generic we are not moving forward email.\n\nI blame myself that I didn't give 100%, and that was part of the reason. I also resent the fact that I put hours learning/onboarding into an assessment, where no feedback was given at all.\n\nMy thoughts on the process: This process seems like a lot of work for a potential job, for both hiring teams and candidates. If you want to make it part of the process, then keep the evaluation criteria transparent. I don't know where I fell short. The doc (the details, the language, the structure, the product depth, etc) or presentation (collaboration, presenting ideas, getting buy in, etc)?",

If the answer is no, I will usually decline them or ask that they give me a real situation that is in the past.   \n  \nWhy I refuse is that about 4 years ago, I interviewed for a position where I did real product work and proposed an innovative solution to the HM. They loved my presentation, but did not give me an offer. 4 months later, they shipped the exact feature I proposed, with the name, my wireframe design, and everything. It went on to receive several awards and become a leader in that little niche.... I'm still pissed about it.\n\n2. I hate doing a ton of work to prepare for a follow-up panel and have no one read it or remember the actual requirements they proposed in the case study, then proceed to ask me a ton of follow up questions that have nothing to do with the case study request.",

The first one they were an early stage startup and they gave me some pretend user research conversations and I had to come up with a PRD of what I would build after parsing through them. Took me about 3 days. I actually passed the assessment, made it to the final round, and they even checked my references but they still turned me down. I recently saw that they ended up using an idea of mine lol.\n\nAfter that I had an interview with a dream job. They gave me a take home that was super grueling as like the second round (after the initial hiring manger call). I had one week and I put my all into it. I covered every basis, left no stone unturned. Basically created a vision/strategy doc that mixed in with a PRD. It was basically like 40 hours of work and like 20+ pages long. I absolutely killed it. As I expected, they loved it. I then proceeded to have 5 interviews where they grilled me on it, while they asked me about other domain knowledge, work experience, etc. Passed every round. Finally made it to the final in person round with the COO. She asked me some pretty generic questions. After that got ghosted lol. Not even a follow up after 40 hours of work, 8 rounds of interviews, and getting feedback that i was the best candidate throughout the whole process.\n\nBasically all that to say that it’s an unfortunate evil. But I do feel they are better than those dumb product sense questions you’ll get at big tech interviews.",

As in submit your written work and powerpoint and then MAYBE we'll invite you to move on, before I could even respond with a hell no, the recruiter came back and let me know that the salary range was also changing (lower) and that my salary requirements wouldn't be met, but she hoped I would continue on.

The common one: the problem is directly related to the work they want you to do (so free work/advice), poorly scoped (a lot of work) and not enough time to deliver\n\n2. Related to the above, companies who are looking for a unicorn and are forever unhappy with what candidates turn in (heard this for one of the companies who did 1 and then rejected my after I submitted it)\n\n3. Not only do they ask you to do work directly related to the role, but then they judge you as if you were already in the role. Had this experience too which I was pissed about. If you give someone 3-4 days to put something together, dont judge them as if they had 3-4 \\*months\\* to work on something.\n\n  \nThe only good ones I've had were where the tasks were clearly based on historical data to assess thinking (and you were given a very tight word count to meet) or where they asked more theoretical based product sense/communication/delivery oriented questions.",

Contractor/fixed term contract is what we’re hiring for.\n\nAt the end of the day if you do get moved to another product that you don’t enjoy and there aren’t any other roles available for you to try, then that will be the time to start looking for a new job that is closer aligned with what you want to do. \n\nI don’t think there’s a ‘standard’ per se across the industry, will differ company by company and you’ll get a better idea as to how yours might be once you have these conversations with them.

What I've never seen happen though is to \"backfill\" the temporary absence. I think teams in the US are used to having people leave constantly (and on much shorter notice than a parental leave!) and being understaffed for months at a time.\n\nBut as many other folks said in their replies, on a one-year horizon, it's impossible to predict if your product will still be a priority for the company, if your manager will still be here, or depending on the size and stage of the company, if the company itself will still be here! And realistically there's not much you can do to prepare your return so far in advance, other than having a honest conversation with your manager (and your skip) and hope for the best.\n\nCongratulations on the upcoming addition to the family and wishing you a great bonding time with the little one 😊",

In smaller or fast moving teams, the product almost always gets absorbed or temporarily owned by another PM or a manager. After a year, things change enough that handing it straight back can be hard, even if everyone has good intentions. In more structured orgs, they plan a clear interim owner and a re onboarding path so you have a real shot at returning to the same space.\n\nOne thing that helps is framing the leave as planned coverage, not a gap. Clear docs, a roadmap snapshot, and defined decision boundaries before you go make a big difference. I have also seen people come back to a slightly reshaped version of their product, not a demotion but an evolution. It is reasonable to ask early what the return looks like and how ownership is handled. That conversation alone signals you care about continuity, not just the time off.\n\nIt is frustrating that there is no standard answer, especially on teams that have never dealt with this before. I would not assume bad intent, but I would assume the product will move while you are gone. The best outcome usually comes from aligning expectations upfront rather than hoping it freezes in place.",

For virtual teams its nice to have some chat but usually i take just the first minutes while everyone is connecting.  \n  \nIf you feel it´s a very disconnected team, they don´t know much about each other you can do separate social sessions. Might be one for introductions, sharing background, hobbies, family, etc or recurrent (in a team we used to play \"code names\" online. But this is a bit risky if the interest comes just from you and not from the team.  \n  \nFor retros it was already mentioned, but the key is not the retro, but what happens afterwards. If you identify 1, 2 or 3 actionables during the retro and you have owners for them, or created backlog tickets to follow-up on them and if after that there is real, measurable and perceived change.. then the team will value the meeting and therefore will participate more and engage more.  \nHaving said that, what i try to do to increase participation is:  \n\\- Only if it´s a new team start with a 5 minutes intro on why you do retros (continuous improvement). And if there are some conflicts inside the team remind them the premise: “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”  \n\\- Do an ice breaker at the beginning. They sound silly, but there is science behind them. They work, it´s easier to participate further in the meeting when you already did with a simple task like sharing a meme that describes your last sprint.  \n\\- You can switch from traditional boards (what went well, what could be improved, action items), the 4 Ls, start/stop/continue, to any other format (funretrospectives.com have some examples, i like the 3 little pigs one). I think this helps just a bit, specially if there are topics that are being repeated from retro to retro. Mixing the framework helps to bring new ideas.  \n\\- Give time to the team members to complete the board. Encourage to add ideas.  \n\\- Socialize and review them. Give the opportunity to ask or explain when it´s not clear.  \n\\- Group.  \n\\- Vote groups by relevance.  \n\\- Work on action items and owners (Again, here is not about how much you can take out of the retro. It can be just one) .  \n\\- You can start next retro reviewing what happened with the action items of the previous one.",

Rotating the facilitator helps too but only if the format is already lightweight.\n\nFor retros, changing the question matters more than adding games. Instead of liked/didn’t like, try things like “what slowed us down more than expected?” or “what would we stop doing if we were brave?”. Also, fewer stickies, more actual discussion as silence while people type usually kills the energy.",

It keeps the detail level high enough that the information is relevant to everyone.\n\nOn the days we meet in our pods, we often start by looking at the Scrum board, and I try to encourage discussions around features rather than individual reporting.\n\nI disagree with the statement that PMs shouldn’t run dailies. It’s not exclusively our job, but in an agile setup, teams should self-organize. And I think PMs are often very well equipped to spot decision points or open questions.\n\nAs for retros: A favorite of mine is the sailboat retro or any variation of that.

It's knowing what to learn and when. With AI tools now, you can build almost anything.

They're the ones who get really good at filtering signal from noise in their domain.\n\nFor full-stack, maybe the question isn't \"can I learn this daily?\" but \"how do I stay focused on what actually matters as the landscape shifts constantly?\"\n\nI hope this helps. I too am pretty technical and have been wanting to learning full stack for 8+ years, but there is no need for that.

The real context and underlying need gets lost, and we don’t always have the time or access to do deep discovery calls for every request.\n\n**Idea I’m validating:** An AI tool that helps PMs uncover the real need behind feature requests by asking a few smart follow-up questions at intake.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you do a **super quick \\~2-minute AI chat** to share whether you experience this problem and how you handle it today?\n\n[https://valiprfeedback.valipr.com/](https://valiprfeedback.valipr.com/)\n\nI’m using this chat only to understand things like:\n\n* Do you see this “feature request ≠ real need” gap in your work?\n* What do you currently do to uncover the “why”?\n* What would an AI-assisted intake need to do to be genuinely useful (or what would make it pointless)?\n\nIf you prefer, you can also just comment your thoughts, I’d love to learn from your process.\n\n**Note:** There’s an email field before the chat.\n\n* If you want me to share updates when/if I move forward with this idea, you can leave your email.\n* If not, a fake email is totally fine, I’m not collecting emails to market to you. I’m just gathering signal.\n\n**Personal note:** I used Valipr to set up this validation page + chat flow (it’s not my product).

If your team is small or moving fast, the overhead starts to outweigh the value pretty quickly. What worked better for us was something lighter where roadmaps are more about intent and sequencing, not perfect hierarchy and fields.\n\nI have seen teams do well with a mix of a simple roadmap tool plus docs for context, instead of one big system of record. The key was that it stayed easy to update weekly without a PM babysitting it. If maintaining the roadmap feels like work in itself, people stop trusting it anyway.\n\nI would start by being honest about who actually uses the roadmap and how often.

You end up maintaining the tool more than actually using it for planning.\n\nFull disclosure: I work at Easy Agile, so take this with appropriate salt. But I've seen this pattern across a ton of enterprise roadmapping tools. They're built for massive orgs and end up being overkill for most teams. If you're in Jira already, keeping your roadmap in the same ecosystem saves you from context-switching hell. Whether that's Easy Agile Roadmaps, Jira's native stuff, or something else depends on your needs. Outside Atlassian, I've seen teams do well with ProductPlan or even just a really organised Notion setup.\n\nThe real question is whether you need all the bells and whistles that enterprise roadmapping tools offer. If you're doing quarterly planning with a few key themes, simpler is usually better. What parts of your current setup are dragging you down the most?",

      "text": "TLDR: how do you manager your product development when you don't have a direct dev team, and have to act as the BA, QA and production support for operations?\n\nBackground: I work for an accounting firm as the product manager for one of its divisions. My prerogative is to build tools that can extract data from databases (non-SQL unfortunately) and transform them into formats that are acceptable (typically XML) by third party portals. Generally these third party portals are government portals\n\nI do not have a team under me, except for a BA. I am the other acting BA in my vertical. I do not have a dev team or a QA team. So now, my products are all built by IT vendors, who claim to have their own QA teams. The tools are then handed over to me for testing before going to production. Thing to keep in mind: I do not have an active production dataset that I can use to test these.\n\nWhat inevitable happens (has happened thrice), based on the limited testing I am able to do on a dataset I pull out of my ass, we encounter bugs in production which were not encountered in testing. For instance, today operations ran 1500 spreadsheets through the ETL tool to produce XMLs, and we encountered new bugs. This was the first production run, crowdsourced with an ops team of about 15 individuals. Now the vendor is understandably not willing to fix the bugs without charging the company, and the company cannot pay as the project team has disbanded.\n\nOne more thing to note, since there is a vendor building stuff, I feel we are effectively building IT solutions in a waterfall. We have to share all requirements up front, which we can do for the most part, but there will always be some corner case that will escape our assessment (think blanks showing up in the files which need to be replaced by 0s). Any follow up requirements cost money, and understandably so.\n\n  \nQuestion: Is there a tool or process I can deploy to make this process more efficient? I feel like I am one of the few product managers who is following waterfall to build IT solutions, and it drives me nuts!",

          "text": "This is a problem with your vendor management process.\n\nYou should be building in to your contractual agreement with them clauses that cover you for bugs uncovered both before and after the product is in production. Ours are standard that the vendor is liable to rectify any bugs identified for 30 days after the product release. We also have separate managed services agreement with them to be fixing production bugs according to an agreed prioritisation / criticality matrix.\n\nUltimately if your vendor agreements are not set up in your favor, you’ll be paying for everything they can get away with.\n\nThe above approaches incentivise the vendor to operate their own high quality testing process because they want to avoid bug fixing. Your testing should be less QA and more just final assurance. You shouldn’t be paying them for you to be doing QA.\n\nYou could also plan to be more proactive with your testing. Tell your vendor up front that this is how you plan to test and with what dataset. Set the expectation up front that you will want to see this dataset pass for these test cases. After launch is too late.\n\nIf I were inheriting a process as you describe, the first thing I’d be doing would be writing a process evaluation which clearly demonstrates the case to your senior stakeholders how you’re on the hook to be paying for a poor quality product. The way you work is burning cash and embedding poor quality into the product. There’s likely a very strong business case to change the ways of working. If they won’t listen, I’m going to need to decide whether or not to find a new job.",

But I could not replicate the testable universe of 1500 sheets with 20 variables each, and each variable having conditional validations dependent on other entries\n\n>first thing I’d be doing would be writing a process evaluation\n\nThat is a great suggestion!\n\nUnfortunately changing jobs is not an option.

If you can’t get production like data, try to define test scenarios instead of test cases. Edge cases like blanks, malformed records, volume spikes, and partial failures should be explicitly documented and signed off. Even if the vendor charges for changes later, having those scenarios written down helps in negotiations when bugs show up.\n\nSecond, change how acceptance works. Instead of a single handoff, break delivery into smaller checkpoints with explicit acceptance criteria. That at least gives you feedback loops, even if the contract is still structured traditionally. On the tooling side, what helped me was having one place to track requirements, test scenarios, defects, and vendor deliverables together. We used Celoxis for this, not as a dev tool, but as a way to keep requirements, change requests, and testing outcomes tied to the same work items. That made it much easier to show what was in scope, what was tested, and where gaps came from when things broke in production.",
