So it's difficult to say what one should be doing over another in any particular company because they are all different. The one thing I will say though, is that Product Managers are very very rarely responsible and accountable for the success of an actual product, despite the name. Usually it's the Head of Product who claims responsibility. In my view, someone should own a product when they are the most knowledgeable person to take active responsibility for a product's success. Sometimes products are the whole company. So, to me, the title \"Product Manager\" should mean exactly that, but the corporate world broke this.",

Expertise in the product space - can be one of or all of the following: technical, market/competition, customer research, customer discovery, pricing, insights, data, etc.   You can sense their level of depth and expertise when talking to them - the staff/principal just knows their shit inside and out around the product space and it's very apparent.\n2. Independence/Leadership -- Staff/Principal level can run the ship and guide all decisions pretty independently -- the best ones don't act this way necessarily, but if there was no VP, CPO, or CEO -- the staff/principal would keep on trucking, making the tough calls, tradeoffs, and taking the hit when it doesn't work, re-chart new course, etc.   A lot of this stems from the foundation of #1.\n3. Presence -- the combination of #1 and #2 create a strong personality inside the company.  If there is ever a question about anything related to the product space -- this person's name should first on everyone's tongue.  So act like a leader, act like a Staff before you get promoted, establish the relationships, establish your expertise while still being 100% collaborative and authentically interested in other peoples ideas and contributions.\n\nIf this all sounds nutty -- yep that's PM -- being the strong expert independent leader while also authentically including everyone else.

BUT, just because you have a good idea, doesn't mean it will work so you need to be a master of tearing your ideas to shreds and validating it as best as you can, by speaking to customers, stakeholders, sales people, engineers, users etc. Engineers are critical because they'll tell you if it's even possible and affordable to build.

On the other side I've seen companies create a new vanity metric every week, thinking they are very clever and take absolutely nothing from it. I've sat with many data scientists over the years who set me straight on a number of things. \n\nIf you look in the books they'll probably hark on about the North Star Metric. Whilst it's a valid metric, many end up using that as the holy grail at the cost of not really understanding anything.\n\nFor me, the key is to analyse a journey map and question everything as you progress along it. \"What's going on here\", \"what could this impact\". Some metrics are not in the purview so the hypothesis needs to be created in order to discover it. \n\nEssentially I see data as glowing lines illuminated from an idea you have about what's going on. Things don't tend to just pop out of a bunch of dashboards unless they're just hygiene metrics. \n\nBe a thinker. Ask, \"what if that impacts that? Or that means this? Let's look see\"",

I've done product management for 10+ years now across many industries, built many product 0>1 and I often feel like I want to get out of the field altogether. Every manager or company I've worked at/with has a different definition of what \"good\" product management actually is. I wrote about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does\\_anyone\\_think\\_that\\_the\\_expectations\\_for\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does_anyone_think_that_the_expectations_for_what/)\n\nWhat would be your mental model for determining whether someone (1) is good at product, but just not in the right company/industry; or (2) needs to move to a different function entirely? And how do you handle the fact that often, your job satisfaction as a PM relies quite heavily on the environment you're in?",

To mitigate risk you need to know as much as you can about the environment. It's a proactive role, not a passive one.

              "text": "Ohhh. I was waiting for this question. I've studied AI at Oxford University so I've got a pretty clear idea what I think will happen. Not good though.\n\nSo all we hear is: AI is going to create a new utopia and everyone needs to come on the journey or be left behind.\n\nWhilst I agree that everyone needs to learn AI, I don't believe it will save their jobs. It's specifically designed as a cognitive and administrative replacement. All jobs will be impacted eventually.\n\nThe question is, how much of the \"middle\" ground can the economy tolerate before we reach this utopia. I'm very negative about this. I see a middle ground where most roles gradually diminish in numbers. Not completely go away, but just go down. I mean, if it drops by only 10% we've got an economic crisis with indebted governments.\n\nSo, I think the redundancies will work up the experience chain until the most experienced are left running the show, doing more with less human support. As a consultant I'm already seeing this in real-time.\n\nOr, AI will be unsafe and unsecure and an event forces a pause. In which case, business as usual :)",

I've used very few in my life because they're always niche. My only framework has been my experience that I use to handle differing scenarios.\n\nFrameworks are good for things that are truly difficult to do without. How many of those can you name? I actually created a framework myself, which is niche, but solves really fucking difficult problem. And I only use that now for the situation it was designed for.\n\nI think people have lost sight of the nature of product management because there are so many people feeding off the dysfunction of product management that it has made it deafening.",

I know the answer, but my brain just skips right past the answer as it's \"common sense\" or \"they wouldn't ask this basic of a question\" , i give an answer later to find it's not what they were asking and I knew the answer they were looking for I just didn't say it out loud as it was too basic\n\n\nLike I'm have trained myself for speed and efficiency, as in dodging basic stuff to get to the core...\n\nHow do I unlearn this or rather how do I learn the basic stuff?

We would teach them, check their understanding and then a week or two later they would fall back into their original habit. There were 3 things at play here. The first was memory. We needed to ensure we were champions everyday and checking everyone remembered to do what they were supposed to. The second was gaps. When someone learns something and then goes back to their original work they sometimes encounter an edge case. They don't yet know how that edge case is solved in the new system and rather than check, they just do what they know using the old system. The third was command. If the leadership didn't understand fully or buy into it well enough they wouldn't hold their staff to account. We needed to ensure the management were mandating the new process otherwise people just do what they want.\nSounds like you're doing your best with 1 and 2, so maybe see if you can influence leadership to get some bossing",

The \"wait how did I get here\" PM. Internal talent who climbed the ranks and ended up in product. They either love it or can't wait to get enough equity to bail. Almost exclusively works remotely. Energy of a nervous golden retriever– friendly but easily overwhelmed. \n\n(I say this knowing good and well I'm probably in the third camp.) \n\nDifferent businesses attract different PM archetypes.

      "text": "I see a lot of advice on how to prep ahead of a meeting, but not a lot of discussion on how to recover when the meeting inevitably doesn't go as planned.\n\nThe moment when you’re in the room, and...\n\nAn exec cuts you off with a dumb in the weeds unrelated question.  \nTwo stakeholders start debating each other.  \nSomeone says the timeline is impossible.  \nSuddenly, you’re managing people, not presenting.\n\nI've learned that trying to argue or defend myself usually ended badly, so here's how I adopted my strategy over time. Let me know if you have anything to add or disagree with.\n\n1. Pause the conversation. Get people to shut up and regain control for just a second.\n\nI use something like:\n\n“Hold on, let’s pause for a second.”  \n“I want to make sure I’m understanding the concern.”\n\n  \n2. I try to function like a PM and actually define the problem publicly\n\nI don't defend anything or try to explain, I just try to name the concern.\n\nSomething like:  \n  \n\"So to confirm, it sounds like the concern is related to delivery risk more than strategy risk, is that correct?\"\n\nIf it's not, I let them clarify and then try to repeat back by further defining it. Often, the most heated moments are messy because nobody’s named the problem cleanly. Once it’s stated in a sentence, the energy usually drops a notch. People relax when they feel heard.\n\n  \n3. I try to steer the conversation back in a product direction.\n\ne.g. if you say, \"thoughts?\", a meeting with fall apart.   \n  \nInstead, now that I've named the problem, I say somethin glike: \"ok, let's stay on the delivery risk for a moment.\"  \n  \n My goal here is to regain control and point the group in 1 constructive direction. People can still disagree, but at least it's within the confines of the topic (e.g. delivery risk) instead of all over the place.\n\n4. Lastly, it's on me as the PM to land the plane  \nAt some point, as the meeting get's closer to the close, I'll say:\n\n\"Here are the options I see...\"\n\nI'll then walk through options as presented in the meeting (intentionally giving credit to any stakeholders that brought them up. (e.g. As steve mentioned...\"XYZ path\"). This helps them feel like they contributed to the successful alignment.\n\nThen I'll make a hard recommendation:  \n\"Given the constraints, this is what I recommend\"\n\nAnd stop talking.\n\nThe silence feels long. Let it be long. That pause forces decisions. If you rush to fill it, the meeting drifts again.\n\nThis is the hardest part, but it works.\n\n  \nThese are usually the meetings where people have come back to me later and said that they were \"well run\"\n\nI'd love to hear you approach and if you'd add or take anything away from this.\n\n\n\n",

The more I read and The more I've experience it seems like you need to really have everybody on board before the actual alignment meeting happens. There may be many steps to getting there and it might require several different cycles of shifting governance, but this is the way to do it. Everyone should already be on board and essentially the meeting is a rubber stamp. Really seasoned product managers but also engagement managers have found ways to Ace this process. Everyone might not truly be aligned in the presessions since you can't have everybody together at the same time but you certainly have already captured all the concerns and at that point you are just triangulating and bringing the recommendation based on all the concerns. ",

This is the best strategy to run these meetings. Whenever the train (discussion) derails you bring it back. I want to add one more thing. I always say \"Lets pause and think why are we here?\". Then link the discussion to the business goal. If an executive has created this ruckus they will be put on the backfoot immediately. The benefit of bringing/highlighting business objective is that everyone can start to visualize the outcome. If you are dealing with smart people with no ego then that would be the end of the discussion. They will either agree with you and let you continue or bring something that you may have missed.

The best product visions are rooted in real customer pain, validated demand, and strategic clarity. You're not making things up. You're connecting dots others haven't connected yet and helping people see a future that solves real problems.  \n  \nThe danger in what your CPO said is the phrase \"even if the numbers don't add up or if realism gets in the way.\" That's not storytelling. That's salesmanship without substance. And it burns credibility fast.  \n  \nStrong product leaders are stubborn on vision but flexible on details. They know the difference between selling a hypothesis they believe in and selling fiction. You can have conviction about where you're headed without ignoring data or pretending problems don't exist. In fact, credibility comes from acknowledging the hard stuff and showing you've thought it through.  \n  \nSo yes, storytelling matters. But the story has to be built on something real.",

What has helped me get promoted on multiple teams is communicating that I want to be promoted and building a plan together with my manager.  Then, I frequently report my progress. Typically I have this conversation about a year out. During the year I am aiming to get promoted, I make the items on this plan my top priorities. This helps with “doing less” to get promoted. Know your organization’s promotion cycles so you can plan well ahead. \n\nAlso, you mentioned visibility. This is a huge factor for promotions in large organizations. Take every opportunity to show off your work, especially to people outside of your team. \n\nLastly, ask around to better understand the promotion process in your organization. Ask what your colleagues did to earn their promotions. You are making some assumptions about what they are doing, but go ask them! Also tell them that you want to be promoted. It never hurts to have advocates!",

Stop being the safety net for everything and replace your \"yes\" with tradeoffs\n\nStop saying yes to random stuff. If it's not helping build your narrative or drive impact, so no with tradeoff framing.\n\nInstead of “I’ll try to fit it in,” you say,  \n“If we take this on, which initiative should slow down?”\n\nWrite down the last 10 things you handled. Circle the ones that could have been owned by someone else with clear expectations. Delegate them! The next time someone asks for something, respond with a priority tradeoff question instead of an automatic yes.\n\n  \n2. Pick the 2 highest visibility/leverage bets and let the rest be average\n\nYou can't be amazing at 10 things. Narrow your focus and drop, delegate, put in maintenance, the non visibile non high impact work.\n\nTry picking the 2 projects that would matter most in your next promo packet. Ask yourself honestly if your calendar reflects that priority. If not, fix the calendar.\n\n  \n3. Stop doing invisible work  \nA PM is basically invisible to leadership. 90% of what you do is with xfn teams that have no say in your promo. YOU have to drive your promo narrative.  \n\n\nDo this: once a week communicate at least 1 win to your boss (framed in terms of business outcomes)\n\n  \n4. Start declining meetings.   \nDo an audit and ask if this is helping or hurting your narrative and then start exiting them. \n\n\n\n5. Turn your narrative into sponsorship.\n\nPromotions are sponsor-driven. After you build the narrative, you have to deliberately align leaders around it ahead of the cycle. Most PMs skip this and hope impact speaks for itself. It doesn’t.\n\nThe mechanics of how to build sponsors and prep them is a bigger topic than fits in a comment. Happy to explain the mechanics if anyone wants it, just DM.  \n\n\n",

You also need to determine how best to prioritize and to focus your efforts so you deliver the meaningful contributions. Don't manage tasks, manage the broader strategy and showcase the strategic efforts. This is important - you have to learn how to tell your story.

They get handed one or two initiatives that are already framed as company priorities and have exec attention. If it goes well, it is automatically visible and it maps cleanly to a promo story. From the outside it looks like deliberate restraint and strategy. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is just better positioning.\n\nIf you are not getting those opportunities, you compensate. You say yes to more things, you cover more surface area, you deliver in multiple less highlighted areas so your value is undeniable. That can be real impact, but it also brands you as the reliable workhorse who keeps everything moving. Promotions tend to go to the person who is seen as driving direction, not the person who is seen as catching everything.\n\nSo when someone says “work smarter, not harder,” what they usually mean in practice is “make sure your impact is tied to a top priority and is obvious to the people who decide promos.” If your wins are spread across a bunch of smaller lanes, you can end up doing more and getting less credit.",

That's basically it. Saying no was their default. Not in a dick way but \"let me check priorities\" then come back with \"can't take this right now but maybe Q3.\" Made it look like resource constraint not laziness.\n\nThey picked maybe 2-3 big things per quarter max. Everything else they found ways to dump or let die. The big things were stuff execs actually cared about not just stuff that needed doing.\n\nThey made sure execs heard about wins directly. Quick slack updates, casual mentions in meetings, asking for exec input. Not brown nosing just making sure the right people knew what they owned.\n\nStopped being in every meeting. Way more selective. Sent updates async instead of showing up. Only went when it actually mattered.\n\nHere's what hurts people like you:\n\nBeing everywhere makes you look like a coordinator not a strategist. Saying yes to everything signals you can't prioritize. Doing good work nobody upstream sees doesn't help you at all.\n\nYour reputation will take a hit when you start saying no. Some people will think you're slacking. But the people who matter for your promo won't if you do it right.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nBe explicit about priorities. \"I'm focused on X and Y because leadership flagged them. Happy to help with Z after those ship.\" Now you're strategic not lazy.\n\nDrop anything execs don't care about. Drop meetings where you're not deciding anything. Stop being the person who answers every Slack question instantly.\n\nDouble down on things with exec visibility and clear numbers. Cost savings with dollar amounts. Revenue. User growth. Vague \"launched initiative\" doesn't cut it.\n\nReal example from banking - two PMs, similar projects. PM A in every meeting, helped everyone with everything, shipped fine. PM B way more selective, made sure CTO knew every blocker they removed.\n\nPM B got promoted. PM A got told they needed more strategic thinking.\n\nThat sucks but it's reality. Being everywhere makes you look necessary but not promotable. Being selective makes you look ready for next level even if you're doing less.\n\nYou'll feel like you're slacking at first. But if you make the right 2-3 things visible to the right people you'll be way better positioned than drowning in everything.\n\nLast thing - PM who does everything can't be promoted because if they leave everything breaks. You're too valuable where you are. That's the trap.",

Are you touching on responsibilities that really does not fall on the core of PM?\n\nIf you try to do everything then you're inevitably going to be burnt out and not make much progress (specially if you're working on things outside of your core responsibilities and skills). I'd try the following things if I were you:\n\n1. Revisit what the PM role actually is. Figure out what the expectations are for your role. It is reasonable for a product manager to be a generalist but unrealistic to ask of them to take over the roles that requires a specialist.\n\n2. There are ways of denying request or passing them on to someone better suited to do it. Saying \"I would love to do it, but I believe this is a job best suited for role A\"\n\n  \n3. Doing less should not hurt your reputation as long as you perform spectacularly on the tasks you put your hand in. You cannot be blamed for things you didn't take the responsibility for or were involved in.\n\n  \nHope it helps!",

Do not expect it to be a logical pathway to promotion by showing how excellent you are in your role.  Other people, and maybe even the ones that got the promotion, probably already advocated for themselves.\n\n(2) Stop taking every meeting, and every request.  Be selective.  There are people that just like to have meetings, but no real work is accomplished.  Block off time on your calendar in which you cannot be scheduled or interrupted to get your work done, and if you get requests for meetings that will not measurably contribute to your job or the project, ask to schedule later, or ask if you can get an email summary or agenda prior to scheduling a meeting.  If its a useless meeting, chances are the person requesting it will not even be able to do either one, or at the very least this will push it out for you.  \n\n(3) Stop being reactionary where you feel the pain alone.  If someone schedules something last minute, use the \"if-then\" acceptance, which sounds like, *\"I can take that meeting, if I can slide a 1/2 day on X deliverable.\"* Or, *\"I can do that research for you, but I will need to push off this project delivery to X date.\"*",

I'm feeling quite stuck between stakeholders and engineering pushing different directions and even not managing transferring the requirements. \n\nTo give some context, I work at a large, established B2B company that is historically hardware-driven, but has also growing software organization. Part of our software work results in standalone products, while another part is developed for internal business units. So in many cases, hardware teams are my clients.\n\nFrom the stakeholders, a big request is to launch as quick as possible so that we are the first in the market. On the other hand architects have been spending 3 months to explore and answer some architectural questions and now they want to have another exploratory 3/6 months period. They say in this period they want to prototype so that we get feedback and we derisk architectural decisions. They don't want me to come up with a well defined scope for this period but they say we do as far as we come and they already mention 20% rework later. We made already prototypes in product management side and we already have feedback and confidence for business outcome. So I find the entire story from architects completely unacceptable but I don't know how to handle it. \n\nAnyone would be interested in mentoring me for some well defined situations like this.  There is quite some politics which I'm not ready to handle so it would be best to have some sessions with someone who is familiar to a setting like mine. \n\nThank you in advance!!\n",

When you deploy this way, you derisk development and tend to stakeholders' expectations.\n\n\nOn engineering asking for months to prototype:\nYou'll have to persuade them into building something simpler and shape up from there. Study lean development and shape up methodology, might give you some insights.\n\n\nAnd most importantly, going through it will give you experience to handle these situations better in the future.

If they're looking to derisk architectural decisions then state what they are and the consequences if they happen. Sometimes you move ahead and accept that level of risk. This is a joint decision between stakeholders and engineering. If your clients are internal hardware teams then judge the downside risk. I would not accept loose scope. If I give you a month I expect concrete outcomes at the end of it.   \n  \n\\- Stakeholders - You generally have 3 factors when building. You have scope, resources and deadlines. If you want to push any of these then you need to compromise. Generally resources are fixed so if they want speed then you need to cut scope. Don't try and promise everything. This will almost always fail.   \n  \n\\- Communicating to engineering - You have 2 options. Escalate to engineering leadership who are normally more tied into business outcomes or make it clear that they are accountable for failing to launch lands on them.   \n   \n\\- For you - I wouldn't conflate prototypes in product management and derisking architectural decisions.

That would be framed under the hood so to speak on the architectural runway that enables the product runway that runs above and upon it. \n\nYou don't have to solve for all up front in most cases - just for now which is next 100 days and likely Year 1 after a release.",

Currently a Senior PM in a startup, with limited short-term salary growth and a very high-pressure environment. Planning to have my first child this or next year, but unsure about pausing my career now and the long-term consequences.\nMy current contract offers 4 months of paid parental leave and I am the main income provider at home. However, all women in my current company were let go after returning from maternity leave (around 6–7 months later), which gives me very low confidence about my future there.\nI have the option to try to land a better job first, earn more to save, but potentially lose the paid parental leave depending on the contract, or take the opportunity now and use the rights I currently have. I also feel that taking the leave after more time in the company might make me less vulnerable to a future layoff, so starting over in a new company also feels risky.\nAny advice from PM mothers? There are so many complexities in becoming a mom while trying to stay valued, financially safe, and mentally healthy, anything would help!",

If every woman at your company who took maternity leave ended up being let go 6 to 7 months later, that’s NOT a coincidence. That’s your company's BAD culture expressing itself.\n\nThere’s an old saying that \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\". Companies are the same. You don’t have to assign intent or argue whether it’s fair. You just look at repeated behavior and treat it as data.\n\nFrom a pure career risk standpoint, staying somewhere that has already shown how it handles returning mothers seems like a bigger gamble than starting fresh somewhere that hasn’t. At least in a new company, you’re evaluating a clean slate instead of walking into a pattern that already exists. That being said, the job market is tough, so this isn't an easy decision either way.\n\nI can’t speak to the emotional side of becoming a mother while managing a career. But from an organizational perspective, I’d treat this less as a motherhood timing question and more as a company quality question. The environment you’re in has already told you how they will likely respond... and that sucks... and I'm sorry.",

By the time you go on leave you’ll probably be able to do most of your job within 4-6h a day and you will keep your energy for your kid as well. Probably you’ll get some nice benefits as well",

If that is a pattern and it happens to you — have a paper trail that shows you were not let go for cause, an employment attorney can help you navigate getting better terms from a severance package. If it’s a pattern, it’s an even better case.

As much as you can only assume how things will go if you stay or find a new job, you should do the same in regards to birth/recovery/baby.

I joined a mid-size company with amazing maternity benefits but that was acquired by a large company with okay benefits. I ended up timing my first kid so that I could take advantage of the better benefits before they expired but then had my second when my husband school was taking us to an unknown state (previous state had great family benefits to top off company benefits with.)\n\nThat being said, neither pregnancy happened when I first started trying (first baby came just before 35) and despite the changes in our org, it’s remained a positive environment for mothers which is one of the biggest reasons I’ve stayed. If it’s at all possible to find a company that offers that kind of environment I would recommend getting out of your current company just for your own wellbeing. And while 4 months isn’t bad, there’s better offers.",

If the maternity leave is the only reason you’re staying, i would suggest looking now. There are more and more US companies with 4 months of maternity leave and with a shorter requirement in terms of how long you have to be there. For long term career prospects also, even if you get a shorter mat leave it might be worth the peace of mind of both job security and longer term career. \n\nYou can also start saving more money and see if you can self-fund a month or 2 of mat leave which would give you more options and bridge the gap with your current leave. \n\nNot exactly the same but I’m at a faang and switched teams internally right after my mat leave and even that was exhausting. A full blown job interview would be even more so and your brain is not working at 100% during or right after mat leave so that will be another hurdle. \n\nPersonally, I’d try to switch now but I’d keep the option open to stay if you get pregnant earlier and can’t find something new.",

It really depends on the business goals of the organization.\n\nSome things that my research found:\n\n1) Startups are putting off hiring PM's longer than before.  A small team where the founder has a strong business vision used to hire one or two PMs just to do all the grunt work.  That is no longer happening.  PM first hire seems to be getting later than before AI.\n\n2) Larger companies are still hiring PMs and if anything they have MORE PM roles.  It used to be common to be up to 20-1 (20 Eng to each PM).  That is changing.  Engineering teams are getting smaller and PM teams are remaining the same size or growing.  \n\n3) Teams becoming more tightly integrated.  The old hard break between PM and eng is starting to fade a bit.  Not everywhere, but we are seeing teams that have both PM and eng reporting to the same leader.  Same with design.  This isn't necessarily a direct result of AI, but it becomes more reasonable as feature teams get smaller.\n\n  \nShort answer:  PM doesn't seem to be going anywhere but the overall structure of the product team is changing.  \n\n",

When i try to turn those into wireframes, everything feels disconnected. The devs want something structured. The marketer wants to see user journeys. I just want one place where I can brain dump ideas and slowly turn them into real screens.\n\nThe problem is that most tools ive tried either feel too designer only or too basic. I’ll create a wireframe, but then feedback comes in like:  \n Where does the user go after this?  \n What happens if they click this?  \n How does this connect to the onboarding flow?\n\nAnd suddenly im remaking everything from scratch. What i really need is a way to visually map the idea, user flow,  wireframe, rough prototype, without switching between five tools and losing context every time. Right now it feels like my product is clear in my head, but the second i try to show it, everything becomes confusing.\n\n",

The difference between chaos and clarity is how you externalize and test assumptions early, before you commit to execution.\n\nHere’s what actually helps in practice:\n\n1) Get real about the problem  not the solution\n\nDon’t start with features. Start with questions like:\n\nWhat outcome are we trying to affect?\n\nWho feels the pain now?\n\nWhat would success look like in measurable terms?\n\nThis moves you from ideas to problems worth solving.\n\n2) Write a one-sentence hypothesis\n\nSomething like:\n\n“We believe improving X will help Y because of Z.”\n\nSimple. Testable. Keeps your focus on the why before the how.\n\nWhen teams skip this, they end up with feature laundry lists instead of a coherent goal.\n\n3) Break it into incremental experiments\n\nInstead of “build the whole thing,” plan small steps that validate assumptions:\n\nTalk to real users\n\nPrototype a slice of the journey\n\nMeasure behavior before and after\n\nIn engineering, we call this vertical slices: the smallest bit that provides usable feedback. Product people need the same mindset.\n\n4) Get shared understanding early\n\nWrite it down. Whiteboard it. Share it with others. Misalignment is usually a sign things live only in your head.\n\nOnce your assumptions are externalized, stakeholders can agree, push back, or refine  and that’s when ideas start becoming real.\n\nIn short: messy ideas become clear not by force, but by iteration, hypothesis framing, and early feedback loops, the same patterns that make high-performing engineering teams reliable.",

Without it, it will spit out general garbage. So, when I start a new project, I always start with the following prompt to ChatGPT: \n\n*\"Imagine you're a CPO at a Fortune 500 company. As a CPO, I want you to fully understand my product and help me improve it. With every new detail you learn about my product, I want you to update your context so it always stays aligned with the latest information. To get a deeper understanding, you can ask me the following questions: \"What is the product's purpose?\", \"What problem is it solving?\", \"How is it solving the problem?\", \"Who are the ICP?s and what are their personas?\", and \"What do these ICPs TRULY desire?\". \"*\n\nWhen you press Enter, it'll ask the questions above. Try to answer all of them, even if they are vague. With your answers, give Chat more information about your product by including all your attachments (note that ChatGPT supports up to 10 attachments per message), and ask it to thoroughly upgrade your answers. It looks something like this:\n\n*\"Here are my answers: 1) ... , 2) ... , etc. However, I want to really ensure my answers are concrete and align well with the product. For more context about my product, please review every attachment thoroughly. Remember to focus on even the smallest details, and enrich my answers by covering everything from what I've missed to what I can add.\"* <-- dump in your files here.\n\nIf it is more than 10 files, just send another message afterwards telling them to update the context even further.\n\nAfter this, I ask it to write a perfect MASTER prompt I can copy and paste into an AI mockup generator, and I'll paste the output into **Google Stitch** (it's free for now). Stitch will generate these amazing UIs to get started, and trust me, it becomes much easier to do the wireframes and iterations when you have some visuals to start with. \n\nHope it helps! Remember, trying it out once is so much easier than it looks :)",

I'd watch a video, then read a few articles, then watch another video, but the info doesn't seem useful or stay in my head because I can't make it feel applied or see the bigger picture.\n\nI'm not a technical dude by nature.

      "text": "**Context**: I am an experienced Product Manager, worked across many high growth B2C companies. For personal reasons I joined a Non-FAANG Big Tech. I am failing to understand this role.\n\n**Role**: I am PM for a Platform Team, and it is from organisation \"A\". But I am part of organisation \"B\".  \nSo, my Manager and Skip are from \"B\" but my EM and engineers are from \"A\". To be very clear, my 'EM's Manager' has a different reporting line and he does not actively work with my Manager or my Skip.\n\nThis Platform Team works on many things, has 3 key customers and organisation \"B\" (I, my Manager, Skip are part of) is just one of the 3 customers. The major work still comes from other 2 key customers. (All key customers are internal orgs).\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. Within 4 months of joining, my EM starts to complain about me to my Skip and my Manager about things I am not doing, mistakes I am making etc. At that point I had not even understood if I should be working more for organisation B or for organisation A.\n2. My Skip directly provided the feedback to me as is about what EM complained about.\n3. Over a period of 1 year or so, this EM complained about me about 3 or 4 times, again, every time the Skip is involved.\n4. The communication channel has been that if EM has a feedback, they tell my Skip and my Manager and then either the Skip or my Manager convey it to me.\n5. I had a weekly with my EM for the first 8-9 months and then I gave up and removed it since the communication channel still was through my Skip. (I tried telling them a few times that please share feedback with me first, see if I am working on it and then involve my Skip but nothing changed).\n6. I tried to clarify my role multiple times from my Manager, she says many words but was not able to clearly explain to me.\n7. I clarified my role from Skip (multiple times), he mentions that I should focus on the needs of Organisation B while ensuring that I am also helping with other 2 customers of the platform. (Basically everything but B is important).\n\n**Manager's Absent Behavior:**\n\n1. Over a period of 1.5 years, I have created multiple documents, artefatcs etc, this person has not left a single comment on any of the documents.\n2. 80% of the times, is late for the 1 on 1. Never has a clear agenda for the 1 on 1, I try to have the agenda whenever I have key topics to discuss. (We are based in different continents).\n3. There are umpteen chats, slack threads where I leave questions for them and I get response from her about 10-15% of the times. Most of my messages in DMs also do not get any response unless it is regarding something they need, for example updates to leadership or something similar.\n\n**All Important Things Going Through EM:**\n\n1. For the bi-annual and annual review sessions, my Manager reaches out to EM to get the feedback and that feedback obviously is all negative. This person passes this to me as is without really putting any effort by themselves.\n2. I tried to push my Manager to define clear goals for myself and I received vague answers such as communication, being proactive, being involved in all projects of EM, keeping EM happy etc.\n3. More context: This EM has never had an experienced PM on the team before. The person before me was basically a Software Engineer doing the job of the PM (perhaps because they wanted to try), this PM was reporting to EM. Later on they moved back to being a Software Engineer in a different team / org.\n\n**Questions and Advice Needed:**\n\n1. Have any of you been in a situation like this? It almost seems that my EM is my pseudo Manager but nobody bothers to spell it out explicitly?\n2. How cooked am I to be in this role? I am confident that I cannot grow here but do you have any advice how should I navigate this?\n\nFor my personal reasons I cannot immediately quit and look for a new job (but if you think that is the only sane right solution, please mention that).",

I’d take the initiative and write a 1 or 2 page PM charter (customers, decision rights, success metrics, operating cadence) and share it with your manager/skip/EM so everyone aligns on expectations.\n\nAlso, in matrix setups, don’t let your manager become data starved. If you don’t proactively provide the right signals, they’ll naturally rely on someone else for those inputs and things can get lost in translation. What’s worked for me is a consistent update that covers what shipped/failed, impact/metrics, key decisions and tradeoffs, and the next set of priorities across customers.\n\nFinally, at a senior PM level, I’d expect leadership to focus on objectives and outcomes, not day-to-day execution details. They may not have time to read every artifact or follow every thread unless something is explicitly flagged! so make it easy for them by calling out what matters and what you need from them.\n\nEdit: Different continents + limited overlap can also amplify meeting fatigue. I’ve found it helps to start 5 mins late, end a couple mins early, keep a clear 1:1 agenda, and explicitly ask for feedback, review (or a Slack DM) when needed.",

They may have a different vision of a PMs role than you do, and as a result you have failed to make a connection that allows you to collaborate effectively.\n\nYour relationship with your EM is probably the most important relationship you have. You will be unable to deliver value without their support. Canceling your series of 1:1 meetings is a terrible sign. It looks like you're giving up.\n\nWe only see the one side here, but I'd lean towards this being an issue with the EM more than you. If it is true that they didn't even attempt to go to you first with feedback that looks bad to them. PM and EM need to be open with one another and constantly communicating.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a good fix. I was in a similar relationship with an EM. He just didn't see PM as playing the role I thought it played. We never clicked, and eventually both of us moved on to other teams. It might be a Hail Mary (that could backfire spectacularly) but if you have trust in your own manager you could lay those cards out: say that there is a fundamental disconnect between the two orgs regarding the PM role, and you'd like to work with a different team that will value a PM more.",

His manager, also an absentee manager and he quit too shortly after. \n\nSince quitting is not an option for you right now,\n\n1. With you skip manager, have an honest talk about what kind of help you need. Be open, but polite and say that 'things aren't working as expected with the EM. I'm willing to work with the EM. However, if every single thing is escalated, it doesnt scale and it is impacting my motivation'. \nIf you dont agree with the feedback, be very specific about a couple of examples and why you dont agree. Be polite and do not come across as brushing aside the feedback. You can say 'i truly appreciate that the EM has passed on this feedback. Another perspective to it is, for them their Org is the top priority, while for me, I need to balance out the needs of 3 orgs. So sometimes the EM might feel that their org needs arent being met. I need your help in putting this across to the EM. Or if you want me to prioritize the needs of org B, let me know'.\n\n2.Also talk to your skip manager about how your manager is not providing you the help you need. You can ask for a mentor who can help you instead. Be specific and mention a couple of examples where your manager hasnt helped you and say 'there are other such exaples'.\n\n\n3. Talk to the EM. Set up a monthly or bi weekly 1x1 if not weekly, be open with them. You xan say 'my skip manager passed on the feedback. I appreciate the feedback. Do know that I'm always open to hearing them directly from you too. I want to work together for the success of the org B'. Every 1x1 ask him them if they have any feedback. Also use this to provide them feedback. \nKeep your skip manager posted on how this goes. Dont fail to mention that you drove this.\n\n4. Think if there is merit to the feedback, spend some time thinking and incorporating the feedback .\n\n5. If the toxicity continues, then quiet quit. Just do what you can and what you feel right. When they give feedback just say 'thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it and will try to work on it' but you do your work. This will need you to develop a thick skin. Sometimes this works well and in time, things fall in place (either the people involved makes peace with the fact that that is how things are, or the toxic people might leave before you do, or you will come across better opportunities within or outside).",

After a year and a half you still aren't meeting their needs and they just are circumventing you. Most stakeholders don't have time to hold your hand and guide you through line by line issues. They have their own job to do. \n\nIt sounds like you have a crap manager though. Do you have peers? Do you have anyone else you can seek advice from about handling this EM or dev space in particular? If you truly are the lowest priority backlog funnel for the dev space, then I can see how that might cause some confusion or even headaches for all parties. \n\nWe just need a lot more info to actually help you here. This is probably one of the harder parts of the job as a PM, but core and essential.",

Sure they are a peer, but not really at the same time. They have their own expectations of handoff, definition of done, etc. They are a very important stakeholder. I've had some dev managers act as my 'dotted line' manager before especially when they are the only dev team I am working with. This isn't uncommon.

In those cases, clarity beats ideology. I’d start by aligning with the Delivery Manager on expectations — specifically a shared definition of ready, definition of done, and a clear planning cadence. That usually surfaces issues like missing acceptance criteria very quickly.\n\nI’d handle this via a private check-in with the Delivery Manager first, using concrete observations (eg. tickets entering sprint without sufficient detail) and see how they interpret the gap. If they don’t see the same issues or don’t own part of the solution, that’s a signal the accountability model itself needs attention and may require involving their leadership counterpart.\n\nStepping back, this sounds like a broader operating-model conversation — revisiting expectations across the definition and delivery phases of your PDLC and making those standards explicit so teams know what “good” actually looks like.",

Ask them how they would go about the work itself or how the product/solution could be assembled and function.\n\nAfter they share that much it's easier to ask another question and then frame if not an estimate in hours, days, weeks, months, or points or sprints and increments - try a simple question like high or low confidence, or is that a big lift or an easy lift. Make 'easy' supremely easy then listen to how it goes from there.\n\nSome people and some organizations are better or worse at estimation. Some can only bid work T&M because they do not know how to set expectations and meet them to confidently bid work on fixed fee and earned value.\n\nIn my lived experience - I seek a top down estimate in one corner or a baseline initiative for comparison, and then a bottom-up estimate.  The former will be too low. The latter will be too high. That's humans for you. \n\nThen use judgement to index high or low relative to your familiarity and confidence in the work, in your org/team's capacabilities, in your client's culture and needfulness (if any dependence on a client), be aware of any 3rd party dependencies as those may not be in your estimate but the risk of impact should be mitigated, avoided or priced/estimated too. \n\nPotential sources of delay are a big one as the biggest driver of development cost and deployment is often the variable cost of humans (fast/slow, many/few).  So focus on the aggregate risk to time (and any source of variable cost in your team or vendor or org), not the unique source of risk - moreso the nature of risk types and probability of them to not be avoided or managed.\n\nNot exactly what you asked for - but hopefully something resonates and helps you move forward, or bond with the estimator/s and get answers you can work with when you need them.",

Ask your lead engineer, “does your gut feel this project is closer to a 3 week, 3 month, or 3 quarter type of project? I won’t hold you to your estimate.” That will at least directionally give you an idea of the approximate lift and should be enough to determine whether the investment might be worth the time. Then, once the project is started, I’d do a re-estimation at the end of each sprint. As the project moves forward, the Eng team will be able to bring the timeline into clearer and clearer focus. Eventually they’ll be able to plan many sprints ahead and have a clear idea of exactly what is left to do, and by then you’ll have a good target date for completion.",

But I had the buy-in of the CEO/Owner and one of the reasons he hired me, as he was kinda desperate/angry. The devs mumbled/complained for a week or so, then it became second nature and everyone was happy with the process.\n\nAnother example - worked as a PM for an internal tool that was the backbone of the operations. People weren't using a new important feature, because they were too used to their ways of doing stuff. CEO enforced it and made everyone use it. Took a little time, but after a while it had great results and everyone was so happy with that feature (we also improved it). \n\nOf course, we explained (in both cases) the reasons behind it, but that wasn't a big factor.\n\nDo you have a reason why you need it?",

Unsurprisingly, this research shows the overrun of software projects is significant; it is the most significant of all project types, it beats the summer olympics, nuclear power plant construction, tunnels etc by margin. \n\nIn fact the distribution telling you (roughly) the probability of finding a software project with overrun x follows a power law distribution (a fat tailed distribution). Now, this power law (its scaling exponent) is such that if you would calculate the average overrun of projects you would find that the average is infinite. \n\nIn other words, philosophically, if you wait an infinite amount of time and the universe would be filled with software projects then you would find that the most likely (central moment) overrun would be infinite!\n\nNow, software devs know this and thats why the are reluctant to give you estimates as the real lead-time varies so much that it doesn't even allow you to calculate a mean.",

          "text": "25 years dev side mostly banking tech. Gonna explain why devs resist estimates and it's not laziness. Building contractor analogy breaks down fast. Contractor builds the same house multiple times. Materials are known. Process is predictable. If foundation takes longer than expected it's usually weather or ground conditions not \"we discovered the concept of concrete mid-project.\"\n\nSoftware is almost never the same thing twice. Every feature has unknowns. Every system has hidden complexity. And here's the key part - the more novel the work the worse estimates get.\n\nBut that's not even the real problem. Real problem is what happens after devs give estimates. In most orgs estimates become promises. Then commitments. Then performance metrics. Dev says \"probably 2 weeks\" and PM hears \"guaranteed 2 weeks.\" When it takes 3 weeks dev gets labeled slow or incompetent.\n\nSo devs learn to either inflate everything by 3x to protect themselves or refuse to estimate at all. Neither helps anyone but both are rational responses to being punished for being wrong. You want estimates? Fine. But you gotta create environment where being wrong isn't treated as failure. Where estimate is \"here's our best guess with current information\" not \"we promise this timeline.\"\n\nAsk devs what would help them estimate better. Usually it's things like clearer requirements, time to investigate unknowns, not having estimates used against them in performance reviews.\n\nAlso construction has change orders. If you change the requirements mid build contractor charges more and extends timeline. Software almost never works that way. Requirements shift constantly and devs are expected to absorb it.\n\nNot saying devs shouldn't estimate. But if your team is digging in their heels this hard there's probably a trust problem underneath. They've been burned before and now they're protecting themselves. What happened last time they gave estimates that were wrong? That'll tell you everything about why they won't do it now.",

Out of all the developers I've worked with over a 25 year period, I've only met around 5 maximum who wouldn't size work.  The rest were capable.\n\nMaybe they don't want to size work because they don't trust what will happen to the estimates?  Estimates are for the team's use only (theoretically).  Used to capture predictability.  The actual numbers don't matter (I always say, in the first instance).  Teams need to build up predictability.
