      "text": "I'm a Senior PO now, but years ago my first break into tech was a Business Analyst. I was embedded in a dev team, basically shadowing my PO. When the PO prioritised a feature, however big or small, it was my job to dig into what that actually meant. What was the impact on the wider product, how would we break it down into individual user stories, what would those stories look like? This allowed the PO to focus on the **why** and **when** of what was being delivered, while I as the BA focused on the **how**. Not in terms of project delivery, timelines, or cost, but the low level detail of the feature, into user stories, acceptance criteria etc.\n\nYears later, having moved onto being a PO, and now Sr. PO, it seems rare that companies even bother with BAs any more. More and more POs are spending time focusing on low level requirements, writing jira tickets, UAT testing, leading backlog refinements to answer detail on edge cases, as BAs are often missed out of the entire structure.\n\nIs SAFe to blame? As that doesn't have BAs at all.\n\nIt's not all companies, but it feels like an increasing number of companies are removing the BA role and expecting the PO to do it.\n\nMaybe it's a UK thing and other countries are different?",

              "text": "Hijacking the top post to challange the belief that eliminating business analysts (or scrum masters, QA, managers, or whatever titles are considered \"non-essential\") actually accomplishes anything positive.\n\nIn my experience, this approach doesn't save a salary, it just eliminates a title in the org chart. The work previously done by business analysts still needs to be done, which means someone is doing it, and being paid.  Generally speaking, that person was hired to do something else, and hired because they were good at the thing they were hired to do.  Often they aren't very interested in (or particularly good at) doing things a BA would do, but the work still needs to be done.  So, it gets done less well and/or slower than before.  As a result, capacity decreases and problems increase.  In the interest of \"eliminating a position\", we often make our teams less efficient, less effective, and less happy.\n\nWhile I'm on a rant, DevOps doesn't mean saving money by making your developers responsible for your Ops functions.  It means reducing friction by connecting your dev people and your ops people to create overlaps and insight where there were once gaps and a wall that people were chucking problems over.\n\nI've spent years fighting with people (often fueled by consultants) who don't understand the purpose of Agile, of DevOps, of Product, or even Cloud, and think everything is supposed to be a cost cutting measure.  That isn't the purpose of any of these, and every time I've seen someone sell these transformation as cost-saving initiatives, they've failed to deliver either cost savings or the benefits those transformations should actually deliver.",

If I wanted to do BA work, I wouldn't have transitioned into a PO role. \n\nAs a BA I was only really thinking weeks, sprints, maybe a couple of sprints ahead, where as a PO I'm thinking months, quarters, even years ahead. If as PO I'm focusing on story writing, low level detail, backlong refinements, answering edge case questions mid-sprint, guess what I'm not doing? Thinking about long term strategy and benefit, ensuring the right thing is being built now as opposed to the wrong thing, building stakeholder relationships. Or maybe I am, but as I'm wearing two hats I'm doing neither one particularly well.\n\nIt feels so many companies have just given BAs a PO title, small pay bump, and made them do both roles.",

The most successful teams I have seen are where the BA is the glue that holds the team together. They go deeper into the tech and the how - finding areas of overlap, redundancy, optimizations, etc, with the tech teams.\n\nNot every company can afford for a PM to spend 3 months on a feature. I work in a very fast-paced industry, mostly in tech transformations. The concept that the PM should do everything is ridiculous. This is just a small list of what is expected:\n\n* Talk to customers\n* Talk to stakeholders\n* Gain alignment\n* Document the what/why\n* Review charts/graphs\n* Develop experiments\n* Work with design\n* Drive delivery\n* Work with LT\n* Share out results\n* Gather new ideas\n* Manage a backlog\n\nThat's insane.\n\nHow we use BAs - I use the analogy of navigating a lake. The PMs stay at the surface level of everything so they can navigate and direct us where to go (areas of opportunity). BAs dive deep into the water - they work from the surface of the lake to the bottom. They partner with PMs to identify anything that may trip us up as we move forward. PMs should rarely have to dive deep into every aspect of the work. If this is happening, they have lost focus on what/why/customer.\n\nBeen using this model for 10 years and it works. We ship on time and deliver value.\n\nEdited for typos and clarity.",

This means leadership teams rely less on POs to make big decisions.

See the *Founder Mode* essay from *Paul Graham* or various interviews with *Brian Chesky*.\n3. Companies are more picky about the engineers they hire - and have increased their expectations. It is becoming more common for **engineers to write their own tickets** and think about the product-impact of what they are building.\n4. In some orgs (for example *Linear*), **Product Designers** have taken on more responsibility when it comes to making nitty gritty product decisions.\n5. Honestly, \"*answering questions from engineers*\" or \"*testing*\" were always weird BA responsibilities in my opinion. I have always expected POs to be able to do that.\n6.

If you can't answer that in under 5 words, then all you're doing is agentic tool tourism.\n\nApologies for going full curmudgeon mode this morning, but I'm getting a bit worn out by product management influencers peddling various RPA+AI tools and then pimping them as strategic agent building for product managers.\n\nNope, not against building agents. Nope, not against getting real PM sh!t done with Ai tools. But that's not product management. Value delivery is.\n\nSo let me throw this challenge down: which business model or operational model levers are you pulling when you prioritize which opportunity to exploit, and which to leave in the dustbin of 'good but not great ideas?'\n\nPut another way, when you explain to your executive sponsor why to invest in an agent, are you able to explain the how your agent helps you compete by increasing revenue, growing market share, or nurturing LTV?\n\nWhen you have to convince the Head of Change Management why you should agentify a part of their operating model, can you explain it in increased productivity, cost savings, or safety & compliance enforcement?\n\nIf you can, would love to hear your stories. If not, be aware that agents ... and any automation for that matter ... intrinsically does not add value. All they do is amplify specific leverage in how you compete or how you operate ... warts and all ... meaning:  \n\\- No leverage = no value.  \n\\- Wrong leverage = wasted budget.  \n\\- Leveraged dysfunction = disaster at scale.\n\nAnyway, my point is, don't get suckered into the time suck that is gaining Mastery with tools like n8n, LangFlow, Make/com, ZapierAI, CrewAI, etc ... Fluency is enough.\n\nPut another way:  \n\\- Stop building agents because you can.  \n\\- Start building them because they move metrics that matter.\n\nTLDR: Know your levers. Then build the agent.\n\n</curmudgeonmode>\n",

Both from a business sense for Lenny and also it’s a treasure trove of new information and techniques to ask questions about.  \n\nI love the podcast still, and can directly attribute recent success in my role and with my Product to listening to the show.

I figure even if Design wants to change a lot, having a screen to model their work off of is better than just text.",

I thought the whole point of tools like Clickup, Asana, and Trello was that they were visual and super easy to add and manage task cards.   \n  \nWe're going back to a command-line interface model because it's somehow faster?\n\nShe argues that going on a web browser, creating a new card, adding a due date etc. is slower than the command line interface. Perhaps - but I have Asana desktop I'm a tab-switch away from adding a new task.\n\nI also didn't get how the \"/today\" command makes life easier. Like I just look at my calendar or Asana board for cards due today and tomorrow (or maybe create a custom view). It feels like an awful lot of new structures to build / learn to do something as basic as task management.\n\nWhat I did like was the research function - apparently, she's automated a subagent to go fetch all the latest research from a set of links and then distill them to what's relevant for her. That's smart. Although I could do the same with a custom GPT or a simple [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) agent. \n\nNot being sarcastic here - everyone's raving about Claude Code on X and I'm genuinely trying to figure out what the groundbreaking upside is. Could you explain it to me in simple terms?\n\n",

          "text": "I'll share a little more about why I chose to use Claude Code for my task management. I'll also share I don't think it's the right solution for everyone. By demoing this, I'm not trying to convince you to do the same. I'm simply sharing what works for me and trying to show what is possible.\n\nHere are my reasons:  \n\\- My trello board is a mess. I have data-baed tasks and evergreen projects. I've tried keeping separate board, separate lists, and a variety of other solutions. But I wasn't able to find a solution within their GUI that worked for me. No matter how I sliced it, my view was too complex. It was hard for me to figure out what to work on next.  \n\\- Most task management tools rely on keyword search. This means if I don't remember exactly what I named my task, it's hard to find it. Claude gives me fuzzy search. When I ask if I have already have a task for my January webinar and it can't find one, it's smart enough to search for related terms like January event. It can even look through all of my tasks and find anything that is remotely similar to \"January webinar\" semantically and suggest it as an option. I've never seen a SaaS tool do this well (yet).  \n\\- I'm comfortable in the terminal. I type fast without thinking and prefer text-based interfaces. I know this is not universal and this is exactly why I'm not trying to convince you this is the right solution for you.  \n\\- I context switch a lot. I have a lot of ideas. I want somewhere where I can capture everything without thinking about how to organize it. Claude helps by tagging everything for me. This allows me to ask, \"What are all the ideas I've had related to my interview coach?\" Claude can find them. No matter how I titled them. This means I can create dynamic views on the fly just by asking questions.  \n\\- By giving Claude access to all my to dos, I can now ask Claude \"What's on my list that you can help with?\" This helps me explore the boundaries of what AI can do. It alleviates the burden of always having to ask \"Can AI help with this?\" It allows Claude to offer, \"I can help with this.\" I like that.  \n\\- I like that my data is portable. It's not locked into a tool. I am concerned about how many of my ideas, thoughts, notes, etc. are locked into Trello. This allows me to extract it and put it into a system that works better for me. That I can take anywhere.\n\nI don't think moving your task management system to Claude magically makes you more productive. Task management is idiosyncratic. We all have our preferred ways of working. That's why there are dozens (if not hundreds) of reasonably successful task management tools and none that have taken the majority of the market. I like that it allows me to design a system that works exactly the way I want to work.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about this. I have nothing to sell related to using AI for task management or productivity. I'm simply having fun exploring and experimenting. And I like sharing.",

The ability to scale to hundreds or even thousands of customer interviews (opposed to the current UXer who seems to think 7 is a magic number). Imagine all that qual feedback (in saying that it would also be crazy $$$ to find enough incentives to pay users at these volumes). But seems to be something in it.",

          "text": "Fwiw, I'm using Github Projects + Issues, but all of this should apply to Asana.\n\nWe run all our tasks through GitHub issues, so bug reports, feature requests, exception notifications, and whatever random thoughts someone has all end up there. In other words, it's a mess. \n\nWhat Claude Code brings to the table is a UI + some level of discernment. It's not about being able to more quickly create an issue; it's about having a robot brain that looks through _all_ the issues as often as I need and does a reasonable job of applying some kind of intelligence to them.\n\nHere's the kinds of things I ask:\n\n    \"Find all the issues added in the last week and check if they're duplicates of previously entered issues.\"\n\n    \"Label all issues without labels as either 'Bug' or 'Feature' requests\"\n\n    \"Give me a list of issues resolved in the last 24 hours that had anything to do with the email notification system\"\n\n    \"Create a new issue for each of these modules, assign it to [name]\" \n\n    \"Compare PRs merged into production for the past week and the existing open issues and see if we missed closing any\"\n\n    \"Create a new weekly dev work issue assigned to me, move over uncompleted issues from last week and add all new exceptions to it as sub-issues\"\n\nA few notes on my setup:\n\n1. I've found MCP's in general to be not great. Claude Code does really well using command line tools (like Github's CLI) and it's much faster. \n\n2. For anything I do semi-regularly I have Claude create a bash script for it.\n\n3. I do also have a few actual Claude skills (these are just markdown documentation files that I also have Claude create). These help for things like having Claude remember to set custom fields we have on issues, etc. \n\n4. I'm also using SuperWhisper for most of this where I'm speaking aloud and it's \"typing\" for me into Claude code (which is awesome). \n\n5. I have scripts that pull down issues, the screenshots (bug reports + UI stuff), descriptions, and comments, and just immediately put all of that into the Claude Code context and launch into fixing them.\n\nHope that helps.",

An example might be Amazon—someone responsible for search, someone responsible for the cart, and someone responsible for order history. \n\nThis works, but leads to messy results when we’re trying to accomplish something that might cut across all number of functions. Does each product manager implement the new feature independently? What if that’s not the highest priority for “search”? How do ensure alignment?\n\nSo I’ve been thinking a lot about JTDB or outcome-driven domains. Rather than have someone be responsible for search, have someone be responsible for “user wants to quickly find a product”. \n\nI think it does three things:\n1. It lets the scope of the solution stretch to all corners of the tooling. “User wants to quickly find a product” could be better search, but could also be smarter recommendations on the homepage. \n2. It provides really easy KPIs for success. “Reduce time to order by 10%.”\n3. It makes prioritization more direct. It’s not “are we working on search or the product page” it’s “are we maximizing order efficiency or are we fulfilling customer needs for more product better\n\nHowever, it also adds new complexities…\n1. Assuming each of the “functions” are on different stacks, you may be asking one engineering team to string together five different code bases (whereas before each code base had an engineering owner).\n2. It assumes you have a great list of JTBD or outcomes to even start from. \n\nI’m really curious how other folks have handled this. I have a strong opinion here and that worries me. I know “fall in love with the problem not the solution” but I have a crush on my solution 😀",

That’s not enough. You have to find (not necessarily come up with yourself) the best idea that is doable based on your constraints (budget, technical feasibility, customer need, etc), and has buy in from your internal sponsors. Often this is not the best idea possible in abstract terms, just the best solution that works for your business. This requires a LOT of communication, which is an important part of the job.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, as long as your meetings are bringing you closer to finding that solution, I’d rather you had more meetings than less. The part where you do solo work as a PM, researching something or writing backlogs is much lower value work than solution discovery, launch planning with others and influencing.\n\nI’m not saying execution is unimportant, it is, but execution shouldn’t be taking such a huge proportion of your time that you don’t have time to talk to others.",

If collecting and reporting feedback is slowing you down that much, you're probably over-indexing on analysis and under-indexing on action.\n\nMost good PMs I know keep feedback gathering lightweight - talk to users, identify patterns, make a call, move on. Not build elaborate decks for every decision.

You can respond to the stakeholders with something like \"Unless we believe new feedback could materially change the decision, I think it’s responsible to place the bet and monitor outcomes\".\n\nI agree that deep user feedback is critical — but one thing that’s helped me is being explicit about **when feedback is “directionally sufficient” vs. when it’s still exploratory**.\n\nI try to separate three phases clearly with stakeholders:\n\n**1) Discovery → are we learning anything new?**  \nOnce feedback starts repeating and new inputs no longer change the decision set, I treat that as *signal saturation*. At that point, more feedback increases confidence marginally but delays action materially.\n\n**2) Decision readiness → do we have enough to place a bet?**  \nI anchor on a small set of decision criteria up front (user impact, business impact, risk, reversibility). If additional feedback wouldn’t change the choice against those criteria, we move forward.\n\n**3) Validation → what will we monitor post-decision?**  \nInstead of extending discovery, we shift feedback collection into leading indicators and guardrails after launch.\n\nThis framing has helped reset expectations: the goal isn’t *maximum* feedback, it’s *sufficient* feedback to make a responsible decision and learn forward.\n\nFor future, you could create a decision criteria upfront and then you can use \"We agreed on the decision criteria upfront. At this point, additional feedback isn’t changing how the options score against those criteria.”\n\nHope this is helpful!

I read that it is not a legal requirement but a de facto standard for most companies. However, percentages vary from 60 to 80 percent and it is hard to find proper reports to calculate how much of a TAM requires it. Do you have any links to evidence or anecdotal knowledge?",

It's boring, repetitive, and it should feel a bit heavy. Here is the 'workout' that actually moved the needle for me:\n\n1. Forensic Strategy: Don’t just read the news. When a company like Slack changes its pricing or Netflix buys a gaming studio, don't just say 'cool.' Force yourself to map out exactly what they are giving up to make that move. What are they deprioritizing? Who are they willing to piss off?\n\n2. The 'Where Not to Play' Rule: Pick a product you use every day. Write down three features they should build, and then force yourself to pick the two they should never touch—and defend why. Strategy shows up in the 'no's.'\n\n3. Paper Trading: Write your logic down. If you don't commit it to paper, your brain will trick you into thinking you 'knew it all along' once the results come in.\n\nForget the lectures. You don't need another framework; you need reps. You need to pressure-test your judgment until the trade-offs start feeling obvious.",
