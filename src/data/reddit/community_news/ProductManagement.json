If it's too much, or too much of a blocker -- move on to another company with a different flavor of dysfunction.   But there is no magical company that doesn't have any.     \n  \nI have used this in interviews with companies i'm talking to --  i literally ask this question: \"every company has some dysfunctionally - what is the flavor here?\", when you ask various folks from same company it can be fascinating to hear the variety and/or consistency of answers.",

The first thing I've noticed as a night and day difference is that I need to plan way ahead, with a much more broader picture in mind than as a delivery manager. The first time I saw the offering development cycles I honestly got overwhelmed, because my default is to solve everything at once and asap. What strategy would you recommend to get over that, what is a healthy and effective mindset for a PM, what would you say I should research or do to avoid mistakes, what common traps should I expect and what did you do to avoid these?

By that I mean learn about how the product is used, what problems it solves, why it is priced the way it is, how successful it is and with whom, what the macro and micro environment is i.e political, environmental, regulatory, usage data, sales data. Literally anything and everything. The more you know, the more right you'll be when you have an idea. BUT, just because you have a good idea, doesn't mean it will work so you need to be a master of tearing your ideas to shreds and validating it as best as you can, by speaking to customers, stakeholders, sales people, engineers, users etc. Engineers are critical because they'll tell you if it's even possible and affordable to build. Once you've done all that, you'll have the best possible arguments and you'll have confidence.",

Independence/Leadership -- Staff/Principal level can run the ship and guide all decisions pretty independently -- the best ones don't act this way necessarily, but if there was no VP, CPO, or CEO -- the staff/principal would keep on trucking, making the tough calls, tradeoffs, and taking the hit when it doesn't work, re-chart new course, etc.   A lot of this stems from the foundation of #1.\n3. Presence -- the combination of #1 and #2 create a strong personality inside the company.  If there is ever a question about anything related to the product space -- this person's name should first on everyone's tongue.  So act like a leader, act like a Staff before you get promoted, establish the relationships, establish your expertise while still being 100% collaborative and authentically interested in other peoples ideas and contributions.\n\nIf this all sounds nutty -- yep that's PM -- being the strong expert independent leader while also authentically including everyone else.

So it's difficult to say what one should be doing over another in any particular company because they are all different. The one thing I will say though, is that Product Managers are very very rarely responsible and accountable for the success of an actual product, despite the name. Usually it's the Head of Product who claims responsibility. In my view, someone should own a product when they are the most knowledgeable person to take active responsibility for a product's success. Sometimes products are the whole company. So, to me, the title \"Product Manager\" should mean exactly that, but the corporate world broke this.",

There are playbooks but they are too generic to get all the details right; and there are always new technologies to address and/or utilize -- again making it up as we try to tweak out more efficiencies or whatever.  It's all invention -- that's literally what tech companies do -- invent things out of thin air and try to get them to market and get people to care... so yes, it's all winging it all the time.",

How do they add the most value?  (even ask folks for input) Then figure out how to excel at it.   A mentor can help, but not required. I've seen many PMs excel without it, and those that certainly needed it. \n\nBe a systems thinker -- think of the company as a system, craft the PM role within that system, and push to excel.

Not good though.\n\nSo all we hear is: AI is going to create a new utopia and everyone needs to come on the journey or be left behind.\n\nWhilst I agree that everyone needs to learn AI, I don't believe it will save their jobs. It's specifically designed as a cognitive and administrative replacement. All jobs will be impacted eventually.\n\nThe question is, how much of the \"middle\" ground can the economy tolerate before we reach this utopia. I'm very negative about this. I see a middle ground where most roles gradually diminish in numbers. Not completely go away, but just go down. I mean, if it drops by only 10% we've got an economic crisis with indebted governments.\n\nSo, I think the redundancies will work up the experience chain until the most experienced are left running the show, doing more with less human support. As a consultant I'm already seeing this in real-time.\n\nOr, AI will be unsafe and unsecure and an event forces a pause. In which case, business as usual :)",

The type 1 startup I just joined is a night and day difference in all aspects, but I am having so much fun and loving it so far. Both companies were great but I think type 1 is where it’s at if you can find the right fit and growth stage and have the energy for it. You can always retire at a type 2 company.

My only framework has been my experience that I use to handle differing scenarios.\n\nFrameworks are good for things that are truly difficult to do without. How many of those can you name? I actually created a framework myself, which is niche, but solves really fucking difficult problem.

I know the answer, but my brain just skips right past the answer as it's \"common sense\" or \"they wouldn't ask this basic of a question\" , i give an answer later to find it's not what they were asking and I knew the answer they were looking for I just didn't say it out loud as it was too basic\n\n\nLike I'm have trained myself for speed and efficiency, as in dodging basic stuff to get to the core...\n\nHow do I unlearn this or rather how do I learn the basic stuff?

I didn't know anything about Marketing so I did a Masters in digital marketing. From there I was able to get into owning digital propositions which eventually led to product management, which I then did for 17 years. Each role I was in I was looking at how my skills could transfer to something else. Every move had a logical connection, but the key was moving and taking risks",

We would teach them, check their understanding and then a week or two later they would fall back into their original habit. There were 3 things at play here. The first was memory. We needed to ensure we were champions everyday and checking everyone remembered to do what they were supposed to. The second was gaps. When someone learns something and then goes back to their original work they sometimes encounter an edge case. They don't yet know how that edge case is solved in the new system and rather than check, they just do what they know using the old system. The third was command. If the leadership didn't understand fully or buy into it well enough they wouldn't hold their staff to account. We needed to ensure the management were mandating the new process otherwise people just do what they want.\nSounds like you're doing your best with 1 and 2, so maybe see if you can influence leadership to get some bossing",

You must have some element that is transferrable to another business of a similar type. \n\nIn terms of building domain knowledge, I don't think it's really possible to do it fully in the business sense because a lot of it will be about how they operate internally. But I have managed to go into a domain where I had no experience but I did have a personal interest. For example I love cars (My Dad was a car salesman) and I love mountain biking, and I ended up working for the first online car sales company and the largest cycle retailer.

This often means talking to engineers (feasibility) and and customers (desirability) to see if it's something that CAN be built and SHOULD be built. I then craft the findings into a playback so that the risks or opportunities can be understood. If you think it's a bad idea you want to play back the evidence to cover your ass. If the validation proves it's a good idea, then fine, it's just about how you break it down to delivery.

When you learn to play golf, you put your ball on the tee, aim down the fairway (basically anywhere where there's smooth grass) and thwack. The problem is, your aim is as wide as the fairway is and more often than not it goes 10% out to the left or right and ends in the rough. The trick is to very specifically aim at the flag. Nowhere else, just the flag (or similar tiny spot). That helps you focus your target area down and you're more likely to hit it.\nAnyways, when I apply this to somewhere I want to get to I look for the flag. In a Product sense, to me this is the Product itself. If I became an expert in the product and its experience, either by researching it or getting as much exposure as I could, then I'll already be talking the talk. It's no guarantee, and researching the iPhone isn't going to get you a job at Apple. But you'd be surprised how many people apply for jobs but provide absolutely no connection to the product at all. It's a standout thing to me. Shows passion too.\nOn the AI question, it's going to reduce the number of product roles I think. I don't believe there will be more jobs because more companies would just make business too competitive.\nAll you can do is your best. I wish you the best of luck. We all need it",

You'll likely have oodles of the \"product sense\" skills, but lack the \"product execution\" experience (this bit is 80% experience 20% knowledge). In my opinion, to be successful and not have a very painful time, you need to have mastered execution, because that's where all the dangers are. To get execution experience you need to be a Product Owner or a hands on Product Manager who has their own squad that they manage. You'd probably earn less than you do now and you'd probably find it a bit of a grind.\n\nI'd imagine you'd be able to get a job as a PM with those credentials, but you'd risk failing without delivery experience, which would be disheartening for someone of your skills. \n\nIf it doesn't bother you getting hands on in delivery, then it'd be worth it in the end. You'd probably be snapped up and climb much quicker than most because you'd grasp the strategic end already.\n\nYou often hear similar stories when an ex-Google or FAANG Product Manager moves to a non-tech-native  \"legacy\" company. They struggle with the dysfunction and eventually end up leaving. It's not like the books in those companies, but they make up 99% of the companies who have Product functions.",

It makes sense too. LLMs are here to assist but at the end of the day they are like another team member reporting to you. If their low quality work passes the quality check (i.e. you) then you are responsible. So in this example, you have the right to point out the misquotations and other discrepancies of your colleague. You can take appropriate action according to the HR policies of your org. If I were you I would point out these issues privately to the colleague and see if they improve or continue to share AI slop without checking. ",

Going through old PRDs, client feedback notes, engineering test cases, etc. has been both helped and hindered by LLMs. At times the output is succinct, but others the summaries are wrong and misinterpret the underlying documentation. But the citation is good and it finds documentation more efficiently than the old search functions we used.   \n  \nI just am not sure how it gets better if there's so much LLM garbage going into the knowledge base though. The LLMs will output bad info because of bad documentation. There's more documentation now so it's going to take longer for me to manually sift through and read it.

Here's another angle you might need to watch out for.\" etc. (AI as a thinking partner)\n\nMy curious nature: follows the white rabbit down the rabbit hole (cognitive drift).\n\nMy tip, if I can even call it that, is to trust my instincts more and/or listen to the voice of reason in my head that says, \"psychedelic singing flowers, smoking caterpillars, and merry unbirthdays\" are a waste of time. (do the work I was trying to, at least experimentally, offload)\n\nI think the trap might be that better prompting, more context, would produce better results.\n\nPreemptively I should go back to my trusted whiteboard and work things out for myself - to trust my experience and system knowledge. (move AI more downstream, into a less trusting role)\n\nThere isn't a single one thing I've used AI to do that didn't fall into this category. (analysis, coding, strategy, discovery, planning, measurement, optimization)\n\nNow, when I do turn to AI, it's very limited: specific work/tasks that has a clear outcome (like organizing data, writing a short reply, debating small scoped/risk ideas). Even then it has a tendency to assume.\n\nI have found that it does help me refresh my memory about frameworks and references that have slipped my memory and sketch out rough ideas that I then force myself to diverge on my own or validate with real people.

          "text": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital product management, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and content creation has birthed a new paradigm of though leadership. \n\nAs we pivot toward a more automated future, the discourse surrounding \"AI slop\" highlights a critical inflection point for PM leaders and stakeholders alike. We must leverage synergistic frameworks to ensure that our high-frequency outputs remain aligned with core user personas and value propositions.\n\nThe recent observation of Aakash Gupta’s content strategy—producing roughly 10,000 words in a mere 30-minute window—serves as a masterclass in scalable operational efficiency. From a product perspective, this isn't just \"slop\"; it’s an MVP (Minimum Viable Post) iteration cycle. By utilizing generative models to provide \"takes\" on viral trends, creators are essentially performing real-time A/B testing on audience engagement. This \"spray and pray\" methodology is, in many ways, an agile approach to capturing the attention economy.\n\nKey Pillars of the Automated PM Strategy\n\nVelocity as a Feature: In a saturated market, speed is often the ultimate differentiator.\n\nBeing the first to comment on a trend—even via an AI-generated quote—allows for maximum visibility within the algorithm’s honeymoon period.\n\nData-Driven Iteration: By generating 10+ quotes in a row, creators can analyze which specific \"hooks\" or \"takes\" resonate with the target demographic, allowing for a pivot in the next batch of content.\n\nContent Arbitrage: Taking a viral post and expanding it by 400-800 words is a form of value-add that rewards the consumer with depth (or the illusion of it) while minimizing the creator's overhead.\n\n\"True disruption occurs when the cost of production drops to near-zero, while the perceived value remains high enough to trigger a click.\" — Anonymous PM Visionary\n\nHowever, we must remain cognizant of the signal-to-noise ratio. While the volume is impressive, the long-term sustainability of \"AI slop\" depends on its ability to solve the user's \"Job to be Done\"—which, in this case, is professional entertainment and micro-learning.\n\nAs we look toward Product-Led Growth (PLG) in 2026, the question isn't whether we should use AI to write our takes, but how we can optimize the human-in-the-loop process to ensure that the \"slop\" eventually evolves into \"gold.\" We are witnessing the democratization of insight, where the barrier to entry is no longer talent, but the capacity to prompt.\n\nWould you like me to generate a series of viral-ready \"hooks\" based on this PM slop style for your own social media feed?",

So even if algorithms rewarded “more,” there was a natural throttle. Now that throttle is gone. One person can simulate the output of ten.\n\nThe uncomfortable part isn’t that AI helps people write. It’s that distribution systems still assume effort equals signal. So formatted reactions start to look like earned insight.\n\nBut I’m not sure the solution is “optimize for quality” either. Engagement is still a proxy. The deeper question is: how do platforms reward demonstrated experience instead of well-articulated opinion?\n\nBecause right now, someone shipping quietly gets less visibility than someone summarizing loudly.\n\nAI didn’t create the incentive problem. It just made it obvious.\n\nCurious how you’d design a feed that surfaces builders over commentators without killing accessibility for new voices.",

If it doesn't come back it never mattered. The fresh context point is the part people miss. A ticket written 8 months ago has assumptions baked in that probably aren't true anymore. The team changed, the system changed, the priorities changed. But the ticket still says \"as discussed in Q2\" referencing a conversation nobody remembers.\n\nThe real question is why Agile frameworks treat the backlog as sacred in the first place.

You can be the best pm ever by purist definitions of the job but still fail miserably, vice versa.\n\nSo start by asking yourself what your goal is. Do you want to become a great builder or just climb corporate ladder? \n\nYou can do both but most of the time it’s a push and pull in between.\n\nAfter a decade, I would say great product manager optimizes for what they want. Figuring out what you want is the half of the journey - it also changes with you along the way. \n\nOne rule is never to stop improving yourself, rest you will figure out in time. There is no one great form of a PM. It’s agile (pun intended).",

If you get clear on that and translate it to your day to day - you're going to use your time much more efficiently. At the end of the day, that prioritisation is what makes us good or bad as PMs. ",

At some point it just creates noise.\n\nThe only way to actually learn product is to **own a problem and make decisions**. A few practical ways to do that without a PM job:\n\n* Build something small with real users. Not a perfect app. A landing page, Notion template, Chrome extension, or simple AI tool. Do the PM work around it: who it’s for, what problem, what you shipped first, what changed after feedback.\n* Volunteer for product ownership wherever you are. Own a feature, a workflow, an experiment. Titles don’t matter as much as ownership.\n* Do real teardowns. Pick a product you use and write a one-pager: user goal, friction, metric, hypothesis, experiment.\n* Freelancing can work, but only if you’re actually making product decisions, not just taking orders.\n\nConfidence in PM comes from shipping, being wrong, and adjusting. Courses help with language. Experience builds judgment.",

It lets you tackle realistic product decisions and get feedback, which really helped build my confidence and instincts way more than just reading or watching.\n\nBesides that, try to find small side projects where you can actually own a feature or a small product from idea to launch, even if it's just for a personal portfolio.

I have a PM I partner with regularly (a couple times a week) to help validate and prioritize the problems to work on. This always involve technical feasibility and sequencing on my part. I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. But being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

          "text": "Communication = Alignment. It goes both ways \n\nUntil it comes more naturally, it might be helpful to write down your talking points. It sounds pretty basic but you need to be really clear to identify what are your goals that you plan to communicate. That usually comes in the form of thoughtful planning, supporting data and ultimately a talk track. Take some time to write down your core goal and work backwards how you can get there - AI can help get you started or unstuck here. This is the same for nearly all kinds of communication. \n\nNow it gets different depending on who your audience is:\nThe number 1 communication skill I’ve learned is knowing your audience. Who are they, what do they care about and how you can add value. Sometimes your message is inspirational, strategy based (resource/output management) or performance (KPI, engagement or financial). Don’t be afraid to ask what they think is important or what their goals are. \n\nThe life hack here is to strategically meet with each of your stakeholders 1-1 before your group meeting. Ask them what their needs are, hesitations with your plan. Share your ideas on how everyone could win. Hear them out. Get their feedback solo, and then you have time to message based on everyone’s core input. \n\nAlso…Many times, a PM is a moderator. State the goal of your communication- hold that as a North Star if someone derails. There was a great post here recently on how to manage moderation while you’re trying to communicate. I’ll look up the post and post a reply.",

I discovered I say \"um\" way more than I thought and bury my main point 3 minutes in.\n\ncoming from QA/BA/dev you probably already have the technical vocabulary. the PM shift is more about adapting your style to different audiences - engineers want different info than execs want different info than customers.\n\nwhat specific situations are tripping you up? async vs sync? presentations vs 1:1s? stakeholder updates?",

It’s about helping people understand *why* something matters and *what to do next*.\n\nA few concrete ways to improve it:\n\n* Start with the decision, not the background. Lead with “We should do X because Y,” then explain how you got there. Most PMs bury the point.\n* Anchor everything to a user problem. If you can’t explain the pain in one sentence, the story isn’t ready.\n* Use before/after framing. What’s broken today, what changes if we ship this, what stays the same if we don’t.\n* Practice one-minute summaries. If you can’t explain the idea clearly in a minute, it’s probably not clear yet.\n* Watch where people interrupt. Confusion shows up as questions in the middle of your story. That’s your feedback loop.\n\nYou’ll know it’s working when meetings get shorter, fewer people argue past each other, and decisions happen faster.",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

I know this sounds obvious but most PMs write great docs and then stumble through presenting them. the story that reads well isn't the same as the story that sounds good.\n\nfor measuring improvement - are people remembering what you said? are they repeating your framing back to you? that's the real signal.\n\nwhat context are you usually storytelling in? exec presentations? sprint planning? roadmap reviews? the approach shifts a bit depending on audience.",

It really depends on the business goals of the organization.\n\nSome things that my research found:\n\n1) Startups are putting off hiring PM's longer than before.  A small team where the founder has a strong business vision used to hire one or two PMs just to do all the grunt work.  That is no longer happening.  PM first hire seems to be getting later than before AI.\n\n2) Larger companies are still hiring PMs and if anything they have MORE PM roles.  It used to be common to be up to 20-1 (20 Eng to each PM).  That is changing.  Engineering teams are getting smaller and PM teams are remaining the same size or growing.  \n\n3) Teams becoming more tightly integrated.  The old hard break between PM and eng is starting to fade a bit.  Not everywhere, but we are seeing teams that have both PM and eng reporting to the same leader.  Same with design.  This isn't necessarily a direct result of AI, but it becomes more reasonable as feature teams get smaller.\n\n  \nShort answer:  PM doesn't seem to be going anywhere but the overall structure of the product team is changing.  \n\n",

      "text": "  \n👀 Here’s my thinking: The same over-the-top AI hype that’s pushing PMs to learn more and do more is also giving them an out.  \n  \nThe PM role was already extremely demanding before the AI hype: you need to be part psychologist to understand users, part strategist to set direction, part salesperson to pitch your ideas, part analyst to make sense of data, part designer to have a vision for the experience, part project manager to keep things moving, and part diplomat to navigate stakeholder politics.   \n  \nIt’s A LOT of different skills just to do the baseline job well. All while managing people who don’t report to you and taking responsibility for outcomes you don’t fully control.  \n  \nNow on top of all that there’s this whole new layer of expectations where PMs need to prove they’re AI people too. Already there are product leaders out there who are demanding that PMs MUST show side projects, vibe coding skills, GitHub activity and prompt libraries just to get hired. Like... their actual work isn’t already hard enough.  \n  \nMeanwhile most product managers are not having good day-to-day experiences on their jobs. Most scaling organisations are struggling to figure out how to give autonomy without losing alignment. How to move fast without creating chaos. How to make decisions without needing multiple layers of approvals. How to stay agile without constant reorgs. These tradeoffs on their own are genuinely hard to balance… and now there’s the AI FOMO in the mix too.   \n  \nSo here’s my logic:  \n  \nPMs already have most of what they need to build products. They know how to find problems, talk to users, figure out what to build, and design decent experiences. The missing piece to complete ownership was needing engineers to actually ship.  \n  \nBut the new AI tools that they’re now asked to learn remove that blocker.  \n  \nSo I bet these multitalented people will soon realise they can build their own thing without needing anyone’s approval or budget or roadmap sign-off.   \n  \nActual autonomy. Real speed. Freedom to execute.  \n  \nSo the best PMs - the frustrated PMs - are going to be facing a dilemma: keep doing the extremely demanding job with all the stakeholders and politics and meetings, or go build something they’re excited about on their own terms.  \n  \nSome will stay. But many are going to try their own thing. And companies with uninspiring missions, unclear strategies and poor operating systems are going to have a hard keeping them.",

          "text": "In B2B industrial and engineering software, the constraint was never just \"can someone write the code\". The hard parts are domain depth, legacy integrations, compliance, safety, procurement cycles, change management, and proving ROI to risk-averse buyers. AI tools dont remove those constraints - they mostly compress parts of execution, not the whole system around it. And this is not even mentioning hardware PMs, where you deal with supply chains, physical constraints, certifications, and timelines where one mistake costs millions. Thats a completly different game.\n\nAlso, \"PMs can now just build their own thing\" glosses over what a real business is. A product is not a demo. Its distribution, trust, support, SLAs, security reviews, contracts, industry relationships, and the stamina to survive 12-24 month sales cycles. That is a very different skill stack and also risk profile vs employment. Many people underestmate this part.\n\nAI absolutely lowers the cost of prototyping. It does not magically give product-market fit, credibility in regulated industries, or access to buyers. In many non-consumer sectors, the moat is context, relationships, and operational maturity - not who can vibe-code fastest.\n\nGenerally, I also feel consumer/app/saas PMs are the most vocal part of the PM crowd online, but I dont think they are the biggest part of the profession. A lot of PM work happens in less visible, more complex environments where the constraints are just different.\n\nSo yes, some PMs will go solo. But the idea that large numbers of experienced PMs in complex B2B environments can simply peel off and outbuild companies because of AI tools feels overstated to me. The leverage AI provides is real, but the bottlenecks in these markets are mostly human, organizational, and structural - and those didnt get automated.",

If the site isn't super complicated and you're an experienced PM you can probably build it yourself.\n\nMy personal prediction is a little short of this.  I think that product teams just get smaller.  You still have a tech lead to keep an eye on things and you still have a visual designer type person (perhaps that's just the PM if they're good a visual design) but you don't have this huge team with two scrum teams, a dedicated design group, etc....  My last startup was 50 people which seemed insanely small at the time.  Today, I could build that entire product with three people easily.  \n\nOf course, sales and marketing are another thing.  I think you still have those also but again smaller and more focused.  \n\n",

For practical purposes the sonographers needed to be able to see this data so they knew which patient they were dealing with.\n\nI think an LLM would need to be agnostic to any PHI and only deal with the facts for analysis.",

Our packaged offering includes:\n\n\\- Data warehouse\n\n\\- Data administration application\n\n\\- Reporting tool\n\nThe company’s strategic direction is to move analytical workloads and customer reporting off the warehouse and instead bet on a Lakehouse offering (Amazon S3 Tables (Iceberg) + Athena to be precise). In this new model, there would be no traditional data warehouse - all analytical data would live on S3 tables and be queried directly.\n\nCustomer use cases today:\n\n\\- Customers ingest data from multiple sources into the platform\n\n\\- We provide out-of-the-box data products (enriched tables, views, dashboards, etc.)\n\n\\- Customers can build their own transformations, reports, and dashboards on top of this delivered content\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this shift primarily through a product lens, not just an infrastructure or cost lens.\n\nFor PMs who’ve been involved in similar transitions:\n\n\\- Have you built or owned a data platform without a traditional data warehouse?\n\n\\- What worked well, and what didn’t?\n\n\\- Where did this show up for customers (performance, flexibility, trust, usability)?\n\n\\- Any things PMs tend to underestimate in “warehouse-less” architectures?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences and lessons learned from a Product perspective.",

Hosted in our cloud or theirs (hyper scalers) which made all of this so much fun. \n\nFor the customers we hosted in our cloud (AWS)\n\nI started with a data warehouse. We had several sources (relational and non relational DBs, runtime resources logs, server logs, etc) for a complex solution that was generating up to 1 TB of data from the largest customer and it needed proper ETL pipelines to give us all the Parquet format files in S3 and queried internally using Athena at the start. \n\nI had up to 2k customers. Think of every bank in the world, health providers, governments, logistics and even defence companies. They all used our previous solution (client server self hosted) and had developed a myriad of dashboards tailored to their business. \n\nI had pressure from my stakeholders to provide dashboards for customers to view their data but I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to find a one size fits all solution and I didn’t want to be a PowerBI PM. My approach was to prioritize solutions to give customers access to data via APIs so they could all do what they want. I eventually added UIs to manage the data they had in our cloud (set retention periods, create archives, etc)\n\nCustomers were fine with this approach. I had to put some effort on defining rules to manage costs. External data transfers of the volumes we run are expensive so I had to put cooldowns on some of the endpoints. \n\nAt this stage I’m working on a solution to stream/share some of the operational data we get in AWS for monitoring customer runtime resources health, status, etc We use this internally just for a health dashboard but customers need this too (we already have a UI they can check but they want real time data to be consumed by applications they developed to track and alert)\n\nMy advice. Have a warehouse, build customer facing dashboards only if you know they’ll be usable for all and keep customisation to a minimum or you’ll be building a BI platform. Implement and enforce retention periods to manage costs (if the volumes will make even S3 a burden). Consider giving access to customers via APIs for specific use cases. ",

          "text": "To answer 1:\nI was a data engineer when I built a data lake (Cloudera directly on HDFS with Hive as DB engine to load these parquets/avro files as external tables). At some point I migrated them to Azure HDInsight (ugh, top-down decision bc of “networking”).\n\nAs a PM I have managed a few “data warehouse” like redshift.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts on it, but keep it mind that I wasn’t a PM during data lake period.\n\n2. For data lake, as you might have already know, it “can” be cheaper, and powerful as in you can make decisions on low level things. This is a double edge sword because it’s shifting the cost from infrastructure to operation/maintenance.\n\nFor an instance, schema evolution can be quite complicated. Altering a table shape involves modifying the data files which is a very expensive operation. It might as well be creating a new external table. This is very different from redshift where the DB engine manages these things for you. Modern tool like Iceberg solves this issue, but it means it’s another tool and complexity you need to deal with.\n\nAnother example, you get to decide a storage format specifically optimized for  your own use case. Like parquet vs avro for an example. Redshift does have its own read optimization which most of the time probably is more efficient. But for some specific cases parquet can be more efficient.\n\nThere are some other advantages for data-lake for its file-based storage like, exporting is a lot easier since the file format is universally accepted and can be directly sent, while redshift requires you to query and export.\n\nIf I want to summarize into one thing, it would be the cost advantage as long as you are aware that the cost is shifted to operations & maintenance, not magically disappeared.\n\nAnd operations and maintenance is something you can control based on how much you want to optimize the performance and efficiency. Which leads to your next question.\n\n3. Where did this show up for customers:\nPerformance, can be as good or better in niche cases, based on how much effort your team put to optimize these. (Again, cost)\n\nFlexibility, depends on what you meant by this, like can your customers easily modify a table? Not as easy as redshift (but, should they even?). To ingest the data? Probably easier and more flexible as I mentioned above.\n\nTrust, the governance will be more on your team to integrate and maintain a tool to manage the governance, again, pushing cost to operation and maintenance. But if you meant trust as in compute accuracy, that probably be the same. Usability, if it’s UI dashboard tooling, the same if you are able to manage the data catalog underlying it. If you are talking about ingestion, probably easier and more efficient “technically”. If they export the results from a UI tool or a query then the same.\n\n\n4. Underestimates.\nHmm, this is where I’m not sure I can answer. I wasn’t a PM when I built data lake. But it’s gonna be the same thing I mentioned (again): cost doesn’t magically disappear, you shift it to operation and maintenance which you can control.\n\n- governance: now you have to built or integrate a tool for governance layer by yourself. \n- performance now is more on you.\n- your team will get exposed to much more complexity than redshift. I hope my examples can give you some ideas, but there will be a lot more. Many unknown unknowns. It will be a long term project where your team will discovers more issues and improvements to do.\n\nI kept all these on high level, feel free to shoot any follow up questions. I’ll answer if I know.",

Since you mentioned costs are gonna be transferred from infra to operations, I take we need to build monitoring and usage tracking tools from day 1.\n\nAlso, regarding customisability/extensibility - we will not allow customers to modify out-of-box content. But they will have a small playground to include their custom objects and/or transformations. Gotta factor in building those capabilities in Lakehouse.",

          "text": "My biggest recommendation is immediately identifying your scalability and latency requirements then partnering with your architect on a structured evaluation. I’ve inherited transformations like this where those details werent factored in, which ultimately led to a rewrite the entire product.\n\nYou mentioned Athena, but you need to be sure this choice is validated by meeting your requirements at scale under the particular conditions of your customers while meeting both your SLAS and staying at an effective cost. This is where the real tradeoffs really show up and can lead to more complex solutions or leveraging technologies like redshift spectrum or snowflake. Ex. \nDo you have interactive workloads for online users or scheduled workloads? Maybe a mix where you can request to run now or schedule for a specific time?\nAre these able to be lazily delivered just in time, or are they required for automated data pipelines on the customer side and always need to be generated exactly on time based on data that may only arrive x minutes before the schedule.\nHow does late arriving data get handled? Does it regenerate previous reports and notify the customer or require requery? \nIs there a latency sla where you may need to autoscale within x minutes/seconds to handle workloads scheduled to run at 4am after a batch job uploads data at 3am but before their business starts at 7am?\nDo you have controls in place to cost manage customer queries? When you ran these workloads in postgres you had a fixed cost in the size of your db, with serverless/on-demand you are often charged based on data scanned not returned. a customer could query 1000s of columns over years of data to aggregate their top 5 most sold products and every time they load this table cost you $20, while adding a 30 day lookback or aggregations at the monthly level for historical data could cut that cost to pennies.\n\nIn cloud the usual gotchas are a lack of real world cost controls on the queries and service scalability limits by cloud providers where you can only run X jobs per cloud account/region. You can mitigate these by 1. Partner early with architecture and make sure you have a pressure tested plan on resource scalability, latency, cost tradeoffs that doesnt open up existential vulnerabilities 2. Work with your cloud service provider so that they can help you cost out the solution and raise/work around various service limits. There are entire PS teams of people that your aws account exec can give you free credits to support this analysis if requested. They’ll throw free expert support at you because they’re ultimately motived by influenced revenue + potential to use you as a customer reference after your migration.",

I'd watch a video, then read a few articles, then watch another video, but the info doesn't seem useful or stay in my head because I can't make it feel applied or see the bigger picture.\n\nI'm not a technical dude by nature.

That's helpful. Feedback of course, but if clients could just ask for the things they wanted, a product managers and businesses often would not need to exist. Sometimes you to understand that with the client ask for is not actually what they want, if we gave them what they said they wanted it would actually not solve the problem. They're trying to solve, or the solution would be too complex and not worth the incremental effort required to build the complexity they're asking for. \n\nThe long story short as with many things and product, there's no clear answer. \n\nI could certainly understand that a jaded founder or product manager after having sales teams tell him to build things that he knows are not the right thing for many iterations, would simply decide to not communicate with sales.

You may have to  build good rapport with sales in order to get access to the users and customers so you can do discovery. Some sales people might understand the product well and can help you with discovery/ideation. \n\nSome additional pitfalls - sales tends to be more self interested than other professions and some will try to use you. I have had sales people demand that I go see every single customer in person to do the roadmap presentation ( I said no I don't want to be traveling 50% of the time to do a series of 1 hour presentations that I can easily do remotely and get the same level of feedback). They sometimes try to use product managers as bait so the customers will agree to meet so they can then try to sell something else to them. I've had sales people demand that I run a product training session for a customer just to add \"next level white glove treatment\". I find that the more you communicate with them, the more they ask of you and the more they try to co-opt you into silly things like this. \n\nAlso when I used to provide more details to sales about what the developers were building,  I would just get more nitpicky feedback about trivial details (because they need to say something in meetings to feel important and that is all they can think of to talk about).",

They are looking to expand their team to the U.S., and I’d be the first hire on this team.\n\nOn paper, it seems to be a good opportunity (decent brand, exposure, senior leadership access) but I’m unsure about the day-to-day reality. \n\nIf you’ve worked with China based teams or traveled there for work, I’d really appreciate hearing:\n\n\\-what surprised you\n\n\\-what was harder than expected\n\n\\-what was better than expected\n\n\\-whether you’d do it again\n\nWould love to hear your perspective if you’ve experienced a similar situation!\n\nFor Context I’m:\n\n\\-US based, Late 20s/mid-career\n\n\\-Enjoy ambiguity/strategy/innovation\n\n\\-Like working with people and being in office (this role is mostly remote)\n\n\\-recently was laid off in a tech PM role, looking to get back into product/innovation/venture/startups down the road.\n\nThanks — genuinely trying to make a thoughtful decision here.",

          "text": "Yup, worked for a couple years in B2B/B2C for a company with split teams. 2 onshore devs + a QA and then 4-5 offshore devs + a QA. I had an offshore 'counterpart' that I spoke with daily during the couple of overlapping hours I had. \n\nNow, the truth is I imagine this depends HEAVILY on the organization you're working with. Talking to other stateside folks that've gone through the experience, it can vary significantly. Some folks said their offshore team was more or a less a black box with a single point of contact. They'd send over requirements in PDF format and do all the back and forth over estimates and questions and delivery via email/chat with that single POC. On the flipside, others (like myself) it was more like any other development experience. They'd get on standup, attend grooming, etc. Our onshore devs and them would work together on stuff. Etc etc. The only big difference was there was a 2 hour window in the morning where our schedules overlapped so if they asked a question at 8am....and I answered at 8:05, it wasn't getting 'done' until the next day. It did heavily impact timelines as a result. \n\n> what surprised you\n\nThey did everything they could to appear westernized. They used American names on calls (which got funny because they chose ones like \"Elvis\" and \"Vinnie\"). When one of them would have a kid, they'd give them a western name (in addition to a Sichuanese one). Any attempt on our end to try and learn their Sichuanese names was rebuffed. This also extended to even things like talking about their food and culture. They did everything they could to essentially hide anything about their personal culture, but they did it by putting up a western facade. They'd never mention any of the foods they liked or ate unless it was something stereotypically western. \n\nThey took all the normal Chinese holidays you're familiar with, but never spoke about it at all. Like we'd all talk about Christmas or Diwali or Hannukah, and they'd ask questions and such about those holidays, but if we asked about what their plans were or what have you, they'd clam up. It was kind of wild. \n\n> what was harder than expected\n\nLearning how to write requirements that worked for them. Obviously there were linguistic aspects I had to be mindful of, but also dissecting even the most technical language required a bit of trial and error. Add in the time difference and yeah, it got complicated. I'd write a requirement and send it over to them. Onshore, it'd take 5 minutes. Because because they were offshore and 12 hours apart, it was a full day turnaround. And if they had a question, it doubled the time...because again, I didn't get the question until the next day and they didn't see my answer until 12 hours later. Even when my schedule changed and I had more overlap in the evening instead (ie: They were starting their day in my evening), it was time consuming and challenging to sort out requirements with them.\n\n> what was better than expected\n\nTheir ingenuity. I assumed they'd be more like typical contractors where they'd build exactly what I asked for (or close enough) and nothing else. If I told them to build a wheel but only described 330* of it, I'd get a wheel missing 30* type stuff, ya know? \n\nThey made a serious effort to understand the product, the customer, etc. They REALLY liked when I included them in discovery. We got some great solutions from them. They also tended to play with ideas if they were light on work, which was neat. They were genuinely pretty skilled engineers, though they sometimes went rogue and instead of getting a full 360* wheel...I'd get a tank tread. \n\nThey were also really approachable and friendly. I got to know my counterpart pretty well, or at least as well as she felt was okay. They'd hop on calls with their kids and their kids knew who we were and such. We even had a sort of happy hour not long after COVID hit. They were in Chengdu so they were in like HARD lockdown, but we all hopped on a party call and talked about it over drinks. \n\nThey came over here a couple times prior to COVID too which was cool.\n\n> whether you’d do it again\n\nWhile I ultimately did enjoy working with them, and would do so if they were onshore, I wouldn't do offshore again if I could help it. There were always knowledge transfer issues, and since they were contractors we were also somewhat hamstrung on how much they could impact. Additionally, there WAS a certain amount of territorialism at play at all times. It was less that we didn't want them to have the 12 herbs and spices, but more that we didn't want to be in a position where we didn't have the 12 herbs and spices if that makes sense. It made planning things challenging because sometimes I'd have to slice up work in an illogical way because we wanted onshore devs working on the core pieces, even though it may have made more sense from a productivity standpoint to slice it up differently. \n\nAlso, ultimately they had their own marching orders and such and they'd periodically get shuffled around, frequently despite our requests for certain devs to remain on certain teams. \n\nAnd I'm 95% sure when they added \"Ethan\" to our team as a 5th dev during COVID, it was actually just Elvis with two logins and a pay bonus to push out front end work for 2.",

Let's call it \"All\" or \"Nothing\". \n\nNOTHING: \n\nYou get hired as a PM with a mandate to launch a new product in a very specific timeframe. The company has never done this before and while you have some expertise in the domain, you're not an expert. The catch is you have no team, no data, no infrastructure...yet. Everyone is being hired from outside the company and yet - you must research, design, build and manage (aka invent) everything from production cadence to frameworks as you go. When new people come on board, you not only have to onboard them but then coordinate with them on how to move forward. Any budgetary issues - environment setup, software, HPC stack, etc.. must be vetted, approved and then reviewed before they can be implemented. Not to mention reviewed and approved by a compliance team and the COO. You onboard an entire team except UX/VD because engineering took over the budget and hired more back-end devs using the UX budget for themselves forcing you to do all of that on top of your own product role. Management doesn't care because again - the product leaders are all ex-engineering and there is very little UX representation around the company. \n\nALL: \n\nYou get hired as a PM to build out an AI powered ETL/Data Lake that ingests over 3000 different API sources to power a database with a search engine on top. Search is inference powered using GCP and there is zero standardization on any of the data inputs. REST? Yes. SOAP? Yes. XML and CSV manually sent over as a physical file attachment? Oh yes. Despite all of the data having the same overall purpose, you not only have very little consistency in data formatting but also specific redactions in the API called due to complicated and ever changing privacy rules. Then - two outsourced teams. One in Europe who are really good but disagree with everything and often build conflicting systems with zero oversight from management (don't upset the apple cart) and another in India who are woefully incompetent and break all security and engineering best practices just to make deadlines. Now have both teams fight on backlogs and any management of sprint planning or UAT is your problem with QA just rejected anything and everthing to cover their asses. \n\nThat was mine. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. ",
