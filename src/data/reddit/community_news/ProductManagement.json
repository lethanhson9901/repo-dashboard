If it's too much, or too much of a blocker -- move on to another company with a different flavor of dysfunction.   But there is no magical company that doesn't have any.     \n  \nI have used this in interviews with companies i'm talking to --  i literally ask this question: \"every company has some dysfunctionally - what is the flavor here?\", when you ask various folks from same company it can be fascinating to hear the variety and/or consistency of answers.",

The first thing I've noticed as a night and day difference is that I need to plan way ahead, with a much more broader picture in mind than as a delivery manager. The first time I saw the offering development cycles I honestly got overwhelmed, because my default is to solve everything at once and asap. What strategy would you recommend to get over that, what is a healthy and effective mindset for a PM, what would you say I should research or do to avoid mistakes, what common traps should I expect and what did you do to avoid these? Also, any tips and tricks from your experience would be great.",

By that I mean learn about how the product is used, what problems it solves, why it is priced the way it is, how successful it is and with whom, what the macro and micro environment is i.e political, environmental, regulatory, usage data, sales data. Literally anything and everything. The more you know, the more right you'll be when you have an idea. BUT, just because you have a good idea, doesn't mean it will work so you need to be a master of tearing your ideas to shreds and validating it as best as you can, by speaking to customers, stakeholders, sales people, engineers, users etc. Engineers are critical because they'll tell you if it's even possible and affordable to build. Once you've done all that, you'll have the best possible arguments and you'll have confidence.",

Independence/Leadership -- Staff/Principal level can run the ship and guide all decisions pretty independently -- the best ones don't act this way necessarily, but if there was no VP, CPO, or CEO -- the staff/principal would keep on trucking, making the tough calls, tradeoffs, and taking the hit when it doesn't work, re-chart new course, etc.   A lot of this stems from the foundation of #1.\n3. Presence -- the combination of #1 and #2 create a strong personality inside the company.  If there is ever a question about anything related to the product space -- this person's name should first on everyone's tongue.  So act like a leader, act like a Staff before you get promoted, establish the relationships, establish your expertise while still being 100% collaborative and authentically interested in other peoples ideas and contributions.\n\nIf this all sounds nutty -- yep that's PM -- being the strong expert independent leader while also authentically including everyone else.

So it's difficult to say what one should be doing over another in any particular company because they are all different. The one thing I will say though, is that Product Managers are very very rarely responsible and accountable for the success of an actual product, despite the name. Usually it's the Head of Product who claims responsibility. In my view, someone should own a product when they are the most knowledgeable person to take active responsibility for a product's success. Sometimes products are the whole company. So, to me, the title \"Product Manager\" should mean exactly that, but the corporate world broke this.",

Some metrics are not in the purview so the hypothesis needs to be created in order to discover it. \n\nEssentially I see data as glowing lines illuminated from an idea you have about what's going on.

I've done product management for 10+ years now across many industries, built many product 0>1 and I often feel like I want to get out of the field altogether. Every manager or company I've worked at/with has a different definition of what \"good\" product management actually is. I wrote about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does\\_anyone\\_think\\_that\\_the\\_expectations\\_for\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1p2u1kq/does_anyone_think_that_the_expectations_for_what/)\n\nWhat would be your mental model for determining whether someone (1) is good at product, but just not in the right company/industry; or (2) needs to move to a different function entirely? And how do you handle the fact that often, your job satisfaction as a PM relies quite heavily on the environment you're in?",

How do they add the most value?  (even ask folks for input) Then figure out how to excel at it.   A mentor can help, but not required.

Not good though.\n\nSo all we hear is: AI is going to create a new utopia and everyone needs to come on the journey or be left behind.\n\nWhilst I agree that everyone needs to learn AI, I don't believe it will save their jobs. It's specifically designed as a cognitive and administrative replacement. All jobs will be impacted eventually.\n\nThe question is, how much of the \"middle\" ground can the economy tolerate before we reach this utopia. I'm very negative about this. I see a middle ground where most roles gradually diminish in numbers. Not completely go away, but just go down. I mean, if it drops by only 10% we've got an economic crisis with indebted governments.\n\nSo, I think the redundancies will work up the experience chain until the most experienced are left running the show, doing more with less human support. As a consultant I'm already seeing this in real-time.\n\nOr, AI will be unsafe and unsecure and an event forces a pause. In which case, business as usual :)",

The type 1 startup I just joined is a night and day difference in all aspects, but I am having so much fun and loving it so far. Both companies were great but I think type 1 is where it’s at if you can find the right fit and growth stage and have the energy for it. You can always retire at a type 2 company.

My only framework has been my experience that I use to handle differing scenarios.\n\nFrameworks are good for things that are truly difficult to do without. How many of those can you name? I actually created a framework myself, which is niche, but solves really fucking difficult problem.

I know the answer, but my brain just skips right past the answer as it's \"common sense\" or \"they wouldn't ask this basic of a question\" , i give an answer later to find it's not what they were asking and I knew the answer they were looking for I just didn't say it out loud as it was too basic\n\n\nLike I'm have trained myself for speed and efficiency, as in dodging basic stuff to get to the core...\n\nHow do I unlearn this or rather how do I learn the basic stuff?

I didn't know anything about Marketing so I did a Masters in digital marketing. From there I was able to get into owning digital propositions which eventually led to product management, which I then did for 17 years. Each role I was in I was looking at how my skills could transfer to something else. Every move had a logical connection, but the key was moving and taking risks",

We would teach them, check their understanding and then a week or two later they would fall back into their original habit. There were 3 things at play here. The first was memory. We needed to ensure we were champions everyday and checking everyone remembered to do what they were supposed to. The second was gaps. When someone learns something and then goes back to their original work they sometimes encounter an edge case. They don't yet know how that edge case is solved in the new system and rather than check, they just do what they know using the old system. The third was command. If the leadership didn't understand fully or buy into it well enough they wouldn't hold their staff to account. We needed to ensure the management were mandating the new process otherwise people just do what they want.\nSounds like you're doing your best with 1 and 2, so maybe see if you can influence leadership to get some bossing",

You must have some element that is transferrable to another business of a similar type. \n\nIn terms of building domain knowledge, I don't think it's really possible to do it fully in the business sense because a lot of it will be about how they operate internally. But I have managed to go into a domain where I had no experience but I did have a personal interest. For example I love cars (My Dad was a car salesman) and I love mountain biking, and I ended up working for the first online car sales company and the largest cycle retailer.

This often means talking to engineers (feasibility) and and customers (desirability) to see if it's something that CAN be built and SHOULD be built. I then craft the findings into a playback so that the risks or opportunities can be understood. If you think it's a bad idea you want to play back the evidence to cover your ass. If the validation proves it's a good idea, then fine, it's just about how you break it down to delivery.

When you learn to play golf, you put your ball on the tee, aim down the fairway (basically anywhere where there's smooth grass) and thwack. The problem is, your aim is as wide as the fairway is and more often than not it goes 10% out to the left or right and ends in the rough. The trick is to very specifically aim at the flag. Nowhere else, just the flag (or similar tiny spot). That helps you focus your target area down and you're more likely to hit it.\nAnyways, when I apply this to somewhere I want to get to I look for the flag. In a Product sense, to me this is the Product itself. If I became an expert in the product and its experience, either by researching it or getting as much exposure as I could, then I'll already be talking the talk. It's no guarantee, and researching the iPhone isn't going to get you a job at Apple. But you'd be surprised how many people apply for jobs but provide absolutely no connection to the product at all. It's a standout thing to me. Shows passion too.\nOn the AI question, it's going to reduce the number of product roles I think. I don't believe there will be more jobs because more companies would just make business too competitive.\nAll you can do is your best. I wish you the best of luck. We all need it",

You'll likely have oodles of the \"product sense\" skills, but lack the \"product execution\" experience (this bit is 80% experience 20% knowledge). In my opinion, to be successful and not have a very painful time, you need to have mastered execution, because that's where all the dangers are. To get execution experience you need to be a Product Owner or a hands on Product Manager who has their own squad that they manage. You'd probably earn less than you do now and you'd probably find it a bit of a grind.\n\nI'd imagine you'd be able to get a job as a PM with those credentials, but you'd risk failing without delivery experience, which would be disheartening for someone of your skills. \n\nIf it doesn't bother you getting hands on in delivery, then it'd be worth it in the end. You'd probably be snapped up and climb much quicker than most because you'd grasp the strategic end already.\n\nYou often hear similar stories when an ex-Google or FAANG Product Manager moves to a non-tech-native  \"legacy\" company. They struggle with the dysfunction and eventually end up leaving. It's not like the books in those companies, but they make up 99% of the companies who have Product functions.",

Jeans and an ill-fitting button-up shirt. Thinks that ping pong tables and smoothie bars are acceptable to mention in the benefits package, regardless of 401k matching. \n\n3. The \"wait how did I get here\" PM. Internal talent who climbed the ranks and ended up in product. They either love it or can't wait to get enough equity to bail. Almost exclusively works remotely. Energy of a nervous golden retriever– friendly but easily overwhelmed. \n\n(I say this knowing good and well I'm probably in the third camp.) \n\nDifferent businesses attract different PM archetypes.

I had spent the previous decade in finance where smart casual meant you could take off your tie and undo your top button. \n\nI think tech company must be more informal than my previous places so there I am on my first day and walk in casual suit trousers and a smartish shirt (think finance bro look). The first person I see is wearing a ripped guns n roses short, ragged shorts and flip flops. \n\n15 years later I still occasionally get reminded and mocked for that first day. \n\nMy uniform now is the tech one. Jeans and hoodie. \n\nI’m older and wiser now. TLDR - If you are good at your job wear whatever the heck you want as nobody care\n\nOnly caveat is if in B2B and pulled into sales dress how the prospect does",

This is someone with a reputable 10+ year work history at a number of companies.\n\n\n\nThe problem with LLM is that the cost of generating bullshit now vastly undercuts the cost of detecting and correcting it. I probably spent more time following links and verifying sources than the author did asking some bot to put together the reference section of their doc.\n\n\n\nAs with similar situations, I feel this calls for punitive consequences.

You can be the best pm ever by purist definitions of the job but still fail miserably, vice versa.\n\nSo start by asking yourself what your goal is. Do you want to become a great builder or just climb corporate ladder? \n\nYou can do both but most of the time it’s a push and pull in between.\n\nAfter a decade, I would say great product manager optimizes for what they want. Figuring out what you want is the half of the journey - it also changes with you along the way. \n\nOne rule is never to stop improving yourself, rest you will figure out in time.

If you get clear on that and translate it to your day to day - you're going to use your time much more efficiently. At the end of the day, that prioritisation is what makes us good or bad as PMs. ",

At some point it just creates noise.\n\nThe only way to actually learn product is to **own a problem and make decisions**. A few practical ways to do that without a PM job:\n\n* Build something small with real users. Not a perfect app. A landing page, Notion template, Chrome extension, or simple AI tool. Do the PM work around it: who it’s for, what problem, what you shipped first, what changed after feedback.\n* Volunteer for product ownership wherever you are. Own a feature, a workflow, an experiment. Titles don’t matter as much as ownership.\n* Do real teardowns. Pick a product you use and write a one-pager: user goal, friction, metric, hypothesis, experiment.\n* Freelancing can work, but only if you’re actually making product decisions, not just taking orders.\n\nConfidence in PM comes from shipping, being wrong, and adjusting. Courses help with language. Experience builds judgment.",

It lets you tackle realistic product decisions and get feedback, which really helped build my confidence and instincts way more than just reading or watching.\n\nBesides that, try to find small side projects where you can actually own a feature or a small product from idea to launch, even if it's just for a personal portfolio.

I have a PM I partner with regularly (a couple times a week) to help validate and prioritize the problems to work on. This always involve technical feasibility and sequencing on my part. I may pitch product iterations or ideas on my own that fits the strategy. I review the product strategy, but I'll never be the one to devise it. I regularly interview customers and support cases. I work in a tech infra company and lately I've been wrangling stakeholders for a risky project and I've talked to legal, marketing, analytics, and a few partner teams on my own.\n\nOnce all the prep work is done, I dial down the \"product assistant\" work by 70% and focus on executing. But being able to engage customers and review customer cases is a non-negotiable for me; that's how my best ideas come about. At the end of the day I'm here to solve customer problems in a manner that fits the goals of the business, and I just happen to thread the needle in a way that benefits from my eng experience.\n\nIMO this engineering archetype doesn't need it's own book. Give an eng who gives a shit about the customer problem a few of the classic PM books, mix in some curiosity that they're given the time to act on, and put them in an org where the eng x product relationship is a true partnership -- then the archetype will come about naturally",

It's not the idea - ideas come back if they matter, you're right about that. It's the context. Every customer conversation that referenced the issue, every edge case someone mentioned in the thread, every \"oh and this also breaks X\" comment that someone added 3 months ago. That stuff doesn't come back.\n\n  \nWe had a feature request resurface as a \"new\" priority. Scoped it from scratch with \"fresh context\" like you described. Shipped it. Then someone found the original killed ticket and it had 3 customer conversations attached that completely changed how we should have approached it. We basically built the wrong version because we treated it as new when it wasn't.\n\n  \nNow I do what you do - kill the ticket - but I keep a lightweight doc with the raw customer signal. Who said what, what they were trying to do, what workaround they're using. Takes 5 min to maintain and saves the painful re-research when something inevitably comes back.",

Nobody deletes them because deleting feels like giving up. So they stay there making sprint planning slower and giving everyone the illusion that the work is \"captured.\"\n\nYour approach is basically what works. If it matters it'll come back. If it doesn't come back it never mattered. The fresh context point is the part people miss. A ticket written 8 months ago has assumptions baked in that probably aren't true anymore. The team changed, the system changed, the priorities changed. But the ticket still says \"as discussed in Q2\" referencing a conversation nobody remembers.\n\nThe real question is why Agile frameworks treat the backlog as sacred in the first place.

          "text": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital product management, the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and content creation has birthed a new paradigm of though leadership. \n\nAs we pivot toward a more automated future, the discourse surrounding \"AI slop\" highlights a critical inflection point for PM leaders and stakeholders alike. We must leverage synergistic frameworks to ensure that our high-frequency outputs remain aligned with core user personas and value propositions.\n\nThe recent observation of Aakash Gupta’s content strategy—producing roughly 10,000 words in a mere 30-minute window—serves as a masterclass in scalable operational efficiency. From a product perspective, this isn't just \"slop\"; it’s an MVP (Minimum Viable Post) iteration cycle. By utilizing generative models to provide \"takes\" on viral trends, creators are essentially performing real-time A/B testing on audience engagement. This \"spray and pray\" methodology is, in many ways, an agile approach to capturing the attention economy.\n\nKey Pillars of the Automated PM Strategy\n\nVelocity as a Feature: In a saturated market, speed is often the ultimate differentiator.\n\nBeing the first to comment on a trend—even via an AI-generated quote—allows for maximum visibility within the algorithm’s honeymoon period.\n\nData-Driven Iteration: By generating 10+ quotes in a row, creators can analyze which specific \"hooks\" or \"takes\" resonate with the target demographic, allowing for a pivot in the next batch of content.\n\nContent Arbitrage: Taking a viral post and expanding it by 400-800 words is a form of value-add that rewards the consumer with depth (or the illusion of it) while minimizing the creator's overhead.\n\n\"True disruption occurs when the cost of production drops to near-zero, while the perceived value remains high enough to trigger a click.\" — Anonymous PM Visionary\n\nHowever, we must remain cognizant of the signal-to-noise ratio. While the volume is impressive, the long-term sustainability of \"AI slop\" depends on its ability to solve the user's \"Job to be Done\"—which, in this case, is professional entertainment and micro-learning.\n\nAs we look toward Product-Led Growth (PLG) in 2026, the question isn't whether we should use AI to write our takes, but how we can optimize the human-in-the-loop process to ensure that the \"slop\" eventually evolves into \"gold.\" We are witnessing the democratization of insight, where the barrier to entry is no longer talent, but the capacity to prompt.\n\nWould you like me to generate a series of viral-ready \"hooks\" based on this PM slop style for your own social media feed?",

As per the framework, the team is the \"guide\" and the user/customer the hero. Therefore, you need to extend the framework by \"what is the personal reward for the guide?\" aspect. \n\nAlso: Get kids :-). You become an amazing storyteller if you try an \"opt-in\" approach with activities; the huge benefit: difficulty scales automatically. It is simple to get a 3 year old to be excited, however the final boss is a 14 year person who is slightly addicted to social media with a raging hormonal imbalance.... Also, you can rent kids from family members for free or even better: they might pay you for your service. You are welcome.\n\n",

It’s about helping people understand *why* something matters and *what to do next*.\n\nA few concrete ways to improve it:\n\n* Start with the decision, not the background. Lead with “We should do X because Y,” then explain how you got there. Most PMs bury the point.\n* Anchor everything to a user problem. If you can’t explain the pain in one sentence, the story isn’t ready.\n* Use before/after framing. What’s broken today, what changes if we ship this, what stays the same if we don’t.\n* Practice one-minute summaries. If you can’t explain the idea clearly in a minute, it’s probably not clear yet.\n* Watch where people interrupt. Confusion shows up as questions in the middle of your story. That’s your feedback loop.\n\nYou’ll know it’s working when meetings get shorter, fewer people argue past each other, and decisions happen faster.",

In order for us to land those a380s, we need to do X,y,z to build us the runway we need.*\n\nIt works really well because almost everyone these days has flown in a variety of planes and has been to airports with big and small planes and big and small terminals and so they can visualize what a big plane landing on a small runway would look like (crash) as well as seeing a small plane landing on a large runway (under utilization).",

I know this sounds obvious but most PMs write great docs and then stumble through presenting them. the story that reads well isn't the same as the story that sounds good.\n\nfor measuring improvement - are people remembering what you said? are they repeating your framing back to you? that's the real signal.\n\nwhat context are you usually storytelling in? exec presentations? sprint planning? roadmap reviews? the approach shifts a bit depending on audience.",

          "text": "Communication = Alignment. It goes both ways \n\nUntil it comes more naturally, it might be helpful to write down your talking points. It sounds pretty basic but you need to be really clear to identify what are your goals that you plan to communicate. That usually comes in the form of thoughtful planning, supporting data and ultimately a talk track. Take some time to write down your core goal and work backwards how you can get there - AI can help get you started or unstuck here. This is the same for nearly all kinds of communication. \n\nNow it gets different depending on who your audience is:\nThe number 1 communication skill I’ve learned is knowing your audience. Who are they, what do they care about and how you can add value. Sometimes your message is inspirational, strategy based (resource/output management) or performance (KPI, engagement or financial). Don’t be afraid to ask what they think is important or what their goals are. \n\nThe life hack here is to strategically meet with each of your stakeholders 1-1 before your group meeting. Ask them what their needs are, hesitations with your plan. Share your ideas on how everyone could win. Hear them out. Get their feedback solo, and then you have time to message based on everyone’s core input. \n\nAlso…Many times, a PM is a moderator. State the goal of your communication- hold that as a North Star if someone derails. There was a great post here recently on how to manage moderation while you’re trying to communicate. I’ll look up the post and post a reply.",

I discovered I say \"um\" way more than I thought and bury my main point 3 minutes in.\n\ncoming from QA/BA/dev you probably already have the technical vocabulary. the PM shift is more about adapting your style to different audiences - engineers want different info than execs want different info than customers.\n\nwhat specific situations are tripping you up? async vs sync? presentations vs 1:1s? stakeholder updates?",

A small team where the founder has a strong business vision used to hire one or two PMs just to do all the grunt work.  That is no longer happening.  PM first hire seems to be getting later than before AI.\n\n2) Larger companies are still hiring PMs and if anything they have MORE PM roles.  It used to be common to be up to 20-1 (20 Eng to each PM).  That is changing.  Engineering teams are getting smaller and PM teams are remaining the same size or growing.  \n\n3) Teams becoming more tightly integrated.  The old hard break between PM and eng is starting to fade a bit.  Not everywhere, but we are seeing teams that have both PM and eng reporting to the same leader.  Same with design.  This isn't necessarily a direct result of AI, but it becomes more reasonable as feature teams get smaller.\n\n  \nShort answer:  PM doesn't seem to be going anywhere but the overall structure of the product team is changing.  \n\n",

Our packaged offering includes:\n\n\\- Data warehouse\n\n\\- Data administration application\n\n\\- Reporting tool\n\nThe company’s strategic direction is to move analytical workloads and customer reporting off the warehouse and instead bet on a Lakehouse offering (Amazon S3 Tables (Iceberg) + Athena to be precise). In this new model, there would be no traditional data warehouse - all analytical data would live on S3 tables and be queried directly.\n\nCustomer use cases today:\n\n\\- Customers ingest data from multiple sources into the platform\n\n\\- We provide out-of-the-box data products (enriched tables, views, dashboards, etc.)\n\n\\- Customers can build their own transformations, reports, and dashboards on top of this delivered content\n\nI’m trying to evaluate this shift primarily through a product lens, not just an infrastructure or cost lens.\n\nFor PMs who’ve been involved in similar transitions:\n\n\\- Have you built or owned a data platform without a traditional data warehouse?\n\n\\- What worked well, and what didn’t?\n\n\\- Where did this show up for customers (performance, flexibility, trust, usability)?\n\n\\- Any things PMs tend to underestimate in “warehouse-less” architectures?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences and lessons learned from a Product perspective.",

          "text": "Platform and Data PM here for a multi-tenant solution sold to customers in highly regulated industries. Hosted in our cloud or theirs (hyper scalers) which made all of this so much fun. \n\nFor the customers we hosted in our cloud (AWS)\n\nI started with a data warehouse. We had several sources (relational and non relational DBs, runtime resources logs, server logs, etc) for a complex solution that was generating up to 1 TB of data from the largest customer and it needed proper ETL pipelines to give us all the Parquet format files in S3 and queried internally using Athena at the start. \n\nI had up to 2k customers. Think of every bank in the world, health providers, governments, logistics and even defence companies. They all used our previous solution (client server self hosted) and had developed a myriad of dashboards tailored to their business. \n\nI had pressure from my stakeholders to provide dashboards for customers to view their data but I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to find a one size fits all solution and I didn’t want to be a PowerBI PM. My approach was to prioritize solutions to give customers access to data via APIs so they could all do what they want. I eventually added UIs to manage the data they had in our cloud (set retention periods, create archives, etc)\n\nCustomers were fine with this approach. I had to put some effort on defining rules to manage costs. External data transfers of the volumes we run are expensive so I had to put cooldowns on some of the endpoints. \n\nAt this stage I’m working on a solution to stream/share some of the operational data we get in AWS for monitoring customer runtime resources health, status, etc We use this internally just for a health dashboard but customers need this too (we already have a UI they can check but they want real time data to be consumed by applications they developed to track and alert)\n\nMy advice. Have a warehouse, build customer facing dashboards only if you know they’ll be usable for all and keep customisation to a minimum or you’ll be building a BI platform. Implement and enforce retention periods to manage costs (if the volumes will make even S3 a burden). Consider giving access to customers via APIs for specific use cases. ",

          "text": "To answer 1:\nI was a data engineer when I built a data lake (Cloudera directly on HDFS with Hive as DB engine to load these parquets/avro files as external tables). At some point I migrated them to Azure HDInsight (ugh, top-down decision bc of “networking”).\n\nAs a PM I have managed a few “data warehouse” like redshift.\n\nSo I have a few thoughts on it, but keep it mind that I wasn’t a PM during data lake period.\n\n2. For data lake, as you might have already know, it “can” be cheaper, and powerful as in you can make decisions on low level things. This is a double edge sword because it’s shifting the cost from infrastructure to operation/maintenance.\n\nFor an instance, schema evolution can be quite complicated. Altering a table shape involves modifying the data files which is a very expensive operation. It might as well be creating a new external table. This is very different from redshift where the DB engine manages these things for you. Modern tool like Iceberg solves this issue, but it means it’s another tool and complexity you need to deal with.\n\nAnother example, you get to decide a storage format specifically optimized for  your own use case. Like parquet vs avro for an example. Redshift does have its own read optimization which most of the time probably is more efficient. But for some specific cases parquet can be more efficient.\n\nThere are some other advantages for data-lake for its file-based storage like, exporting is a lot easier since the file format is universally accepted and can be directly sent, while redshift requires you to query and export.\n\nIf I want to summarize into one thing, it would be the cost advantage as long as you are aware that the cost is shifted to operations & maintenance, not magically disappeared.\n\nAnd operations and maintenance is something you can control based on how much you want to optimize the performance and efficiency. Which leads to your next question.\n\n3. Where did this show up for customers:\nPerformance, can be as good or better in niche cases, based on how much effort your team put to optimize these. (Again, cost)\n\nFlexibility, depends on what you meant by this, like can your customers easily modify a table? Not as easy as redshift (but, should they even?). To ingest the data? Probably easier and more flexible as I mentioned above.\n\nTrust, the governance will be more on your team to integrate and maintain a tool to manage the governance, again, pushing cost to operation and maintenance. But if you meant trust as in compute accuracy, that probably be the same. Usability, if it’s UI dashboard tooling, the same if you are able to manage the data catalog underlying it. If you are talking about ingestion, probably easier and more efficient “technically”. If they export the results from a UI tool or a query then the same.\n\n\n4. Underestimates.\nHmm, this is where I’m not sure I can answer. I wasn’t a PM when I built data lake. But it’s gonna be the same thing I mentioned (again): cost doesn’t magically disappear, you shift it to operation and maintenance which you can control.\n\n- governance: now you have to built or integrate a tool for governance layer by yourself. \n- performance now is more on you.\n- your team will get exposed to much more complexity than redshift. I hope my examples can give you some ideas, but there will be a lot more. Many unknown unknowns. It will be a long term project where your team will discovers more issues and improvements to do.\n\nI kept all these on high level, feel free to shoot any follow up questions. I’ll answer if I know.",

          "text": "My biggest recommendation is immediately identifying your scalability and latency requirements then partnering with your architect on a structured evaluation. I’ve inherited transformations like this where those details werent factored in, which ultimately led to a rewrite the entire product.\n\nYou mentioned Athena, but you need to be sure this choice is validated by meeting your requirements at scale under the particular conditions of your customers while meeting both your SLAS and staying at an effective cost. This is where the real tradeoffs really show up and can lead to more complex solutions or leveraging technologies like redshift spectrum or snowflake. Ex. \nDo you have interactive workloads for online users or scheduled workloads? Maybe a mix where you can request to run now or schedule for a specific time?\nAre these able to be lazily delivered just in time, or are they required for automated data pipelines on the customer side and always need to be generated exactly on time based on data that may only arrive x minutes before the schedule.\nHow does late arriving data get handled? Does it regenerate previous reports and notify the customer or require requery? \nIs there a latency sla where you may need to autoscale within x minutes/seconds to handle workloads scheduled to run at 4am after a batch job uploads data at 3am but before their business starts at 7am?\nDo you have controls in place to cost manage customer queries? When you ran these workloads in postgres you had a fixed cost in the size of your db, with serverless/on-demand you are often charged based on data scanned not returned. a customer could query 1000s of columns over years of data to aggregate their top 5 most sold products and every time they load this table cost you $20, while adding a 30 day lookback or aggregations at the monthly level for historical data could cut that cost to pennies.\n\nIn cloud the usual gotchas are a lack of real world cost controls on the queries and service scalability limits by cloud providers where you can only run X jobs per cloud account/region. You can mitigate these by 1. Partner early with architecture and make sure you have a pressure tested plan on resource scalability, latency, cost tradeoffs that doesnt open up existential vulnerabilities 2. Work with your cloud service provider so that they can help you cost out the solution and raise/work around various service limits. There are entire PS teams of people that your aws account exec can give you free credits to support this analysis if requested. They’ll throw free expert support at you because they’re ultimately motived by influenced revenue + potential to use you as a customer reference after your migration.",

I am sure, 80% of the topic will be clear to you using the above approach. Then you can dive deeper if you want (with the LLMs only), as you will be in the position to understand.\n\n3. Using that knowledge, you can then ask your coding agent to help you understand the code base.

That's helpful. Feedback of course, but if clients could just ask for the things they wanted, a product managers and businesses often would not need to exist. Sometimes you to understand that with the client ask for is not actually what they want, if we gave them what they said they wanted it would actually not solve the problem. They're trying to solve, or the solution would be too complex and not worth the incremental effort required to build the complexity they're asking for. \n\nThe long story short as with many things and product, there's no clear answer. \n\nI could certainly understand that a jaded founder or product manager after having sales teams tell him to build things that he knows are not the right thing for many iterations, would simply decide to not communicate with sales. I don't think that's the right answer, but if you've been a successful entrepreneur, who am I to tell you you're wrong.",

You may have to  build good rapport with sales in order to get access to the users and customers so you can do discovery. Some sales people might understand the product well and can help you with discovery/ideation. \n\nSome additional pitfalls - sales tends to be more self interested than other professions and some will try to use you. I have had sales people demand that I go see every single customer in person to do the roadmap presentation ( I said no I don't want to be traveling 50% of the time to do a series of 1 hour presentations that I can easily do remotely and get the same level of feedback). They sometimes try to use product managers as bait so the customers will agree to meet so they can then try to sell something else to them. I've had sales people demand that I run a product training session for a customer just to add \"next level white glove treatment\". I find that the more you communicate with them, the more they ask of you and the more they try to co-opt you into silly things like this. \n\nAlso when I used to provide more details to sales about what the developers were building,  I would just get more nitpicky feedback about trivial details (because they need to say something in meetings to feel important and that is all they can think of to talk about).",

But the actual signal from all those customer touchpoints gets lost.\n\n  \nThe recency bias point someone made above applies here too - except for most channels it's the opposite problem. It's not that the signal is too loud, it's that nobody's listening at all.

At best someone drops a note in Slack that a PM maybe sees.\n\n  \nWe tried tagging tickets, shared Notion docs, weekly syncs - nothing really stuck because there was no real workflow for surfacing patterns from customer conversations into product decisions.

      "text": "**TL;DR: offered a global tech strategy role with heavy China collaboration. Sounds exciting on paper, but unsure about day-to-day reality. Looking for honest lived experiences before deciding.**\n\nHi all — I’m at a bit of a crossroads and would really appreciate advice from people who have actually worked with China-based teams or spent time there.\n\nI’ve been offered a global tech/AI strategy role at a f500 tech company that involves close / somewhat exclusive collaboration with a Beijing based team of \\~10, likely frequent off-hour meetings due to time zones, and multi-week travel to China for onboarding. They are looking to expand their team to the U.S., and I’d be the first hire on this team.\n\nOn paper, it seems to be a good opportunity (decent brand, exposure, senior leadership access) but I’m unsure about the day-to-day reality. \n\nIf you’ve worked with China based teams or traveled there for work, I’d really appreciate hearing:\n\n\\-what surprised you\n\n\\-what was harder than expected\n\n\\-what was better than expected\n\n\\-whether you’d do it again\n\nWould love to hear your perspective if you’ve experienced a similar situation!\n\nFor Context I’m:\n\n\\-US based, Late 20s/mid-career\n\n\\-Enjoy ambiguity/strategy/innovation\n\n\\-Like working with people and being in office (this role is mostly remote)\n\n\\-recently was laid off in a tech PM role, looking to get back into product/innovation/venture/startups down the road.\n\nThanks — genuinely trying to make a thoughtful decision here.",

          "text": "Yup, worked for a couple years in B2B/B2C for a company with split teams. 2 onshore devs + a QA and then 4-5 offshore devs + a QA. I had an offshore 'counterpart' that I spoke with daily during the couple of overlapping hours I had. \n\nNow, the truth is I imagine this depends HEAVILY on the organization you're working with. Talking to other stateside folks that've gone through the experience, it can vary significantly. Some folks said their offshore team was more or a less a black box with a single point of contact. They'd send over requirements in PDF format and do all the back and forth over estimates and questions and delivery via email/chat with that single POC. On the flipside, others (like myself) it was more like any other development experience. They'd get on standup, attend grooming, etc. Our onshore devs and them would work together on stuff. Etc etc. The only big difference was there was a 2 hour window in the morning where our schedules overlapped so if they asked a question at 8am....and I answered at 8:05, it wasn't getting 'done' until the next day. It did heavily impact timelines as a result. \n\n> what surprised you\n\nThey did everything they could to appear westernized. They used American names on calls (which got funny because they chose ones like \"Elvis\" and \"Vinnie\"). When one of them would have a kid, they'd give them a western name (in addition to a Sichuanese one). Any attempt on our end to try and learn their Sichuanese names was rebuffed. This also extended to even things like talking about their food and culture. They did everything they could to essentially hide anything about their personal culture, but they did it by putting up a western facade. They'd never mention any of the foods they liked or ate unless it was something stereotypically western. \n\nThey took all the normal Chinese holidays you're familiar with, but never spoke about it at all. Like we'd all talk about Christmas or Diwali or Hannukah, and they'd ask questions and such about those holidays, but if we asked about what their plans were or what have you, they'd clam up. It was kind of wild. \n\n> what was harder than expected\n\nLearning how to write requirements that worked for them. Obviously there were linguistic aspects I had to be mindful of, but also dissecting even the most technical language required a bit of trial and error. Add in the time difference and yeah, it got complicated. I'd write a requirement and send it over to them. Onshore, it'd take 5 minutes. Because because they were offshore and 12 hours apart, it was a full day turnaround. And if they had a question, it doubled the time...because again, I didn't get the question until the next day and they didn't see my answer until 12 hours later. Even when my schedule changed and I had more overlap in the evening instead (ie: They were starting their day in my evening), it was time consuming and challenging to sort out requirements with them.\n\n> what was better than expected\n\nTheir ingenuity. I assumed they'd be more like typical contractors where they'd build exactly what I asked for (or close enough) and nothing else. If I told them to build a wheel but only described 330* of it, I'd get a wheel missing 30* type stuff, ya know? \n\nThey made a serious effort to understand the product, the customer, etc. They REALLY liked when I included them in discovery. We got some great solutions from them. They also tended to play with ideas if they were light on work, which was neat. They were genuinely pretty skilled engineers, though they sometimes went rogue and instead of getting a full 360* wheel...I'd get a tank tread. \n\nThey were also really approachable and friendly. I got to know my counterpart pretty well, or at least as well as she felt was okay. They'd hop on calls with their kids and their kids knew who we were and such. We even had a sort of happy hour not long after COVID hit. They were in Chengdu so they were in like HARD lockdown, but we all hopped on a party call and talked about it over drinks. \n\nThey came over here a couple times prior to COVID too which was cool.\n\n> whether you’d do it again\n\nWhile I ultimately did enjoy working with them, and would do so if they were onshore, I wouldn't do offshore again if I could help it. There were always knowledge transfer issues, and since they were contractors we were also somewhat hamstrung on how much they could impact. Additionally, there WAS a certain amount of territorialism at play at all times. It was less that we didn't want them to have the 12 herbs and spices, but more that we didn't want to be in a position where we didn't have the 12 herbs and spices if that makes sense. It made planning things challenging because sometimes I'd have to slice up work in an illogical way because we wanted onshore devs working on the core pieces, even though it may have made more sense from a productivity standpoint to slice it up differently. \n\nAlso, ultimately they had their own marching orders and such and they'd periodically get shuffled around, frequently despite our requests for certain devs to remain on certain teams. \n\nAnd I'm 95% sure when they added \"Ethan\" to our team as a 5th dev during COVID, it was actually just Elvis with two logins and a pay bonus to push out front end work for 2.",

If HR can contribute, involve them too.\n\nDoing this allows you to see both disconnect and imbalance in expectations for responsibilities and work product.\n\nWhen you ask for these role and responsibility definitions (self and of each other), you should follow a model that forces them to describe High and Low Level responsibilities, associated tasks (detail) and outputs/deliverables.  Anything that is on a routine basis, like a quarterly sales report for example, should have a secondary \"due date\" indication.\n\nThese are then shared up and down the ladder in a non-confrontational way to identify the issues in perception, and fixed.",

I think all the standard PM advice that other people are extremely sound, but here's my attempt of framing that advice:\n\nIt's really easy to want to reply to what people are saying. You're using the business conversation as your input and provide output based on what you say. You're smart, have good context, and come up with great solutions! You'll find the best path forward, great!\n\nUnfortunately, that's not quite what the job is.\n\nIt's important to remember that the business input you're getting is actually their own individual *outputs*, so to speak, and your job is to understand what *their* inputs are to have provided you the output in the meeting. People are notoriously bad at articulating their issues, but are really good at asking for things.\n\nTogether, *that (what they've said and WHY they said it)* becomes *your* input. If you start solutioning without understanding, it's the equivalent of prompting an AI to generate an image without clarifying what it is you're trying to build. And it's not necessarily *bad*, and probably a good approximation, but it's just easier to take a step back and spend that ADHD energy to get more details, and understand *why* people are saying what they're saying.\n\nThere's a lot of asking \"okay but WHY is what you're doing now not working\" and \"okay what are you optimizing for\".",

Knowing who your stakeholders are and how to weight their feedback is a combo method of sound business and psychological analysis . . . being able to ferret out who is giving feedback that supports the project success, who gives feedback that supports themselves but screws others, who gives feedback with a hidden agenda, whose feedback is reliable, whose is not.\n\nWithout knowing these people very well that evaluation comes in part by volume.  When you get some of the same stakeholder users telling you the same thing and they are close to the process, work product, etc. that should mean more than a high-level executive who tells you the opposite.\n\nWhat you do NOT want to do ever, is off the hip, with the client or stakeholder, start suggesting or commenting on solutions after you've listened to them for a few minutes.  If you do, they will latch onto that and not let it go, even if later, you go down a path from your analysis that shows that spontaneous solutionizing to be wrong.\n\nYou may think that you have an understanding of the problem after one or two conversations with one or two stakeholders, but what is often the case, when you dig deeper, you will find that you only understand about half of the problem.\n\nIt is your job to understand the business goal, and business problems to solve, gather and synthesize data on these things, document the current state manual and automated processes, looking for process improvement opportunities (i.e., efficiencies, where you can automate, etc.), documenting future state workflows and requirements, features and functions. \n\nDepending on the complexity of the problem(s) to solve, I may be onsite for a few weeks, shadowing and interviewing stakeholders, re-interviewing and asking questions, getting survey responses as follow-up data, and then I go back document everything (requirements, workflows, etc.) and then I go back with that and review with the stakeholders for validation.\n\nBy and large, the main reason projects fail is due to rushing through this business problem requirements analysis and management process or skipping major steps, thinking you are wasting time, so that what ends up happening is you build the wrong thing, or something only 60% right, and have to rework, run up additional costs.",

      "text": "Hi great people of Reddit,\n\nAt the company I work at, there is a branch that relies on a monster of a technical system. You can scope it in a few ways, but essentially there are three PMs active within this space. They are each responsible for their own internal product, but each influence this bigger system. Rough sketch there is a: PM for underlying data product, PM for application product, PM for AI product. The latter is (obviously) the newest to the bunch, and he is still finding his way around. The PM for the application has had the biggest responsibility up to now and has taken majority of the ownership. With the newest addition of this Mr. AI, the whole idea of this monster technical system is being reconsidered by executives. There is now a project brought to life to enhance this, involving all three PMs. \n\nPreviously, each PM has been minding their own business and reaching out to another PM if needed, where paths are crossing. \n\nRecently, there has been complaints from internal stakeholders/users that the overall project of improving this monster technical system is unclear. \n\nThere is no vision, goals, metrics, or roadmaps in place. Just whatever each PM is doing separately. The internal stakeholders are worried that the PMs will loose sight of the bigger picture and create or build things in silos. They also do not want to be the ones to have to follow up with three PMs on progress if they are all working on the same monster project. \n\nWhat advice can you give the PMs that are now being asked to work on a single joint project? Where to start? What needs to be put on paper? How to communicate or work with these internal stakeholders? Any advice is welcome. ",

Your senior product manager on the application product is probably a good candidate. Let's call them the principal product manager for now.\n\nThe principal product manager needs a roadmap for the suite. For example, do you really have a \"product for AI\" or should AI be an enabling technology for the other products? Is the \"data product\" a product or is it enabling as well? \n\nIt sounds like you have ONE product: an application with both a data component and an AI component.",

We sync up once per week with just the PMs to make sure nothing is drifting out of alignment and we pull in engineering and architecture as needed. I pull all of their updates together for status info that goes up to my director who collates that with his other projects for reporting up to VPs, EVPs and so on.\n\nThink about this from the leadership point of view as well - how do they get updates? Do they want updates from all 3 PMs in your project? That's just a recipe for confusion if they're not directly involved with the day-to-day of the project. Hierarchy exists for a reason and it sounds like this project needs to establish one. The buck needs to stop with someone, and unless you're a really small org that someone shouldn't be your CEO.",

      "text": "tl;dr I need to find a structure that works for high level buy in docs and an execution document. How do they differ and how can they share information effectively given differing audiences? \n\nMy company we use the term brief or PRD for just about any type of product document. \n\nIn previous jobs, I’ve been a lot more empowered and had autonomy in terms of getting features off the ground in my area of focus. \n\nMy current role requires almost any work of any size (I know…) to be approved by VP or above. They’re looking for a “brief” that’s pretty high-level. What the problem or opportunity is what we wanna do about it what. We need high-level overview. I’d like to keep it to 1-2 pages max. \n\nMany people, including my manager, have opinions on what the content of this should be. The result is it gets added onto an added onto until it’s a 3 to 5 pager with too much detail for execs but not enough detail for execution. \n\nThis is the area where I need the most help because I’ve never really had to pitch things like this to this extent. Researching online this seems to align to a product vision or strategy doc but sometimes the thing being pitched is much lower level than that. And senior stakeholders would react adversely to talking about vision and strategy for these types of lower level things. We do still need to cover goals and objectives though. \n\nOnce approved but somewhat in parallel, we need a “brief” for execution. This is your more typical product requirements doc. I’m looking for new templates here because both myself and my organization don’t like user stories. This document needs to have some context, but not as much as the one for the pitch although it’s very similar.\n\nI’m having a hard time with these document creations because there is so much overlap. We’ve created two pagers, we’ve tried doing the whole thing and ended up with 15 pagers and everything in between. \n\nI’m looking for suggestions and example examples of high-level pitch documents to get the concept approved that gives the amount context needed for a stakeholder to understand what we’re asking for with some high-level requirements. In parallel we need to start drafting a document that is more detailed requirements. It has some context, but it might be a little different to the pitch doc. \n\nHow can I create two different documents for different purposes have them cover overlapping details but with different angles and also cover medium level requirements?

          "text": "spent 8 years across a few companies and documentation structure is weirdly high impact. here's what actually works:\n\nseparate docs into: \\[1\\] strategy/vision (quarterly updates, read by leadership), \\[2\\] specs (detailed feature design, read by eng/design, updated per-release), \\[3\\] runbooks (how to do common tasks, maintained by product ops).\n\nmost teams jam everything into one massive wiki and it rots. the trick is different cadence per doc type. runbooks stay fresh because people use them daily. specs age but that's fine – they're snapshot-in-time. strategy docs should be 1-2 pages max or nobody reads them.\n\nthe structure that worked best: separate folders by initiative, not by doc type. easier to find everything for one project in one place.",
