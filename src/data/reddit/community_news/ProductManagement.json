For the fuckwits at Google who have apparently never used their maps app to navigate walking around unfamiliar cities, that goes double.\n\nWho the fuck is this feature for?  What does the persona look like for the typical user who;\n\n* Knows the gesture exists, and;\n* Remembers it when they're having a problem they want to report, and;\n* And is willing to shake their phone like a fucking ape out in public / on a train / in a meeting when they have an issue.\n\nThis feels less like \"we implemented this pattern because user telemetry data shows that our average user is a fucking moron who shakes their phone when they're confused by it\" and more like \"these other apps do it and we need feature parity.\"",

Something doesn't work right so you \"shake it in frustration and it asks what it can do better\". \n\nI've seen successful (and very unsuccessful) implementations where embedding a responsive trigger aimed at \"frustration\" moments can delight unexpectedly, capture/route the user momentum into feedback (like a bug report) that may have otherwise been missed. \n\nI suspect it went through a curve very quickly, and is more in annoying than clever. Especially as interactions that stick around tend to go through some dynamic of sophisticated, normalized, and expected.\n\nInteractions like these can spread quickly and be great, but also dilute quickly, such as the early effectiveness of gen AI on LinkedIn or Substack, which becomes less effective (and likeable) as it permeates.\n\nHaven't thought about that for a while, thanks for that OP.",

Also, who cares - as in - who cares at all, if you miss a feature being launched?! If you knew about it the minute it shipped, then what? Who would act on it? What would anyone gain outside just having heard about it? You wouldn't be stopping the competitor release in any case.\n\nIf you are AS competitor driven as you are my gut tells me you're missing out on your own creativity. Be in the trenches with customers - actual paying customers - and find out what their needs are. And don't just build what they need, but challenge the status quo. Sometimes customers are unaware of hidden needs they might have. That's the magic of PM - be bold, be creative. That's why Henry Ford built a car instead of making a faster horse (as the people wanted). I know it sounds very fluffy, but you kinda miss out on yourself if you put all your eggs in the basket of AI agents, automations and what everyone else is doing (i.e. your competitors).\n\nCompetitor insights is nice to have.

These were: all the data I got from 3 competitors (I used CC for that), support tickets exported from Zendesk, user interviews, and feedback from stakeholders (sales and customer service). I then used CC for the following questions:\n\n* What are the top 3 pain points? (Top = shared the most number of times) \n* Who mentioned them (pattern by user type) \n* Direct quotes that capture the pain \n* What are the contradictions between users? \n\nAnd a lot more. It helped me to narrow down the problem.\n\nB) I created 3 skills. One each for a principal engineer, a principal designer, and the founder. Then I asked CC to challenge the first draft of our Q1 2026 OKRs (yes, we’re late) as if it were each of them.\n\nThe feedback I got before taking this to the real people was honestly incredible.\n\nLikewise, I have already found some amazing use-cases.

Assuming the worth of the invest in the setup (which I doubt, but OK), for an organisation to rely on the tinkering-abilities of some ICs to unearth potentials, which had not been there before, would be dangerous anyway.

They felt pointless, a waste of time, and yeah, the information is available in multiple places. I swore I would never ask my team to do such pointless work. \n\nNow I manage an organisation with 18 squads across 3 tribes, and every product manager handles their day to day SLIGHTLY differently. Some have details in confluence. Some in Figma boards. Some in PowerPoint. Some in Jira. Which I’m fine with because I want people to utilise things that work with their flows. But it makes my life 1000% more difficult, because I don’t have an easy way to find anything when I need to get answers, and it’s hard to easily stay on top of the overall state of things and know where I need to focus my attention. I cannot tell you how many times in the last few years I have thought “it would be so nice to just have an email from each product manager each week letting me know what’s going on.” And then I chastise myself. 😆 But honestly, I’m so close to asking for it. \n\nI know it sucks because when everything is fine, the report feels useless. But I need to know where things are fine vs where they’re not, or where I see dots that need connecting that aren’t, or any other number of factors I can see from a different perspective. I also get asked random questions from lots of folks, including the CEO, board members, and other VIPs that I’m expected to answer quickly. If that comes at 10pm, I don’t have the luxury of exploring 20 different sources and hoping I can figure out what different documents are saying. \n\nI would encourage you to find out who is really asking for your weekly reports, and ask them what would be useful within it. Hopefully you’ll find that someone is actually getting value, and it will make the exercise feel less pointless.",

We've settled on written team-level updates in an OKR planning tool that anyone in the org can see. My team often complains that it's copying the same info as Jira. I try to remind my teams that effective communication is a skill. It's unlikely the COO/CTO can get what they need for Jira,  we need to tailor our comms to the audience's needs - which doesn't often come through in ticket comments. The CPO/CTO want to know what have we learnt, where are we potentially delayed, risks to overall timelines or wider dependencies, how can we mitigate it, where can they help, what are we testing and are we missing a valuable opportunity elsewhere etc..Engineering ticket comments don't tend to have this nuance. \n\nReporting either verbal or written is a catch 22. It all coms down to company culture around planning, autonomy/collaboration and comms in my mind. Lite written reports require a baseline common understanding across key stakeholders, but how do you get that common understanding I.e bringing people along the journey. \n\nFrom my experience, I don't want teams to do so much planning that they become waterfall, just so they can deliver \"accurate\" async updates. I also don't want them to spend so much time talking about verbally updates, which could be solved with an effective async report...  so I come back to company culture. Our company values open communication  given complicated structure, so I lean towards over communication but making them *really effective* for the audience. In my company communication is the job. So the question is.. how can you get AI to deliver effective nuanced status reports for relevant stakeholders?",

One of the biggest differentiators I've seen is how they ask questions.\n\nA common trap I see is the \"it'd be interesting to know X\" impulse. They ask data teams to pull numbers because they are curious. This creates motion (requests are generated, queries are run), but not progress.\n\nThe effective leaders I’ve worked with do the opposite. They ask sharp questions that cut straight to the core: *\"What evidence do I actually need to make this decision?\"* They work backward from the decision to find the specific evidence that would change it. If the answer to a data question won't change their roadmap, they don't ask it.\n\nI’m working on a resource for my internal team and peers to bridge the gap between Data and Product, based on the patterns I saw effective leaders use at my previous jobs. I want to make sure I'm not missing any major friction points.\n\n1. **Framing questions that drive decisions:** Asking \"What does the data say?\" (Passive) vs. \"What is the threshold to kill this feature?\" (Active).\n2. **Designing metrics that don't lie:** Using vanity metrics that look good vs. leading indicators that actually predict health.\n3. **Extracting Insights:** How to look at a mountain of charts and find the one \"signal\" that matters and ignore the noise.\n\n**My question to the group:** What other \"Data Disconnects\" do you see between Product and Data teams? Where do you see most people get stuck?",

I'd survived 3 rounds of layoffs at this place but the layoff cycle really hit me hard since I'd been laid off from my previous place in early 2023 despite great performance in all my reviews. After the last official round in summer 2024 they started just silently firing people to where I'd be chatting with some stakeholder on Slack about when they'd have something ready and the next day their Slack would be deactivated. Tons of exec turnover, no clear strategy, projects that I knew would go nowhere, super slow moving, pain in the ass stakeholders always mad at me for things outside my control, manager was only interested in optics and implementing whatever framework he read that weekend...yeah. I got my annual bonus and had some vest in March I realized that I couldn't stick around, my performance had suffered and I'd lost all interest and was too burnt out to interview.\n\nI explored pivoting to a different field entirely, did a bunch of networking, went to some networking events and workshop type things, tried to find my niche. Also focused on physical and mental health, getting back into a gym routine, getting offline more. Ultimately I realized that starting from the bottom again and grinding my ass off was just not what I wanted to do at this point in my life, and it was a field that's notoriously hard to break into, so decided to look back to tech and PM. I was extremely selective though, only looked at the sector I was interested in (health tech), only looked at earlier stage startups (Series A-B), and didn't really focus on the specific product/offering because I know by now that stuff is all fungible and there's good and bad to each. Really paid attention to vibes and culture and rejected a few companies outright because my bullshit/douchebag detector went off when I talked to the founders (this happened a LOT in final stages).\n\nEnded up signing with a Series B startup and joined in December, so was off for about 7 full months living off savings. A recruiter had reached out and the company/role was different than I'd been focusing on, and it was in office more than I'd have preferred, but I kept the convo going because why not and it turned out to be a great fit. Been there about 2 months, going great so far. The switch back to a small company has definitely been invigorating, the in-office culture is a huge improvement (previous place was 1-2 days in office, but very corporate and sterile).\n\nAnyway, happy to chat more via DM. All in all I'd say it was worth it and I'm feeling much more optimistic and energized even though I'm working longer hours now than I have in a while. More than anything I'm glad I gave myself the chance to explore another field instead of always wondering \"what if,\" I got it out of my system and made a firm decision and I haven't second guessed it at all.",

For sabbaticals, 4 months (career break, unpaid leave), 12 months between 'proper' jobs, and another 18 months between jobs.\n\n**For how long were you away from work? And how did you spend that time?**\n\n4 months traveling with my partner. Amazing. And at the time, not very expensive to do. My work kept me 'employed' but unpaid, so still accrued benefits and time-served and went straight back in to my old role.\n\n12 months between full time PM role, i did a short 3 month contract job, built an industry blog that was great for creating leads for work and made a small amount of beer money from sponsorships. \n\n18 months total disconnect from all work. Did 12 months not even thinking about work, then started casually looking for my next full time PM job.\n\n**Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?**\n\nNo and no. Every time I've gone back to work it's been essentially the same. Its a function of the company and your colleagues more than anything. A sabbatical won't help.\n\nStudy, sure. I've doen PM referesher course, AI/data scenience course etc. during the sabbaticals and that can help with finding a job and give you some new ideas to apply in the next job. keeps it fresh. But fundamentally, because I've stayed in very similar industries (b2b, enterprise software) PM-ing is PM-ing just the same.\n\n**Would you say it was worth it?**\n\nYes. YES. I have convinced friends to do the same and they are now sold on the sabbatical or 'mini-retirement'. I still meet people who don't get it, assume I'll get bored, or tell me I'll never find a job afterwards... But for me personally, they've all been much needed and benefited my physical and mental health no end.\n\nAnd on the job front, it gives you time to see whats out there. Something will come along. Sometimes just being the guy who's available NOW, without 1-3 months notice period, is enough to get you on to the short list and selected.",

I drove a motorcycle in the northern mountains of Vietnam via the Ha Giang Loop. It was awesome. I’ll always look back on it as the most fun I’ve had. \n\nHow it changed my relationship with work: In the US, your work is your identity. I lived in Silicon Valley where people asked “what do you do?” before “what’s your name?” traveling allowed me to decouple my identity from work because people traveling really don’t care or think it’s impressive you’re a “product manager”. People care more so about different values — where you’re from, kindness, adventure, etc. It really allowed me to tackle work with fresh eyes and the right priority/stress. \n\nRecommendation: Treat your sabbatical like you would making corporate goals— make them SMART goals. Personally, I’d make them about learning a new skill. \n\nI love my previous sabbatical, but honestly i was traveling every 4 days so there wasn’t much stability. My next sabbatical (hopefully in 5 years), im gonna make it wellness oriented and probably get certified in yoga/fitness or something. Learn a martial art like Muay Thai for a couple weeks— maybe train for a fight. Go to a tennis academy, etc.",

I got lucky that I'm not a generalist, so I did get interviews, but the expectations and number of applications were very, very high. \n\nWhat it did help me with is: got more grounded after getting some time to myself, spent about a month thinking about what I really want to do in terms of the future, what are my strenghts, weaknesses, etc, and which areas to target, etc. It also helped me understand that time passes by very quickly. A year was gone in a blink, and I could have planned it better. \n\nWorth it? I don't know. A year passes by really quickly, and I think I could have wasted less time after I recovered mentally.

I'm fairly data and design savvy but the more social components I'm now realizing I struggle with particularly around articulation and communication which are critical for the role ofc.\n\nMy previous team was quite lax so I'm probably underdeveloped as a contributor that can work in ambiguity without guidance and structure and if I give up my facade of confidence and ask for help, people are concerned about my ability to deliver. Honestly, I think a task oriented job might fit me more (maybe a data analyst or data engineer? or something else?). I can do the PM job but I'm just slow I guess.\n\nIdk I'm feeling quite a bit demoralized and want to quit, but thought I'd reach out to this group of peers on what are reasonable career changes to consider. I think certain aspects of being a PM are just not rewarding to me when I reflect. Thank you all!",

Big tech PM often rewards influence, storytelling, and stakeholder management more than execution.  It's a different skill set but learnable.\n\n2. Asking for help is not the problem.  It is in how you frame it.  Lead with options or recommendations.\n\n3. A lot of data-oriented PMs feel \"slow\" in fast cultures.  But thoughtful PMs become assets later after the early perception phase.\n\n4. Before pivoting careers, consider some PM adjacent roles like product ops?\n\n5. Don't feel demoralized.  It is just a signal and one rough environment doesn't define your entire career.  I had an old boss tell me I was not really good at my job.  Months later he praised me for my performance.\n\nCould you ask your manager for 2-3 specific behaviors they expect you to show in ambiguous situations and how they will evaluate progress?",

I'm assuming you're being a little overly critical of yourself, since you were, after all, hired into the role. Your manager's concerns could just be a cultural mismatch with their leadership style.  \n\nProduct Management spans a spectrum depending on the org.  Many PM roles are much more technical and data-driven and others are much less.  What is it that drew you doing Product Management and has that changed?  I'd love to learn more about what skills and interests you have before suggesting other career paths. I'm wondering if is there just more of a cultural mismatch at your current company about what a PM does and if you can find a PM role elsewhere that fits.\n\nI wouldn't suggest you proactively quit.  You're already in the door there and getting a new job in this market is not a sure thing.  I'm assuming your manager hired you for a reason, and perhaps this feedback is their (hypocritically unclear) way of suggesting improvement.\n\nIt could be that fundamentally your soft skills need to improve.  That's a valuable life skill regardless.  Use this opportunity as a forcing function.  Fail upward, as quitting downward wont get you closer to any of your goals.",

To be fair, I kind of just took any interviews from college landed a pseudo-PM role and I guess that's defined me.

          "text": "A lot of this resonates for me. I think two different things here to separate out is the executive presence stuff from the dealing with ambiguity, i definitely wouldn’t conflate the two. \n\nIt’s important because executive presence is almost always something that improves over time in a new role because as you drink from the firehose it’s overwhelming and you don’t feel confident in your read on things. 6 months later you have the full stack nailed down, and confidence builds naturally outward to that executive presence. Natural communicators level up significantly at this point, but introverts improve too.\n\nInability to deal with ambiguity is quite different. Sure it can be developed, but it’s more something that you either have or you don’t, it’s often how we’re wired and our emotional/cognitive regulation. It’s a very, very important skill for product people more important than anything else when combined with problem solving. Sure, some companies like high growth startups have it worse than legacy companies with the level of ambiguity, it’s not going away, and it gets worse the way up the chain.\n\nIf I were you I’d pause to see if building your toolkit of the new role can build your confidence to then better deal with the ambiguity over time or if it only gets worse when you’d rather be on the other side of the sprint board in data or something more task oriented. Give it some time and maybe some momentum starts shifting their narrative of you.",

Another option is product ops or analytics - you stay close to product but focus more on systems, metrics, processes vs the fuzzy strategy stuff.

Your argument above essentially reads as \"I've got the newer shiny thing, but my VP is interested in things other than my shiny thing.\"\n\nI'm not likely to spend the time now to do full on career coaching but here are some things you should substantiate based on your claims above if you really want to tackle this in a positive way.\n\n* What makes you believe that your VP is underperforming? What's the bar set for VP at your company and how are they not hitting it? I suspect given they're multiple levels above you, it's unlikely you see them in the right rooms often enough to know whether they're underperforming or not.\n* Why do you believe your VP is lost? Be able to articulate what \"found\" is and why you're confident they're not there. Realistically, your VP likely sets your strategy so I'd find it odd that they're not on the strategy they defined. It's much more likely you believe they should set a new strategy and you've not yet made a case compelling enough to warrant pivoting.\n* You feel you're performing at least one level above where you are? Again, what's the bar, and how are you confident you're meeting that and also doing so relative to your peers. Maybe everyone met the bar and you met it the least?\n* How does the feedback that you're frustrated about receiving relate to the next level expectations and your leaders strategy? You may not like the feedback but that doesn't mean it's not good feedback should you want to grow or should your manager be trying to get you aligned with a strategy they believe to be better?",

I certainly wouldn’t.\n\nWhat kind of feedback does your VP give you that you think isn’t pertinent? It’s so difficult to actually understand the difference between being an IC and a senior leader if you’ve never experienced it first hand. Your scope of responsibility is so completely different.\n\nMy ICs don’t get in the weeds with me on their respective products — I do not have the capacity to maximize both my breadth and depth at this stage while also operating effectively for business objectives and outcomes.\n\nIf you are vying for a promotion, think less like an IC and abstract your product into the greater picture of your company at large.",

          "text": "Apart from all the wonderful comments shared, here is something more to consider. Don't judge your boss's skill levels or competence in the corporate world. I made this mistake in my career too. It is a punishing outcome and foolish thing to do.   \nA boss is chosen to operate at a certain level not by employees under him/her but by leaders above your boss. Even in a tightly operated and open communication culture, like say, an early stage startup, you have no idea what your founders are thinking through before choosing a set of leaders above your level.   \nA leader being incompetent, distracted or lost is your mapping of the leader's behaviors and actions to your expectations. You may be right (as I thought about myself too), but that doesn't mean you write off a leader as an underperformer.   \nThe simple reality is that for wherever your company is headed towards and whatever your company wants to do, your boss (and the hierarchy above) have mapped certain measurable outcomes and certain subjective behaviors/attitudes/communication imperatives as things that will work and are worth rewarding. They could be wrong, illogical or impossible to meet in reality (or per your judgment), but that doesn't take away the fact that you are not being promoted because you have been deemed as not ready to be promoted yet. You are not being heard because your claims and frustrations are not changing the world for your leaders.  \nSo, how do you deal with such a leadership? - You do what your boss wants you to do, exactly the way they want it done. This is advice not just coming from me, but from also coaches and advisors that you pay thousands of dollars to be trained in. Don't immediately jump ship and try to join another company. You will face the same issues and this \"feature\" of yours will never die. You will find new ways to find and complain about yet another incompetent boss. Instead, improve your presence, your communication and your awareness of the corporate world outside of things cooking in your head and your nearby teammates gossip chambers. This is a skill that takes time to develop and you need to put the effort into it. Good luck!",

That's not true, that's just performance art. Just look at how lawyers and politicians actually speak. They are firm when they are being proactive or have high conviction in their response, but that isn't always. They talk around when they are reacting and aren't quite sure.\n\nIn the long haul, people will respect you more if you are methodical and consistently prove to make good, rational choices. You won't do that if you are sacrificing your judgement for sake of responding on the spot. That's just reacting.\n\nLeaders want people who proactively improve the business. Not just order takers.

But in stakeholder reviews or cross-functional sessions, suddenly there are all these competing agendas you're trying to read in real time. Your brain goes into people-pleasing mode because you can't quickly assess what's actually important versus what just sounds urgent.\n\nThe teams that handle this well usually do two things: they prep not just their content but their boundaries beforehand (literally writing down what they will and won't commit to), and they get comfortable with pausing conversations.

Start with good product discovery, requirement documentation, and data before you even get close to the roadmap review. Try to get more touch points earlier to avoid surprising people. \n\nRun proper product inceptions that include all of the stakeholders so they understand the problem being solved. Defining what is in and out of scope is possibly the most important aspect of this. Inviting stakeholders to this process will get ahead of future conflicts. \n\nWhen disagreements inevitably arise, you will have a paper trail of decisions and data. Different teams have varying levels of dysfunction, but in most cases having hard evidence and strong processes trump feelings and off the cuff remarks. \n\nIt’s always helpful to emphasize the “iron triangle” of software development. You have quality, scope, and speed — you can only pick two. \n\nOne trick I like to do is describe different scenarios to make them imagine the future based on different choices. If an exec wants speed of delivery, it’s certainly possible, but explain what that will mean for quality and scope reduction. Similarly if they want a laundry list of requirements, explain how much longer it will take. If they want both fast delivery and wide scope, really make them feel what a low quality product will be like. \n\nSo - do your homework. Communicate early. Be able to point back to process. Be confident in the plan, but leave options for flexibility. If there are disagreements, follow up individually to understand the problem. \n\nAs others have said, don’t be afraid of saying what you don’t know. Hopefully all of your prep makes that less uncomfortable. \n\nAnd finally, if you’re a nervous person, you just need to do the reps and practice. It’s a skill",

Teams and leadership respond to clarity and decisiveness, even when the underlying answer is imperfect. I have seen strong PMs struggle because they hesitate to frame trade offs and commit, so their good analysis never lands. The flip side is overconfident PMs can move fast but create cleanup work later if they are not grounded in reality. The ones who scale best usually show calm conviction while being transparent about uncertainty. They decide, explain why, and adjust without getting defensive.",

          "text": "I had one recently at a startup. I was excited to join the company and had some domain knowledge. After two easy interviews, they gave me a take home assessment. The assessment had all the sections of a detailed PRD. Starting from background, problem statement, detailed solution, priority ranking, go to market strategy, and change management.\n\nI spent \\~8 hours on it and it still didn't come out as polished and refined as I would have liked. But I drew a line at completion and submitted it. They setup a discussion panel interview with 4 team members. On the call, they admitted they hadn't had the time to read the doc :/ After my presentation, I got a generic we are not moving forward email.\n\nI blame myself that I didn't give 100%, and that was part of the reason. I also resent the fact that I put hours learning/onboarding into an assessment, where no feedback was given at all.\n\nMy thoughts on the process: This process seems like a lot of work for a potential job, for both hiring teams and candidates. If you want to make it part of the process, then keep the evaluation criteria transparent. I don't know where I fell short. The doc (the details, the language, the structure, the product depth, etc) or presentation (collaboration, presenting ideas, getting buy in, etc)?",

They loved my presentation, but did not give me an offer. 4 months later, they shipped the exact feature I proposed, with the name, my wireframe design, and everything. It went on to receive several awards and become a leader in that little niche.... I'm still pissed about it.\n\n2.

I recently saw that they ended up using an idea of mine lol.\n\nAfter that I had an interview with a dream job. They gave me a take home that was super grueling as like the second round (after the initial hiring manger call). I had one week and I put my all into it. I covered every basis, left no stone unturned. Basically created a vision/strategy doc that mixed in with a PRD. It was basically like 40 hours of work and like 20+ pages long. I absolutely killed it. As I expected, they loved it. I then proceeded to have 5 interviews where they grilled me on it, while they asked me about other domain knowledge, work experience, etc. Passed every round. Finally made it to the final in person round with the COO. She asked me some pretty generic questions. After that got ghosted lol. Not even a follow up after 40 hours of work, 8 rounds of interviews, and getting feedback that i was the best candidate throughout the whole process.\n\nBasically all that to say that it’s an unfortunate evil.

Related to the above, companies who are looking for a unicorn and are forever unhappy with what candidates turn in (heard this for one of the companies who did 1 and then rejected my after I submitted it)\n\n3. Not only do they ask you to do work directly related to the role, but then they judge you as if you were already in the role. Had this experience too which I was pissed about. If you give someone 3-4 days to put something together, dont judge them as if they had 3-4 \\*months\\* to work on something.\n\n  \nThe only good ones I've had were where the tasks were clearly based on historical data to assess thinking (and you were given a very tight word count to meet) or where they asked more theoretical based product sense/communication/delivery oriented questions.",

Meanwhile, AI has been able to take that particular product operating model day-to-day function and compress it into a one-day affair with similar outcomes to the 3-week journey. \n\nAnother area these framework and canvas hustlers fall down on is, you don't get hired fired or promoted for filling in the boxes. You get paid and your project get sponsored because it pulls economic levers, business model and/or operational model. Any training that doesn't include that, might make your resume look good and get you past the first gatekeeper. It's not going to get you the job. \n\nAnd then there's the other extreme, the people pimping tools and techniques. Especially tools these days. The amount of cursing I do have my screen as someone who teaches and coaches product management over those who are telling people their $500 Maven course will turn them into a lean mean agent generating machine ... well, again, I really don't want to use the colorful words that come to mind when I see that tool tyranny being sold as a career solution.\n\nLike I said, after 20 years of product management, and 15 years of software engineering before that, I've spent the past three and a half years sending the damn ladder down working for Productside. So I've had conversations with the executives who sponsor individual or corporate training. I can tell you where they're willing to invest $2k or not.\n\nPoint is, take a step back and figure out where you want to be 5 years from now and 10 years from now, and find the people who have actually done that shit, we're also good at teaching that shit, and get training from them. And be warned, being a good product manager does not necessarily make you a good pedagogue.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI started an associate PM role back in October at a big tech company. My first PM role, with alot of support from senior colleagues. I honestly have no idea why they hired me, as the impostor syndrome when I started was through the roof. So far, I’ve grown in confidence and trying to develop my softer skills. I’m more of an introverted strategic thinker, but so much of the job is externalising your thought process, which I’m learning and slowly (emphasis on slowly) getting better at. It’s highly fast paced, and I’m learning to navigate all of that, but I don’t feel like I’m providing any real value to my team. I feel like an intern. I’m not sure if that’s normal 4 months into an APM role but I know other APM’s at this company who are confident, business savvy, and just exponentially more skilled already at the job.\n\nI am willing to grow, but I feel ‘slow’ if that makes sense. I guess I’m curious from more experienced PM’s, or maybe even APM’s, how you grow in this role. ",

I tell my new hires it will be 9 months before they feel like they have contributed.\n\nThis can make you feel nervous especially if (LIKE ALL FIRST TIME PMs) you feel like an imposter.\n\nMy advice would be to use this period to focus on building an understanding of your users/customers - users/customers are always at the core of what we do.\n\nDepending upon your product that might mean deeply going through all your product analytics, plowing through existing customer research, reading all your customer survey, call your customers/sales team for a chat etc\nDocument what you learn. And you’ll find that these insights are what will then help you deliver value.",

The job feels like you’re “not adding value” because early PM value is mostly preventing mistakes, not creating visible wins. Also, big tech is optimized to move slowly and safely, so you won’t feel impact fast unless you’re on a tiny, scrappy team. One actionable thing: ask your manager for a single sentence definition of “you’re doing well” for the next 60 days, then track it weekly. If you’re hitting that sentence, you’re not failing, you’re ramping.",

          "text": "As said by others, completely normal.\n\nI think it's crazy if at times you don't think \"wow, I'm not making any difference.\" Typically that means you have some humility, self awareness, you don't believe this all happens because of you, and you've tried some things that didn't workout.\n\nI was the first product hire and eventually became the Director of Product/GM for a B2B SaaS product that grew from $1m to $15m and was acquired. I would say reliably I had 1 week per month where I thought, \"wow, this place absolutely does not need me, and I am providing no material value.\" Turns out, it's always a balance. My teams swore I was essential to their survival, and the only leader they trusted. So gratifying! Then I left after 5 years, and they had no idea how they were going to survive... it wasn't plausible. And you know what, they did. In fact they are doing just as good (maybe better) since I left. \n\nAll that to say, you can both be extremely valuable and replaceable. Most importantly, everyone is replaceable. I stay grounded to that because no place ever shut down after I left, but it doesn't mean I didn't make a positive impact.\n\nSo what can you do about it?\n\nLook for gaps in your product team. Are there projects/initiatives that are important but always get bumped? Is there a certain \"man, I wish someone would finally do that\" type project that you can just take over. Even if you aren't prepared for it, making any kind of progress would be win. Common types of these I've seen are:\n\n\\- Become an expert on your customer's POV. Listen to every call, read every G2 review, feedback comments, support ticket. Talk to sales/success/support teams. Turn these disparate data points into a cohesive view of the world with highlights that could impact the strategy. Headlines like Biggest Customer's Biggest Needs, Top Complaint from Users, Biggest Unlock for XYZ Industry, High Risk High Result Opportunities. Then supported with cited user feedback, examples, customers/revenue, customers who look like those customers, etc.\n\n\\- Competitive intelligence. Put together the most basic outline of competitor segments, and listing competitors. Company, founded, company size, customer count, website, recent PR funding/acquisitions, general feature breakdown, target industries, links to walkthroughs/screenshots, and a 1-2 sentence summary of their business and how they compete with you. Rank them/bucket them. Highlight areas where you think you win vs. them, and where they beat you. These can turn into battlecards to support the sales/marketing teams, and inform future roadmaps. If you want to go real deep, then be the person who searches your company and competitors on Reddit and finds the discussions/convos then give real customer insight and summarize that meaningfully.\n\n\\- Product, sales man's best friend. Embed yourself with the sales team. Get on customer calls, product demos, and help them take notes. Document customer needs, use cases. Offer to support them by doing part of the demo, talking about exciting things on the roadmap, or answering more complex questions for them. It's easier to sell with two people, and product people can speak passionate without the pressure of a quota. Help them close more sales. Build trust with them and get the insights that they don't readily share. What do they hate demoing? What don't they understand? What questions do their customers ask that stump them? Build them notes, tools, cheat sheets, collateral, pre-recorded demos, great demo accounts, etc. that help them win more business.\n\n\\- Customer Success and renewals. Same as above, but for the success team and enterprise clients, upcoming renewals, or potential industry/target customer focuses.\n\nThose are some of the things I tried to do to add value as a PM. It didn't always show up tied to me on the scoreboard, but it helped me become the glue for how things worked. Then all of a sudden my opinion became the most critical in strategy or how to approach it because I amassed all of these perspectives from spending the time and grinding through it.\n\nOverall, just by the tone of your post, you're probably over thinking it.\n\nKeep trying hard. Have a good attitude. Ask questions. Ask how you can help. Then do it, even if it's not perfect. Get the ball rolling.",

You end up maintaining the tool more than actually using it for planning.\n\nFull disclosure: I work at Easy Agile, so take this with appropriate salt. But I've seen this pattern across a ton of enterprise roadmapping tools. They're built for massive orgs and end up being overkill for most teams. If you're in Jira already, keeping your roadmap in the same ecosystem saves you from context-switching hell. Whether that's Easy Agile Roadmaps, Jira's native stuff, or something else depends on your needs. Outside Atlassian, I've seen teams do well with ProductPlan or even just a really organised Notion setup.\n\nThe real question is whether you need all the bells and whistles that enterprise roadmapping tools offer. If you're doing quarterly planning with a few key themes, simpler is usually better. What parts of your current setup are dragging you down the most?",

Once you’ve shipped enough features and experiments, individual results blur together quickly.\n\nAt first, I thought that meant the work was ephemeral. If I couldn’t recall the exact metric movement months later, then surely the 2–4 weeks spent designing and running the test hadn’t mattered much.\n\nWhat changed was how collaborative the work became. I started talking through post-launch reflections with willow voice, organizing insights in Notion, and reviewing trends in Amplitude, often alongside designers and engineers. Seeing how design intent and technical constraints shaped outcomes made individual metrics feel less central.\n\nIn my second year as a product analyst at Robinhood, working closely with both design partners and backend engineers across 10+ experiments touching 100k+ users, judgment started to replace recall. I could tell which ideas were worth pursuing long before numbers finalized.\n\nWhat sticks is taste around tradeoffs, especially at the intersection of user experience and system constraints.\n\nSo the value of product work was never in remembering every result. It was in learning how to make better decisions with imperfect information.\n\nMakes me wonder how much product sense forms in conversations rather than dashboards.",

          "text": "I believe the effort put into experimentation is never for the experimentation per se or the result.\n\nThe point of the experiment is to get the data to make the next decision, no? Of which lead to sharing, discussion, collaboration, and alignment like you said, bringing everyone in to make decision based on empirical evidence. This I believe is the core value of a product manager instead of be the sole responsible person to make a product decision.\n\nThe effort used in designing and running the experiment is just to make sure the result is relevant. e.g. knowing the experiment fails because the initiative doesn’t perform instead of entry-point not clear leading to not enough data points. \n\nThe effort should be just enough to know that. The tooling itself can even be suboptimal or manual. I only need a feature flag with randomizing capability and tracking. That’s it. \n\nSo, I think it’s natural to forget about an experiment itself? You remember the decisions and how decisions were made instead because that’s the point.\n\nSame thing with dashboard. Heck, same thing with “data-driven”. In the end, it’s about the conversation. Good ideas don’t come from data. It comes from conversations.\n\nBut naturally conversation drifts into personal bias and believe, so the whole data-driven and hypothesis driven product development is tool, a guardrail framework for humans to be less bias, and error tolerant.  It let us know when it’s bad (and most of the time it’s bad), and allows people in a conversation to make bad decisions and come back to make a better decision based on previous result.  That’s about it. Nothing grand about it.\n\nI even made a point to founders I worked with: Look, you can disagree, ignore data, and make decision based on intuition and all, but you need to measure the outcome. An AB test is one of the most conclusive data to determine the outcome.",

I mostly work with engineering and internal teams for execution. \n\nNow, I joined another organization and in a more strategic role. Could you help me by suggesting some books for understanding PM function deeper? I am not looking for personal PM success stories but a guide. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is that most of the books currently available in the market are for B2C product management, but I am specifically looking for B2B product management. The only B2B book I found was \"Building products for the Enterprise\" \n\nTIA",
