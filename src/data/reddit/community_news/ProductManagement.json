For a lot of us, you have to really force \"the PM lifestyle\" on your company if that's what you want. This is especially the case once you get out of tech companies and into other industries. Hell, I find it preferrable to PM in an environment where I'm supporting/enabling the core business....but not actually being the core business. It gives me room to think about problems and address them properly, without also destroying my life. Companies pay handsomely for people to make it easier for them to do their core business. When someone makes $10B a year selling something, making that 10% more efficient is SUPER valuable and waaaaay easier then trying to figure out how to make their flagship product 10% more valuable/better.",

Switch to a place that uses the PM title but actually means project manager, product owner, etc. The smaller the company the more hats you have to wear and PMs (good ones) have to wear more hats than most other roles. Some companies do ask PMs to cover too much ground as a company is growing, though. If that's you, you may simply be understaffed or need to hire dedicated Product Marketing, or simply focus the company's priorities better. But guess what, that realization and advocacy for fixing it is ALSO your job. 😅 Welcome to being a leader. It can never be just a job. But you may be confusing an impossible amount of work with focusing on the work that matters.",

There was this internal conflict. \n\nIt’s hard for a PM to just be a job imo. It’s not tasked based and theres always something on the horizon.

I’m back to being an SE, same company for the last 6 years with the same pay, don’t have to grind trying to figure out the product for the next year at a new job. I can rebound from the burnout. I think I was good at the SE roles, going back to SE has been great, I can do this job in my sleep\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Just to follow up since this is getting a good amount of views for being this deep into the comments. I wish I had seen such a comment so that it didn't feel like I was taking a step back.\n\nI had been thinking about doing this move for 2+ years, but my own ego wouldn't let me tell myself that I needed to move back down into a \"sales\" role. \n\nI always hated that I was just in \"sales\". I hated that I grew up poor and I was just a community college dropout. Even though I had worked at some amazing companies, and made it to a FAANG, and quit on my own accord. \n\nI still always felt that I needed to be more than just a \"sales\" person. I always got great feed back, and constantly put on high priority projects, did the extras, and I was always one of the most technical SEs anywhere I went. \n\nOne day I just finally said it out loud to myself. \"I need to go back to being an SE.\" Which turned into thinking about the SEs I work with, and there are great one and there are bad ones. I don't look down on the good ones, so why am I thinking of this as a backwards step. \n\nI started looking at other companies, and got an offer nearly immediately. I told my current company that I was putting in my two weeks. They were shocked, and pretty much offered me anything I wanted, even got a small pay bump, and 6 month ramp up, so guaranteed OTE paid out monthly instead of quarterly. With a better upside to make even more money with hitting my quota.\n\nMoral of the story; do what you think will make you happy, you may end up getting a better outcome than you envisioned.",

If anything, engineers don't need you to be another engineer they can butt heads with, they need you to understand and chime in from the perspective of the user (and also, other microservice POs that power the data sources feeding said API).",

UXD of course designs particular interfaces, taking in input from UXR on to have the user best interact with the product. What is the product manager doing? The product manager is exercising their judgement on the 1) the scope of the product (and how it fits the market), and 2) as an interface with engineering, what the product strategy should be to meet fundamental constraints.\n\nNow of course, the truly best of us, PM, Eng, or UX, have some foundational skills in all disciplines, and can cross-functionally work as needed.

That is a communication barrier that you can't overcome by being useless in meetings and looking stuff up later.\n\n\nYou're a PM. Part of your skill set is *building* expertise when you don't have it. It sounds like the team has technical expertise, so your job becomes using it.\n\n\nI say this as a comparatively very technical PM. I build my own data pipelines, I lead architectural discussions, I've coded live customer facing apps (without ChatGPT). I've also worked with a lot of developers and in your exact scenario I would have just said \"I'm not familiar with those terms, what's the difference.\" The lead explains it to me, I sketch out that explanation against the business problem at hand (it either doesn't matter which we do or one is better than the other because x). Decision done.\n\n\nNot everyone knows everything and you are NOT a developer. You're going to know less no matter how much of a \"Technical PM\" you are unless you were formerly a developer yourself. You need to understand and own up to that while still getting the answers you do need. CI/CD, DNS, migration patterns, gateways, logging practices, data consistency, caching, data contracts, versioning... the list of things you don't know will never end, so your strategy for dealing with it has to take that into account.\n\n\nI'm not surprised you feel like the team is losing faith in you - maybe it's true. i\nIt's not the fact that you can't participate in the architectural debates (which maybe you can't... yet), but that by hiding your ignorance the team doesn't know what you do and don't know and it makes you a poor collaborator. THAT'S the problem you need to fix.\n\n\nFrankly I'd suggest doing this immediately - first, in your next meeting write whatever you don't know down. You don't need to change anything yet, just get stuff to work from. Write down what you think it is. Then set up a 1-on-1 with your lead and walk him through your understanding. \"Hey. I'm realizing a lot of this terminology is new to me, so I'm going to be doing a bit of knowledge building and being more overt in asking questions in our discussions so I can give better answers. Here's what I have so far, how close/far am I?\". Next meeting you participate in, start weaponizing your ignorance. \"These options sound fine on the technical level but I'm not following where the actual trade-off is. Is it performance? Scalability? Observability?\" Etc. Start learning and leveraging the team's expertise to explain what you don't know to you.\n\n\nHopefully you get the idea.",

What you see are features becoming less important and then prioritized again in light of the restriction. If the “but it must be in” really is that important- then it would bump above the other “must haves”. With a time restriction you have to become ruthless with scope to decide what actually is important and worth spending time on. Now with AI, the pressure to release even quicker compounds the PMs thought process because it “appears so easy to build now”, but that does not inherently make this better or usable.\n\nIf they don’t have restrictions, then scope becomes an elastic band of “just one more thing”.

Invite those people to read it over and comment where they think there are gaps or additional requirements/questions that need to be asked. \n\nIf your PM is only doing one or two collab sessions, grabbing the requirements and then going quiet until they think the PRD is complete, then they risk the idea coming out half baked; the old adage “you don’t know what you don’t know” rings true here. \n\nSo I’d say your coaching sessions need to focus around two things: \n\n1. Continuous collaboration- either in person or virtual \n\n2. Being happy to showcase work that is draft only/unrefined and get feedback early. This one can be super challenging for some as you want to be proud of what you’re doing but it doesn’t feel like that when it’s all in progress and rough around the edges. \n\nIMO, the best PRDs have a lot of edits on them and a bunch of people associated with those edits. We can’t and shouldn’t encourage working in a vacuum.",

How can the PM think of this sooner.  I get this approach. Makes sense.\n\n\nMight I offer one perspective to simply lean into this.  What if you leaned into the way they do the work?  Is it thorough and do they deliver?  Can you as their leader coach the org and stakeholders to adapt to an \"agile\" and \"continuous discovery\" way of doing things?  Some orgs do. Why not yours?\n\n\nI've been in positions where i can work with UX, thoroughly have something designed out. Write out stories to perfection (some devs love it). Devs validate, perhaps come back with a few little things but usually I've thought of everything at that point.\n\n\nI've also been in positions where i get it close enough and just throw it into a sprint and we work in through. Definitely more backend processes, new APIs and such just made it easier.  Perhaps a dev needs to really think something through or once they get into something then they learn.\n\n\nHonestly I think the later is better for software development even though I have more control over the thorough preparation process.  I think everyone thinks they want so much preparation and everything is thought out but software development feels smoother when you prepare enough, have \"enough\" thought but you simply go and move.  I find it reduces unnecessary scope and keeps the team thinking in smaller delivery.\n\n\nBut orgs hate that and want to burden you will all the bureaucracy.  But I'd consider coaching the org to embrace the faster more agile, last minute approach.  Smaller faster delivery IMO works better because it's just hard to properly think everything through until a few people can just dive into it.\n\n\nThis is what scrum is SUPPOSED to be btw but no one hardly ever does it",

A lot of what people want seems like it could already be done with Cursor (or other AI tools). \n\nI’ve even built a few tools around this myself, but I’m not sure it’s actually a common enough pain to build yet another “PM copilot”.\n\nIs this a real unmet need, or just hype catching up to what’s already possible?",

Couple that with massive AI slop coming from all fronts, it can make a PM overwhelmed.\n\nPMs + engineers could technically build this as a tool in-house, with integrations that work with apps they currently use. While I understand that some teams may lack these resources and may be willing to pay for an external solution (\"PM copilots\"), I have a feeling that this may lead to more overheads, and eventually a race to the bottom.\n\nTons of PM influencers have jumped on this bandwagon, calling it PM copilot/PM OS and generating needlessly complicated setups. This is just hype in my opinion. More often than not, it is a shill to sign up for their course on Maven, or subscribe to their newsletter on substack by generating FOMO.",

Then I realized those were costing me context and often weren't worth it, so I culled the list and landed on a relatively simple system where the backlog in Linear just linked to markdown spec files in the repo, and most of the work happened from web fetch or reading the local files.\n\nI slowly organized a structure around industry references, customer comments, interview transcripts, and backlog ideas. From there I just asked Claude Code questions and guided it to certain areas of that md structure.\n\nAs things grew, I realized that it was hard to query without sending agents on a context burning goose chase. Long story long, I realized that structured artifacts were the key: one pagers from interviews, key insights in a normalized format (with citations to original sources from the messy world), summaries of the competitive landscape with differentiation points, and even a structure for the feature specs themselves. This lends itself well to a proper tool with a database, but the interface is still ideally an agent. So now I have a set of repeatable workflows with structured outputs that store to a database that holds all the structured data. Then I prompt Claude Code to talk to it via my MCP server. Building all this took a long time, so I'm wondering if that is a useful product: a product specific artifact generation and storage platform that existing agents can read from and even trigger via MCP.\n\nWhen we're prototyping things with agents, there are often a lot of decisions to be made, and it's actually kind of handy to give the agent tools like \"query_customer_insights\" and \"find_evidence_for_assumption\".\n\nAt the end of the day I feel like my biggest problem is still \"how valuable is this thing I'm prototyping to my customers?\" and the answer to that question isn't super helpful if it's just an LLM's hot take without any way to compare more than one option.\n\nAnyone else out there feeling this one?",

If you could dump messy thoughts frequently and have them structured into whatever format your engineers or stakeholders need that changes the game more than another PRD template or “PM copilot.”\nMost of the AI-for-PM tools I’ve seen are solving the artifact problem (better docs, better specs).

Mostly what has happened is that PMs are moving away from things like PRDs and towards things like prototypes.  In some shops, PMs are expected to be able to take an idea all the way to prototype before bringing it to eng.  Smaller organizations are more aggressive, of course, but we are seeing that feature teams are getting smaller as AI allows them to ship more code faster.\n\nClaude code is one of the more popular choices but we saw Gemini, ChatGPT and others being used actively.\n\n",

I’ve been building a side project that integrates with existing SaaS stacks and provides some extra analysis/automation layers on top, but in a lot of instances even that could be building a new house on a bad foundation. Layering tools on top of other tools is rarely sustainable, but I would like to get it to where it’s an extra layer that functionally hides the bloat of the lower layers. In my testing so far, it’s been useful for some workflows, but I’m still early on it. \n\nIn terms of strategic decisions/coaching, I think I’m just generally weary of offloading any deeply human skills to AI. It’s useful for gathering, sorting, analyzing, etc, but I would still always want to get raw outputs from it and then layer in my experience/intuition/style to actually move forward with something. \n\nMy other hesitation is just that the PM function is going to look dramatically different in a year, 3yrs, etc. Our traditional inputs, workflows, and outputs are likely going to be totally different in the near future.",

It's that product context is inherently team-level, but every AI workflow today is built for an individual. Claude/Cursor/MCP setups are great for the PM who built them - but that context doesn't live anywhere the rest of the team can access or build on.\n\n\n\nSo you end up with this situation: one PM has a sophisticated Claude setup that knows the product inside out. Another PM on the same team starts fresh every conversation. An engineer wants to understand a decision from 3 weeks ago - there's no trail. A new joiner tries to get up to speed - they're reading stale Confluence docs.\n\n\n\nThe real gap isn't individual AI productivity. It's that product knowledge doesn't persist at the team level.\n\n\n\nThe teams that figure this out aren't building another copilot. They're thinking about it more like infrastructure: where does product context live, who can query it, how does it stay current when specs change or decisions get made in Slack?\n\n\n\nThat's a harder problem than PRD generation, but it's also the one worth solving. Individual AI workflows will commoditize fast. Shared, persistent product memory that the whole team can rely on - that's actually differentiated.",

It’s lack of structured gating.\n\nWhat’s interesting to me is not “PM copilots,” but tools that:\n\n* Force hypothesis clarity\n* Define measurable success criteria\n* Validate data readiness\n* Compare rule-based vs ML baselines\n* Make ROI explicit before engineering starts\n\nThat’s less about generative assistance and more about decision infrastructure.\n\nCursor can help you write a PRD.  \nIt doesn’t tell you whether the project should exist.\n\nI’m curious how many people here have seen AI/ML projects fail not because the model was bad — but because the problem wasn’t well defined or economically justified?\n\nIf that failure mode is common, then this category is real.  \nIf not, it’s probably hype.\n\nWould love to hear others’ experiences.",

I am  curious to know if it is a common occurrence (i.e. skill gap blindsiding) or that person is just one data point. For those who stayed ahead of the curve, how did you manage this upskilling with a full-time job? PM itself is an energy draining role. Any tips? suggestions? tools?\n\nUpdated (22feb): Thanks everyone for the detailed responses. I think the discussion went in the wrong direction. I was wondering if there is a way to pre-emptively figure out what is coming to make us a dinosaur. Some of us are good at spotting the market trends. Others are not. For those who are not what are the options? ",

              "text": "I actually strongly disagree here. But this is a recent shift. \n\nI think AI is changing how we work which will blur the lines between engineers, designers and PMs. \n\nI think the shift will take us from doing work to orchestrating it. \n\nIf you're saying that the core of the role is to really drive the strategy up, down and across your organisation and get the right things built the right way, then that's fair enough. \n\nBut if you are any more specific than that, then we're probably at odds. \n\nI think PMs will increasingly design and ship things. Simple front end changes won't need engineers nor designers and when we work together, we'll likely automate documentation by having meeting notes converted into project posters, specs etc. \n\nAnd even if it's just engineers pushing out more work with agents, this will change the role as the cost to deliver will decline sharply. This changes our role because so much of what we do is to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing or building the right thing the wrong way. \n\nBasically, a lot of our role is to manage investments where costs are high. But if that changes, so does our ability to return on that investment. \n\nI think we need to rethink the PM role from the ground up and if we don't, the PMs that can deliver more value will beat the old guard. \n\nThis will take some time and there will be lots of hype and snake oil before we see real changes. \n\nBut I think PM three years from now will be radically different. \n\nI might be agreeing with you more than I think, but I do think that we should feel more of a sense of urgency. \n\nI have a current goal of figuring out how I might ship a feature to prod. It will be small and I'll need to make sure it's not slop. But if agentic software development is half as good as my architects tell me, it should be doable.\n\nBut it's not about the feature. It's about figuring out what that way of working looks like.",

Whether it’s writing documentation, doing market research or writing code - AI delivers very little value wrapped in a lot of fluff and grandeur. Unfortunately, this is also exactly what shitty PM’s in big organizations do, and historically are rewarded for it - so we are looking at the machine-powered amplification of utter bullshit, now coming at us from every direction with supersonic speed.\n\nIt will become a reality simply because the decision makers are mostly clueless, and the ones depending on them value their paycheck more than true efficiency of some company they don’t own. VC investors are drooling over AI use because it kinda sounds like a market differentiator and their grandkids generated a cute cat with ChatGPT once, so they put pressure on boards. Boards are mostly lobotomized by the time they get in this position, so they are simply not qualified to estimate quality - they just hear about the end result for 10 minutes every quarter and nod. Mid-senior management doesn’t give a shit, but they like their salaries and want to hide the fact that they are a useless organizational layer for longer, so they will pressure individual contributors to use AI. Individual contributors will happily shit out hoards of AI text and documents to simulate productivity and beg for a promotion because of all this fantastic productivity. I’ve literally pip’d a tech lead for using ChatGPT for anything he wrote last year, but I guess these days it’s a virtue. \n\nHonestly, I have given up. If people collectively want to do a subpar job and waste all of this planet’s resources to write a ticket explaining how to center the company logo on the page, and then jerk each other offer about how productive and fast “they” are by putting Gemini-generated research into Claude Code prompts - be my fucking guests. Just like I pretended to agree with the bald Silicon Valley fuck writing radical books about product management without shipping a single thing in the past 20 years, I can nod along when someone claims that a Replit mock-up is comparable to a production platform",

I'd bet the internal narrative about them was \"been around forever, not adapting, maybe even resistant to new tech.\" Whether that was true or not almost doesn't matter. That was the perception, and perception is what gets you promoted or laid off.\n\nThere's a reason everyone and their mom is updating their LinkedIn headline to \"AI Native PM\" right now. Some of those ppl are genuinely learning. A lot of them just understand that the narrative matters more than the skill itself.\n\nI'm not saying don't upskill. You should. But be careful not to over-optimize on chasing the next trend and miss the meta lesson from your friend's story. What people think about you is more important to your career than what is actually true.\n\nTons of PMs keep their heads down and crush it and never get promoted. Meanwhile the PM who's always waxing poetic to leadership about their \"AI-first product vision\" but never ships a thing gets the next title bump. Why? Because it's a narrative game. You can be mad at it. You can even hate it. But you either find a way to authentically play it without selling out, or it plays you.\n\nTry this: start small. In your next 1:1, tell your boss about some side project you built with Claude Code or Cursor or whatever. Doesn't have to be fancy. But it starts to build the narrative that you're the PM who gets this stuff, and that's worth more than any course or certification.",

It turns out there is a deeper reason than that.\n\nI've been in PM for 10+ years across many industries, and I've never really had an \"aha\" moment with this job. I just.. fell into it and went with it. Each role had a nice initial phase of learning, and then the core of the job led to disengagement.\n\nCurrently evaluating whether I should quit my full time job for consulting / pivot to something more technical and less people-facing.\n\nFor PMs who are in a similar boat\n\n1. Do you think Product Management can be a genuinely rewarding career for someone on the spectrum, or does the job fundamentally require neurotypical social skills to thrive?\n2. What have you done to protect your energy and make the role sustainable?\n3. For those who've pivoted away: what did you move into, and did it help?\n\nPS - also exploring an ADHD assessment because my therapist suspects it, which would answer why my brain is always thinking in 20 different directions.

I’m also more hesitant to speak out when people disagree with me. I honestly feel like it’s not the profession for me but I’m too deep into it and not sure what else I’d do.\n\nI also have become more and more overwhelmed as I get older. Getting married, having kids, more responsibilities at work, and I have slowly become less and less functional. It’s almost like I’m getting more autistic as I age because I’m shutting down. This makes it hard to do a lot of critical thinking and learning new tech that a PM should do.\n\nI should also note that I can definitely have moments of super power. I can punch out a PRD in no time if I’m in the right mood. I am always calm and never react emotionally to anything. So there are advantages. I could also see someone if they are fixating on PM being incredible good. Unfortunately for me, my fixation is on cycling or cars not on work.",

You've started a journey of self-discovery that will change your love for the better. \n\n\n1. 100% I've worked with a number of neurodivergent product managers (autistic, audADHD and ADHD) And some of the best managers I've had were also neurodivergent.\n\n\n2. Learn what gives and takes away your energy. Now that you're diagnosed, keep working with a therapist or professional to learn the language of how your mind operates so that you can set up the ideal routines and behaviors that keep you in regulated. For example, you mentioned crashing after social interactions. It's likely that the crash is from masking to get through them. If you can learn what your masking behaviors are, you can work with a professional to replace them other behaviors that are less costly.\n\n\n3. I moved into a chief of staff/PMO role. I'm an IC but indirectly lead our org by supporting our senior leadership. There's a routine to the central planning and budget mechanisms I run, which gives me the stability I need  \n\n\nHowever, also I get the novelty of being thrown into the most random things sometimes because no one else is sure who should fix it (my flavor of ADHD loves a good crisis). My influence is in mostly one-on-one settings which helps with my social anxiety. \n\n\nPs, If you're on the spectrum, it's also highly likely you have ADHD. They are a common pair. Getting assessed will give you further language to find the tools the best fit your needs. Best of luck to you.",

But I coach a lot of neurodivergent PMs, so I'll offer what I've seen.\n\nGetting a diagnosis isn't a sign you need to quit. It's an explanation for challenges you've prob already noticed or suspected for years. You've had a 10 year PM career. You can clearly do this job. You already have been.\n\nTo put a product lens on it, the only thing this diagnosis did was put a name to the customer problem. The energy crashes, the discomfort with office politics, the disengagement cycle. Now you know what you're actually solving for.\n\nAnd that's good news. Because now you can stop trying to brute force your way through a neurotypical playbook and start building systems that work for how your brain actually operates.\n\nThe neurodivergent PMs I coach who are crushing it have all done some version of this. They protect their energy ruthlessly. Stack all stakeholder conversations into one or two blocks instead of spreading them across the week. Build in real recovery time between meeting-heavy days, not as a nice-to-have but as a non-negotiable. Lean into async written communication as a strength instead of forcing themselves into hallway politics. They stopped trying to mask through the standard PM playbook and built their own.\n\nOn the pivot, I'd push back a little. \"Less people-facing\" can be a trap because every role has people stuff eventually. The real question is whether it's the type of people work in PM that drains you, or the volume and format. Those are different problems with different solutions.\n\nDon't make a career decision until you've had time to sit with the diagnosis and figure out what's \"this job isn't right\" vs. \"I've been doing this job in a way that was never gonna work for me.\" Big difference.",

Diagnosis rates are higher because (1) people are more aware and the stigma around ADHD/ASD has lessened a bit, which means lesser barriers to getting a diagnosis; and (2) the definition of ASD has broadened\n2. The CDC estimates 1 in 31 children (aged 8) to be on the autistic spectrum. Some studies estimate ADHD prevalence to be between 3-5% of the population. (I am not talking about people who are self-diagnosed, rather people officially diagnosed by licensed professionals)\n3. There are no drugs for ASD. You may be confusing ASD with ADHD. ",

      "text": "I came across this while thinking about how we handle recurring edge-case requests in our own product.\n\nDomino's has this feature where you order to GPS coordinates instead of an address.\n\nLike a park bench or a spot on the beach. They call them Hotspots and there are a lot of them now.\n\nThis feels like the kind of request most teams see and keep saying no to because it doesn’t really fit the model. Delivery systems are usually built around validated addresses, density, and repeatable logistics. Random outdoor locations are kind of the opposite of that.\n\nBuilding something like this probably means stepping outside the optimized flow most teams spend years refining. It’s not the cleanest thing to support operationally, and it doesn’t scale the same way as the core use case.\n\nBut it does let them handle situations most delivery products aren’t designed for.\n\nIt made me think about how often “edge cases” show up like this. Not impossible, just awkward enough that they never get prioritized because they don’t match how the system is supposed to work.\n\nCurious how others think about this. Would you build for it or keep saying no?",

The thinking can be crystal clear, but unless everyone - from engineering to design to finance - are working in lock-step with said strategy, across the board...the clarity of thought is left in that confluence document, unread and unabsorbed. I've made that mistake earlier in my career and years later, understood it through the help of mentors who reminded me of how critical change management is when trying to implement strategy at scale. \n\nA strong strategy in my experience is something that is designed not just for clarity of thought but also (most importantly) *designed to spread and resonate with all teams*. That's why PMs look at companies with great product culture and nick their ideas - some of them have compressed their strategy into simple, catchy principles that make it easy to adopt (whether they understood it in the context of their own org problems is its own rabbit hole). \n\nA strategy that requires a long document to be understood does not survive contact with a large organization. A strategy document isn't successful when it's well written, it's successful when it's actually used. If it isn't memorable principles or ideas, doesn't already leverage some artifacts that teams already have and use, doesn't create simple yes/no filters or re-inforced through any sort of rituals...it dies. Even quicker death ensues if leaders aren't keen to bat for it or if it doesn't show results in a timeline they're willing to wait for.",

I recently started a new role (with my existing job), and I'm finding it tough to manage burnout, excessive meetings, and the constant demands from people on remote teams.\n\nA bit of background: My team is quite inexperienced, and only 2 out of 10 people on my team are based in the same office as me. I spend about 70% of my week in meetings, which creates two big issues:\n\n1.      It destroys my ability to focus and actually get things done because I'm constantly moving between meetings and can't give people the attention they need to get up to speed. I cannot think.\n\n2.      Since my teammates haven't been able to get up to speed (not blaming them—they're new to the company and area), things only get done when I jump in and do them myself.\n\nThe area of the business we're in is difficult and full of jargon. I've been with the company for eight years, so I know how to navigate it, but most of the others don't.\n\nI'm wondering: How do others deal with meeting fatigue and remote work fatigue in other companies?\n\nI'm a very personable, in-person kind of person—I like to explain things with whiteboards and face-to-face conversations. I really dislike this fragmented, remote world. I had eight hours of back to back Teams meeting Tuesday, and genuinely think it made me sick.\n\nAny tips or experiences that could help would be much appreciated! I miss when work was somewhat enjoyable. ",

Default meeting time is 30mins. Most things can be done in that time. Doesn’t mean you can’t have a longer one where it makes sense but helps keep the meeting focussed and productive. \n2. Every meeting has an agenda, goal or format. \n3. Every 6 months have a company wide meeting free week. This helped force a reset and remind people how to work without having a meeting. \n4. This sounds counterintuitive but having a regular fixed meeting for some things helped reduce additional meetings. \n5. Having some meetings cameras off helped with the zoom fatigue. Looking at yourself is way more exhausting than in person meetings. We made cameras optional for all tech team meetings. \n6. Slack updates - move update style meetings to slack instead where appropriate. We created channels for projects where anyone who was interested could follow along and save attending a meeting each week. Helpful if there’s a lot of projects that you want / need to stay across. \n7. Train team how to work async. For people who prefer verbally explaining or want to show and tell, get them to record a loom or a video and share it. Help team learn how to improve their communication to make meetings unnecessary or at least run better. \n8. Have a good repository of info (I like notion) that is accessible to everyone. Have everything documented in there which everyone can access helps keep everyone on the same page and can self serve info. This includes a jargon / acronyms directory.",

Creating a little friction can go a long way sometimes. \n\nFor slack we had different channels so everything stayed focussed to a specific project. And used naming conventions to keep them organised. So #project-project name. And then folks used threads to keep things organised nicely within each. So you could skim the major updates and when there was one you needed more context on you could click to the thread to see more info. We also encouraged tagging of people and never expected anyone to stay across everything unless they were tagged in it. So you could mute channels and just get notified when/if they needed your eyes or input. \n\nMeeting free was always wonderful. We had a strong remote first culture so most people were experienced working async and appreciated the extra time in their calendars to think and get stuff done. As part of each one all meeting organisers and leaders were encouraged to review all their meetings and cancel any that no longer felt necessary permanently which free’d up time. \n\nAdditionally attendance at meetings was never enforced. You could always say no if it didn’t feel like you needed to be there. And there was no pressure to say no, just an expectation that you’d decline the invite so people knew not to expect you. For important meetings these would be recorded and transcripts shared incase anyone couldn’t make it or simply preferred to just skim the transcript. \n\nA lot of this was driven top down which helped obviously, but we also had a strong culture of if you could demonstrate a better way of working, folks were always onboard to listen and try it. \n\nAt the end of the day, less meetings is generally better for everyone. Sometimes you just need to show people the impact it can have to convince them.",

To address that you have to forget about people and start with the \"work\". What is the job to do and what outcomes do you need. Once you clarify what the work is, you can define the job. Once you define the job you can work out if the people currently doing the job have the right skills. Sounds harsh, but this is a cold reality.\n\nIf you do that and discover that you have the right skills for the work, then you have to go up the chain and assess the strategy, both technical and propositional. If the strategy is causing the issue, then you have a leadership skills issue. If it's a technical issue, then you probably have a budget problem, because technical usually means some level of investment is required.\n\nGood luck",

          "text": "A few things that actually help with this, from experience:\n\n\n\nThe core problem isn't too many meetings - it's that meetings are doing the wrong job. When a team is new and context-light (your words), meetings become the primary mechanism for transferring knowledge that should live in written form. Every sync reconstructs what happened last week because it's not written down anywhere reliable. So the fix isn't necessarily fewer meetings - it's making meetings no longer necessary for people to stay informed.\n\n\n\nPractical things that reduce meeting load without abandoning the team:\n\n\n\n1. Weekly written update, 5 bullets max. What got decided, what's blocked, what changed. You write it, they read it. This alone can eliminate a 1hr sync per week because people arrive with context instead of needing to be briefed.\n\n\n\n2. Distinguish between meetings that require real-time input vs. ones that are just status. Status meetings are almost always replaceable with async. Decision meetings often aren't. If you audit your 70% of week, I'd guess a majority are status or handoff, not genuine decision-making.\n\n\n\n3. When you jump in and do things yourself, document the process after. You're carrying tribal knowledge. Every time you do the thing for someone, add one line to a doc explaining why + how. This compounds - within a few months your team gets up to speed faster because the context is accessible rather than living only in your head.\n\n\n\n4. Protect 2-3 hour focus blocks on your calendar explicitly. Not as \"busy\" - as named blocks (e.g., \"Deep Work: Roadmap\"). People will fill whatever unblocked time you have with meetings. Visible blocks communicate that your calendar isn't a free-for-all.\n\n\n\nOn the in-person vs. remote friction: what you're feeling is real. But I'd reframe it slightly - it's not that remote is inherently worse, it's that remote requires more intentional information architecture to work. The whiteboard and face-to-face conversations encode context extremely efficiently. Remote doesn't have that natural channel, so you have to build the equivalent deliberately.",

When your team sees one another in the hallway this rarely happens. \"Oh!

But if you cannot convince them, it doesn’t matter. It’s even likely that even with airtight reasoning, it still doesn’t matter. You cannot convince them otherwise if their goal is to find “who” to blame instead of “what” to solve.\n\nLet’s evaluate here, you know better than any of us, are they in the situation to understand you, or they are just looking for something to blame?\n\nNormally I’ll work with the teams to find a shared understanding of r&r.\n\nBut my gut feeling if I were you, and I’ll be looking at the worse case scenario:\n\n1. Update resume, lay out your resources and plan for the worst case.\n2. Given the job market, do my best whatever is needed to be airtight. Documents everything. Go above and beyond to add details in the requirements. Have the PRD signed even. Signature is a blame game. It is bad for a product. It slows things down massively and throws around responsibility like hot potatoes, but it can saves you.\n\nDon’t give them the bullet.

Many are fresh undergrad or MBA hires and this seems to be their first PM job.\n\nComing from fintech, I was curious what they PM. So I talked to them and although a few are building tech platforms or integrations, many are managing things like:\n- Credit card or portfolio P&L\n- Investment returns\n- Marketing (mailing) programs\n- Customer acquisition strategy\n- Financial advisor relationships\n- Even call center workforce management,\nall framed as “product\" by their organization and HR (and therefore themselves). \n\nHaving worked in the product world at the US and EU before, I haven’t really seen “product” used this broadly elsewhere, so it’s been a bit confusing why that's a thing here. Anyone noticing the same?\n\nIn addition, does anyone know what the career path is like for these PM roles? Would their \"product management\" experience and skills be recognized as actual PM assets in a different industry if they want to switch?\n\nHere's an example: https://jobs.rbc.com/ca/en/job/R-0000149608/Senior-Manager-Product-Business-Credit-Cards",

This includes the usage, risk and profitability of those cards and perhaps most importantly the rewards & benefits structure of those cards.\n\nSame thing if you go into the telco industry. They have product managers whom have similar responsibilities as the credit card PM above, but in this case for different telco plans.\n\nAs a PM with 10 years of experience, I would probably never be able to seamlessly jump into those specific roles as they are essentially different things.

Is there a *meaningful* improvement to the product? It’s unclear if there is impact.

Left to their own devices, devs (I was one and around them everyday) are terrible at maximizing their impact for multiple reasons. They tend towards activity of many types, e.g. prematurely building frameworks. AI tools may perpetuate this problem.

But that's not even the problem.\n\n\nThe problem is that the AI can make those tests and then update those tests so quickly that your relationship as the arbiter of quality becomes a single huge point of failure. You have to interpret the tests, the purpose of the test, the changes, and any other changes. But you now have to do it in a stream of continuous changes, and the AI doesn't know if the ultimate implementation is \"correct\" or not, just that it works.\n\n\nThis pattern with AI agents is a common one and it exposes a core weakness called the [reverse centaur](https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/).\n\n\nSolving that problem is kind of the definition of an SDLC problem.",

I have a Senior title, but I know I likely wouldn't meet Senior criteria for the most part in terms of yoe. At my company, we have no POs or Program Managers, so I handle everything from high-level strategy and discovery to specs, enablement comms, and analytics.\n\nA recruiter reached out about a Product Ops role with pretty good pay, but the JD overlaps heavily with what I do now. The hiring manager said their PMs own the \"Strategy/What,\" while Product Ops does \"everything else.\" This includes conducting client discovery, writing specs, managing delivery, and owning enterprise implementations and compliance.\n\nSo I'm confused, is this actually product ops? It feels to me more like a Technical PM role.

In 2 years or so, as many other entry jobs, there won't be a place for Associate PdMs, and the ones above will be very scarce\n\n* During this period, it will continue to evolve quickly, not only demanding vibe coding, but also PdDesign.\n\nSo, at some point a PdM can be a one-stop shop for all.

If multiple initiatives rely on informal heroics to get across the line, that’s usually a sign the operating model needs tightening. It might help to map responsibilities explicitly using something like a RACI and make the gaps visible rather than absorbing them silently.",
