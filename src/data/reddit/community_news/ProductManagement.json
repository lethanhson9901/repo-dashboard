      "text": "I see a lot of advice on how to prep ahead of a meeting, but not a lot of discussion on how to recover when the meeting inevitably doesn't go as planned.\n\nThe moment when you’re in the room, and...\n\nAn exec cuts you off with a dumb in the weeds unrelated question.  \nTwo stakeholders start debating each other.  \nSomeone says the timeline is impossible.  \nSuddenly, you’re managing people, not presenting.\n\nI've learned that trying to argue or defend myself usually ended badly, so here's how I adopted my strategy over time. Let me know if you have anything to add or disagree with.\n\n1. Pause the conversation. Get people to shut up and regain control for just a second.\n\nI use something like:\n\n“Hold on, let’s pause for a second.”  \n“I want to make sure I’m understanding the concern.”\n\n  \n2. I try to function like a PM and actually define the problem publicly\n\nI don't defend anything or try to explain, I just try to name the concern.\n\nSomething like:  \n  \n\"So to confirm, it sounds like the concern is related to delivery risk more than strategy risk, is that correct?\"\n\nIf it's not, I let them clarify and then try to repeat back by further defining it. Often, the most heated moments are messy because nobody’s named the problem cleanly. Once it’s stated in a sentence, the energy usually drops a notch. People relax when they feel heard.\n\n  \n3. I try to steer the conversation back in a product direction.\n\ne.g. if you say, \"thoughts?\", a meeting with fall apart.   \n  \nInstead, now that I've named the problem, I say somethin glike: \"ok, let's stay on the delivery risk for a moment.\"  \n  \n My goal here is to regain control and point the group in 1 constructive direction. People can still disagree, but at least it's within the confines of the topic (e.g. delivery risk) instead of all over the place.\n\n4. Lastly, it's on me as the PM to land the plane  \nAt some point, as the meeting get's closer to the close, I'll say:\n\n\"Here are the options I see...\"\n\nI'll then walk through options as presented in the meeting (intentionally giving credit to any stakeholders that brought them up. (e.g. As steve mentioned...\"XYZ path\"). This helps them feel like they contributed to the successful alignment.\n\nThen I'll make a hard recommendation:  \n\"Given the constraints, this is what I recommend\"\n\nAnd stop talking.\n\nThe silence feels long. Let it be long. That pause forces decisions. If you rush to fill it, the meeting drifts again.\n\nThis is the hardest part, but it works.\n\n  \nThese are usually the meetings where people have come back to me later and said that they were \"well run\"\n\nI'd love to hear you approach and if you'd add or take anything away from this.\n\n\n\n",

The more I read and The more I've experience it seems like you need to really have everybody on board before the actual alignment meeting happens. There may be many steps to getting there and it might require several different cycles of shifting governance, but this is the way to do it. Everyone should already be on board and essentially the meeting is a rubber stamp. Really seasoned product managers but also engagement managers have found ways to Ace this process. Everyone might not truly be aligned in the presessions since you can't have everybody together at the same time but you certainly have already captured all the concerns and at that point you are just triangulating and bringing the recommendation based on all the concerns. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone, having an issue at my current company and could use advice.\n\nIt is an expectation that (despite being agile) we build every single minute feature in such a way that it can handle any conceivable edge cases.  If we ever have to make modifications to a feature at any point in the future, product is blamed for “not scoping edge cases”.  However; the trade off is that every feature implementation is so complicated that none ever get complete.\n\nFor example: \n\nWe are building a widget which allows for users to send messages directly to our support.  Think help button.  Easy ask, right?\n\nWell, no.  Executive leadership is demanding that we consider the following in our design:\n\n1. Speech-to-text enscription of queries.  And apparently, this speech to text must support multi-lingual translations and have 10 different male / female voices.\n\n2. Support complex functionality like a built-in equation editor, or modification of images copy-pasted into request (re-sizing, etc)\n\n3.  Conversion of requests into JSON, in case we ever decide to send our requests to some hypothetical platform that ingests JSON.\n\n4. Email support such that any emails that got to users who might receive the request are automatically scrubbed, and then redundantly logged in our system.  This must happen automatically.\n\nAnd I could go on.  Essentially, if someone can conceive of it, it “MUST” be included in the design.  If not, then I am “painting them in a corner” for future rework.  However, this 2 week implementation is sprawling out into what they estimate would be 9-12 months, at the expense of other critical path features.  \n\nUltimately, I have veto authority but essentially everybody is telling me I’m a “moron” for not thinking about the future.  For whatever reason, they seem totally okay developing in perpetuity and never finishing any features.\n\nWhat can I do here?  This is impacting me, as I’ve lost tons of influence.  And the org has more or less told me I’d be terminated for “wasting dev time” in the case that a high profile client were ever to request any of these features in 10 years.\n\nI’m at a loss.  It’s impossible to scope any of these things.  I try to be a realist, but I lose either way.  I’m either held accountable for nothing finishing, or held accountable for any request a client may ever make in the future that we did not proactively design for. ",

That’s 60% of the battle, so that is good—as long as they actually can list most of the edge-cases that will pop-up.  \n  \nTo push back on requirements that you think that unreasonable, do three things:  \n\\- Thank the people for listing them, so that developers can plan their architecture around that need; that unexpected features are harder to get early. It’s not really a thing (software patterns wouldn’t change that much), but it will make them feel heard, whether you build what they want or not.  \n\\- Add the additional work time in your public facing plan, and frame it as a delay to the release; if you have expected sales, retention targets, etc. frame it as a corresponding business loss. Make sure to model it as you are not losing the first few early weeks of low sales, but delaying the whole calendar, so you are delaying full-speed adoption, user testing feedback, and that the sales team will have to rescind commitments they made to prospects, etc.  \n\\- Publicly regret that this is too negative framing and ask the requirements to come with a business case: how much more sales, how many more retention they expect with and without the feature. Say that you want to include that feature, but you are under pressure to deliver the most profitable option, and delays are a cost that you need to justify to either a undisclosed and invisible profitability monster, or scary big-boss. Most people see their ideas as a “must” and struggle to list paying customers whose decision will hinge on that; when they do, it’s often one client with a personal contact and a very long lit of very specific requirements: their business will pale in comparison to the wall of features they need, and the “personal relationship” will seem very unprofitable.",

Unless your product is used by people who can’t type (say, dee-sea divers), this is a non-starter.  Anyone who someone works with voice because AI is cool has a way to convert on their machine.  \nThere are plugins that do that: reach out to Eleven Labs, ask for a price, slap it at the end of suggestions, with a generous “integration” delay.   \n  \n\\> Support complex functionality like a built-in equation editor, or modification of images copy-pasted into request (re-sizing, etc)  \nI might be the only person here who actually writes down equations several dozen times a day, and… that’s not even remotely needed for us. Type LaTeX code, put it between $$, and that works for anyone who cares. Anyone who can process those now reads raw code. Personally, I think it’s nice, but I can tell that’s my very obvious bias. No one who reads equations for a living has any budget or buying power.  \n  \nIncluding images notably screenshots, that’s key (I’m tempted to defend that), but editing them? Why? Some edits like cropping and rotation, maybe but… any basic device has those embedded already. Unless you thing is embedded in a truck driving console, I have no idea how that came up.  \n  \n\\> Conversion of requests into JSON, in case we ever decide to send our requests to some hypothetical platform that ingests JSON.  \nThe emblematic example of a feature that should come in v. 1.2 after customer explicit feedback, with a structure that actually matches their requirement.

Without dismissing some of the ideas of your management as 'bad ideas', you always need to counter-weigh them against other opportunities. \n\nIf management has a (at least somewhat) shared understanding of a longterm roadmap, then the discussion about 'manager A's pet project idea' is not judgemental, like it being 'good or bad', but merely a matter of 'do we want this outcome over that outcome'.\n\nAs much as I dislike leader cult fixation with people like Steve Jobs, here is a quote, that I have used in presentations before: \"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\"\n\nSo, as for your question on losing influence: I think you cannot fight the losing battle of having to be the one to argue against each and every feature - the answer lays in a shared understanding of a broader strategy. This is easier said than done - I, too, have not managed to instill this kinda thinking into my management.",

When you say YES too much, no one believes you, and stakeholders and engineering know they can't trust you.  Most engineers I know hate building obviously dumb stuff, and will push back really hard on dumb ideas, even if you make them do them.... (If they ask for too much spec, it's because they think it's dumb; if they think it's a good idea, they will write the whole thing based on a good Post It note) People trust PM's who say No, not PM's who say Yes....\n\nIt's like reverse psychology.  Your current most important mindset is \"Yes\" and by your own admission have really delivered nothing, my most important mindset is \"No\" and I've truly delivered..... Well not a metric fuck-ton, but still, quite a lot. ;-P  \n  \n In my super long career in PM, the word \"No\" is one of my favorite arrows in my quiver and nearly the first thing I say to any idea that comes my way, but not in a grumpy way, it's more like:  \"That sounds really cool!  Sorry, let me start by saying No..... We're already going to launch X on Y date, but this sounds interesting and we can start looking in to this, maybe get some user feedback, and hopefully some analytics that can give us some sense of security that we're spending time and resources wisely.... Now let's talk more about why we would need this.... How did this idea come to you? How much value does it add, who needs it, does it get us to our north star, and can we do it later when we discover that it's necessary, delightful, or value-add in some way?  The good news is that we're not yet locked in to a solution, so we can really figure this out and I can't wait to see if it has legs!\"  or whatever.\n\nAnyway, obviously \"No\" is not forever, but people need to know that when they come to you, you're going to say \"No\", and so WHEN they come to you, they will have thought out how they will get around your \"No\" which means they will have thought through some value proposition on their own ahead of time and the level of their conviction, which is good, because you need that.  They will need to put some emotional/tactical skin in the game to put forth their ideas, and this is good.\n\nA caveat.... PMs, clients, peers, stakeholders.... They're all different.....  So this strategy is just one idea and maybe it won't work for you, but hopefully it gives you something to think about.",

Make them feel heard and seen by not dismissing their concerns or suggestions. Instead, ask questions about how they’re solving the problem with the tools they have today (read The Mom Test if you haven’t).\n\nThe question to ask: “Walk me through the last time this was a problem for you.” Real examples and story time (I love story time, also helps build rapport). This does a few things: 1) shows you’re taking them seriously, 2) helps you understand if it’s actually critical or just feels urgent, 3) you understand the current state and the problem, and now you can take the problem back to your team to solution instead of just taking their feature idea.\n\nOnce you understand the problem, protect your team from the noise. They shouldn’t be hearing ten different priorities from ten different stakeholders. That’s your job to filter and translate.\n\nGet a prioritization exercise going with the key decision makers all in the same room. Together review the strategic direction set by the company (I hope you have one).\n\nIf there IS a company strategy, this is your North Star. Ask everyone to make a list of things they think will generate incremental revenue or assist with user adoption (whatever your goals are). Each proposal needs a business case to be considered. Your objective is to have them compete with each other for priority instead of competing with you. You’re the facilitator, not the gatekeeper.\n\nUse a framework they can’t argue with—RICE, ICE, whatever. Just make it objective and make it visible. When someone asks why their thing isn’t being built, you point to the scoring everyone agreed to.\n\nIf there’s NO company strategy, maybe it’s up to you to propose one and lead through influence. Come armed with data on who your profitable users are and how you bet you can get more of them. Ideally partner with Finance or Revenue so your plan has the numbers add up in the same language your leaders are used to.\n\nBasically:\nEverything can’t be critical. If everything is critical, nothing is. Make this explicit in your prioritization sessions.\nYou’re not a project manager taking orders. You’re a product manager making strategic bets. There’s a difference.\nIf the organization is truly chaotic and won’t set priorities, that’s a red flag. Time to get people fired or get out yourself.",

That should “arm” you with proof that it’s not needed to consider all edge case, BUT the trick is not to wave in in their face but use negotiation and influencing tactics so that they actually uncover it themselves.\n\n3. Transparant USer Story Mapping: create a user story map of such a feature and break it down into releases. Show leadership your are thinking of every edge case, but just broke it down into smaller releases. You can use AI also here to help you conceive even more use cases, showing your stakeholders how thourough you are.\nThen; when you deliver initial parts of the feature, go back to step 2: show them how the feature is being used, and then you ask them: now, do we want more of these edge cases delivered, or should we move on to the next feature?\n\n4. Key stakeholder/client mapping. Who are the key stakeholders and/or clients you feel you should “always” listen to?

          "text": "This is not uncommon. I find there are two levers. \n\nThe first into talk to customers. You can also look at support tickets to find out what they are asking for help with. The goal is to get a good idea of how many queries you expect to come in (benchmarking against support tickets), how many languages, whether they want to talk on the phone, send a message or dictate via voice etc. \n\nIf you can be the expert and tell them that 97% of users use the app in English and 347 out of 412 support tickets in the last year were English, then the multilingual conversion can die. Or you find out it matters. \n\nEither way, it's validated. \n\nThe other thing is to get rough estimates. These are rough so more about relative effort. But you can prioritise if you share the effort clearly so they get a sense of what is possible in the timeframe and make the trade offs WITH you rather than pushing asks and expecting you to get the team to ship it in a few days. \n\nWhen you have both of these, the conversation goes really well. But when you don't, they worry that you don't have the right requirements and don't understand why you can't just ship the feature the business (ostensibly) needs.",

Jira is for developers no matter how hard they try to expand outside of that. PB integrates with Jira and Azure so they can do what they do best. \n\nI share specific boards in PB with stakeholders so they can focus on what they care about and it’s much friendlier to non-tech users. Their Insights feature is a game changer for collecting, storing, and taking action on customer/user feedback. I also like that I can do product work there without engineers getting too curious about ideas I’m not ready to share with them. ",

The best product visions are rooted in real customer pain, validated demand, and strategic clarity. You're not making things up. You're connecting dots others haven't connected yet and helping people see a future that solves real problems.  \n  \nThe danger in what your CPO said is the phrase \"even if the numbers don't add up or if realism gets in the way.\" That's not storytelling. That's salesmanship without substance. And it burns credibility fast.  \n  \nStrong product leaders are stubborn on vision but flexible on details. They know the difference between selling a hypothesis they believe in and selling fiction. You can have conviction about where you're headed without ignoring data or pretending problems don't exist. In fact, credibility comes from acknowledging the hard stuff and showing you've thought it through.  \n  \nSo yes, storytelling matters. But the story has to be built on something real.",

I’ve been struggling with confidence, thinking, and interviews, and I’m trying to figure out how to get unstuck.\n\nSome context:\n\nI genuinely feel like I’ve become bad at thinking. I struggle to answer basic product questions like “How would you build X?” or “How would you launch Y?” My mind just goes blank.\n\nI have pretty severe social anxiety. Even casual questions like “How was your day?” or “What’s up?” throw me off if I haven’t mentally rehearsed.\n\nHeavy impostor syndrome. Constant feeling that I don’t belong at my level.\n\nI grew from APM → Principal PM in ~4 years at the same company, so objectively I must been doing something right. But strangely, I now struggle to clearly articulate my past work or impact.\n\nI’m trying to switch companies and not getting interview calls, which has been really discouraging and honestly depressing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\nHow do I start thinking like a senior/Principal PM again instead of freezing?\n\nHow do I prepare for interviews when my brain blanks under pressure?\n\nHow do I approach the job hunt when confidence is already low?\n\nIf you’ve been here before: what actually helped?\n\nI’m open to tactical advice (frameworks, prep methods, exercises) and mindset shifts. Even hearing that others have gone through this would help.\n\nAnyone else feel like they “lost” their PM thinking at senior levels?\n\nThanks in advance",

With that CV, hiring, I would assume that you're either the top 0.0001% of PMs in the world (and I might believe it if I saw, like, MIT on your CV) or much more likely, subject to egregious title inflation. For the two Principals I manage, at least, it's openly known and openly discussed as one of the hardest and most scrutinised promo docs in the entire company and most people in the role have 15-20 years experience in tech or related industries total. It's HARD to get, and the title is very respected; no one gets it unless they get top 10% in both potential and performance that year.\n\nAs other PMs have said, Principal doesn't scale too well without significant exposure to multiple other stacks / ecosystems / verticals either.\n\nAre you at an Indian company, by any chance? I know promote-every-year title expectations are way higher there.\n\nTo be brutally honest, as a current hiring manager in this market, I think your problem for callbacks outside your mental blocks is not imposter syndrome; it's title inflation. You're a mid-level at best and I would, genuinely, think about putting yourself down as a Sr PM instead, and go for Product Manager / Sr PM roles at better companies.",

What you’re describing is not a deficit of skills or knowledge, but of mental and emotional hurdles that impact your ability to do what you otherwise could. I am going to give you some advice that you are going to want to dismiss as too obvious to be helpful, but I urge you to take a breath, put your phone down for just a second and really consider it.\n\nThe advice is this: First, get more sleep, at least eight hours per night. If you already are and still feel tired get tested for sleep apnea, especially if you know you snore. Then actually use the cpap machine they give you- it’s super effective amongst those who use it but many don’t.\n\nSecond, get more movement in your life. Substantial movement, amounting to miles of walking and substantial weight training and stretching. Commit to a step goal and hit it every day. Stretch when you get up. Lift heavy things. Do it for ninety days and then do it for ninety more. \n\nWhatever you’re going through if you do these two things your concentration will improve. You might be depressed - exercise and sleep are one of the most effective treatments. Same for adhd. Same for many many other possible causes for your disruption.\n\nGood luck!",

I highly recommend trying to get your anxiety in order to the best of your abilities. There are lots of treatments out there, from medicinal to non-medicinal. For example, if you have problems speaking during high-pressure meetings, presentations, or interviews, talk to your doctor about getting put on a beta blocker like propranolol. Doing a round of pushups prior to these high pressure settings can help reduce anxiety. Also don’t forget to take time thinking about how to answer questions. This isn’t a sign of someone not knowing something, it’s a sign of someone in control willing to put thought into their answers.

          "text": "I'll add something from a slightly different angle here. Lots of folks are saying that APM to principal in four years is probably title inflation, and they're likely right to a certain extent at least, but what I want to emphasize is that that's not strictly a bad thing, and you don't need to feel like even more of an imposter because of it. \n\nProduct management is a weird discipline, and there's basically no such thing as a standard career path into or through it. There's no default degree or training program for it, it's vastly different at a small startup than at a giant established corporation, and even in the same category every company does it differently. There's a good chance that principle at your current company isn't at all the same as principal at another one, and given your quick rise it's probably not as high-level or heavy as at many, and that's ok. As you said, that progress indicates that you were objectively doing things well, even if principal there isn't objectively the same as principal somewhere else. \n\nThe thing is, we all know that. That's part of the problem, because (as we're seeing in the comments) some hiring managers will look at the timing on your resume and assume there was inflation. But it's also helpful, because that sort of thing is common, so nobody's going to automatically assuming you're just full of shit and faking it. That means that, in this industry more than many others, you have an opportunity to show the skills you have independently from the title. (Obviously not every hiring manager is going to give you this opportunity, but honestly you don't want to work for the ones who don't, because that's not setting yourself up for success.)\n\nSo, in your job search, instead of trying to justify being at a principal level, focus on what gave you the momentum. Be open about your limited experience in one company, because people are very good at spotting generic BS if you try to pretend you could be a principal anywhere, but talk about your strengths. Did you move up fast because you are good at dabbling in any skill and can get stuff done without a lot of oversight or prompting? Was it because you're really good at teasing out customer requirements from interviews or data? Was it because you manage projects really well and so things get built more quickly and smoothly when you're at the helm? All of the above or something else entirely? Those are things that translate really well into new jobs, regardless of the official level of the new title. Not every company will prioritize those—I personally have a very wide breadth of experience across a ton of disciplines and not a huge amount of depth in most of them, which means I can often say \"yes, I can make that happen\" but less often \"yes, I know how to do that.\" So I thrive at small companies where things are somewhat less structured and there are too many hats to go around and results are more important than process, but I would have a lot of trouble getting hired at someplace like Google. I suspect you're going to be in a similar boat, at least until you have more experience on your resume. But conversely, someone with tons of experience in highly structured environments who wants a specific chain of command and advancement track and strict responsibilities would probably hate having my job and also probably wouldn't get hired here anyway. Different strengths fit in different places. \n\nIf you can reframe that stuff for yourself ahead of time, you can tailor resumes and cover letters around it, which hopefully will help you get in the door for an interview. And then hopefully because you're thinking about it differently, it will be easier to feel confident during the interview because you can spend the time talking about who you are and what you're good at, instead of trying to fit into a theoretical empty space that may or may not fit your strengths. \n\nOne last piece of advice: don't focus on the principal title right now. Another effect of everyone knowing that career progress goes at different speeds in different places is that if you go from principal back to a \"lesser\" title later, people rarely assume that's a downgrade, so you don't need to worry about how that looks on a resume. Just be prepared to explain (later, in your next job search) that you got to principal *at that company* and then continued to grow your breadth of experience at the next one (which you're hunting for now).",

Wow. I can barely remember. Nothing crazy. Hung out with friends, enjoyed some slow time. It was good. What about you?\"\n\nNote that this works even if you can't recall what you did. \n\nFor the product craft questions, just look up some answers on Google and use them as a guide. \n\nMost of these things are pretty simple.

I own new tooling that is critical to our AI efforts, but I work more on people, awareness, enablement, and general alignment than the actual product. There are amazing early career PMs in my org who are much better at the rituals and language of PM work than I am. I'm not even sure I'd pass an interview elsewhere that focuses on classical feature development routines. Companies have machinery for this, and I've been ejected from it in this role (and not mad about it).\n\n\nSeniority is about scope and impact. Scope and impact translate to leadership. Leadership is getting people seeing the same playing field and pointing the same direction. Management is about getting them moving along the path leadership aligned them to. Everything else is just scaffolding. \n\n\nSo it's not that you lose PM thinking at higher levels, it's that you're starting to solve for entirely different problems. The PM thinking is about your leadership as a product, your organization and operations as a product that serve its users (staff). You're offloading the tactical and guiding the big picture by synthesizing what is important, anticipating user behavior, and knowing where to drill down and where to save time.\n\n\nNow to your question on the job hunt. You have ~3 issues here. \n1. Getting the interview\n2. Passing the filters for boilerplate PM work\n3. Demonstrating high level PM leadership commensurate with Sr or Sr Princ. level work\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\n1. Is about having a resume that fits the expected formulas. Watch the Google video on building your resume. Use AI to interview yourself about your work and write it for you (then edit yourself, obviously). Tell it exactly what role you are aiming for. Put metrics here even if it's not product directly: \"got half of PMs in my org building specs my way and saved devs a week of meetings\" or whatever.\n\n\n2. Practice the dance. If you're asked how you'd go about building a new feature, you're expected to follow a pattern that is generic. Fine. You can use AI again for practice, and watch interview videos.\n\n\n3. Leadership is a story telling skill. So is compelling writing. PMs have to do both, daily. Work on learning the stories you can tell about yourself. Write them down. Get AI critique. Edit. Read them. Get crystal clear on your own mythology. Personally I hate the \"tell me about a time when\" questions, but you can anticipate them and have a story adjacent and ready to go that you tell over and over. \n\n\nAnd finally, know yourself. What are you exceptionally good at? Besides PM tasks, I mean. In my case, I've found I'm far better at intuitive pattern recognition and putting high level structure to ambiguity quickly than the vast majority of my peers. I see priorities and put boxes around complexity. Now that doesn't mean I'm automatically any damn good at anything I do or that I'm better than peers at my job, but it gives me a lens through which I can tell my story and demonstrate value. At work I can lean into it in the service of others and create impact through being a willing volunteer, and it adds to the stories I tell. All impact is someone else's perception of value.",

          "text": "The fact that you went from APM to Principal in four years at one company is both an incredible achievement and the likely source of your current \"thinking\" block. You have essentially spent your entire career in one \"ecosystem,\" and while you mastered that specific culture, you are now facing the gilded cage effect. You are excellent at being a principal at *your* company, but you haven't yet built the \"generalized\" muscles that work everywhere else.\n\nHere is a tactical way to reset your brain and regain your confidence:\n\n**1. Move from frameworks to first principles** The reason your mind goes blank on questions like “How would you build X?” is likely because you are trying to find the \"correct\" framework to fit the answer. At the principal level, frameworks are often a trap. Instead, start with the system logic. If someone asks how to build a global notification system, don't think about user personas, think about the data flow. How does the trigger reach the user? What breaks first? When you anchor your thinking in how things actually work (technical orchestration), the \"product\" answers start to flow naturally because they are grounded in reality, not abstract theory.\n\n**2. The \"proof of work\" interview hack** If your brain blanks under pressure during interviews, stop trying to win the \"verbal sparring\" match. Most people with social anxiety struggle with the performance aspect of interviews. You can bypass this by having proof of work. In 2026, a Principal PM who can show a live url of a functional tool or a detailed technical map they built using AI orchestration is 10x more convincing than someone who just talks well. When you have something tangible to show, the interview becomes a \"walkthrough\" of your work rather than a high-pressure interrogation.\n\n**3. Resetting the \"impostor\" narrative** You didn't get to principal in four years by accident. You likely have a high \"delivery-to-noise\" ratio. Your company kept promoting you because you solved problems. The reason you can’t articulate your impact right now is that you’re looking for \"grand strategy\" stories when your real strength is probably \"high-velocity execution.\" Document your wins as technical de-risking events. Did you save a launch? Did you identify a scaling bottleneck? Those are your stories.\n\n**4. The job hunt strategy for low confidence** If you aren't getting calls, it is usually a resume formatting issue. In the current market, \"generalist\" principal pms are being overlooked for \"technical\" pms who understand ai integration. Update your resume to highlight your experience with AI-driven product cycles and agentic workflows. Even if you haven't done it at scale, showing that you are currently building and learning in this space will trigger the algorithms and the recruiters.\n\n**What actually helps?** Start building something small and solo. When you are the one responsible for the logic, the \"PM thinking\" comes back because it has to. It forces you to get out of your head and into the build. Once you see a live url of something you created, that \"bad at thinking\" feeling usually disappears.",

There is a lot in product that come from pure experience and time, and even if you have just absolutely rocked your current role, there just hasn’t been enough time for you to encounter many of the situations that a principal would be expected to manage. \n\nI know it may be hard to hear, but you might be better served “stepping back” (not really, but just in title) in your next role so you can get the extra experience under your belt. You clearly have a lot of potential, but I think it’s going to be unlikely that you’ll really be in the running for a true principal role. With only 4 years experience at one company, even a Senior PM role is probably going to be difficult to get an interview.",

Typically I have this conversation about a year out. During the year I am aiming to get promoted, I make the items on this plan my top priorities. This helps with “doing less” to get promoted. Know your organization’s promotion cycles so you can plan well ahead. \n\nAlso, you mentioned visibility. This is a huge factor for promotions in large organizations. Take every opportunity to show off your work, especially to people outside of your team. \n\nLastly, ask around to better understand the promotion process in your organization. Ask what your colleagues did to earn their promotions. You are making some assumptions about what they are doing, but go ask them! Also tell them that you want to be promoted.

Stop being the safety net for everything and replace your \"yes\" with tradeoffs\n\nStop saying yes to random stuff. If it's not helping build your narrative or drive impact, so no with tradeoff framing.\n\nInstead of “I’ll try to fit it in,” you say,  \n“If we take this on, which initiative should slow down?”\n\nWrite down the last 10 things you handled. Circle the ones that could have been owned by someone else with clear expectations. Delegate them! The next time someone asks for something, respond with a priority tradeoff question instead of an automatic yes.\n\n  \n2. Pick the 2 highest visibility/leverage bets and let the rest be average\n\nYou can't be amazing at 10 things. Narrow your focus and drop, delegate, put in maintenance, the non visibile non high impact work.\n\nTry picking the 2 projects that would matter most in your next promo packet. Ask yourself honestly if your calendar reflects that priority. If not, fix the calendar.\n\n  \n3. Stop doing invisible work  \nA PM is basically invisible to leadership. 90% of what you do is with xfn teams that have no say in your promo. YOU have to drive your promo narrative.  \n\n\nDo this: once a week communicate at least 1 win to your boss (framed in terms of business outcomes)\n\n  \n4. Start declining meetings.   \nDo an audit and ask if this is helping or hurting your narrative and then start exiting them. \n\n\n\n5. Turn your narrative into sponsorship.\n\nPromotions are sponsor-driven. After you build the narrative, you have to deliberately align leaders around it ahead of the cycle. Most PMs skip this and hope impact speaks for itself. It doesn’t.\n\nThe mechanics of how to build sponsors and prep them is a bigger topic than fits in a comment.

They get handed one or two initiatives that are already framed as company priorities and have exec attention. If it goes well, it is automatically visible and it maps cleanly to a promo story. From the outside it looks like deliberate restraint and strategy. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is just better positioning.\n\nIf you are not getting those opportunities, you compensate. You say yes to more things, you cover more surface area, you deliver in multiple less highlighted areas so your value is undeniable. That can be real impact, but it also brands you as the reliable workhorse who keeps everything moving. Promotions tend to go to the person who is seen as driving direction, not the person who is seen as catching everything.\n\nSo when someone says “work smarter, not harder,” what they usually mean in practice is “make sure your impact is tied to a top priority and is obvious to the people who decide promos.” If your wins are spread across a bunch of smaller lanes, you can end up doing more and getting less credit.",

I'd try the following things if I were you:\n\n1. Revisit what the PM role actually is. Figure out what the expectations are for your role. It is reasonable for a product manager to be a generalist but unrealistic to ask of them to take over the roles that requires a specialist.\n\n2. There are ways of denying request or passing them on to someone better suited to do it. Saying \"I would love to do it, but I believe this is a job best suited for role A\"\n\n  \n3. Doing less should not hurt your reputation as long as you perform spectacularly on the tasks you put your hand in. You cannot be blamed for things you didn't take the responsibility for or were involved in.\n\n  \nHope it helps!",

          "text": "Here's what I do that works as well as anything I've tried:\n\n\\- Make a list of everyone who needs to be on the call\n\n\\- Call (don't text / email) everyone on the list 1:1. Tell them you're going to schedule an alignment meeting to get \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\[people\\] aligned around path forward for \\_\\_\\_\\_ topic, and that you wanted their input before the meeting. Framing it as \"soliciting feedback\" is critical - you want to make them feel special, like their opinion matters and that's why you're reaching out the THEM directly (they don't need to know you're doing the same thing for everyone else who will be on the call).\n\n\\- On each 1:1 call, introduce super high level direction / goal for whatever it is that you're trying to get alignment around - don't get into detail on whatever plan you have, or show all your cards. Then, shut up and listen. 9/10 times they'll tell you every objection they have, and what they think you should do instead. Don't debate, just ask questions and figure out why. What are their motivations? Fears? Hesitations? Do they have conflicting goals? Are they counting on resources that you need and therefore they're worried they won't get their bonus? Are they making assumptions / missing context? Etc. Etc.\n\n\\- Rinse, repeat with everyone. \\[Reminder, this is all BEFORE the alignment call\\]\n\n\\- Now you have a list of each stakeholder's motivations, objections, and fears... i.e. you know exactly what each person is going to say / react to on the call, and can adjust your plan for how to navigate the call.\n\n\\- I like to sprinkle little nuggets / anecdotes from each person throughout the deck / presentation (I use quotes / terms verbatim, so they know they were the person you got the ideas from). E.g. Jim said \"doing X is going to take resources and delay the delivery of Y!\" ... Literally add a bullet to the \"risks\" and write Jim's comment \\*exactly as he said it\\*.  E.g. 2: Suzy is advocation for you to do X thing in Y way - you were already planning on doing exactly that, and had that concept in the deck... go update the deck to use the EXACT wording Suzy used on the call...Boom! Now Suzy thinks she gave you that idea in her pre-call with you, and smirks when you get to that slide.  etc. etc.\n\n\\- \\[OPTIONAL\\] - After the 1:1, but before the alignment call, if there's anything particularly controversial that you are still going to present / talk about, call the stakeholder who disagrees. Make them feel heard, or even make them believe you agree with them, but most importantly give them a heads up that you are going to still present the thing they disagree with in the meeting for X/Y/Z reason... You can even tell them \"look, I will add your counter points to the presentation and when we get to them I will tap you in to share your opinion... but to the extent that we go the other direction that I know you don't agree with, I need your help moving things along and I want to ask that you disagree and commit.\"\n\n\\- If you do this right, you will have alignment before you walk into your alignment call...but nobody else knows that... they all think that their voice was most important in crafting the solution that you want to align everyone around. You know every objection that people are going to bring up and you've already mitigated them. You've also already gotten the strongest personalities to commit (to you) to playing ball and \"disagreeing and committing\" in the meeting.  \n\nTL;DR - Call everyone 1:1 first, hear their objections, make them feel special and heard, and then you'll walk into the alignment call already having alignment.",

If you walk into a room of leaders without knowing exactly what they are going to say, it's a much harder conversation.\n\nHere is the three-step flow to handle this:\n\n1. The real work: speak to key stakeholders before the big meeting. Show them a rough draft and ask, \"Is there anything in here that would make you say no?\" It is much easier to handle an objection in a private chat than in front of a crowd. By the time the big meeting starts, you should already have everyone's \"soft\" approval.\n2. The meeting: The actual meeting is just a formality to get everyone to say \"yes\" at the same time. Keep it specific. State the problem, present the solution you already vetted in your 1:1s, and ask if there are any final blockers. Since you already did the pre-wire, there shouldn't be any surprises.\n3. The alignment lockin: Send a recap email within an hour. Start with, \"Great meeting. Here is what we aligned on and who is owning the next steps.\" If it isn't in writing, the alignment is hard to resurrect 😂\n\nSince you are new, use the \"I'm still learning the landscape\" excuse to ask leaders for 1:1s.

      "text": "Hi all, \nI am quite struggling in my new role as a PM. Unfortunately my manager is also new and he doesn't have product background, he came from sales. I'm feeling quite stuck between stakeholders and engineering pushing different directions and even not managing transferring the requirements. \n\nTo give some context, I work at a large, established B2B company that is historically hardware-driven, but has also growing software organization. Part of our software work results in standalone products, while another part is developed for internal business units. So in many cases, hardware teams are my clients.\n\nFrom the stakeholders, a big request is to launch as quick as possible so that we are the first in the market. On the other hand architects have been spending 3 months to explore and answer some architectural questions and now they want to have another exploratory 3/6 months period. They say in this period they want to prototype so that we get feedback and we derisk architectural decisions. They don't want me to come up with a well defined scope for this period but they say we do as far as we come and they already mention 20% rework later. We made already prototypes in product management side and we already have feedback and confidence for business outcome. So I find the entire story from architects completely unacceptable but I don't know how to handle it. \n\nAnyone would be interested in mentoring me for some well defined situations like this.  There is quite some politics which I'm not ready to handle so it would be best to have some sessions with someone who is familiar to a setting like mine. \n\nThank you in advance!!\n",

As a mentor, set up booking questions like what topics or why did you choose me to help set up more context.\n- mentors be explicit about what you don’t want to help with.

A good thing to do here is to deploy incrementally. From your total scope, can you divide it into a few versions? What would be you V1? When you deploy this way, you derisk development and tend to stakeholders' expectations.\n\n\nOn engineering asking for months to prototype:\nYou'll have to persuade them into building something simpler and shape up from there. Study lean development and shape up methodology, might give you some insights.\n\n\nAnd most importantly, going through it will give you experience to handle these situations better in the future.

If they're looking to derisk architectural decisions then state what they are and the consequences if they happen. Sometimes you move ahead and accept that level of risk. This is a joint decision between stakeholders and engineering. If your clients are internal hardware teams then judge the downside risk. I would not accept loose scope. If I give you a month I expect concrete outcomes at the end of it.   \n  \n\\- Stakeholders - You generally have 3 factors when building. You have scope, resources and deadlines. If you want to push any of these then you need to compromise. Generally resources are fixed so if they want speed then you need to cut scope. Don't try and promise everything. This will almost always fail.   \n  \n\\- Communicating to engineering - You have 2 options. Escalate to engineering leadership who are normally more tied into business outcomes or make it clear that they are accountable for failing to launch lands on them.   \n   \n\\- For you - I wouldn't conflate prototypes in product management and derisking architectural decisions.

That would be framed under the hood so to speak on the architectural runway that enables the product runway that runs above and upon it. \n\nYou don't have to solve for all up front in most cases - just for now which is next 100 days and likely Year 1 after a release.",

For me it was due to context switching and being \"too available.\" Slack is very helpful and far superior to Teams, but it also can really kneecap your productivity unless you approach it in a more controlled way. I check it in the AM, at lunch, 3pm and then before I shut the laptop for the day.\n\nA few suggeestions:\n\n\\- Create scarcity. Take a day off and let everyone adjust to the feeling of you not being as responsive. I had a boss who had to coach me for months, reassuring me that it was in my best interest to ignore certain slack messages sometimes indefinitely. Once people stopped expecting me to respond right away, the urgency went down and I was able to start doing valuable work again. I take a scarcity day ever six months or so and am further reinvigorated by how much more appreciative some folks are when I do go back online.\n\n\\- Control slack before it controls you - Whatever internal messaging app you use might be getting out of control with the notifications. Maybe you can mute some channels? Never be ashamed to leave a slack channel that is doing nothing for you. It goes back to scarcity. When you show that you value your time, others will follow suit.\n\n\\- Take care of yourself - sounds like you're working a lot of hours, OP. I'll save you all the cliche shit like \"work will always be there\" and just say this... when you take time off and do things other than work, it can lead to the most productive, high output, creative and memorable of your life. Make sure you're balancing things the best you can.",

That's when you probably want to invest in product ops.\n\n\nMost of us tend to just start doing it, then it becomes our job. Change management is a big deal. Knowing the limits of your influence, figuring out change fatigue, borrowing power across the org to make things happen... You figure it out.",

Observe where people are spending time. A couple examples can be (1) Are PMs spending too much time directly with internal teams educating/teaching? Can you be the functional liaison there 50% of the time? (2) Is engineering taking many direct tickets that could be troubleshooted by support? Does support need a tool to solve this problem, or is there an information gap?\n\n2. Product Operations should be product first and operations second. Every person I've seen that struggled couldn't see the forest from the trees. They would come into every project / effort with a playbook, but they didn't want to dive into what is truly novel in that situation. Everything situation is different. Adapt fast, be flexible, fill the gaps and scale. Understand where  you should be diving deep.

Currently a Senior PM in a startup, with limited short-term salary growth and a very high-pressure environment. Planning to have my first child this or next year, but unsure about pausing my career now and the long-term consequences.\nMy current contract offers 4 months of paid parental leave and I am the main income provider at home. However, all women in my current company were let go after returning from maternity leave (around 6–7 months later), which gives me very low confidence about my future there.\nI have the option to try to land a better job first, earn more to save, but potentially lose the paid parental leave depending on the contract, or take the opportunity now and use the rights I currently have. I also feel that taking the leave after more time in the company might make me less vulnerable to a future layoff, so starting over in a new company also feels risky.\nAny advice from PM mothers? There are so many complexities in becoming a mom while trying to stay valued, financially safe, and mentally healthy, anything would help!",

If every woman at your company who took maternity leave ended up being let go 6 to 7 months later, that’s NOT a coincidence. That’s your company's BAD culture expressing itself.\n\nThere’s an old saying that \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\". Companies are the same. You don’t have to assign intent or argue whether it’s fair. You just look at repeated behavior and treat it as data.\n\nFrom a pure career risk standpoint, staying somewhere that has already shown how it handles returning mothers seems like a bigger gamble than starting fresh somewhere that hasn’t. At least in a new company, you’re evaluating a clean slate instead of walking into a pattern that already exists. That being said, the job market is tough, so this isn't an easy decision either way.\n\nI can’t speak to the emotional side of becoming a mother while managing a career. But from an organizational perspective, I’d treat this less as a motherhood timing question and more as a company quality question. The environment you’re in has already told you how they will likely respond... and that sucks... and I'm sorry.",

It was anyone coming back from parental leave.

I would NOT work for such company. But startups have all sorts of crazy so…\n\nAnyhow\nI gave birth at 28 with 5 years of XP, took a 4 month leave and went back part time for a few months (in my country it’s normal to take a 12 month paid leave by law but my circumstances were different bcs i work as a contractor). \nIt was good getting back to work, for my mental health (i love my kid to the moon and back but i also love my career and work). But my priorities did shift and only now almost 3 years later Im ready to really focus again on my work the way i did before. So just keep in mind you might want more time with your kid and you will probably not be as ready to do the extra hours or take the extra mental load, unless necessary.\nThat said, I work in a huge corp so the workload and pace are super light compared to a startup. \nIf I were in your shoes I’d look for a corp job now, stay there for 9-12 months to establish myself, and then get pregnant. By the time you go on leave you’ll probably be able to do most of your job within 4-6h a day and you will keep your energy for your kid as well. Probably you’ll get some nice benefits as well",

Many women are getting laid off/fired while pregnant right now, so it’s a risk no matter what. When you get to that point, preemptively consult an employment attorney. If that is a pattern and it happens to you — have a paper trail that shows you were not let go for cause, an employment attorney can help you navigate getting better terms from a severance package. If it’s a pattern, it’s an even better case. I was let go at 8 months pregnant, and I can’t give too many details, but I was able be home with my baby for 8 months with the terms of my severance (also the breadwinner).

Once the baby arrived though I realised I needed the time off. As much as you can only assume how things will go if you stay or find a new job, you should do the same in regards to birth/recovery/baby. Motherhood has been my hardest discovery journey so far - both physically and mentally. \nI ended up being let go after my maternity leave ended but I sadly already expected it to happen.  I can decisively say that my time management, negotiation, resource management and other skills have never been better since becoming a mother.

I ended up timing my first kid so that I could take advantage of the better benefits before they expired but then had my second when my husband school was taking us to an unknown state (previous state had great family benefits to top off company benefits with.)\n\nThat being said, neither pregnancy happened when I first started trying (first baby came just before 35) and despite the changes in our org, it’s remained a positive environment for mothers which is one of the biggest reasons I’ve stayed. If it’s at all possible to find a company that offers that kind of environment I would recommend getting out of your current company just for your own wellbeing.

For long term career prospects also, even if you get a shorter mat leave it might be worth the peace of mind of both job security and longer term career. \n\nYou can also start saving more money and see if you can self-fund a month or 2 of mat leave which would give you more options and bridge the gap with your current leave. \n\nNot exactly the same but I’m at a faang and switched teams internally right after my mat leave and even that was exhausting. A full blown job interview would be even more so and your brain is not working at 100% during or right after mat leave so that will be another hurdle. \n\nPersonally, I’d try to switch now but I’d keep the option open to stay if you get pregnant earlier and can’t find something new.",

When i try to turn those into wireframes, everything feels disconnected. The devs want something structured. The marketer wants to see user journeys. I just want one place where I can brain dump ideas and slowly turn them into real screens.\n\nThe problem is that most tools ive tried either feel too designer only or too basic. I’ll create a wireframe, but then feedback comes in like:  \n Where does the user go after this?  \n What happens if they click this?  \n How does this connect to the onboarding flow?\n\nAnd suddenly im remaking everything from scratch. What i really need is a way to visually map the idea, user flow,  wireframe, rough prototype, without switching between five tools and losing context every time. Right now it feels like my product is clear in my head, but the second i try to show it, everything becomes confusing.\n\n",

The difference between chaos and clarity is how you externalize and test assumptions early, before you commit to execution.\n\nHere’s what actually helps in practice:\n\n1) Get real about the problem  not the solution\n\nDon’t start with features. Start with questions like:\n\nWhat outcome are we trying to affect?\n\nWho feels the pain now?\n\nWhat would success look like in measurable terms?\n\nThis moves you from ideas to problems worth solving.\n\n2) Write a one-sentence hypothesis\n\nSomething like:\n\n“We believe improving X will help Y because of Z.”\n\nSimple. Testable. Keeps your focus on the why before the how.\n\nWhen teams skip this, they end up with feature laundry lists instead of a coherent goal.\n\n3) Break it into incremental experiments\n\nInstead of “build the whole thing,” plan small steps that validate assumptions:\n\nTalk to real users\n\nPrototype a slice of the journey\n\nMeasure behavior before and after\n\nIn engineering, we call this vertical slices: the smallest bit that provides usable feedback. Product people need the same mindset.\n\n4) Get shared understanding early\n\nWrite it down. Whiteboard it. Share it with others. Misalignment is usually a sign things live only in your head.\n\nOnce your assumptions are externalized, stakeholders can agree, push back, or refine  and that’s when ideas start becoming real.\n\nIn short: messy ideas become clear not by force, but by iteration, hypothesis framing, and early feedback loops, the same patterns that make high-performing engineering teams reliable.",

Without it, it will spit out general garbage. So, when I start a new project, I always start with the following prompt to ChatGPT: \n\n*\"Imagine you're a CPO at a Fortune 500 company. As a CPO, I want you to fully understand my product and help me improve it. With every new detail you learn about my product, I want you to update your context so it always stays aligned with the latest information. To get a deeper understanding, you can ask me the following questions: \"What is the product's purpose?\", \"What problem is it solving?\", \"How is it solving the problem?\", \"Who are the ICP?s and what are their personas?\", and \"What do these ICPs TRULY desire?\". \"*\n\nWhen you press Enter, it'll ask the questions above. Try to answer all of them, even if they are vague. With your answers, give Chat more information about your product by including all your attachments (note that ChatGPT supports up to 10 attachments per message), and ask it to thoroughly upgrade your answers. It looks something like this:\n\n*\"Here are my answers: 1) ... , 2) ... , etc. However, I want to really ensure my answers are concrete and align well with the product. For more context about my product, please review every attachment thoroughly. Remember to focus on even the smallest details, and enrich my answers by covering everything from what I've missed to what I can add.\"* <-- dump in your files here.\n\nIf it is more than 10 files, just send another message afterwards telling them to update the context even further.\n\nAfter this, I ask it to write a perfect MASTER prompt I can copy and paste into an AI mockup generator, and I'll paste the output into **Google Stitch** (it's free for now). Stitch will generate these amazing UIs to get started, and trust me, it becomes much easier to do the wireframes and iterations when you have some visuals to start with. \n\nHope it helps! Remember, trying it out once is so much easier than it looks :)",

Product-market fit is the name of the game and you're dealing with execs and the sales teams. \n\n\nInternal products is more chilled. Stakeholders are easier to pin down and requirements are usually clearer.  Problems here come when the senior leadership changes and the 'need' for certain products and programs evaporates. Also noone cares about successes you have here. It's a cost centre. However I find this role better for balancing a young family because there's not much travel and no urgent bs from sales you get with commercial products.",
