For the fuckwits at Google who have apparently never used their maps app to navigate walking around unfamiliar cities, that goes double.\n\nWho the fuck is this feature for?  What does the persona look like for the typical user who;\n\n* Knows the gesture exists, and;\n* Remembers it when they're having a problem they want to report, and;\n* And is willing to shake their phone like a fucking ape out in public / on a train / in a meeting when they have an issue.\n\nThis feels less like \"we implemented this pattern because user telemetry data shows that our average user is a fucking moron who shakes their phone when they're confused by it\" and more like \"these other apps do it and we need feature parity.\"",

Something doesn't work right so you \"shake it in frustration and it asks what it can do better\". \n\nI've seen successful (and very unsuccessful) implementations where embedding a responsive trigger aimed at \"frustration\" moments can delight unexpectedly, capture/route the user momentum into feedback (like a bug report) that may have otherwise been missed. \n\nI suspect it went through a curve very quickly, and is more in annoying than clever. Especially as interactions that stick around tend to go through some dynamic of sophisticated, normalized, and expected.\n\nInteractions like these can spread quickly and be great, but also dilute quickly, such as the early effectiveness of gen AI on LinkedIn or Substack, which becomes less effective (and likeable) as it permeates.\n\nHaven't thought about that for a while, thanks for that OP.",

Here are a few ways I have used it and found it very effective:\n\nA) During discovery, I added all the data that I had in the folders. These were: all the data I got from 3 competitors (I used CC for that), support tickets exported from Zendesk, user interviews, and feedback from stakeholders (sales and customer service). I then used CC for the following questions:\n\n* What are the top 3 pain points? (Top = shared the most number of times) \n* Who mentioned them (pattern by user type) \n* Direct quotes that capture the pain \n* What are the contradictions between users? \n\nAnd a lot more. It helped me to narrow down the problem.\n\nB) I created 3 skills. One each for a principal engineer, a principal designer, and the founder. Then I asked CC to challenge the first draft of our Q1 2026 OKRs (yes, we’re late) as if it were each of them.\n\nThe feedback I got before taking this to the real people was honestly incredible.\n\nLikewise, I have already found some amazing use-cases. I think the tool has definitely helped me think through my decisions and thoughts. And it's surely special, mainly because of its ability to have the context all the time.",

I’ve been placed on a PIP because, according to my org, I am accountable for dev team performance since I “own all aspects of the product”.  \n\nSome of my issues include:\n\n1. Devs flat ignore acceptance criteria, and constantly deliver features that break core areas of the application.  They always complain that “I didn’t specify that feature X could not break all other features in the app”, so how were they supposed to know?  \n\n2. Zero accountability.  Devs refuse to estimate, increment work, and are…generally unavailable.  Every solution they merge looks like they were just trying to lazily bang it out as fast as possible.\n\n3. Zero QA.  My org fired all QA to save money, and I absorbed that role.\n\n4. MIA engineering manager.  They never show up to ceremonies, don’t answer calls / emails, and nobody knows what they are working on.\n\nAll in all, this is the most poorly performing dev team I’ve ever led by a wide margin.  The org feels they have no accountability, and that it is my job to fix the process.  \n\nIn a situation like this, where do I start?  Performance management is not an option, as leadership says it is my job to “inspire them” to work harder and that firing anyone is “a failure of my leadership, and not of them”. ",

Use AI to \"ironman\" your specs - get good at prompting it to take your general specifications and make them absolutely bullet proof. DM me if you want any guidance on this.\n2. Understand the motivating factors of the devs. Are they being lazy because they're also being crushed by the organisation? For example, if one of the devs wants to develop their skills in area X, try occasionally matching tickets related to their area of interest to their queue. \n3. Consider the opposite case to what you've said above\n   1. Do the genuinely not understand your requirements (language barriers?)\n   2. Do they not know how the rest of the product works, and thus don't know what they will or won't break?\n   3. etc.... In most cases one or two bad apples in a squad is possible, but all 7 being bad is unlikely. So consider the systemic reasons why they might output work that isn't acceptable and address those things. \n4. Find an ally in your squad of engineers - find just one person and work outwards from there. Think Kotter's theory of change.\n5. Reframe QA being pushed onto you as an opportunity - depending on your stack, learn some Selenium etc. It's never been easier to write test code. And your skills as a PM will increase as you understand the tech more. \n\nNobody should have to stay in a role like the one you describe, but if you don't have a choice then the above is my best, quick advice. \n\nTo be clear, I am not excusing or saying the employer's behaviour here is acceptable. I am not endorsing it in any way, but it is a privileged position to be in to say \"move jobs\" and if OP doesn't have that opportunity, making it work as best as possible might be the only option.",

Pull the team into a call, all of them including the engineering manager, and tell them exactly what your perception of the situation is and what the consequences are likely to be if things don't turn around.\n\nThen have a really open conversation about what could change to improve things:\n\n* Do you need to be testing everything yourself to ensure ACs are met?\n* Do you need to be writing tickets differently to be easier for the devs?\n* Is there another reason why they might be missing acceptance criteria?\n* Is there a reason the EM can't attend the ceremonies? \n\nAnd so on... And so forth.\n\nTry to reset the working contract & expectations for the team by making it clear to them that they have the responsibility to do good work and you're all working together to make that happen. People don't turn up to work to do a bad job, the bad job is usually a product of some other factors which you might be able to address.\n\nI'm saying this as a person who has had to navigate these situations a lot and disengagement from engineering usually comes from a place of disempowerment, frustration and burnout.

Code quality may matter to you, but if no one is controlling it, insist at least on static code analysis (for example SonarQube) and mandatory testing (unit, regression, integration, etc.), with results documented (for example test screenshots attached to the ticket).

If the team is performing poorly as a whole, and you're letting that happen, that can definitely fall on you without that being unfair or strange.

Sometimes that is initiating and driving tough conversations with the absent engineering manager, and their manager and your manager. Sometimes it's stepping in and rolling up your sleeves. Have you been owning it? Have you been escalating and following up and escalating again?\n\nIt sucks mightily when things that are out of your control happen that lead to failure (downsizing, budget constraints, resource re-allocations and so on), but I've learned the hard way that it never, ever helps to make excuses. \"It's not my fault, it's because of X\" should always be \"It's because of X and here's what I'm doing to mitigate\" even if all you want to do is scream.\n\nThis is being downvoted, so I just want to clarify something.

I'm sorry to hear it. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a circumstance that you should be attempting to get out of. \n\nIf a product manager is responsible for Dev team performance then thing that that product manager cannot spend time on is continuous discovery. Your discovery work is the most important aspect of product management and without it you cannot deliver an outcome driven product roadmap, you cannot prioritize appropriately, you cannot weigh opportunity cost appropriately, you cannot spend the time you need deeply understanding your customers, business operations, and the market landscape in which your product is supposed to thrive. \n\nThe fact that you were put on a PIP because of a dev team's performance also indicates that your organization doesn't have a good understanding of the role of Product Manager is supposed to play in a product development organization. You are supposed to represent the business priority and the customer's needs, and you work with engineering and design to deliver solutions that meet business and customer needs. Development process is not where the business needs you spending time. If that is where they want you spending time then a Product Manager is not what they want — they're looking for a DevOps manager or a Scrum Master. \n\nAlso, it is rare for an employee to \"bounce back\" from a PIP. Performance improvement plans, regardless of how warranted they are, usually just delay the inevitable. What you have described here in detail suggest to me that you should be looking for your next opportunity. I know that sucks has a job market is tough but it's easier to find a job when you already have one. Take advantage of that.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

When the dev team says they have completed something, dont close it till you are satisfied. If they close work items, reopen them if you feel they dont meet the acceptance criteria. \n\n3. Roll out an anonymous survey to the team to understand where the team wants you to spend time with them. Spend some time analysing the responses and if those expectations align with your role, then do the needful. If not be ready with proper explaination. Then do a debriefing with the team on what action you are going to take based on the survey results. \n\n4. Set expectations with tech lead saying that not every minute detail can be called out in the acceptance criteria and they need to work with you in an iterative way to build what is best for the users. \n\n5. Ask you team to give you demos regularly. Give them feedback so that they can address them during development and not wait till the end.\n\n6.

When we decide features, we use RICE, when we decide MVP scope, we use MoSCoW etc.\n\n\n\n I would also say it depends on business goals too. If you're looking to augment specific KPIs, how will those features help. Not many features or items will increase EVERY metric, you have to teeter totter with knowing the pros and cons of each item.\n\n  \n2. If you think of your product strategy from a today POV you're only using yesterday's facts, you need to think about where you think your product will be in 3-5 years and what that domain looks like. How can we build steps to the second floor if we don't know where the second floor will be kind of thinking. \n\nThe steps can change, heck even the 2nd floor can change but the general idea is there's a second floor and you need to aim for it with specific items.\n\n  \n3. Experiment boards, run experiments that have business goals in line within your product. Example would be more subscribed users, run different pricing promos, trim the onboarding process etc\n\n  \n4. Not every problem has a solution, but every solution had a problem. Group your problems together, run problem analyses and tackle the problem at large not individually\n\n5. Problem > Idea > Data Validation > Solution > Data Validation > Build > Iterate. It's not a frame work or a model, but it's what I've used for a while in 3 platforms for 0-1s. \n\n6. Not so much a product leader, but I was a founding PM.

Leadership tends to respond more to whether they already see you as someone who owns a narrative, not just someone who executes well. How you frame problems, tradeoffs, and impact upward often carries more weight than adding another skill.\n\nGrowing those skills is still valuable, but it usually works best when it’s paired with being more intentional about how your work is understood.

If you don't have an North Star Metric then it's usually safe to aim improvements in user engagement metrics (e.g.: Monthly Active Users) or money (Revenue, Profit, Lifetime Value). This sounds simple but can be super complex if for example your company never agreed on what is the definition of an \"active user\". You can sharpen your metrics game by reading Lean Analytics by Alistair Croll.\n\n\n\n* How you define a clear product strategy that actually guides decisions\n   * Work from the abovementioned goal backwards. If you want to achieve that impact then what are the immediate steps? Organise work into milestones and make sure that at every milestone there is user recognisable value. Something that is visible for the user and measurable by metrics.\n\n\n\n* How you connect company goals to product bets in a concrete way\n   * Any product bet should impact some user or business metric. But those don't happen in a silo.\n   * Try to build a funnel. E.g.: you want to increase profit from car rentals? Profit = revenue-cost. Revenue=rented cars \\* days \\* daily price. Cost=leasing fee+insurance+maintenance.\n   * If you want to increase profit you have to make more money or spend less on the cost items. \n   * What can you build that can impact any of the components of your income or cost.\n\n\n\n* How you get better at identifying the right problems to solve, not just shipping solutions\n   * Use the above metric game to identify which one has more chance to move a number meaningfully. To find it out you can do data analysis (quantitative analysis) and ask users for their feedback (qualitative analysis)\n\n\n\n* Any frameworks, mental models, or exercises that made strategy “click” for you\n   * I practised with consultatncy job applicants on a website called PrepLounge. If you become good at Consultancy interviews, you will nail the strategy questions!\n\n\n\n* How product leaders think about strategy differently from mid-level PMs\n   * PMs think: this feature moves that metric, making us more money.\n   * Leaders think: this big bet will make us this much profit and it will cost us that much in development cost.

Or you've reached your definition of success and realised... wait... this is it?\n\nFor high achievers especially, impostor syndrome is normally the source of fuel.  \nYou work extremely hard because you feel \"not enough.\" Then the day comes when  you hit your goals, look around and ask yourself: \"Is this all there is?\"\n\nSometimes it's in your environment: I've watched people in SaaS burn out like chickens because the industry is so competitive that everyone's playing on super hard mode all of the time.  \nYou're exhausted, things barely work, successes are rare and at some point you think: \"What's the point of killing myself to make this business more money?\"\n\nThe thing is, when people ask \"what's the meaning of this?\" they're really asking \"am I good enough?\" It's an intellectualised version of the same question.  \nIf you were wildly successful at this game, would you still question if it makes sense? I don't think so.\n\n**! Understand this before you quit your job or start that business:!**\n\nThe loss of meaning is multi-factor. Some reasons are real and rational, others are circumstantial. I've seen people do a slight industry pivot and find meaning because their work suddenly helps people in a more tangible way. A few others found it by taking a break, starting a hobby, or monetising something on the side for the challenge.\n\nI've also seen people leave corporate jobs thinking entrepreneurship will save them, only to realise they just traded one type of shit for another type of shit they hate more.  \nThen they fall into a deeper crisis because, well -  they didn't like the first thing, don't like the second thing - now what???\n\nWhat worked for my case:\n\nI went on without meaning for 3-4 years, lost clients and nearly went bankrupt. Really bankrupt. Ironically, the process of making back that money gave me meaning and drive again. So did the therapy work, helping people one-on-one.\n\nBut a year before this, if you'd asked me, I would've said that I'm not cut out to be a therapist.\n\nI had to go through very structured exercises to deeply understand: What makes me feel whole?\n\nThis question is insanely difficult because when you're happy and whole you don't notice it.  \nThose moments pass directly to the subconscious, skipping your active awareness.\n\nAnytime you're thinking \"does this make me happy?\" you're not there yet.\n\nI had to ask: Who am I? What do I love doing when no one's watching? What's my default activity?\n\nFor me, the answer was in front of my eyes the whole time: using my skills and knowledge for helping people but I just couldn't see it.\n\nIt took isolation, reflection, me-time, and crucially… I had to stop worrying about finding meaning in order to find it.  \nThree or four years of intensive effort, and then one day over coffee something just clicked.\n\nMy advice if you're “in the fog” right now:\n\nDon't make big decisions while you're still in crisis.  \nIf you think running a business will make you happy, run it on the side first. If you think changing companies will help, send some resumes. If you think golf will help, play golf.  \nTry minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability.\n\nYou might not be supposed to find meaning in your corporate job either, that might just not be its purpose. I've seen people treat their 9-to-5 as the source of every problem until they lost it and realised the grass wasn't greener.\n\nThe meaning might be in front of your eyes, you just can't see it yet because you're too deep in the crisis and the pressure clouds you.\n\nGet some distance. Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.  \nIt's hard to be the driver and the observer at the same time.",

A couple of things you said really stood out and resonated:  \n1. \"Try minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability\"  \n2. \"Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.\"  \n3. \"Anytime you're thinking \"does this make me happy?\" you're not there yet\"\n\nI did do a lot of critical thinking, inflection, listened to \"Hidden Brain\" podcast to write down my inherent biases so that I could start doing 1. Doing 1 and its ebbs and flows has shown me not to quit my steady thing that gives me the most stress. Looking at the satisfaction from my partner and children about what I can do from the money made by doing the boring steady state thing does allow me to feel happy.\n\nFound a mirror in my partner and also some very critical friends. The latter did take me down more than I needed to but they are not as close to me as my partner so having some healthy self respect helped me figure out noise from signal. \n\nNumber 3 is the easiest check and love it. I have been using it for the last 2 years to avoid dipping into things that would distract and make it all worse. ",

I’ve been reflecting on something I keep running into and wanted to sanity-check my perspective with the community.\n\nIn many orgs, I see PMs who operate primarily at a very high level, focusing on vision, outcomes, and abstract requirements (e.g., “we need 600ms response times globally”) without getting deeply involved in how a feature actually works end-to-end.\n\nMeanwhile, I tend to be more hands-on and spending time with engineers, understanding system constraints, data flows, edge cases, and operational compelexity. I often feel like this leads to better product decisions, but I also notice that the more high-level, “strategic” PMs often seem to advance faster in larger organizations.\n\nSo I’m genuinely curious about a few things:\n\n* Is staying high-level actually a mark of strong product leadership, rather than a lack of product depth?\n* Where’s the healthy boundary between being strategic vs. overly tactical as a PM?\n* In your experience, does being more hands-on with technical and operational details help or hurt career progression in larger companies?\n\nI’m not trying to criticize, I’m honestly trying to understand whether I’m optimizing for the wrong dimension of the role, especially in more corporate or scaled environments.\n\nWould love to hear how others see this.",

For some organizations, what you have described as your role would be a senior business or business systems analyst position.  For others, it would be some level of Product Management.  These distinctions are also variable depending on the size of your organization.  So there is no cookie-cutter response to your questions because at one organization what you have described as a high-level, strategy PM is actually a Product Owner, and at another organization it is a senior Product Manager managing other PMs and BAs.\n\nTitles do not matter for quality of product.  What matters is that you have the correct amount of people performing the correct roles.  You must have a detail-oriented person doing the analysis to flesh out the requirements for a feature, prioritize them in the plan, etc. but by the same token you need to have a person that sees the product at a higher level within the company's overall business goals and strategy, and perhaps where there is crossover with other products, departments, etc.  Sometimes, if the company and product is small and simple enough a PM can do it all, but that is rare.\n\nWhat you do NOT want is a PM that typically functions as you say (high-level), but when bored or lacking work tries to jump into your space of detail, without full knowledge and understanding of every function, feature, etc., and rather than being a collaborative resource wants to make product detail decisions that you are more qualified to make.\n\nWhat you really need to ask yourself is what to do you want, and what is more important . . . the same analysis and prioritization process you do in work, but for your career.  So, for example, is it more important to you to move up the corporate ladder in title and pay, with the possibility of adding more overall stress or lack of enjoyment of your job?  Do you like your current job and the level of detail but feel as though you are not being valued and compensated appropriately?  What is pulling you to these questions?",

          "text": "You are touching on a classic tension between the ivory tower and the trenches. In many large organizations, being high-level is rewarded because it scales well with stakeholder management, even if the product itself suffers because no one understood the technical constraints.\n\nIs staying high-level a mark of leadership? Not necessarily. Often, it is just a survival mechanism for PMs who want to avoid being held accountable for the details. However, in deeply technical fields like cybersecurity, a PM who cannot discuss data flows or system constraints eventually loses the respect of the engineers. You become a paper pusher who promises outcomes the architecture simply cannot support.\n\nThe healthy boundary is what many now call technical orchestration. It is not about doing the engineer's job, but about understanding the \"how\" well enough to know when a requirement is a minor tweak versus a major overhaul. If you are spotting edge cases early, you are not being too tactical, you are de-risking the strategy. Strategy without technical feasibility doesn't become real that easy.\n\nDoes it hurt career progression? In a traditional corporate ladder, the storytellers often move faster because they focus on visibility. But as we move further into the era of AI-assisted development, the gap between concept and execution is shrinking. The market is shifting back toward the hands-on technical orchestrator because companies need PMs who can actually ship, not just slide-deck their way through a quarter. That requires speaking with engineers and QAs in language that they are comfortable with - and by now this would be your edge.\n\nMy advice is to stay hands-on but change your framing. Stop telling leadership you spent four hours on data flows. Tell them you identified an architectural bottleneck that would have delayed the launch by two months. Translate your technical depth into strategic risk mitigation.",

I love the strategy across many products because 1 product bores me now. I love diving into the weeds for a little bit to help support my team through tough decisions or help them learn new skills but if I’ve seen it all before and I don’t want to keep living it like Groundhog Day. I excel at big picture but it can be a challenge and I like a challenge but sometimes it gets boring too. I like to see other people succeed and celebrate them. I love being the defender of others. I also learned I don’t want to be the CPO because it’s too isolating having all your peers be stakeholders. I was head of product and wasn’t delightful for me. I have an amazing CPO who loves to dive deep too and will build new product in his spare time, sometimes I take care of people stuff so I can enable him to do cool shit, and sometimes it’s vice versa. I only work for leaders who are more skilled and more experienced than I am and then I learn new things so I don’t get bored. \n\nHaving said all that if you’re happy the don’t sweat it. If you’re not each new role comes with positives and negatives. None of these choices mark you as a good or bad product person we are all just humans with different brains and lives who sometimes require different types of stimulation to keep showing up.",

I'd survived 3 rounds of layoffs at this place but the layoff cycle really hit me hard since I'd been laid off from my previous place in early 2023 despite great performance in all my reviews. After the last official round in summer 2024 they started just silently firing people to where I'd be chatting with some stakeholder on Slack about when they'd have something ready and the next day their Slack would be deactivated. Tons of exec turnover, no clear strategy, projects that I knew would go nowhere, super slow moving, pain in the ass stakeholders always mad at me for things outside my control, manager was only interested in optics and implementing whatever framework he read that weekend...yeah. I got my annual bonus and had some vest in March I realized that I couldn't stick around, my performance had suffered and I'd lost all interest and was too burnt out to interview.\n\nI explored pivoting to a different field entirely, did a bunch of networking, went to some networking events and workshop type things, tried to find my niche. Also focused on physical and mental health, getting back into a gym routine, getting offline more. Ultimately I realized that starting from the bottom again and grinding my ass off was just not what I wanted to do at this point in my life, and it was a field that's notoriously hard to break into, so decided to look back to tech and PM. I was extremely selective though, only looked at the sector I was interested in (health tech), only looked at earlier stage startups (Series A-B), and didn't really focus on the specific product/offering because I know by now that stuff is all fungible and there's good and bad to each. Really paid attention to vibes and culture and rejected a few companies outright because my bullshit/douchebag detector went off when I talked to the founders (this happened a LOT in final stages).\n\nEnded up signing with a Series B startup and joined in December, so was off for about 7 full months living off savings. A recruiter had reached out and the company/role was different than I'd been focusing on, and it was in office more than I'd have preferred, but I kept the convo going because why not and it turned out to be a great fit. Been there about 2 months, going great so far. The switch back to a small company has definitely been invigorating, the in-office culture is a huge improvement (previous place was 1-2 days in office, but very corporate and sterile).\n\nAnyway, happy to chat more via DM. All in all I'd say it was worth it and I'm feeling much more optimistic and energized even though I'm working longer hours now than I have in a while. More than anything I'm glad I gave myself the chance to explore another field instead of always wondering \"what if,\" I got it out of my system and made a firm decision and I haven't second guessed it at all.",

My work kept me 'employed' but unpaid, so still accrued benefits and time-served and went straight back in to my old role.\n\n12 months between full time PM role, i did a short 3 month contract job, built an industry blog that was great for creating leads for work and made a small amount of beer money from sponsorships. \n\n18 months total disconnect from all work. Did 12 months not even thinking about work, then started casually looking for my next full time PM job.\n\n**Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?**\n\nNo and no. Every time I've gone back to work it's been essentially the same. Its a function of the company and your colleagues more than anything. A sabbatical won't help.\n\nStudy, sure. I've doen PM referesher course, AI/data scenience course etc. during the sabbaticals and that can help with finding a job and give you some new ideas to apply in the next job. keeps it fresh. But fundamentally, because I've stayed in very similar industries (b2b, enterprise software) PM-ing is PM-ing just the same.\n\n**Would you say it was worth it?**\n\nYes. YES. I have convinced friends to do the same and they are now sold on the sabbatical or 'mini-retirement'. I still meet people who don't get it, assume I'll get bored, or tell me I'll never find a job afterwards... But for me personally, they've all been much needed and benefited my physical and mental health no end.\n\nAnd on the job front, it gives you time to see whats out there. Something will come along.

I drove a motorcycle in the northern mountains of Vietnam via the Ha Giang Loop. It was awesome. I’ll always look back on it as the most fun I’ve had. \n\nHow it changed my relationship with work: In the US, your work is your identity. I lived in Silicon Valley where people asked “what do you do?” before “what’s your name?” traveling allowed me to decouple my identity from work because people traveling really don’t care or think it’s impressive you’re a “product manager”. People care more so about different values — where you’re from, kindness, adventure, etc. It really allowed me to tackle work with fresh eyes and the right priority/stress. \n\nRecommendation: Treat your sabbatical like you would making corporate goals— make them SMART goals. Personally, I’d make them about learning a new skill. \n\nI love my previous sabbatical, but honestly i was traveling every 4 days so there wasn’t much stability. My next sabbatical (hopefully in 5 years), im gonna make it wellness oriented and probably get certified in yoga/fitness or something. Learn a martial art like Muay Thai for a couple weeks— maybe train for a fight. Go to a tennis academy, etc.",

I'm fairly data and design savvy but the more social components I'm now realizing I struggle with particularly around articulation and communication which are critical for the role ofc.\n\nMy previous team was quite lax so I'm probably underdeveloped as a contributor that can work in ambiguity without guidance and structure and if I give up my facade of confidence and ask for help, people are concerned about my ability to deliver. Honestly, I think a task oriented job might fit me more (maybe a data analyst or data engineer? or something else?). I can do the PM job but I'm just slow I guess.\n\nIdk I'm feeling quite a bit demoralized and want to quit, but thought I'd reach out to this group of peers on what are reasonable career changes to consider. I think certain aspects of being a PM are just not rewarding to me when I reflect. Thank you all!",

Big tech PM often rewards influence, storytelling, and stakeholder management more than execution.  It's a different skill set but learnable.\n\n2. Asking for help is not the problem.  It is in how you frame it.  Lead with options or recommendations.\n\n3. A lot of data-oriented PMs feel \"slow\" in fast cultures.  But thoughtful PMs become assets later after the early perception phase.\n\n4. Before pivoting careers, consider some PM adjacent roles like product ops?\n\n5. Don't feel demoralized.  It is just a signal and one rough environment doesn't define your entire career.  I had an old boss tell me I was not really good at my job.  Months later he praised me for my performance.\n\nCould you ask your manager for 2-3 specific behaviors they expect you to show in ambiguous situations and how they will evaluate progress?",

I'm assuming you're being a little overly critical of yourself, since you were, after all, hired into the role. Your manager's concerns could just be a cultural mismatch with their leadership style.  \n\nProduct Management spans a spectrum depending on the org.  Many PM roles are much more technical and data-driven and others are much less.  What is it that drew you doing Product Management and has that changed?  I'd love to learn more about what skills and interests you have before suggesting other career paths. I'm wondering if is there just more of a cultural mismatch at your current company about what a PM does and if you can find a PM role elsewhere that fits.\n\nI wouldn't suggest you proactively quit.  You're already in the door there and getting a new job in this market is not a sure thing.  I'm assuming your manager hired you for a reason, and perhaps this feedback is their (hypocritically unclear) way of suggesting improvement.\n\nIt could be that fundamentally your soft skills need to improve.  That's a valuable life skill regardless.  Use this opportunity as a forcing function.  Fail upward, as quitting downward wont get you closer to any of your goals.",

          "text": "A lot of this resonates for me. I think two different things here to separate out is the executive presence stuff from the dealing with ambiguity, i definitely wouldn’t conflate the two. \n\nIt’s important because executive presence is almost always something that improves over time in a new role because as you drink from the firehose it’s overwhelming and you don’t feel confident in your read on things. 6 months later you have the full stack nailed down, and confidence builds naturally outward to that executive presence. Natural communicators level up significantly at this point, but introverts improve too.\n\nInability to deal with ambiguity is quite different. Sure it can be developed, but it’s more something that you either have or you don’t, it’s often how we’re wired and our emotional/cognitive regulation. It’s a very, very important skill for product people more important than anything else when combined with problem solving. Sure, some companies like high growth startups have it worse than legacy companies with the level of ambiguity, it’s not going away, and it gets worse the way up the chain.\n\nIf I were you I’d pause to see if building your toolkit of the new role can build your confidence to then better deal with the ambiguity over time or if it only gets worse when you’d rather be on the other side of the sprint board in data or something more task oriented. Give it some time and maybe some momentum starts shifting their narrative of you.",

Your argument above essentially reads as \"I've got the newer shiny thing, but my VP is interested in things other than my shiny thing.\"\n\nI'm not likely to spend the time now to do full on career coaching but here are some things you should substantiate based on your claims above if you really want to tackle this in a positive way.\n\n* What makes you believe that your VP is underperforming? What's the bar set for VP at your company and how are they not hitting it? I suspect given they're multiple levels above you, it's unlikely you see them in the right rooms often enough to know whether they're underperforming or not.\n* Why do you believe your VP is lost? Be able to articulate what \"found\" is and why you're confident they're not there. Realistically, your VP likely sets your strategy so I'd find it odd that they're not on the strategy they defined. It's much more likely you believe they should set a new strategy and you've not yet made a case compelling enough to warrant pivoting.\n* You feel you're performing at least one level above where you are? Again, what's the bar, and how are you confident you're meeting that and also doing so relative to your peers. Maybe everyone met the bar and you met it the least?\n* How does the feedback that you're frustrated about receiving relate to the next level expectations and your leaders strategy? You may not like the feedback but that doesn't mean it's not good feedback should you want to grow or should your manager be trying to get you aligned with a strategy they believe to be better?",

It’s so difficult to actually understand the difference between being an IC and a senior leader if you’ve never experienced it first hand.

          "text": "Apart from all the wonderful comments shared, here is something more to consider. Don't judge your boss's skill levels or competence in the corporate world. I made this mistake in my career too. It is a punishing outcome and foolish thing to do.   \nA boss is chosen to operate at a certain level not by employees under him/her but by leaders above your boss. Even in a tightly operated and open communication culture, like say, an early stage startup, you have no idea what your founders are thinking through before choosing a set of leaders above your level.   \nA leader being incompetent, distracted or lost is your mapping of the leader's behaviors and actions to your expectations. You may be right (as I thought about myself too), but that doesn't mean you write off a leader as an underperformer.   \nThe simple reality is that for wherever your company is headed towards and whatever your company wants to do, your boss (and the hierarchy above) have mapped certain measurable outcomes and certain subjective behaviors/attitudes/communication imperatives as things that will work and are worth rewarding. They could be wrong, illogical or impossible to meet in reality (or per your judgment), but that doesn't take away the fact that you are not being promoted because you have been deemed as not ready to be promoted yet. You are not being heard because your claims and frustrations are not changing the world for your leaders.  \nSo, how do you deal with such a leadership? - You do what your boss wants you to do, exactly the way they want it done. This is advice not just coming from me, but from also coaches and advisors that you pay thousands of dollars to be trained in. Don't immediately jump ship and try to join another company. You will face the same issues and this \"feature\" of yours will never die. You will find new ways to find and complain about yet another incompetent boss. Instead, improve your presence, your communication and your awareness of the corporate world outside of things cooking in your head and your nearby teammates gossip chambers. This is a skill that takes time to develop and you need to put the effort into it. Good luck!",

I struggle to answer basic product questions like “How would you build X?” or “How would you launch Y?” My mind just goes blank.\n\nI have pretty severe social anxiety. Even casual questions like “How was your day?” or “What’s up?” throw me off if I haven’t mentally rehearsed.\n\nHeavy impostor syndrome. Constant feeling that I don’t belong at my level.\n\nI grew from APM → Principal PM in ~4 years at the same company, so objectively I must been doing something right. But strangely, I now struggle to clearly articulate my past work or impact.\n\nI’m trying to switch companies and not getting interview calls, which has been really discouraging and honestly depressing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out:\n\nHow do I start thinking like a senior/Principal PM again instead of freezing?\n\nHow do I prepare for interviews when my brain blanks under pressure?\n\nHow do I approach the job hunt when confidence is already low?\n\nIf you’ve been here before: what actually helped?\n\nI’m open to tactical advice (frameworks, prep methods, exercises) and mindset shifts.

With that CV, hiring, I would assume that you're either the top 0.0001% of PMs in the world (and I might believe it if I saw, like, MIT on your CV) or much more likely, subject to egregious title inflation. For the two Principals I manage, at least, it's openly known and openly discussed as one of the hardest and most scrutinised promo docs in the entire company and most people in the role have 15-20 years experience in tech or related industries total. It's HARD to get, and the title is very respected; no one gets it unless they get top 10% in both potential and performance that year.\n\nAs other PMs have said, Principal doesn't scale too well without significant exposure to multiple other stacks / ecosystems / verticals either.\n\nAre you at an Indian company, by any chance? I know promote-every-year title expectations are way higher there.\n\nTo be brutally honest, as a current hiring manager in this market, I think your problem for callbacks outside your mental blocks is not imposter syndrome; it's title inflation. You're a mid-level at best and I would, genuinely, think about putting yourself down as a Sr PM instead, and go for Product Manager / Sr PM roles at better companies.",

If you already are and still feel tired get tested for sleep apnea, especially if you know you snore. Then actually use the cpap machine they give you- it’s super effective amongst those who use it but many don’t.\n\nSecond, get more movement in your life. Substantial movement, amounting to miles of walking and substantial weight training and stretching. Commit to a step goal and hit it every day. Stretch when you get up. Lift heavy things. Do it for ninety days and then do it for ninety more. \n\nWhatever you’re going through if you do these two things your concentration will improve. You might be depressed - exercise and sleep are one of the most effective treatments. Same for adhd. Same for many many other possible causes for your disruption.\n\nGood luck!",

Doing a round of pushups prior to these high pressure settings can help reduce anxiety. Also don’t forget to take time thinking about how to answer questions.

          "text": "I'll add something from a slightly different angle here. Lots of folks are saying that APM to principal in four years is probably title inflation, and they're likely right to a certain extent at least, but what I want to emphasize is that that's not strictly a bad thing, and you don't need to feel like even more of an imposter because of it. \n\nProduct management is a weird discipline, and there's basically no such thing as a standard career path into or through it. There's no default degree or training program for it, it's vastly different at a small startup than at a giant established corporation, and even in the same category every company does it differently. There's a good chance that principle at your current company isn't at all the same as principal at another one, and given your quick rise it's probably not as high-level or heavy as at many, and that's ok. As you said, that progress indicates that you were objectively doing things well, even if principal there isn't objectively the same as principal somewhere else. \n\nThe thing is, we all know that. That's part of the problem, because (as we're seeing in the comments) some hiring managers will look at the timing on your resume and assume there was inflation. But it's also helpful, because that sort of thing is common, so nobody's going to automatically assuming you're just full of shit and faking it. That means that, in this industry more than many others, you have an opportunity to show the skills you have independently from the title. (Obviously not every hiring manager is going to give you this opportunity, but honestly you don't want to work for the ones who don't, because that's not setting yourself up for success.)\n\nSo, in your job search, instead of trying to justify being at a principal level, focus on what gave you the momentum. Be open about your limited experience in one company, because people are very good at spotting generic BS if you try to pretend you could be a principal anywhere, but talk about your strengths. Did you move up fast because you are good at dabbling in any skill and can get stuff done without a lot of oversight or prompting? Was it because you're really good at teasing out customer requirements from interviews or data? Was it because you manage projects really well and so things get built more quickly and smoothly when you're at the helm? All of the above or something else entirely? Those are things that translate really well into new jobs, regardless of the official level of the new title. Not every company will prioritize those—I personally have a very wide breadth of experience across a ton of disciplines and not a huge amount of depth in most of them, which means I can often say \"yes, I can make that happen\" but less often \"yes, I know how to do that.\" So I thrive at small companies where things are somewhat less structured and there are too many hats to go around and results are more important than process, but I would have a lot of trouble getting hired at someplace like Google. I suspect you're going to be in a similar boat, at least until you have more experience on your resume. But conversely, someone with tons of experience in highly structured environments who wants a specific chain of command and advancement track and strict responsibilities would probably hate having my job and also probably wouldn't get hired here anyway. Different strengths fit in different places. \n\nIf you can reframe that stuff for yourself ahead of time, you can tailor resumes and cover letters around it, which hopefully will help you get in the door for an interview. And then hopefully because you're thinking about it differently, it will be easier to feel confident during the interview because you can spend the time talking about who you are and what you're good at, instead of trying to fit into a theoretical empty space that may or may not fit your strengths. \n\nOne last piece of advice: don't focus on the principal title right now. Another effect of everyone knowing that career progress goes at different speeds in different places is that if you go from principal back to a \"lesser\" title later, people rarely assume that's a downgrade, so you don't need to worry about how that looks on a resume. Just be prepared to explain (later, in your next job search) that you got to principal *at that company* and then continued to grow your breadth of experience at the next one (which you're hunting for now).",

          "text": "The fact that you went from APM to Principal in four years at one company is both an incredible achievement and the likely source of your current \"thinking\" block. You have essentially spent your entire career in one \"ecosystem,\" and while you mastered that specific culture, you are now facing the gilded cage effect. You are excellent at being a principal at *your* company, but you haven't yet built the \"generalized\" muscles that work everywhere else.\n\nHere is a tactical way to reset your brain and regain your confidence:\n\n**1. Move from frameworks to first principles** The reason your mind goes blank on questions like “How would you build X?” is likely because you are trying to find the \"correct\" framework to fit the answer. At the principal level, frameworks are often a trap. Instead, start with the system logic. If someone asks how to build a global notification system, don't think about user personas, think about the data flow. How does the trigger reach the user? What breaks first? When you anchor your thinking in how things actually work (technical orchestration), the \"product\" answers start to flow naturally because they are grounded in reality, not abstract theory.\n\n**2. The \"proof of work\" interview hack** If your brain blanks under pressure during interviews, stop trying to win the \"verbal sparring\" match. Most people with social anxiety struggle with the performance aspect of interviews. You can bypass this by having proof of work. In 2026, a Principal PM who can show a live url of a functional tool or a detailed technical map they built using AI orchestration is 10x more convincing than someone who just talks well. When you have something tangible to show, the interview becomes a \"walkthrough\" of your work rather than a high-pressure interrogation.\n\n**3. Resetting the \"impostor\" narrative** You didn't get to principal in four years by accident. You likely have a high \"delivery-to-noise\" ratio. Your company kept promoting you because you solved problems. The reason you can’t articulate your impact right now is that you’re looking for \"grand strategy\" stories when your real strength is probably \"high-velocity execution.\" Document your wins as technical de-risking events. Did you save a launch? Did you identify a scaling bottleneck? Those are your stories.\n\n**4. The job hunt strategy for low confidence** If you aren't getting calls, it is usually a resume formatting issue. In the current market, \"generalist\" principal pms are being overlooked for \"technical\" pms who understand ai integration. Update your resume to highlight your experience with AI-driven product cycles and agentic workflows. Even if you haven't done it at scale, showing that you are currently building and learning in this space will trigger the algorithms and the recruiters.\n\n**What actually helps?** Start building something small and solo. When you are the one responsible for the logic, the \"PM thinking\" comes back because it has to. It forces you to get out of your head and into the build. Once you see a live url of something you created, that \"bad at thinking\" feeling usually disappears.",

Start with whatever your last annual salary was, plus any expenses related to benefits that will now come out of your pocket . . . for burning through over the next year to get your first client.\n\nIf you are talking about moving to a consulting firm in the role of PM, that's different, and I would tell you that if you enjoy your current job do not leave it for the lure of consulting without understanding the cons.  There are definitely pros, but the cons can be brutal. \n\nResource and budget constraints are an issue no matter where you are, but there is a layer of this in consulting that makes it worse.  When you work for a consultant and are an ethical PM you form a relationship with your client in which you act as a steward of quality and their best interest.  This may be in direct opposition to the Sales and C-Suite of your consulting firm who care almost exclusively about the bottom line of the company, in which case they will put the added pressure on you to get what you can out of the relationship . . . which, if you are ethical, will make you vomit in your mouth.\n\nThe other con is that consultants are always chasing the next gig, juggling clients in order to bridge project gaps, while simultaneously dealing with the same problems of resource and budget issues.  Of course, this is amplified in boutique firms, but while you may have more stability at a big consulting firm, the climate and financial stability can change on a dime, if they lose a big client.\n\nHaving worked for a large-scale corporation that built and sold their own IT products, having worked at a mid-size firm in which we built our own internal IT products, and having worked at a boutique consulting firm, had I to pick again, the last place I would go would be the consulting route.",

          "text": "As said by others, completely normal.\n\nI think it's crazy if at times you don't think \"wow, I'm not making any difference.\" Typically that means you have some humility, self awareness, you don't believe this all happens because of you, and you've tried some things that didn't workout.\n\nI was the first product hire and eventually became the Director of Product/GM for a B2B SaaS product that grew from $1m to $15m and was acquired. I would say reliably I had 1 week per month where I thought, \"wow, this place absolutely does not need me, and I am providing no material value.\" Turns out, it's always a balance. My teams swore I was essential to their survival, and the only leader they trusted. So gratifying! Then I left after 5 years, and they had no idea how they were going to survive... it wasn't plausible. And you know what, they did. In fact they are doing just as good (maybe better) since I left. \n\nAll that to say, you can both be extremely valuable and replaceable. Most importantly, everyone is replaceable. I stay grounded to that because no place ever shut down after I left, but it doesn't mean I didn't make a positive impact.\n\nSo what can you do about it?\n\nLook for gaps in your product team. Are there projects/initiatives that are important but always get bumped? Is there a certain \"man, I wish someone would finally do that\" type project that you can just take over. Even if you aren't prepared for it, making any kind of progress would be win. Common types of these I've seen are:\n\n\\- Become an expert on your customer's POV. Listen to every call, read every G2 review, feedback comments, support ticket. Talk to sales/success/support teams. Turn these disparate data points into a cohesive view of the world with highlights that could impact the strategy. Headlines like Biggest Customer's Biggest Needs, Top Complaint from Users, Biggest Unlock for XYZ Industry, High Risk High Result Opportunities. Then supported with cited user feedback, examples, customers/revenue, customers who look like those customers, etc.\n\n\\- Competitive intelligence. Put together the most basic outline of competitor segments, and listing competitors. Company, founded, company size, customer count, website, recent PR funding/acquisitions, general feature breakdown, target industries, links to walkthroughs/screenshots, and a 1-2 sentence summary of their business and how they compete with you. Rank them/bucket them. Highlight areas where you think you win vs. them, and where they beat you. These can turn into battlecards to support the sales/marketing teams, and inform future roadmaps. If you want to go real deep, then be the person who searches your company and competitors on Reddit and finds the discussions/convos then give real customer insight and summarize that meaningfully.\n\n\\- Product, sales man's best friend. Embed yourself with the sales team. Get on customer calls, product demos, and help them take notes. Document customer needs, use cases. Offer to support them by doing part of the demo, talking about exciting things on the roadmap, or answering more complex questions for them. It's easier to sell with two people, and product people can speak passionate without the pressure of a quota. Help them close more sales. Build trust with them and get the insights that they don't readily share. What do they hate demoing? What don't they understand? What questions do their customers ask that stump them? Build them notes, tools, cheat sheets, collateral, pre-recorded demos, great demo accounts, etc. that help them win more business.\n\n\\- Customer Success and renewals. Same as above, but for the success team and enterprise clients, upcoming renewals, or potential industry/target customer focuses.\n\nThose are some of the things I tried to do to add value as a PM. It didn't always show up tied to me on the scoreboard, but it helped me become the glue for how things worked. Then all of a sudden my opinion became the most critical in strategy or how to approach it because I amassed all of these perspectives from spending the time and grinding through it.\n\nOverall, just by the tone of your post, you're probably over thinking it.\n\nKeep trying hard. Have a good attitude. Ask questions. Ask how you can help. Then do it, even if it's not perfect. Get the ball rolling.",

I kinda \"lucked into\" that insight but it turned out to be incredibly valuable so I kept doing it, and now I do it even more. You can never have enough user feedback and trying to take the feedback to gather insight is a fun and useful skill\n\n\\- not sure what kinda company or industry this is in, but the best pms are incredibly knowledgeable in the service they're providing - aka it's hard to be a rockstar PM at coinbase if you have no deep insights into crypto (how the tech works, who the big players are, what the trending stories are..) because at the end of the day, you want to be valued based on your opinion of where things go in the next 1-3 years \n\ngood luck friend!",

You have been hired because you stood out among other applicants and those who hired you have seen some value in you. \n\nIf this feeling is because of your lack of familiarity with the product or how it works, that is nothing to be ashamed of. Just spend more time with the tech lead or architect. Have an open 1x1 convo woth them and say 'you are new to the game and would like to learn from them. Say that you will be relying on their opinion a lot to begin with'. This also establishes trust and make them feel valued. Dont hesitate to ask their opinion, ask questions. \n\nWithin a few months you will be able to get upto speed. \n\nRemember this is cyclic. No one would remain a PM for the same product their entire life. They will move on in a couple of years or so.

That urge to add \"just one more B2B feature\" is usually just a defense mechanism to delay the pain of finding out if people actually want what you are building.\n\nThe community-led approach you mentioned is actually the most reliable forcing function I have seen work. Transitioning from \"solo tinkering\" to a \"pressure cooker\" environment changes everything. When you have a small group of beta testers expecting a weekly update, the fear of launching is replaced by the fear of letting your users down. It forces you to prioritize the core logic over the \"nice-to-have\" stuff.\n\nMy current hack for validation is the \"Live URL\" test. I stopped building full-stack MVPs behind closed doors. Now, I use tools like Cursor and v0 to ship a functional, single-feature tool. If I can't get 10 strangers to click that link and get value out of the core logic immediately, I don't spend another minute on it. Real-world pressure is the only thing that kills \"tinkering mode.\"\n\nI have seen this work exceptionally well in cohort-based setups. Having a group of peers who are also shipping at the same time provides the \"honest feedback\" you are looking for because they understand the struggle of the build. It turns validation from a lonely, existential crisis into a tactical group sport.\n\nIf you are stuck in \"tinkering\", my advice is to stop coding for a second and find your \"hand-raisers\" first. Build a functional slice of your idea, put it on a live URL, and see who actually uses it.",

The biggest fail in product development is when engineers go in their silos and design something that has not been through the process which analyzes the business problem to solve, tests against assumptions, researches solution competition, gathers and analyzes requirements, and so forth.  As u/NihilisticMacaron said, you start with the perceived business problem to solve.  If you have not realistically defined this and overestimated the importance to solve . . . if there is not a market for a solution, then there is no reason to build it. \n\nThe other bit of advice I would give is to avoid building a coded prototype that expends too much time.  You just need visuals that can walk a user through the workflow.  I cannot tell you how many time execs that are terrible at their jobs will send a team of engineers off to code a live prototype, wasting so much money, because they came up with an idea or feature on a whim, only to find out that their idea was in a vacuum and not validated as needed, or that someone else had penetrated the market to a level that could not be easily overcome.",

Of course, it's then on you to empathize, decode, and interpret their feedback.\n\nAnd really I don't know that there's an easy \"hack\" for this. For me at least it's more about the practice of empathy and finding the \"question behind the question\" (or the feedback behind the feedback).\n\nA question I always include in some form: \"when did you hit frustration / the most frustrating thing\" or \"what broke your flow?\" The flow one has surfaced some great insights over time, and I suspect it tends to be where people get interrupted or disconnected from solving their problem in the first place.\n\nedit - words\n\nedit 2 - there are lots of \"discovery hacks\" out there, but I find they tend to be more about injecting AI automation than actually improving discovery.

I've gone back and forth between IC and manager roles, I like them both for different reasons. \n\nThere are places where you simply \"top out\" as an IC at Principal and this causes some PMs to switch over to people manager simply so they can get promoted.  I think this explains the general lack of quality in our PM leadership when it comes to people management skills.  Most PM leaders that I have worked for are continuing to act like PMs instead of managing the team.  I've had several PMs join my team only to be shocked that I want to talk to them about career development and other very basic people manager tasks.\n\nSo, no, I would say that people management isn't a \"core skill\" for PM.  Just the opposite.  Very rare to run into a PM leader who is good at it.  I can think of only two or three in my entire career.\n\nI was very lucky in that I didn't come to PM until later.  I was a former Director of Presales Engineering who took a step down to be a Senior PM.  My first PM manager had no business having direct reports.  He seemed surprised to see me each day.  1:1 meetings were a bother for him.  No guidance, no personal development, etc..  I had to look elsewhere to learn how to be a PM.

People are not “manageable”, because they have feelings, emotions, opinions, thoughts, worries, etc.\n\nSo, it comes down to leading people. And (people) leadership is a special skill.\nThink about your past careeer; and think of how often you had a manager or leader that truly cared for you and that inspired you. It seems often not a lot of great examples exist. Most people are mediocre at best.\nThat is because it takes something special. You’ve gotta be okay with all the different personalities, traits, behaviors, emotions, and find a good way to lead.\n\nThat can be extremely rewarding, but it’s also hard work.\n\nI teach a course called “Leadership for Product Mangers”, and we talk about three pillars:\n- Leading yourself \n- Leading the product (through vision, strategy; discovery, etc)\n- Leading others/leading people\n\nFor lower level/Mid level PMs we can argue you lead through the product and often your team reports into somebody else, so use product skills to lead. \n\nBut more senior level PMs would need to develop some people leadership skills, which in my opinion, not everyone is suited for (to do a really great job).\n\nTherefore some might pick a different type of career not needing to have to lead people",

          "text": "There are two reasons: you can make plenty of money as an IC and it's less stress and people are on average, shitty managers.\n\nIn a lot of careers you can only make really good money if you manage people, there's just a cap on what an IC can deliver to the company so the value to pay them $200k+ isn't there. For PMs, that's not the case.\n\nThe other reason is a lot of people move into product after starting as an IC in an other adjacent field and then there's just never really the opportunity to move into a people management role. Most companies do not utilize multiple layers of management between VPs/CPO and senior PMs. There's maybe one director with a half dozen PMs and seniors and that's sufficient. Orgs scaling up in the last 7-10 years used more Group PMs and the like but those middle management roles are not that critical and most \"Senior\" PMs don't manage juniors, so there's a big gap between being a mid-career senior PM and a group PM or other people manager. \n\nLess opportunity and more pathways to career success as an IC mean most people just do that. And if you do hire a PM to be a people manager, you often find a candidate who has already done it vs trusting someone you like internally to take on that entirely new skill.",

          "text": "Here's what I do that works as well as anything I've tried:\n\n\\- Make a list of everyone who needs to be on the call\n\n\\- Call (don't text / email) everyone on the list 1:1. Tell them you're going to schedule an alignment meeting to get \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\[people\\] aligned around path forward for \\_\\_\\_\\_ topic, and that you wanted their input before the meeting. Framing it as \"soliciting feedback\" is critical - you want to make them feel special, like their opinion matters and that's why you're reaching out the THEM directly (they don't need to know you're doing the same thing for everyone else who will be on the call).\n\n\\- On each 1:1 call, introduce super high level direction / goal for whatever it is that you're trying to get alignment around - don't get into detail on whatever plan you have, or show all your cards. Then, shut up and listen. 9/10 times they'll tell you every objection they have, and what they think you should do instead. Don't debate, just ask questions and figure out why. What are their motivations? Fears? Hesitations? Do they have conflicting goals? Are they counting on resources that you need and therefore they're worried they won't get their bonus? Are they making assumptions / missing context? Etc. Etc.\n\n\\- Rinse, repeat with everyone. \\[Reminder, this is all BEFORE the alignment call\\]\n\n\\- Now you have a list of each stakeholder's motivations, objections, and fears... i.e. you know exactly what each person is going to say / react to on the call, and can adjust your plan for how to navigate the call.\n\n\\- I like to sprinkle little nuggets / anecdotes from each person throughout the deck / presentation (I use quotes / terms verbatim, so they know they were the person you got the ideas from). E.g. Jim said \"doing X is going to take resources and delay the delivery of Y!\" ... Literally add a bullet to the \"risks\" and write Jim's comment \\*exactly as he said it\\*.  E.g. 2: Suzy is advocation for you to do X thing in Y way - you were already planning on doing exactly that, and had that concept in the deck... go update the deck to use the EXACT wording Suzy used on the call...Boom! Now Suzy thinks she gave you that idea in her pre-call with you, and smirks when you get to that slide.  etc. etc.\n\n\\- \\[OPTIONAL\\] - After the 1:1, but before the alignment call, if there's anything particularly controversial that you are still going to present / talk about, call the stakeholder who disagrees. Make them feel heard, or even make them believe you agree with them, but most importantly give them a heads up that you are going to still present the thing they disagree with in the meeting for X/Y/Z reason... You can even tell them \"look, I will add your counter points to the presentation and when we get to them I will tap you in to share your opinion... but to the extent that we go the other direction that I know you don't agree with, I need your help moving things along and I want to ask that you disagree and commit.\"\n\n\\- If you do this right, you will have alignment before you walk into your alignment call...but nobody else knows that... they all think that their voice was most important in crafting the solution that you want to align everyone around. You know every objection that people are going to bring up and you've already mitigated them. You've also already gotten the strongest personalities to commit (to you) to playing ball and \"disagreeing and committing\" in the meeting.  \n\nTL;DR - Call everyone 1:1 first, hear their objections, make them feel special and heard, and then you'll walk into the alignment call already having alignment.",

If you walk into a room of leaders without knowing exactly what they are going to say, it's a much harder conversation.\n\nHere is the three-step flow to handle this:\n\n1. The real work: speak to key stakeholders before the big meeting. Show them a rough draft and ask, \"Is there anything in here that would make you say no?\" It is much easier to handle an objection in a private chat than in front of a crowd. By the time the big meeting starts, you should already have everyone's \"soft\" approval.\n2. The meeting: The actual meeting is just a formality to get everyone to say \"yes\" at the same time. Keep it specific. State the problem, present the solution you already vetted in your 1:1s, and ask if there are any final blockers. Since you already did the pre-wire, there shouldn't be any surprises.\n3. The alignment lockin: Send a recap email within an hour. Start with, \"Great meeting. Here is what we aligned on and who is owning the next steps.\" If it isn't in writing, the alignment is hard to resurrect 😂\n\nSince you are new, use the \"I'm still learning the landscape\" excuse to ask leaders for 1:1s. It is the best way to build a rapport while secretly getting your plan approved.",

Plus man management of PMs that are under your umbrella: weekly's for running topics, half yearly performance reviews, salary adjustments & promotions, trainings etc.\n\nHow does this look at your side, curious to hear?",

There are other things in between, such as:\n\n* I ask them to provide a reaction to my plan.\n* I ask them for a suggestion on how to solve it.\n* They take a first swing at solving it, but then run it by me before they complete it. \n* etc., etc. \n\nOne thing to do is work your way from \"I'll do this for you\" all the way to \"you just do this without me\".

I set expectations clearly by providing well written Jira tickets with all expected outcomes and aligning with them on the expected delivery date. Beyond that, I am available for questions.\n\nBut the team seems to be lacking curiosity I would say. They wait until the last minute and then find that there are things they missed that now we have to move mountains to get done at the last second (that's when it comes to me). They are not thinking ahead. If I do not ask pointed questions during standup then they will remain blocked for days at a time without telling me what's going on.\n\nI do think partially to blame is extremely poor company culture from what I've seen since starting here.
