      "text": "I have a decade in PM. I started building apps with AI last year for rapid prototyping in my day job. Naturally, I explored ideas in my own time ..not because I had a startup idea…Because I looked at what the market wants from PMs now and realised my CV was going stale.\n\nEvery job spec wants “AI experience” or “technical fluency” or “full stack PM.” The market shifts to do everything …\n\nThe first app I built in Lovable. It looked beautiful. Zero security, zero business model, zero point. But it was so easy it was almost boring.\n\nThe second one solved a real problem for my team. I mixed Lovable with Cursor, added GitHub for version control, hosted it on Netlify. Still no auth, no database. Just a useful thing that exists. \n\nThe third one is where it got interesting. Not because I suddenly became a developer….I’m still not writing code. AI writes it. But I wanted to do a bit more. So instead of one tool abstracting everything away, I used the pieces separately. Next.js for the framework. Vercel for hosting. Supabase for the database. Upstash for rate limiting. Claude’s API directly. Resend for emails. Cursor orchestrating the AI coding.\n\nThat’s when things started breaking. And that’s when I started learning. I journaled all of it.\n\nI made a couple more apps since…each getting a little better. Focusing on security… RLS etc \n\nEvery day I built, I wrote up what happened. Not documentation. Just me explaining concepts to myself. What broke…What I learned. Why something worked the way it did.\n\nThose journals turned into personal playbooks. And now when someone asks about a technical trade-off, I don’t construct a hypothetical. I read my own notes. \n\nThe building is valuable. The writing about the building is what compounded …And once you’ve built a couple of apps, you’ve basically got a portfolio. \n\nThe same way UX designers are compelled to talk through their portfolio you can too. You can populate it with case studies. Lessons learned. How you’d scale it. What strategy you took and why. Hiring managers can actually look at something instead of taking your word for it… \n\nThe commercial awareness you pick up is the bonus. Cost optimisation for AI is a real skill now. Which model for which task. Haiku is 10x cheaper but falls apart on complex instructions. Structured outputs forces Claude to return data in an exact format, no conversational fluff, no mistakes. Sounds perfect until you notice it adds latency and slows your shit down. Model updates break your app overnight with no warning.\n\nThe job market wants “full stack PMs” now (even if they don’t explicitly say it!) Whether that’s reasonable is a different conversation. But if that’s where things are heading, I’d rather have something to show than hope my existing experience translates.\n\nIf you’re a PM thinking about future-proofing: pick a problem you actually have. Build something that solves it badly. Document what went wrong. Keep it hosted so you can talk through it and demo it. Better yet host all the links to your  apps on a landing page. \n\nEdit: this advice is probably more geared to new PMs starting out and struggling to get a role, or those who are stuck on internal tool product work and can’t really flex other things marketing and distribution.

Yep, I also noticed this idea of Full Stak PM which honestly I think it's a unicorn (one in a billion).\n\nAnyway, build a portfolio of products explaining the reational, economics, etc. seems a logical step in the PM job search.\n\nHowever, my view, my understanding is that you tend to be more a Full Stack Dev than a Ful Stack PM. The role of a PM, for me, seems more about: research the right business problem to solve (demostrate it with metrics like market size, etc.), finding the right product/feature-market fit (again based on metrics), market your product (aka marketing), Creating the business case (I think you did this one), etc. \n\nAgain, this is my view, and honestly, I may be wrong because when I see Full Stack PM in articles, job post, etc. they are looking for Full Stack Dev. PMs define the WHAT, Devs define the HOW, and selecting the LLM is a HOW not a WHAT. Selecting the business problem to solve is the WHAT.",

Understanding customers, distribution, pricing, all that stuff matters more than whether I can deploy to Vercel.\n\nNot saying don't learn technical stuff, but building apps with AI isn't the same as being a \"full stack PM.\" It's just prompting with extra steps.",

I spent years in product at eBay and other big tech, left three years ago to do consulting, and more recently started building products with a co-founder - we launched our first one three months back and are already onto the second. What I've noticed is exactly what you're describing but from the other side of it: the bottleneck has genuinely moved. Vibe coding means the hard part isn't syntax anymore, it's problem definition, scoping, knowing what to build and what to leave out, understanding tradeoffs - all stuff that good PMs have been doing forever, just without the ability to immediately act on it. Your point about journaling is underrated though, I think a lot of PMs will start building but skip the reflection piece and wonder why the learning doesn't stick. The portfolio isn't just proof for hiring managers, it's proof to yourself that you actually understand what you made. One thing I'd add for anyone reading this who's earlier in their career: don't wait until you feel ready or until you have a \"real\" idea, the first few things you build will be rough and that's the point, you learn more from the breaking than from the building.",

Luckily I already have great in depth knowledge about our customers, users and use cases with too much voluntary feedback to even digest at this point (i.e. super engaged users) - so I'll start from that and see where it takes me.\n\nOne thing though...\n\nWhere do I comment VIBING2026 to get a free sample of your playbook (sarcasm intended) 😁\n\nHave an awesome new year and best of luck to everyone learning more about these types of AI decisions.",

The real life business strategies are reliable. The writing styles aren’t all the exact same. \n\nWhen Claude doesn’t understand the prompt, it asks clarifying questions. When recalling past conversations, it doesn’t forget half of it.\n\nClaude is so much more reliable for everything besides image creation, which let’s be honest are only for memes at this point, and deep research. Now I will say, I think the deep research is a lot better with chatgpt, and makes the case to keep the subscription for that single application mode.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Disagree?",

      "text": "I'm a Senior PO now, but years ago my first break into tech was a Business Analyst. I was embedded in a dev team, basically shadowing my PO. When the PO prioritised a feature, however big or small, it was my job to dig into what that actually meant. What was the impact on the wider product, how would we break it down into individual user stories, what would those stories look like? This allowed the PO to focus on the **why** and **when** of what was being delivered, while I as the BA focused on the **how**. Not in terms of project delivery, timelines, or cost, but the low level detail of the feature, into user stories, acceptance criteria etc.\n\nYears later, having moved onto being a PO, and now Sr. PO, it seems rare that companies even bother with BAs any more. More and more POs are spending time focusing on low level requirements, writing jira tickets, UAT testing, leading backlog refinements to answer detail on edge cases, as BAs are often missed out of the entire structure.\n\nIs SAFe to blame? As that doesn't have BAs at all.\n\nIt's not all companies, but it feels like an increasing number of companies are removing the BA role and expecting the PO to do it.\n\nMaybe it's a UK thing and other countries are different?",

              "text": "Hijacking the top post to challange the belief that eliminating business analysts (or scrum masters, QA, managers, or whatever titles are considered \"non-essential\") actually accomplishes anything positive.\n\nIn my experience, this approach doesn't save a salary, it just eliminates a title in the org chart. The work previously done by business analysts still needs to be done, which means someone is doing it, and being paid.  Generally speaking, that person was hired to do something else, and hired because they were good at the thing they were hired to do.  Often they aren't very interested in (or particularly good at) doing things a BA would do, but the work still needs to be done.  So, it gets done less well and/or slower than before.  As a result, capacity decreases and problems increase.  In the interest of \"eliminating a position\", we often make our teams less efficient, less effective, and less happy.\n\nWhile I'm on a rant, DevOps doesn't mean saving money by making your developers responsible for your Ops functions.  It means reducing friction by connecting your dev people and your ops people to create overlaps and insight where there were once gaps and a wall that people were chucking problems over.\n\nI've spent years fighting with people (often fueled by consultants) who don't understand the purpose of Agile, of DevOps, of Product, or even Cloud, and think everything is supposed to be a cost cutting measure.  That isn't the purpose of any of these, and every time I've seen someone sell these transformation as cost-saving initiatives, they've failed to deliver either cost savings or the benefits those transformations should actually deliver.",

If I wanted to do BA work, I wouldn't have transitioned into a PO role. \n\nAs a BA I was only really thinking weeks, sprints, maybe a couple of sprints ahead, where as a PO I'm thinking months, quarters, even years ahead. If as PO I'm focusing on story writing, low level detail, backlong refinements, answering edge case questions mid-sprint, guess what I'm not doing? Thinking about long term strategy and benefit, ensuring the right thing is being built now as opposed to the wrong thing, building stakeholder relationships. Or maybe I am, but as I'm wearing two hats I'm doing neither one particularly well.\n\nIt feels so many companies have just given BAs a PO title, small pay bump, and made them do both roles.",

I work in a very fast-paced industry, mostly in tech transformations. The concept that the PM should do everything is ridiculous. This is just a small list of what is expected:\n\n* Talk to customers\n* Talk to stakeholders\n* Gain alignment\n* Document the what/why\n* Review charts/graphs\n* Develop experiments\n* Work with design\n* Drive delivery\n* Work with LT\n* Share out results\n* Gather new ideas\n* Manage a backlog\n\nThat's insane.\n\nHow we use BAs - I use the analogy of navigating a lake. The PMs stay at the surface level of everything so they can navigate and direct us where to go (areas of opportunity). BAs dive deep into the water - they work from the surface of the lake to the bottom. They partner with PMs to identify anything that may trip us up as we move forward. PMs should rarely have to dive deep into every aspect of the work. If this is happening, they have lost focus on what/why/customer.\n\nBeen using this model for 10 years and it works.

We involve Solution Architects when it is a very complex feature or has different microservices intertwined. \n\nWe create the technical documentation, API definitions, User Stories and drive the refinements, the rest, we are involved, but in a consulting/monitoring role. We of course involve everyone on the definition of the solution, but we are the owners of it, the choice is ours.\n\nI understand Technical Product Owners are normally associated to Product Managers/Owners for Core Technology Platforms (Cloud, plugins, etc), but i would say it is according on the business needs of the company. \n\nWe really enjoy our work, every new requirement is a new challenge and few feelings at work compare to see how Product Managers use a solution you designed and how it can be reused for other purposes due to our solution creation foresight.",

I suspect if I continued a PO I'd be deemed unnecessary and be fired. \n\nI agree 100% that the work doesn't simply go away. On the other hand some people might argue that if it's simply writing requirements then AI can do it (I don't think it can).

I was a solid performer, felt competent, and was even promoted to a leadership role \n\nI moved into PM because I wanted to be closer to the actual product, work directly with engineering and design, and be part of making product decisions. The role itself sounded (and still sounds) exciting to me.\n\nBut honestly, my experience so far has been… bad. People are great and the company's culture is amazing - I seem to be the problem.\n\nI’ve gotten positive feedback from my manager and my eng manager counterpart, but day to day I feel like I’m drowning. After more than 6 months, I still struggle with things that will sound very basic: making decisions, giving engineers enough clarity, and moving design discussions and decisions forward at a reasonable pace. I often feel slow, unprepared and like I’m not adding value.\n\nI’m putting a lot of effort into learning and improving, but I’ve started questioning whether PM is actually for me or not... The confusing part is that I like the job, weirdly enough, I just feel like I suck at it right now.\n\nTwo questions:\n1. If this happened to you, how did you recover from a rough start as a PM?\n2. How do you personally tell the difference between “this is just a steep learning curve” and “this role isn’t the right fit”?\n\nAny insights are appreciated. I read through many posts, and saw a lot about impostor syndrome or organizational problems, but that isn't my key issue.\n\nTL;DR: I like being a PM but feel bad at it after 6+ months in a PM role.

These are the insights I’ve uncovered from my discovery for context…” \n\nI can guarantee that you that you’ll garner more respect, because engineers and designers can smell bullshit from a mile away, and the truest sigh of intelligence is being aware of what you don’t know instead of trying to fake it till you make it. Plus, people usually love being looped in and jamming together on ideas instead of being told what to do. So turn it into a dialogue, leverage your colleagues and accept that you’re on a learning curve that will feel uncomfortable for a while longer.\n\nOver time you will gain “product sense” and confidence with experience. You’ll be able to challenge your colleagues opinions and have conviction in your own ideas. Your work will still be very much focused around having a dialogue, but you’ll be respected enough to lead and be trusted. \n\nIn the meantime, to remember that you are in fact adding lots of value, think to yourself: imagine if my squad didn’t have me? Sure, you’re not committing code, but I guarantee you’re doing a bunch of other tasks that shield your team from the drudgery of working in any bureaucracy, and letting them focus on what they love doing best.

I'd say this: maybe your rough start isn't you but the organization you're in.   \n  \nMy advice: no PM gig goes by the book - each one needs to be tailored to where the leaders and culture and team is at, and ideally move the org towards high performance. Find the currency of your stakeholders, make them seem like rockstars wherever you can, and put numbers on the board that resonate with leadership.

What is making you feel less confident in your decision making? Without knowing that answer yet, it sounds like maybe you’re hesitating or second guessing your own ability to be the driving voice in these new spaces. Perhaps being unsure if your suggestions are the “best path”? If any of that resonates, I’d say fall back to your analytics background. You can make data tell pretty much any story you want, it’s about applying strategy and vision to them. Sure, a design concept might not be perfectly hashed yet, or a launch / test might not seem fool-proof, but in a lot of PM roles you’re supposed to master the “fail fast pivot faster” route. It all depends on how agile your company really is and their risk appetite, but once you get a grasp on those things you shouldn’t let failure be your fear. Not moving forward confidently with plan Bs & Cs is the fatal flaw in most PMs, imho.\n\nIf you’re more so feeling like you can’t move fast enough, find tools that help you move faster. Believe it or not using copilot in vscode for writing my own markdown files helped increase my pace immensely because it helps generate your ideas faster than you can (but you need a really close eye on the value of the suggestions too). Both of those were free to install  and passed my company security, even if no other PMs were using it.\n\nBut if I’m off base, I’m still curious to hear what you feel like your blockers are.",

Product influencers and authors and podcasters don’t dwell on these feelings but these feelings accompany not just learning but mastering something.  Getting to 75% competence is exhausting, 99% feels impossible. There are no shortcuts or frameworks or matrices for these feelings because so much of the job is unique to the culture and people there. You will likely feel like this in every new product role you take for the first 9 months- not the exact same because you’ll know this a part of any ramp, but a lot of the job can’t be taught to you\n\n2. Every manager is different and nearly all of them want to worry about less stuff. “You’re doing great” can often be synonymous with “I don’t know/care how you’re doing”. Make sure you advocate for yourself without too much honesty about feeling insufficient. I have never seen one company ramp/train a PM well.\n\nHang in there! Keep going",

In B2B Product Management, the inputs are messy, and the 'architecture' of your decision making hasn't caught up to the complexity of the new role yet.\n\nTo your two questions:\n\n**1. How to recover?** Treat yourself like a product in beta. If your engineers lack clarity, it’s usually because the 'Requirements Architecture' is broken. Start using a rigid framework for every decision. Instead of 'thinking' about a choice, run it through a standard weighted scoring model (like RICE) and share that *exact* logic with your team. When engineers see the 'architecture' behind your thought process, they gain confidence even if you’re still learning the technical side.\n\n**2. Learning Curve vs. Wrong Fit?** The difference lies in the 'Energy Tax.'\n\n* **Steep Curve:** You are exhausted because you are building new mental workflows (learning how to architect a roadmap).\n* **Wrong Fit:** You are exhausted because the core activities (negotiating, trade-offs, ambiguity) fundamentally drain your soul.\n\nSince you said you actually *like* the job, you’re likely just in the 'Trough of Disillusionment' where your taste is higher than your current output. Focus on building better **operating rituals** (weekly sync templates, decision logs, etc.). Once the 'system' is in place, the 'drowning' feeling usually turns into 'swimming.'

Understand the database, the codebase, and write skeletons against which the developers can work.\n\n3. Spearhead QA\n\n4. Lead all client communication.  This doesn’t mean just taking client calls: it means forging strategic partnerships.   \n\n5. Maintain PRD, user stories, & tasks in complete detail.  All ambiguity should be foreseen, and it should be impossible for developers to misunderstand.  Remember: if velocity is low, a product is not built to spec, it there is any ambiguity, it is ALWAYS product’s fault.\n\nThe above are minimum to succeed.

The result isn’t better products...it’s faster confidence built on thinner understanding. Deferred complexity is never fun and bites hard later! Additional context, I was also an early adopter in the OpenAI playground way back 2 years ago. 😂AI is powerful when it amplifies judgment.

Faster dev doesn't remove cognitive biases and political convenience, which are enormous factors in decision making.\n\nSo much \"testing\" in our profession is not about empirical verification. It's more like \"a show of progress\" to make higher ups happy. To even get larger scale tests approved, you still need implicit sign-off from multiple orgs (ie PM/Eng/Design) who will be helping you, yet may all have a flawed understanding of how the product actually works.\n\nMore tests run is still good though. Even if it doesn't solve corporate politics issues, data is ammo that savvy PMs can use. And the thought process itself of coming up with more experiment hypotheses is really useful. It helps to show that things are always more nuanced than snake oil-selling PMs make them seem.\n\nShitty PMs used to be able to coast by for years by sounding convincing and bringing \"data\" to conversations.

They didn't have much experience in either field and were working on a pretty poorly defined problem. Those who relied on the LLMs didn't tend to understand the relationship between their designs and the requirements or desireable qualities of the project. It was a big hassle that resulted in more design review rounds since they weren't applying critical thought beyond what the LLM was spitting out. \n\nWe would have done with more talking with the client and thinking about what we actually needed to build.

The PM does market research, stakeholder research, etc. and is therefore the most well-positioned to make a call on what to build next. The reality is that the PM does that work as busy work, the execs make the decision based on their intuition, you do what they want, the project either succeeds and they take credit, or it fails and you get the blame.\n\nTo me PM is a cool role in theory and a terrible role in practice due to the power dynamics of business.",

Most younger PMs come to us from larger MBA programs like Stanford or Kellogg.  So, if you have good grades, focus on getting into a decent college and plan to get an MBA.  Because PMs lead feature teams, it's tough to get your first PM gig.  Internships are the thing that will get your foot in the door.  \n\nIn the meantime, learn how this business works.  Bonus points if you major in Computer Science as an undergrad.  You can also start side hustles in school, try building a small site and see how far you can get.\n\nPersonally, I went the other way.

How would build those if you have zero experience, one might ask. Well, the good news is that now you have all these LLMs to do research; test your ideas via social media platforms, like Reddit and so on.\n\nIf I were in your position, I'd focus on the things you like that you use in your daily bases and how would you think those could be improved..start from there. And build on that, it could be anything, e.g., you might like watching Netflix. Start listing why you like Netflix and what would you like to change; so the idea is to be intentional.. next build on that, start checking what other similar platforms exists, what you like about them and so on...and then you document those...blah, blah.. Then with the help of LLMs you can build MVPs and ask your friends for the feedback by interviewing them.. I guess you got the idea.\n\nOne more thing, for God's sake please invest your time on the communication and selling skills. u/Fuzion_mix",

That led into Android, iOS, and web QA, and then at some point I switched to the PM track.\n\nThat was over a decade ago and I've since been a PM in business intelligence, clinical studies, mobility (parking, EV charging, etc), e-commerce, and currently some sort of logistics. I just kind of drifted from opportunity to opportunity (and studied hard along the way), but definitely didn't start out with formal education as a PM. \n\nIn fact, PM as it is today didn't even exist back when I was a fresh graduate. Keep an open mind and be ready to pivot when the market does. PM isn't going anywhere, but it's changing (with AI being the current Trendy Thing) and to make the most of it you need to be on the lookout. \n\nThat said, you don't necessarily go straight for it if it's your longer term goal. Take some adjacent jobs in industries that interest you, and watch for opportunities. You never know.",

Build the solution and start networking and selling it one by one. Over time, you'll be successful and make some great connections along the way. Use replit or lovable if it's a tech solution. If you can solve a problem with a tangible service, even better.\n\nI'd suggest rethinking your approach to what will make sense 5 years from now. You'll gain valuable skills building something on your own that can translate to a \"job\" if/when you're ready.\n\nTrue, lasting success is slow and steady.\n\nOtherwise, I'd recommend going into a career in the medical field, specifically becoming a surgeon or family medicine doctor. Better work life balance for family medicine. I'd do that if I could start over.\n\nCreativity wise, just get some cool fun hobbies you actually enjoy on the side. No pressure to make money from it.",

You’ll have metrics you don’t agree with thrust upon you, narcissistic VPs telling you how to do your job with no real understanding of the systems, and you’ll hardly be able to discern any real impact of your efforts - the systems are just too convoluted and don’t account for all variables. Because of that, you’ll need to constantly deliver a narrative that highlights the value your team is bringing and sells that story to high level executives. Lotttttta politicking. Lotttttta performative bullshit. \n\nAt the end of the day, many of these roles are utterly worthless in terms of the value they provide to society as a whole, but can be lucrative in terms of shareholder value created. The pay can be very good, assuming you’re at the right company or participate in an IPO. If you do land at a big company with great pay your role may be so limited that you’re just in charge of a single button color or something. And now they expect everyone to be able to code and be a “full stack PM” whatever that means. Pay is going down too. \n\nRetired from PM roles last year and couldn’t be happier with the decision.

I was lucky to be part of an IPO and reinvested my equity steadily over several years, mostly broad market funds, some commercial real estate, and a few alternative bets. Nothing flashy, just consistent. Stayed out of debt, lived well but below our means, and always knew it wasn’t a forever thing.\n\nNow I keep things simple and mostly passive, but still actively tending to the garden. A few commercial projects usually in play, otherwise a mostly index-based portfolio. A friend and I built a trading system that’s done really well over the last five years, but it only shows up once or twice a year. Always looking for new opportunities, but are quite careful and manage risk aggressively. Optionality matters more than consumption. Possessions don’t make you rich.\n\nMy days start early with dog walks, coffee, and golf most mornings, then the gym for lifting, cardio, and a 20-minute sauna. I work part-time with a friend’s business, 10–15 hours a week. We cook all our meals, volunteer regularly, and spend time with family every week. We travel often, but find we really enjoy being home for long stretches now that day to day life feels like the vacation.\n\nRetirement is active and intentional, busier than I ever imagined. We set big aspirational goals twice a year. My wife is training for her first marathon, I’m getting back into competitive golf, and last year we did a 22-mile day hike with 10,000 feet of elevation gain, plus seven other peaks while training.\n\nProduct management trained me to see systems clearly, incentives, feedback loops, waste. Once I saw how the consumer machine works and how little is actually based on true merit, it was hard to unsee it. Using those same tools to step out of it felt like the most rational move I ever made. I had no earthly idea what a product manager was when I got into tech. I’m just an obsessive problem solver, and that translates to whatever I want it to. Glad it’s channeled towards self actualization today  and not editing 50 slides for the VP who procrastinated on the deck and is frantically cramming the night before presentation at 3am.

I suggest exploring many avenues at school and internships and see what type of work really most interests you.\n\n\\- PM is a better mid to late career move than something you should goal on in high school. You benefit a lot from domain expertise, eng experience, or data analysis experience. If you want to eventually be a pm, do one of those first.\n\n\\- Frankly, the role will probably change so much by the time you graduate college that our perspectives will be moot by then. Keep an open mind and stay up to date with industry changes.",

But I love shipping products, getting to change  projects and working with different people and thinking through how to solve weird and difficult problems. So it’s worth it for me.\n\nI think the questions I’d ask at your age:\n\n1. What kind of lifestyle do you want? You mention “pay well,” but that’s pretty nebulous. Jobs earning $150k, $250k, $500k all “pay well” but the lifestyle afforded by those salaries is very different. Also the WLB. \n\n2. What kind of people do you want to work with? I really think everyone should work a retail job at some point (or any job!!) and figure it out. This, IMO, has a huge impact on the day to day enjoyment. Creative jobs are rife with high ego people in positions of power. \n\n3. What things are you good at, vs what do you want to get good at? Career wise it’s a lot easier to build on your strengths, and you’ll enjoy it more too. Things I am truly mediocre at, like figure drawing, I keep as hobbies.",

Depending on your area- being a SME and keeping up with AI- how you can utilize the latest information and it's abilities and do all else without giving up personal head space is near impossible for many. Now imagine you dont live to work and live to also enjoy life outside work or you have a sick parent you take care of or a family, it is not one of those jobs you can just clock out of. The culture is not great depending on team or company- your stability is less stable than it used to be. You can know your users and product so well- passion and fun kind of dried up and those who have it- I envy you. It is a crapshoot job and depends day to day and is overall less stable and more work with no break with someone wanting your job behind you. Burnout af.",

From that experience, I got my current PM role at a small asset management firm. The team, and the org as a whole, is really young and everyone’s pretty smart and cool to work with. Once again, it’s a situation where I’ve been able to be proactive and carve out the role I’m most interested in, given the needs of the firm. I love what I do, and it’s an added bonus that I make solid money doing it.\n\n\nAll this to say, I think it depends on how you approach it. For me, I grew up teaching myself editing softwares, making YouTube videos. Ended up getting a degree in media production. But I’ve also always been a gamer, into nerdy tech stuff etc. So the PM role is a great blend of the two and right up my alley. The stuff people are commenting on here, about the bs you have to deal with etc., is tedious if you’re not actually interested in the PM role at the crux of it: Creative problem solving through the lens of technology (assuming we’re talking digital products). If that doesn’t sound like you, then maybe it’s not the direction you want to go. But if it does, it might take some time to work towards and find that perfect role, but it can be very fun and rewarding imo.",

After all, the main objective is to make money and that means prioritizing the business objectives and pulling the levers that do that. \n\nI’m a PM leading a commerce function in an org and our mandate is “take the money”. Every initiative and move we make is geared towards enabling the business to monetize their products and extract revenue from their users. \n\nNow granted I’m not the PM deciding to do dark patterns that keep you locked into a subscription because we make it too hard to cancel or positioning “aggregated payouts” for gig workers because we want to hold money for longer and earn interest or minimize the transaction costs by batching; but when you’re tasked with building those platform features, you can’t be too morally driven or it will eat you up. \n\nI mean there are PMs out there building even more insidious features around algorithmic behavior and optimizing addiction signals to maximize user engagement; so even getting a role on a great team in a well funded high profile company can be miserable if you don’t feel comfortable with that sort of thing.",

If you love a challenge and thinking on your feet while putting out tons of fires and doing busy work, and have the capacity to multitask and prioritize your time well, you'll thrive. If that doesn't sound like you, then it's still an option but maybe worth talking to your school counselor. \n\nLanding a PM role fresh out of university is pretty tough in this market especially in the roles that do pay well and have brand recognition. Many people choose to pursue (in my opinion overpriced) MBA degrees from top programs to compete and get a foothold into this career, even though it won't teach you much of the required skillset. \n\nMany PM roles are also better fits for technical folks who transition into business leadership positions from areas of domain expertise, I haven't met too many PMs in FAANG + fortune 20 companies in my time in the industry that have a degree in anything outside of computer science or engineering, so it can be pretty competitive end-to-end. Doesn't mean there's no creative PMs, I just happen to be a PM in tech and those roles tend to pay more highly so just a reflection on the current market. \n\nWith that said, I think PM will change a lot in the next 10 years so take what I say with a grain of salt and if you follow your track and work really hard there's no reason you won't be leading the next wave of PMs if that's what you want to do. Stay motivated, that's my real advice, don't take no for an answer, pitch yourself and believe in yourself and fake it 'til you make it, that's how I got to where I am +- a few degrees. :)",

At least with engineering managers, people inherently respect that you bring specialized expertise and knowledge to the table, which makes the politics and influence more straightforward. As a PM, this inherent respect is harder to gain because you are not bringing specialized expertise or domain knowledge to the table.\n\nI am working in the AI space and am considering moving to an engineering role.

In the best team I had a lot of latitude to do what I thought was right and was able to make significant changes with the support of my leadership. The product wasn't inherently that exciting, but because the environment was healthy I learned to enjoy the product. On the worst team I had zero freedom to do anything, and received constant nitpicking and micromanagement from leadership, as well as major organizational uncertainty and staffing churn. I would have really enjoyed working on the product but instead I was miserable.\n\nSo my philosophy is that the biggest factor is the health of the org and your relationship with leadership and peers.

From introducing to new ways of working, to leadership change, letting good and long term employees go due to political games and all the AI thing on top. It was a hard year emotionally. Although I think I did burn out eventually in December, throughout the year, the passion for my product actually saved me from wanting to quit and for keep going to move forward. I still don't feel as good as I did a year ago, but I think caring about your product actually makes all those challenges and chaos a bit easier to handle. It's because you focus on what actually matters and kind of try to distance yourself from the noise. \n\nNot sure if there is anything to advise. If your ideas keep getting shut down, try to look for feedback why is that. Is it purely emotional and depends on a person? Or maybe some data driven evidence could help proof that your ideas are worth trying? Don't be afraid to ask for feedback. This is a very powerful tool to understand what is going on in people's minds and maybe see a perspective which you haven't thought about before.\n\n The most useful think I was able to do in my career is to build relations with my stakeholders at various different levels in departments. If you come prepared with research and data, they will appreciate your opinion more. If you will help them get answers to their questions, they will start seeing you as someone who can be trusted. Be one step ahead and you will become a trusted partner whose opinion matters. But you will have to invest a lot of your time in understanding your product and its customers",

Think about your funeral; what would you want to have been true about your life?\n\nYou may not have particularly opinionated answers to these questions. That’s OK. Not everyone has a dream.

They keep one pipeline open, so it may appear to a job seeker that it's the same job over and over. On their end, they're just using it to fill the same type of role.\n\nAnother case is where they had a candidate in the process but lost out to someone else. There are more reasons, but not every role is fake simply because it's being reposted or has not been filled.\n\nI also agree that LinkedIn's \"new postings\" label is misleading, and that feedback continues to be shared with them, but I don't see them changing it. This report looks only at the total number of active listings and doesn't presume any of them to be new. It compares the total number of active listings to previous time periods when they were pulled.\n\nSo while there may be existing jobs that were live a month ago and are still live today, that nuance is not captured in the reports. The reports simply show the total number of open listings at the time I pulled the data.",

If you've only had four interviews after hundreds of applications, that's usually a signal that, despite what you've been doing, there is opportunity to improve your application conversion rate or that you're applying to roles where they're being more selective about who they interview.\n\nThe reality is nearly no one is finding new jobs in under two months, and that has been true for the past couple of years.

Early on you think the hard part is prioritization or execution but most of the real work ends up being alignment between smart people who all see different risks.\n\nIt also feels stage dependent. Smaller or early teams argue less because they can’t afford to, while bigger orgs spend more time agreeing on the problem than building the solution. Once alignment clicks, execution suddenly feels easy, which is usually the giveaway that the time wasn’t wasted.",

All I hear on Lenny's podcast, Marty Cagan's books and every Youtube video about product frameworks is how great the product cultures at these companies are. \"Product-driven\" cultures is what they call them.\n\nI've worked for most of my life in LatAm and Europe, so I'm really curious to know if it's all as perfect and rosy as it's depicted. Or is it just more common in the US to have tech companies that work more smoothly and have less \"drama\"?\n\nFrom the outside, it seems that only 10% of tech companies have a real product-driven culture where strategy is clear, stakeholders are aligned, the focus is on shipping real value (for the user - not only the company) and overall there's less friction.

In the startup mode and growth mode, some things can be more product-driven.\n\nTypical companies are more focus on growing the business and products are just a vehicle to do this. Specially if you are in B2B. Product vision or strategy are rarely properly articulated. So yeah some companies will have stronger product culture while others won't, but I've never seen what is described in the books or podcasts.\n\nPM influencers tend to talk about the best scenario, which probably is very hard to achieve for most companies, if possible at all.\n\nCreating a product culture can work and make things smoother. The problem with the world of PM is that it has painted the picture of product being the center of everything, and at least in my experience, this is not often the case.\n\nBut I would say that pretty much the same goes for any other teams. And yes, sales tend to be highlighted in the results. \n\nIn my opinion companies should not focus so much on product-led or PMs, but focus on creating small squads that are responsible for the success of a product/business area. That tends to force them to work together, along and collaborate. And remove the silo mentality.\n\nBtw, I'm not saying product is not key, in my experience typically product and sales, some times other teams, are in the key discussions. \n\nBut we all know what happens when a big deal is proposed and where the product-driven philosophy goes.",

Even if I had the opportunity to visit more customers I likely couldn't due to having to work on hundred other things. I could do a ton of research and say \"Hey! This is what we should be doing and here's how I know it\" and it would be ignored because it doesn't align with the opinions of decision makers. \n\nEvery book I've read on PM seems idealized and the reality never seems to align.

If they focus on something else entirely, that’s often even more valuable.\n\nMy rule of thumb is: start broad, let users lead, and only narrow in once I understand what’s important to *them*, not what’s important to *me*.\n\nHope this helps!",

I expect this to change after the AI craze / stagflation period we're in, hopefully\n\n\n2. *Companies are reducing UR teams.* Yep. Long ago, in 2008, software was such a lucrative business--no overheard or physical cost to what you sell = insane profit margin--that companies could afford to split up the work across many individuals. We had engineers, scrum coaches, product managers, engineering managers who didn't actually write code, UX, UR, and QA all embedded in teams or in big departments. This has fallen off slowly for years. Every business now has a tech stack but the competition is a lot fiercer and only FAANG can afford all of those luxurious perks and hyper-specialized roles. Tools, including but also before AI, have moved in to help PMs or developers do more themselves. THIS is why they've gotten rid of User Researchers, not because it's a lower priority but because companies in general want everyone to do three jobs at once now.\n\n\nAnd... they're sort of right. And sort of wrong. Obviously every PM should be talking to clients and doing UR, but a lot of this was \"best practice\" bloat that the execs didn't actually use and I can't blame them for cutting. And I'm not one of the AI doom-and-gloomers, I think great humans (+ AI help) will always surpass pure AI. But having a UR team doesn't mean your company is actually learning and applying anything useful, and in the current era I don't see it being applied well or valued highly",

Research is all about uncertainty, and finding comfort in that uncertainty to provide insights. \n\nTo put it bluntly, researchers know there might not be an easily captured answer to a question.

It takes time, it's also important to do it well. \nI think there's a balance though. Not all research is equal (in terms of the skills required), and it takes people literally years of just focussing on research to get good at the more complicated stuff. It's not a side hustle. I don't know you can do the bigger pieces of research you might need, as well as manage the product at the same time. In places Ive worked we've had a mix of projects we have helped other conduct pre tactical work, (usability etc), while leaving us to do the more complex or heavy weight strat work. That's often worked well, but still requires upskilling most people. \nAs a UXR I've got skills in product management, service design, and UCD, but these help me help those teams better, so our work is more integrated.

I spent the past year feeling stuck and overwhelmed with the scale and volume of problems that I am trying to solve.\n\nAfter a lot of thought I feel what I need is to talk to a senior product professional that has a strong grasp of product fundamentals to help me stay grounded in what matters and in delivering value where it counts the most. Have you been in such a position before? Any recommendations for me on how to go about finding such mentorship opportunity? \n\nAlso if you feel it is worth it, I would be open to paid product coaching type sessions as well so feel free to share any experiences that you have with this. Thank you all!",

I checked LinkedIn profiles of people who were in similar roles, and if anyone was generous enough to mention type of product problems they solved in their bio and that resonated with me , I made a connection request. I am guilty of not going ahead with follow ups when initial messages were unanswered though.   \n3. ADPList was suggested to me by a friend who did find a mentor on that platform after much trial and error. You can try that  \n4. As of today, I am heavily relying on LLM (I use perplexity) as my guide/mentor and so far the bond has been going good (:P). I keep dumping context to it and at least an action plan is cooked, however imperfect.   \n5. I have also started believing in 'do good, get good'.

Thank you all in advance.\n\n* If you were to name 3 fundamental principles for being a successful PM, what would they be and why?\n* Which tools are you working with and which problems do they solve?\n* In your daily experience how much of the stuff you deal requires technical know-how? (Feel free to criticize this question aswell)\n* What do you read, watch or consume in general? Books, blogs, newsletters, videos etc. Everything is welcome, book recommendations would go a longer way :).\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "welcome to the chaos, honestly asking these questions early is already a good sign.\n\nthree fundamentals that actually matter  \nfirst, be clear on the problem before touching a solution. most pm pain comes from building the right thing for the wrong problem. if you can explain the problem in simple words, you’re ahead of a lot of people.  \nsecond, learn to say no and explain why. not aggressively, just calmly and repeatedly. priorities are your real product.  \nthird, close the loop. decisions, tradeoffs, outcomes. write them down. memory lies, docs don’t.\n\ntools wise, tools mostly solve visibility problems. something to track work, something to capture decisions, something to show progress. the exact stack matters less than whether people actually update it. if a tool needs babysitting, it’ll rot.\n\non technical know how, you don’t need to be an engineer but you do need to understand constraints. you should know why something is hard, what tradeoffs exist, and when someone is hand waving. curiosity matters more than depth.\n\nfor reading, i’d skip most hype blogs. look for stuff about decision making and systems. books like inspired, empowered, continuous discovery habits are fine starters. also read things outside product, psychology, writing, org behavior. it helps more than another roadmap framework.\n\nlast thing, feeling lost is normal. pm confidence comes from reps, not theory. you’ll cringe at stuff you ship now in a year, that’s how you know you’re learning.",

The tools I want to work with and the tools approved by my employer are not necessarily the same thing. However, the most valuable tools to me are: Ones that enable clear communication of priorities, timelines, and deliverables. Ones that allow me to offload repetitive chores. Ones that allow me to effectively organize my brain. Ones that allow me to effectively support my engineers.  \n\n3: It varies. Many PMs can have long careers with little technical knowledge, especially in B2B spaces where domain knowledge is sometimes considered equally or more important. I try to keep up to date with my technical know how, at a minimum it allows you to understand if your engineers are over or under estimating level of effort. I feel that is an important skill. Table stakes is knowing SQL for analytics purposes. \n\n4: There are many lists that teach you the fundamentals, Cagan, Eyal, Ries, etc are essential reading, but are not fully instructive for your actual role. Understanding the literature is valuable, but it is extremely unlikely you’ll ever work in a company where it operates by such ideals. Learn the basics, and then observe and write what you see working at your employer. Contrast that against the literature and develop your own hypothesis on how to be effective. A good PM should always aim to improve.",

          "text": "Fundamentals\nI’ll go a bit deeper than the usual “ship fast and learn from customers”. These are three mantras I try to live by.\n\nUnderpromise overdeliver - whenever working with timing, plan pessimistically and ship early, e.g., when asked for a deadline, knowing you can deliver early this week, always say end of this week. Or when asked to present a mock-up, set expectations low and give high (more evidence = stronger use case)\n\nNever EVER leave with questions in your mind - (I’m a non-technical PM), but I always ask to the greatest extent possible, what technical implications are. Sometimes I just mention it’s just a couple lines of text, how hard can it be to change it? If you have the feeling at the end of a conversation with engineers that you still don’t fully understand what they’re doing or what the problem is, you need to clarify as much as you can. Assume stakeholders would like to understand what’s taking so much time.\n\nAllow yourself time to think (when possible) - We often feel pressured to respond immediately. Don’t. First thoughts are rarely the best ones. Take time to think, collaborate with engineering and design, explore alternatives, and consider edge cases. A slightly slower, well-thought-out response often saves weeks later.\n\nTooling\n(Highly dependent on what your company allows)\nMiro – stakeholder collaboration & getting ideas out of my head\nJira – project management (2-week sprints)\nMicrosoft Clarity, GA4, BigQuery – data & analytics\nLyssna – quick user feedback\nFigma / Lovable – prototyping\nChatGPT – writing simple tickets or first drafts\n\nTechnical know-how\nThis really depends on your context. SQL is often less “technical” than people think and very handy. From a web perspective, understanding how Google Tag Manager works is also extremely useful.\n\nReading & learning\nHonestly, I don’t read much anymore. I became a dad 1.5 years ago, so time is limited. The best learning for me has been learning on the job, observing other PMs and picking the things that work for you, and ignoring the rest",

Also, accept that this is often very, very difficult. It's an inherently complex problem with many dimensions and distractions, but it's the one thing you absolutely must do well or you will fail 100% of the time.\n\nIn B2B, you have to accept that the right thing to do often depends more on your company position, ways of working, sales team and so on than what would make the most sense from an end user pov.\n\nBeware scope creep! MVP starts with MINIMUM/MINIMAL. If someone wants to add scope, ask why. It's on them to motivate. Never just accept additions because someone thinks they make sense or are cool or nice or whatever. If there's not a crystal clear path to the one problem that you are focusing on solving, shoot it down.",

Try to filter out the noise and act on what’s actually important so you don’t get overwhelmed.

On technical know how, you do not need to be an engineer, but you need to understand constraints well enough to make tradeoffs without hand waving.

          "text": "1) Love your customer.  The most important thing the PM needs to do is to understand who the product is for (i.e. the \"Target User Persona\").  You need to know that person intimately.  Successful PMs can predict how their target user persona will react to any change you are thinking about making.  This increases your odds of building good software.  Spend time with them, ask questions.  Learn.  The more time you spend with customers the better off you will be long term. \n\n2) Own and drive the process.  As the PM, you are responsible for the outcome.  Thus, you need to be empowered to drive to that outcome.  If your leadership isn't allowing you to drive the outcome, push back.  Engineering has their role, marketing has their role, design, etc...   However, PM has to drive the ship.  As a new PM, take your queues from your seniors.  You'll have to spend some time learning the job, but your goal is to be the leader of your feature team, not a contributor.\n\n3) Trust your engineers.  It's not your job to build the thing.  It's their job.  Yes, you want to know what they're building and why, but no, it's not your call how the thing is built.  If you have a strong relationship with eng, you'll have a seat at the table and you'll know you're doing well because they'll ask for your input.  But  you have to respect their position.  If the thing doesn't work, they're the ones who will get the call in the middle of the night, not you.   Actively seek a strong partnership with your eng counterpart.  The two of you are in this together.\n\n4) Learn to work the machine.  Depending on the size of your company, you will have more or less support.  Do you have a dedicated designer?  A tech marketing engineer?  Sales specialist?  In most cases, there is a team surrounding your product or feature.  Get to know them.  Understand what they do.  Actively work to bring them into your orbit.  Many junior PM's think that they have to do everything and get overwhelmed.  You don't have to do it all yourself.  Get your supporting cast going, get them on our side.  Approach it as a team exercise.\n\n5) Focus on velocity and quality.  In the end the only two things that matter (IMHO) for a feature team are velocity and quality.  Are you moving quickly?  Are you building good software?  If not, stop.  Those things have to be true or nothing else matters.",

          "text": "3 fundamental principles that are a must have to grow in the PM role -\n\n1. **Customer Backward Mindset**. The center of everything you do as a PM on a product is are you able to step into the shoes of your users. Are you really able to dissect a hypothesis or a problem statement to a layer that you start to find the real causes of a pain-point. And are you able to overpower this customer backward mindset over your pre-conceived biases.\n2. **You must be a natural / keen observer**. For a PM, it is extremely important to keenly observe and identify underlying layers that may be impacting your users. This becomes even more important because for PMs there is generally no-task delegation from their managers. You are on your own for the product you're handling. You are generally told about the company objectives and product function objectives, rest is upto you, on how you will help the teams achieve these objectives.\n3. **Patience** is an important skill that every PM has to learn or possess. It adds value to how you operate as a PM because you manage multiple stakeholders on a single product, and aligning them takes alot of convincing, negotiations and long war-room meetings. And all this multiplies as you have no direct control on the say of these stakeholders.\n4. few more would be business acumen, communication skills, etc.\n\nNot a big user of tools, the most we are exposed to is JIRA that too during the execution phase. Rest of the stuff is done at the usual google / microsoft suite. For user interviews I use dovetail and for wireframing balsamiq / lucidchart. \n\nOn a day to day basis, the most technical exposure you need to be at is during the standup calls with your execution team or when you are working with a 3rd party & trying to integrate their APIs. \n\nI have been writing articles on ***PM Transition and 0 to 1 Product Building***, if you wish, I would love to share the articles with you.",

I have a coding background, and when GPT dropped in late 2022 I started building small Python tools and automations. That quickly turned into larger internal apps and experiments.\n\nMost of what I built never shipped. Not because it was bad, but because HR preferred maintaining the status quo. Over the last 6 to 9 months, I built several weekend projects purely out of interest. One could have replaced a vendor we paid ~$200k/year for, with better UX, better auditability, and lower risk. Another would have saved ~$30k YoY. I shared demos internally and in AI communities at my job. Internally, it was mostly radio silence.\n\nI kept building anyway, mostly for my portfolio.\nA month or two later, my manager told me to apply for an internal role. Turns out leadership had seen my work and wanted me in it. I got the role, and now I work with a team of devs I already collaborate with in an AI community where we share research, experiments, and memes. For example, I recently posted about how moving to a larger embedding model actually degraded performance due to dimensionality issues.\n\n\nNow I’m looking for advice from folks who have been here before:\nWhat should I be watching out for from a stakeholder management perspective, especially in AI-heavy products?\nAny open source or lightweight tools people like for project tracking?\nAny advice for working with leadership when automation may eventually reduce headcount?",

It helps to make failure modes visible early, not just accuracy or cost savings, but what happens when the agent is wrong and who absorbs that cost. On the headcount side, framing automation as load shaping rather than pure reduction tends to keep conversations more grounded.

I was always taught that Engineers never liked the PM second guessing their technical decisions. It wasn't my job.  My job was to focus on the problem, not the solution.  I just needed to ensure the result matched the needs.\n\nI think with AI that is changing.  Im vibe coding my own apps for fun to learn and maybe one day to do something.  I started with Replit, and now I am realizing I need more and more control over my apps, my stack, my deployments.\n\nI just installed Claude Code after avoiding the command line for 20 years.\n\nIt's an exciting time and I get to learn new concepts, systems, but not needing to know how many brackets I need in my code or that I typed syntax the wrong way.  AI does that all now.\n\nI think this means PMs will by default become more \"technical\" but in a new AI way.  Curious to hear thoughts.",

I’ll back this up with some of the “compasses” I use to navigate my career, then share a story about my mentor.\n\n1/ If you need a \"relative\" formula for your question, I think this article is the one: [https://www.ravi-mehta.com/product-manager-roles/](https://www.ravi-mehta.com/product-manager-roles/) . But from my POV, there are only 3 types:  \n\\- New comers: who don't know the technical basics, sometime get caught in basic discovery traps (like asking what user wants, whether user needs a feature,...)  \n\\- Mid PMs: who do everything right, make no mistakes but the outcomes doesn't change significantly, A typical PM for mature companies.  \n\\- Successful PMs: who don't need to care much about the task quality but can warranty the outcome. But it's a huge gap between the mid ones and  the successful ones, and it requires luck and timing as well\n\n2/ About mentorship, I think every mentorship is very distinct, so there is no single common answer. This is just an example from my experience. My mentor didn’t shape my PM career much because I chose to become a tech entrepreneur, while he enjoys being a highly specialized expert at top companies. However, he fuels my career in a very thoughtful way. He listens to me extremely attentively, even when I’m in situations he has never experienced himself. He is always humble when pointing out nuances I might miss, and he can sense my energy and tune the conversation to fit my context. \n\nMy career is quite complicated and uncertain right now, and I don’t expect much from anyone to help me with it. My mentor simply prevents me from collapsing, and that’s all I need from him. Hope my answer help, good luck!",

AI lowers the cost of building the first version, not the cost of owning it long term. You still pay in maintenance, edge cases, security, and keeping it aligned as the business changes. That’s where a lot of internal tools quietly die.\n\nI do think internal PMs become more valuable in teams that choose to build selectively. Someone has to be ruthless about what is actually worth custom work versus good enough off the shelf. The danger is assuming cheaper build means cheaper forever. In my experience, build wins when the workflow is truly core or weird. Everything else still gravitates toward buying and adapting.",

But when the tool you buy only has 80% the functionality you need and it’s 1 FTE ongoing to compensate for the missing parts then it’s time to build. AI speeds up initial development significantly but it improves maintenance only marginally.",

          "text": "I would recommend the book Exocapitalism. A wonderful book from last year that attempts to grapple with how software’s exponential value creation and our current speculative economy upends traditional Marxist theories of labor and value. \n\nFor our purposes, it posits that most companies in our contemporary era opt for “lift,” which is described as follows:  \n\n> [lift is] the tendencyof capitalism to move itself away from fixed costs, from the soil, the\nearth, the sphere of human affairs. You can think of lift as the negative definition of financialization, describing a motion away instead of toward …\n\n> Examples of lift are literally everywhere, felt most tangibly in the indifference with which goods and services are ultimately delivered to humans, colorized most lucidly in the bottom-line decision-making of a business when it finally shakes off the dead weight of consumer-driven obligation and launches off into pure financial engineering. \n\n> Lift is in the 9 different Delta Airlines boarding groups, 5 of which are associated with credit card tiers. As Caroline Busta puts it, lift is in the intentional time-dilation in airport transit time to facilitate duty-free shopping. Lift is in the pears ‘grown in Thailand, packed in Argentina, eaten in the UK’ meme of 2021. Lift is in Daniel Felstead’s “janky capitalism,”the mediation of daily life through a cascade of disinterested, random apps …\n\n> Lift represents the imperative to move away from the soil, from physical capital and human labor - but not simply due to business need (leanness: the outsourcing of low-margin, hard to maintain, expensive, politically charged, physically remote\nactivities) and instead the machinic impulse toward abstraction (lightness: modularity, agility, airiness, independence, looseness, incompleteness). \n\nThe more you think about these ideas (which are greatly expanded upon, and the authors best explain in terms of Salesforce later on in the book) the more obviously true they ring. It’s for this reason I believe what you’re asking will absolutely not happen. There is no incentive for companies long term to assume the fixed costs of in-house platform development when they could instead pay a marginal rate for a much better equipped company to both build, support, and enhance software that can be leased out.\n\nI assume some companies will attempt to spin up stuff in house, but they will quickly learn there is no incentive to do so and, on a long enough time scale, it makes infinitely more sense to pay someone a fraction to do all the hard work for you. So it goes.",

I have the Scrum CSP-PO, SAFe POPM, and PMI-ACP, and in my experience, all of these are great at teaching you what a few books and Google searches would teach you.\n\nI'll keep taking them if they keep getting paid for, don't get me wrong, but wondering: Has anyone taken any courses, certifications, or degrees that actually helped you become a better product manager, especially when it comes to moving into more strategic and operational roles vs more tactical?\n\n\\---------\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for your input. Just updating this with some key takeaways, for people finding this post in the future.\n\n* Consensus is that it is not worth *your* money for most of these courses (if your company pays, that's their decision, then go for it). They cost too much and usually focus on process knowledge over the actual strategic elements of being a PM.\n   * If you are still looking for courses, identify and focus on your gaps, and educate yourself on those. There are also a few suggestions below.\n* Focus your effort doing the work and learning to deliver a product/feature that users want. The ability and experience required to do this are what actually makes a PM, not letters behind your name. Being able to demonstrate your process of market research, user research, pricing decisions, understanding P&Ls, etc. is what will set your apart.",

If you are a senior, I'm just going to focus on your experience.  What did you build?  Why did you build it?  What did you learn when you did it?  What mistakes did you make?  What would you do differently?\n\nIf we spend 30 minutes talking about products you were directly involved in, I will know everything I need to know about how good of a PM you are.\n\nI've also done my share of interns.  Of course, they've never built anything serious so you can't ask about that.  What I ask are theoretical questions.  \"You are the PM for X.  I am your target user persona.  Interview me to see if you should build feature Y.\"    Again, after thirty minutes, I know how your head works.  That's what matters.\n\nThere are three things that determine if you can do a job (any job):\n\n1. Ability\n2. Experience\n3. Knowledge\n\nStandard certs only give you #3, knowledge.  However #1 and #2 are your best indicators for success.  #3 is also the easiest to fix.  If you suck at estimating, I can send you to an estimating class.  If you are not passionate about customers, I can't fix that.  Juniors are interviewed to see if they have #1.  If they do, #2 will come and I can give them #3.  Seniors should have #1 and #2.  If you have been doing this job then I assume you know how to learn and #3 will take care of it's self.\n\nSo, no.  I don't interview based on knowledge.  It's pointless.\n\nApologies if this offends folks, just relating my personal experience.\n\nOh, BTW, if you want to know why this technique works, read this book:  [https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU](https://a.co/d/1Dy4wzU)",

But only if the education attacks your blind spots instead of polishing your badge wall.\n\nLong-winded answer: As a long-time PM, former programmer, now with a front-row seat to training and coaching, here's how I see the blind spots shake out across four common JTBDs and personas.\n\n(*Buckle up kids, I'm pretty passionate about this particular topic so this is going to go really long*)\n\nI've watched (and lived) what happens when technical backgrounds get dragged into the cold fluorescent light of business reality. Unit economics that bite back. Market forces that don't care how elegant your architecture is. Pricing and positioning that feel less like spreadsheets and more like knife fights in a dark parking lot. Business cases where you learn the difference between \"this is cool\" and \"this gets funded.\" Stuff that rewires how you see the problem through a P&L lens, not just how you format the PRD.\n\nI've witnessed (with some schadenfreude) MBA-types sweat when they have to drag strategy down from the mountaintop and make it survive first contact with engineers who actually build things. Discovery that doesn't devolve into cosplay. Shaping work so it can actually ship instead of dying as a catchy positioning statement. Turning narrative into decision instead of another deck that fossilizes in Confluence. Learning that execution isn't beneath strategy, it's where strategy goes to get judged.\n\nI've observed people from design or support backgrounds grow product leadership teeth. Real teeth. Prioritization under real constraint with real economic and strategic leverage. Surviving feature-hostage negotiations with sponsors and stakeholders by saying no ... or at least not yet ... without napalming trust. Translating raw customer pain into financial and opportunity trade-offs that hold up when the CFO squints and the CEO asks, \"And then what?\" Empathy, yes. But empathy with a balance sheet taped to it.\n\nAnd I've seen marketing and sales folks slow down long enough to learn how the sausage actually gets made. Learn the how Design thinking combined with Systems thinking avoids expensive failures. Deliberate delivery in trade-offs rather than HiPPO tirades. Technical feasibility conversations that don't end in promises engineering never made and that are metaphysically impossible. Living inside ambiguity longer than a quarterly quota permits. Learning that not everything persuasive is possible, not everything possible is worth building, and that PM is more than feeding the feature factory's endless appetite.\n\nPoint is: good education doesn't teach you new words. It gives you new scars. It fills gaps you didn't know were load-bearing and makes you uncomfortable in productive ways.\n\nThe certs you listed do exactly what they're designed to do. They teach the commonly Googled. The shared vocabulary. The stuff that clears HR filters and makes everyone nod in meetings. Useful. Necessary. Not sufficient if you want to advance into product leadership.\n\nSo yes, education can be worth it. Just don't collect it like trading cards. Find the kind that forces you to confront the parts of the job you've been avoiding.\n\nI'd name specific programs and training vendors, but this sub has prohibitions to keep this channel from becoming a billboard for unpaid shilling and low-effort spam. Full disclosure: I now teach product management after decades as a PM who waited too long to fill the business-side gaps I didn't know were load-bearing.\n\nTLDR: Fill gaps. Don't collect credentials.",

Support, MarTech, data, platform, etc. \n\nWithout oversharing about myself this is what I was able to do. \n\nFrom what I’ve seen producer is kiiiiinda a mix of a Product and Project manager. Watching people in those roles it both feels like that blend and at times a whole other role I just don’t know haha. \n\nWish you the best of luck mate. Took me a long time to get into the auxiliary role but, to me, was well worth it.",

          "text": "I worked as a product manager for a couple small game companies for about 10 years.  In my experience, the dev studios don’t usually have people in the role, but they will usually have someone handling production or project management with some overlap in responsibility.  Publishers, though, will more likely have a dedicated product manager or two.\n\nYou’re probably more likely to get hired as a product manager without prior games experience, than as a producer, even if there are fewer roles out there.  A challenge though, is that studios will often have someone already in-house that can fill the role, even if they don’t have someone full-time.  Both are often hired internally, from people who are already familiar with the studio’s games, players and processes.\n\nIf you’re determined, start applying.  I’d also recommend actually learning another related skill, too.  The barrier to “be a game dev” is quite low, which actually works against you if you’re applying alongside people who have actually worked on game projects, but don’t have any under your belt.\n\nFinally, be careful to set appropriate expectations about job satisfaction.  The pay is usually lower than in literally any other industry, especially without games experience.  Game companies can seem cool from the outside, but the culture can be wildly different from studio to studio.  Personally, I saw product management in a “regular” company more rewarding; most other industries have a lot more organizational support and resources available to maintain a product management function, than what you get in the games industry.",

In fact, from what I see, the industry is generally very old school, with no real product-style way of working.\n\nThe second thing to say is that it is not a good industry to work in. It is brutally exploitative and badly run. Most of the folks I know who work in it, earn considerably less than equivalent roles in other industries (even folks in big studios working on high budget games) and lots of them fucking hate their jobs, their management, the work, etc.\n\nThe problem is that there is a huge supply of folks who are eager to work in gaming, because they are fans, and so there is huge competition, and and endless supply of fresh meat for the grinder, as folks get burnt out by the hours and low pay and leave, simply to be replaced by someone younger, cheaper, and full of passion for a few years.\n\nMy overall recommendation is *don't*",

That means synthesizing across docs, notes, and prior decisions — and being explicit when things are unclear.\n2. **Source grounding + uncertainty** It should always show where an answer comes from and be able to say “I don’t know” instead of confidently hallucinating.\n3. **Continuous knowledge capture** If decisions are made in meetings, calls, Slack, etc., the knowledge base needs a way to capture and structure that — otherwise it decays immediately.\n4. **Context over keywords** Asking “How do we handle X?” should work even if the relevant doc is titled something completely different.\n5. **Low friction for updates** If maintaining the system feels like work, people won’t do it. The best setups reduce the effort to almost zero.\n\nAfter trying wiki tools, Notion-style search, and various “AI over documents” approaches, we realized the missing piece wasn’t better search — it was treating operational knowledge and decisions as first-class citizens, not just files.\n\nA simple test when evaluating tools:\n\n>Ask the same question three different ways.\n\n>If the answers aren’t consistent, grounded, and actionable, it’s just a smarter search bar.\n\nIf you want to share more context (team size, regulated vs non-regulated, how decisions are made), that usually changes what the *right* solution looks like.",

          "text": "Like anything, feature flags can be awesome or they can be hell on earth.  It totally depends on how you handle them.\n\nFirst, I would strongly suggest that FF usage is temporary.  That is to say, FF are used to roll out new features and thus have a finite and discrete lifespan.  Over time, they add up so you need to actively purge them.  I usually say that once a feature is 100% rolled out, the FF gets removed.  At that point, if if you find a problem, it's just a bug and you handle it the normal way.\n\nSecond, you need a strong release management process.  Unless you have a written down process, then things will get messy because every feature team will do things differently.  You don't need to have a massive bureaucracy, just a simple written agreement about how you release new features that everyone has read and understands.\n\nThird, PM should be the ones turning FFs on and off in production.  We ultimately own the feature and thus we are the only ones who can approve rollout.  By taking direct control of the FF process, you ensure that PM is responsible for new features.  PM then coordinates with PgmMgt to drive the release process.\n\nHere is how we did it in a past company:\n\n1) Every epic had as part of the description:  FF Required?  We actually changed the Jira template and this was a custom field.  When a feature gets approved (i.e. before code is written) we discuss how much impact this has on the user experience and we decide if the FF is needed or not.  Right up front.  Test tools need to be FF aware so you can test all your variations of FF on or off.  This adds up quickly, see my comment about killing FF as soon as you can.\n\n2) Every other Friday, there was a FF turn on meeting.  This was a pretty big product so we had features coming along during every sprint (2 week sprints).  If a feature team wanted something on, they would present it to the FF meeting.  All of the leads were there (mktg, design, PM, eng, PgmMgt, etc.).  We would discuss the new feature, perhaps get a demo if we hadn't seen it and approve FF on.  Part of that is that you would tell us about your rollout plan.  It was also a final control point to ensure that features met UX guidelines, were tested properly, etc. \n\n3) PgmMgt would then follow up on your rollout plan.  If you completed your plan, the FF would be removed.  If you were struggling, you would go back to the friday meeting.  Then we would talk about what was going on with your feature and either give you more time, you send you back to re-plan.\n\nIf you have a small team, this is probably just a quick chat during standup.  In the example above, we had twenty different scrum teams so there was a ton of things to keep track of.",

You’re right to ask about guardrails, and it's critical to have these in place because not everyone will stay disciplined, and you’ll need to tie in ownership too. \n\nWithout getting into the weeds, we basically created buckets for our flags and categorized everything so we could actively stop people from using the incorrect flag (or the same flag for everything). It was a drag, but it worked. We then took it a step further by implementing timelines for experiments that had strict requirements and controls in place. \n\nIf you have a strong team where you can assign ownership and trust that it’ll be managed, what worked for us was assigning the feature flag to an owner to manage and ensure that person was responsible for maintaining the process until it ended. We didn't have any cleanup issues, and it stopped people from creating duplicate and orphan flags. There’s a lot more that we did, but this is a good step in the right direction.\n\nOne big lesson for me was that whatever issues you’re currently experiencing are probably less about feature flags and more about what's going on internally. So try to get some processes in place, and see if there’s a good level of ownership and maturity to help support this process.\n\nGood luck!",

But I want to get a picture of what a typical day / week / month looks like for you as a PM (seniority, tenure aside) - tools are you using, how you set yourself and team up, the cadence of customer calls, roadmap calls, joining sales calls, delivery cadence. Basically I want to see how you get your work done, that maybe the simple way to put it. DM if your up for a chat or share some of your wisdom in a reply.\n\nMuch appreciated (and hope this isn’t breaking the rules)",

Mornings are usually stakeholder syncs, roadmap tradeoffs, unblock this now conversations. Afternoons are deeper work if you protect them docs, PRDs, reviewing designs, thinking through sequencing. Customer calls come in waves usually tied to deals or escalations rather than a clean cadence.\n\nTool wise it’s usually a messy stack. Jira and Confluence for execution and docs, some form of product analytics, spreadsheets that refuse to die, and a higher level planning layer to keep capacity and timelines honest once things get big. I’ve seen teams use things like Aha, Productboard, Smartsheet, or Celoxis in that middle space when Jira alone stops being enough.\n\nWhat surprised me most at enterprise scale is how much of the job is just creating clarity. Making sure people agree on what problem we’re solving this quarter, what is explicitly not happening, and who actually owns what. The work doesn’t move because of tools, it moves because you keep forcing alignment back into the system.\n\nHappy to chat if you want to compare notes. DM is fine.",

Lately I’ve been seeing roles titled “Agent Product Manager” or “AI Agent PM”, especially at AI-native startups.\n\nFrom the outside, they seem to involve working closely with specific customers or verticals and translating real workflows into AI/agent-powered solutions. There appears to be overlap with product management, but also a heavier emphasis on customer-specific implementation and delivery.\n\nI’m curious:\n\n* How do you generally view these roles?\n* Do they feel like a strong career move, a lateral shift, or something else?\n* Has anyone worked as an Agent PM or closely with one? What was it actually like?\n* Where do people in these roles tend to go next?\n\nTrying to understand how folks with real experience think about the tradeoffs.\n\nExample listings:  \n[https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Sierra/effd7cd2-8a28-4bae-a3b8-40720ba09717](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Sierra/effd7cd2-8a28-4bae-a3b8-40720ba09717)\n\n[https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/decagon/c88f32ef-8fb2-4ade-a4e2-1b1e399b42c5](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/decagon/c88f32ef-8fb2-4ade-a4e2-1b1e399b42c5)\n\n[https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/harvey/2cbe13b9-a44b-47d3-abb8-45d9a98b05f6](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/harvey/2cbe13b9-a44b-47d3-abb8-45d9a98b05f6)",

Not bad, just different.

Both kinda fizzled.\n\nMobile PM was actually a specialized thing early on but that one evolved differently. Eventually mobile just became part of being a PM instead of a separate role, since every product needed mobile. Could see AI agents going that route too where in a few years it's just expected baseline knowledge.\n\nVoice/Alexa PMs were also a thing for a bit. Cloud PM roles existed too but those were less about specialization and more about enterprise sales cycles being different.\n\nThe pattern I noticed was the ones who did okay either pivoted back to general PM work or went deep enough to become actual experts in the space. The ones who struggled were people chasing the trend without really caring about the underlying tech. When the hype cycle moved on they didn't have transferable skills or deep expertise, just buzzwords on their resume.",

That's just a strange order of operations to me.\n\nThat being said, to answer your question about good move or not, AI experience is good for the resume right now. Having agentic experience has helped me get a lot of interviews, even for roles not labeled as AI/Agent PMs. I think even if agentic experiences dry up because they're not profitable, no one is gonna fault you in a year or two if you move back to a more traditionally scoped PM role.",

So useage is inconsistent, and tied mainly to how critical I feel the decision is.\n\nI have been places that had better structures around this. For major decisions, you had to present the decision to a board of relevant folks in the area, and get it signed off, this was then logged as a decision, and a printed form physically signed (I know.. XD, but it worked)\n\nThe place I am currently at is very disorganised and unstructured in that sense.

Early PM work feels tangible because you can point to what you shipped. Later on, the real building is alignment, expectations, and deciding what not to touch because the downstream cost is too high. I have heard a lot of PMs say they miss the clarity of the early phase, but not the surprise consequences that came with it. The ones who seem most at peace are the ones who reframed building as shaping outcomes over time, not artifacts. Do you feel like the tradeoff work at least leads to fewer bad surprises, or does it still feel abstract day to day?",

Three rounds of interviews, all went well. Then came the take-home: \"Design and prototype an end-to-end AI system.\" Something within their product space.\n\nI spent about 1-2 weeks building a functional prototype with a detailed design doc. Submitted and followed up twice - complete radio silence since then. They were in contact before submission. Then I see the role posted again a few weeks later. Still nothing from them.\n\nHere's what's bugging me. The scope feels weird for a take-home. It wasn't \"show us how you think\" or \"design an approach.\" It was literally build a working system. For a PM role. That's closer to consulting work than an interview assignment. I didn't share the code with them, but I built a multi-agent framework with near complete backend and frontend at this point.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe this is just how some companies operate and I should chalk it up to experience.\n\nHow common is this kind of thing? Have you seen take-homes that felt more like free consulting? Do you set hard limits on take-home scope? What are the actual red flags I should watch for? In hindsight, what would you have done differently?\n\nI want to calibrate for next time. Where's the line between \"thorough evaluation\" and \"we just got a free POC\"?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or similar experiences. Not looking to name anyone or start drama, genuinely just trying to learn what's normal here.",

I ask how long they expect it to take and I cap my effort explicitly. If they want something bigger, I push for a live session or a paid trial project. In hindsight, I would have reduced the scope hard or kept it at a design level only. This kind of thing is unfortunately not rare, but it is also a good filter. Teams that respect candidates usually respect time and follow up, even with a no.",

I typically write an initial story in our software project management system (we use Atono).

If working on an existing screen I also provide a screenshot of the screen.

It's boring, repetitive, and it should feel a bit heavy. Here is the 'workout' that actually moved the needle for me:\n\n1. Forensic Strategy: Don’t just read the news. When a company like Slack changes its pricing or Netflix buys a gaming studio, don't just say 'cool.' Force yourself to map out exactly what they are giving up to make that move. What are they deprioritizing? Who are they willing to piss off?\n\n2. The 'Where Not to Play' Rule: Pick a product you use every day. Write down three features they should build, and then force yourself to pick the two they should never touch—and defend why. Strategy shows up in the 'no's.'\n\n3. Paper Trading: Write your logic down. If you don't commit it to paper, your brain will trick you into thinking you 'knew it all along' once the results come in.\n\nForget the lectures. You don't need another framework; you need reps. You need to pressure-test your judgment until the trade-offs start feeling obvious.",

          "text": "Short answer: yes. For the humble.  \nLong answer: yes, but only if you’re willing to let education hit you where you’re soft.\n\n(*Seat belts on, PM peeps. I’m fired up on this one and driving, so we’re taking the scenic route and ignoring the word-count GPS.*)\n\nAt ~8 years in, most PMs don’t lack knowledge. You already speak PM-esperanto. You can recite OKRs, discovery, alignment, and outcomes like a catechism. The problem is fluency can turn into product management theater.\n\nWhat’s missing are the blind spots you’ve been quietly tip-toeing around like creaky floorboards.\n\nI’ve watched engineers-turned-PMs, myself included, walk into exec meetings swinging tech jargon when the room wanted unit economics. That’s not courage. That’s showing up to a gunfight with a foam pool noodle and insisting it’s “technically superior.” Markets don’t care. Pricing definitely doesn’t care. Funding cares even less.\n\nI’ve watched strategy-first PMs learn that strategy without delivery is just astrology for adults. Execution isn’t beneath strategy. It’s where strategy gets cross-examined by reality.\n\nI’ve seen designers and support folks graduate from backlog babysitting to real product leadership. Prioritization under constraint. Feature-hostage negotiations where “not yet” lands without detonating trust. Empathy, yes. But empathy with a balance sheet duct-taped to its forehead.\n\nI’ve watched sales and marketing backgrounds slow down long enough to learn how the sausage actually gets made. Why feasibility matters. Why promises decay. Why not everything persuasive is possible, and not everything possible is worth building.\n\nThat’s what good education does. It doesn’t give you new words. It gives you new scars. It exposes gaps you didn’t realize were load-bearing until something cracked.\n\nMost certifications do exactly what they’re designed to do. Shared language. HR filters. Synchronized head-nodding. Useful. Necessary. But they won’t save you from becoming a very articulate feature-factory foreman.\n\nFull disclosure: I teach product now, after decades as a PM who waited far too long to fill some very expensive business-side gaps. I’ve lived most of these mistakes personally.\n\nHappy to share specific course recommendations over DM so this thread doesn’t turn into a billboard and get nuked from orbit.\n\nTL;DR: fill gaps. Don’t polish the badge wall.",

Coursera / edX courses** – Something like “Digital Product Management” from University of Virginia or “Agile Development” courses are practical and easy to digest.

          "text": "After 8 years as a PM, here's my honest take: certifications aren't your best ROI at this stage.\n\nWith your experience level, you already know the fundamentals. You've shipped products, worked cross-functionally, and made real-world trade off. The bottleneck most experienced PMs face isn't knowledge. Rather structured communication.\n\nHere's the reality: most PMs become good at the job before they become good at interviewing for the job. Good PMs get promoted internally. Good PMs who are also strong interviewers? They get hired, often with significant salary bumps.\n\nYour next role isn't decided by how well you perform day-to-day-it's decided in 4-5 hours of interviews. Yet most experienced PMs spend hundreds of hours improving their craft and almost no time practicing how to articulate their impact, structure their stories, or navigate difficult interview scenarios.\n\nLet’s PM our own career, shall we? :)\n- Certifications: $500-$3,000, marginal hiring impact at your level\n- Interview coaching: $1,000-$20,000, but can result in $20K to $50K+ salary increases (plus compounding over your career)\n\nI run a PM career coaching business (full disclosure), but I'm not pitching my services here. I genuinely believe that at 8 years of experience, your best investment is learning to tell your story better, structure your product thinking in interviews, and negotiate effectively.\n\nIf you're set on formal learning, consider tactical skills that differentiate you: data analysis (SQL, analytics), technical depth (working with APIs, system design basics), or specialized domain knowledge (AI/ML, fintech, healthcare). But even these work best when you can clearly articulate them in interviews.\n\nHappy to answer questions if this perspective is helpful.",

A lot of PM work is waiting, observing, connecting dots and making sure the right things happen, not staying busy. If you want to use that time better, I’d focus on digging deeper into user problems, sharpening requirements, talking more with stakeholders and proactively shaping what’s coming next instead of reacting.",

If collecting and reporting feedback is slowing you down that much, you're probably over-indexing on analysis and under-indexing on action.\n\nMost good PMs I know keep feedback gathering lightweight - talk to users, identify patterns, make a call, move on. Not build elaborate decks for every decision.

You can respond to the stakeholders with something like \"Unless we believe new feedback could materially change the decision, I think it’s responsible to place the bet and monitor outcomes\".\n\nI agree that deep user feedback is critical — but one thing that’s helped me is being explicit about **when feedback is “directionally sufficient” vs. when it’s still exploratory**.\n\nI try to separate three phases clearly with stakeholders:\n\n**1) Discovery → are we learning anything new?**  \nOnce feedback starts repeating and new inputs no longer change the decision set, I treat that as *signal saturation*. At that point, more feedback increases confidence marginally but delays action materially.\n\n**2) Decision readiness → do we have enough to place a bet?**  \nI anchor on a small set of decision criteria up front (user impact, business impact, risk, reversibility). If additional feedback wouldn’t change the choice against those criteria, we move forward.\n\n**3) Validation → what will we monitor post-decision?**  \nInstead of extending discovery, we shift feedback collection into leading indicators and guardrails after launch.\n\nThis framing has helped reset expectations: the goal isn’t *maximum* feedback, it’s *sufficient* feedback to make a responsible decision and learn forward.\n\nFor future, you could create a decision criteria upfront and then you can use \"We agreed on the decision criteria upfront. At this point, additional feedback isn’t changing how the options score against those criteria.”\n\nHope this is helpful!

Now I already have a thought in mind of what problem space looks like and how we might go about addressing it. I present a pitch of the problem space, why it is important to solve, and what is the financial upside. If leadership wants more data, I go get it later, but they usually don't.\n\n2.

Used CleverX to get the right user segments fast - worked well for getting specific types of users quickly. Learned that most people just don't read announcements or changelogs at all.\n\nWhat actually worked after that research: contextual \"new\" badges where the feature lives. Not fullscreen announcements (people swipe those away in under 2 seconds). Show the hint when users are doing something related, not randomly.\n\nAlso selective emails to existing users worked okay. We did one for a major feature and got decent adoption.

          "text": "These are all PM competencies.  But when it comes to being evaluated on these? Two main critiques here:\n\n(1,2,3,6) is trying to make a science out of a qualitative observation.  If you truly wanted to optimize for what’s outlined here, your best route is to overly and needlessly nurture relationships with each individual engineer so they give you good marks.  Ultimately this is framing things in a vacuum.  (1) PRD Quality is 99% of the time not the reason why a sprint might go over in my experience - this is not very measurable - how unclear was the PRD? How much exactly did that lack of clarity contribute to the delay? (2) Sprint scope contribution - how close you are with the tech lead? How exactly were your contributions meaningful? It might almost bias you to forcefully contribute when you have no idea what you’re talking about.  (3) Responsiveness - are your notifications on and do your engineers like you. (6) Do your engineers like you\n\n(4,5) These motivate you to overestimate sprints and initiatives.  If you’re only measured by if a sprint has completed, might as well sandbag and get “100% sprint completion and on time delivery” every time.  This also only works well for incredibly mature products which have very far line of sight and deep team understanding.  This would be ridiculous to measure for any greenfield product or at a startup - you don’t know what you don’t know and that’s ok.  Be antifragile and deal with new information properly.  Delays happen, but you should push towards a business result. \n\nAll in all I think the only way to properly measure a PM is by their ability to drive impact.  Have them set an OKR, make sure it’s specific, relevant, and measurable.  Make sure they’re not sand bagging by breaking down assumptions.  And track the teams performance against that OKR.  Ultimately the PM is responsible for the success or failure of a product.  You could be 100% sprint complete for the whole quarter, have the clearest PRD, run scrums like a machine and deliver a failed product - you shouldn’t reward or optimize for this.\n\nI’ve never seen a scorecard system like this before (fintech 2 large cos and 2 startups) and quite frankly think it misses the essence of what a PM is responsible for.",

Like yeah, PMs should be accountable, but getting scored every single sprint by engineers on \"responsiveness\" and \"clarity\" sounds like a recipe for PMs just focusing on keeping devs happy instead of actually building the right thing.\n\nAlso \"perceived impact\" is vague as hell. Who's perceiving it? What if you're working on unglamorous but necessary tech debt?\n\nThe real question: does this actually make the product better, or does it just create a bunch of defensive behavior where PMs over-document everything and avoid hard conversations because it might hurt their scorecard?\n\nHow common is it? Not very, at least not to this level. Most places do quarterly reviews, not per-sprint evaluation.",

Everyone will score very highly and then get laid off in the next downcycle.**\n\n**1) waste of time;  \"a shared document is not a shared understanding\"** (Jeff Patton, user story mapping)  \nIndividuals interacting is what matters, not verbose detail.  If you need verbose detail, split the story.  Remember when we used 3x5 index cards?  That constraint was there for a good reason.  Bloated verbose stories NEVER work and always have errors.  Small slicing feels less efficient but has fewer slips, lapses, mistakes and rework.\n\n2) **No such thing as Sprint Scope; you have a Sprint Goal that is based on a (measurable) business outcome,**  Measure that outcome, and use that as the basis for performance.  That's the only thing that matters.  Deliver multiple times within a Sprint to get feedback on your progress towards the goal.  Ruthlessly improve your DveOps and XP practices until that's a reality.   \n  \n**3) waste of time.**  STOP using JIRA as a communication channel.  Talk to each other, a lot.  Involve the developers in user story mapping.  Don't give them solutions to implement.  Written communication is always less effective, with delays and comprehension layers.  If you work is so unsafe you need to CYA, fix that first.   \n  \n**4) Kind of agree on this**;  UAT is your last-line-of-defense as part of your layered \"shift left, build quality in\" mindset.  But it's the whole team here, not the PM - escaped defects bad is a good idea though.  Don't blame the goal keeper because the attackers, midfield and defenders didn't keep control of the ball.   \n  \n**5) utter bollocks.** This is nothing to do with Scrum or effectiveness in the role.  Allowing this kind of bollocks into your org is already a red flag that the SMs are not effective at educating or influencing the org,  Where's the stuff on team learning and growth?  Nah.   \n  \n6) **I like this better** but it really should be something you as a team talk about in your retrospectives, always \n\n**7) \"Post release activities\"  lol.**  \nMeasure the value you created within the Sprint.  Release continually.",

The requirements were already written and I did have a chance to change some things before Q1 planning based on customer convos.\n\nI am having anxiety that the MVP will deliver small value to a very small set of customers/users (<10%). Our plans for this product are awesome, will deliver tons of value, but will take extensive development.\n\nI've been in Product for over 5 years but this is my first time building a product of this magnitude from nothing. Looking for advice on how to stay optimistic with such a large challenge ahead & continue to deliver consistent value quickly once this MVP is released next year.\n\nETA: (my company is not a startup & this is not the core product)",

Not urgent - not going to pay for it. Not prevalent - even if people pay for it, there may not be enough of them to make your product commercially viable. \nSome good questions to consider:\n1. Is 10% based on the problem set I can address now? How big will that customer base slice become once I move beyond the MVP?\n2. How do customers solve the problem today? What painpoints they have with existing solutions?\n3. What are other vendors doing? What will you do that is unique, differentiated from what's available in the market?\n4. Will this be a brand new product? Can it attach to any other products your company is selling?",

ONE of these new contracts is worth $40M/year and that's just one customer. Other customers have decided to stick with us instead of looking at our competition because of what my team is building, but this is such a \"niche\" (and expensive) feature that it will be used by a small number of our largest enterprise customers.\n\nThat 10% might not sound like a lot, but the balance sheet tells a different story.",

MVPs often deliver meaningful value to a small slice of users, not breadth. That’s kind of the point. Low initial adoption usually means you still have room to learn and iterate without causing large-scale damage.\n\nWhat helped me in similar situations was separating “MVP success” from “product success”. The MVP’s job is to validate direction and assumptions, not to justify the full roadmap.\n\nIf you can clearly show what you learned, what changed, and how each iteration compounds value, you’re doing real PM work even if adoption is <10% initially.",

Ideally the founder has the first best idea, ie the vision.  What I think I have become better at is execution. Synthesis, being the glue, connecting the functions and seeing the patterns.  And then shipping and making customers happy. \n\nTo me that is where I add value not necessarily “making money” and there’s a range of insights about our purpose if you  agree.\n\nDo others disagree ?

You can be working on the right things, but again, the larger the company, the more that taking those things to market end up being done by other functions and you have to influence those functions, you do not own them.\n\nTo be clear, these are all B2B SaaS comments and again, no PLG motions, where I think the answer would be different if you were say, a B2C PM or you have a PLG motion in your B2B SaaS Product.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an AI product where I use an AI as judge to evaluate how well the product is doing. Basically, I run e-vals using the AI to get a score on different criteria. The tricky part is that if I run these evaluations multiple times, I often get different results each time. For example, one run might flag certain issues and another run will catch a completely different set of issues or give me a different pass rate.\n\nThis leaves me in a weird spot because I’m not sure if I’m actually improving the product or just seeing random variance in the AI’s scoring. Other than running the AI multiple times and averaging the results (or taking a union of all the different failures it spots), I’m not sure how to get a consistent measure.\n\nHas anyone else faced this kind of inconsistency when using AI for evaluation? I’d love to hear if there are smarter ways to stabilize the scores or any best practices to make sure I can trust the results over time. Thanks!",

If you treat the output like a deterministic test, it’ll drive you a bit mad.\n\nA few things that usually help in practice:\n\nFirst, tighten the evaluation prompt way more than feels natural. Explicit rubrics, scoring scales with definitions, and examples of what a “good” vs “bad” answer looks like reduce variance a lot. Vague criteria almost guarantee drift run to run.\n\nSecond, fix everything you can. Temperature as low as possible, same model version, same prompt ordering, same input formatting. Small differences compound more than people expect.\n\nThird, stop thinking of a single run as truth. What tends to work better is treating evals as trend signals. If scores move consistently over time across multiple runs, you’re improving. If they bounce randomly, you probably aren’t. Averaging or majority voting is boring, but effective.\n\nFourth, separate discovery from measurement. Let the model be loose and exploratory when you want to find issues. Then lock down a stricter eval for tracking progress. Mixing those two goals in one judge usually causes confusion.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen eventually accept that AI judges are closer to noisy sensors than unit tests. Once you design around that reality, confidence comes from consistency of direction, not identical scores every run.",

That’s where the noise creeps in.\n\nOn the discovery vs measurement point, think of it like this. In discovery mode, you let the evaluator be opinionated and loose. You ask things like “what’s weak here,” “what feels off,” or “what would confuse a PM.” You expect variance because you’re learning. Those outputs are for insight, not scoring.\n\nMeasurement mode is much narrower. You freeze the criteria and only ask things that can be judged consistently. For example, instead of “is this a good product question,” you score specific dimensions like clarity of prompt, presence of a real tradeoff, and whether there’s enough context to make a decision. Each dimension should be something the evaluator can say yes or no to with minimal interpretation.\n\nIf I were to improve one eval, I’d start by removing any language that asks the model to infer intent or quality holistically. Replace it with concrete checks. Does the question force a prioritization decision. Does it include constraints. Is there a clear failure mode. Those tend to be much more stable run to run.\n\nOnce you separate those two modes, the system usually feels a lot saner. You explore with one prompt, then measure progress with a much stricter, almost boring one.",

It’s hurting my confidence and I’m having nightmares of failing / being fired. I also feel embarrsed because I championed this product hard pre-launch internally in the company to get people excited and get things done. \n\n1. Any PM (not founder) was successful in getting PMF for B2C two sided marketplace product? How did you do it? \n\n2. How do you convince the leadership that you need to change the value proposition and that the current one does not work? (Their assumption is that we could be doing more with markering without making changes to our value proposition) \n\n3. When do you know it’s time to give up? And when do you keep trying? ",

If I were you, I'd start with existing customers and then improve the product accordingly to market it further.

          "text": "I have bootstrapped a business, built B2C and D2C products, and this is what my views are on your query. Few questions:\n\n1. Why do you think you are failing to achieve PMF? Did you research the problem statement before building the solution? If yes, go to the same research sample (target users) and ask them to test the product and share their feedback. This can do 2 things - help you get organic users, get early feedback and window to iterate before product gets adopted by larger audience\n2. Can you define two sided marketplace product? Is it something like an amazon which has apps for buyers as well as sellers?\n\n  \nFor marketplace applications, following factors shall be considered to achieve PMF -\n\n1. First, you need to very careful and analytic to clear in validating / rejecting your hypothesis. Ensuring that no assumptions were made while solving for the problem statement. As often times companies end up building solution that they only thought will solve a problem, that never existed.\n2. Instead of planning to acquire users through paid traffic, focus on building a community around your product. \n3. Define a metric that can make you strongly say that this is the moment when the product can be considered as PMF. A lot signs are when you start getting referred customers, or constant feedbacks or feature requests. \n\n\n\nChanging the value proposition, the leadership will ask why was it at the first place present? what assumptions were considered, what insights were validated? and why do you think it is not working? do you need to completely scrap it or you require an enhancements? if yes why? So basically you need to find answers to these questions and it will surely help you convince them! Though this time they would want you to come up with even stronger insights on why the next feature shall now be the core offering.\n\nThe time that clearly states that a product is not working is when you figure out that even after making multiple iterations in the product, GTM strategies, the users are just not sticking or using the product.",
