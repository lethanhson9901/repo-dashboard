For the fuckwits at Google who have apparently never used their maps app to navigate walking around unfamiliar cities, that goes double.\n\nWho the fuck is this feature for?  What does the persona look like for the typical user who;\n\n* Knows the gesture exists, and;\n* Remembers it when they're having a problem they want to report, and;\n* And is willing to shake their phone like a fucking ape out in public / on a train / in a meeting when they have an issue.\n\nThis feels less like \"we implemented this pattern because user telemetry data shows that our average user is a fucking moron who shakes their phone when they're confused by it\" and more like \"these other apps do it and we need feature parity.\"",

Something doesn't work right so you \"shake it in frustration and it asks what it can do better\". \n\nI've seen successful (and very unsuccessful) implementations where embedding a responsive trigger aimed at \"frustration\" moments can delight unexpectedly, capture/route the user momentum into feedback (like a bug report) that may have otherwise been missed. \n\nI suspect it went through a curve very quickly, and is more in annoying than clever. Especially as interactions that stick around tend to go through some dynamic of sophisticated, normalized, and expected.\n\nInteractions like these can spread quickly and be great, but also dilute quickly, such as the early effectiveness of gen AI on LinkedIn or Substack, which becomes less effective (and likeable) as it permeates.\n\nHaven't thought about that for a while, thanks for that OP.",

Here are a few ways I have used it and found it very effective:\n\nA) During discovery, I added all the data that I had in the folders. These were: all the data I got from 3 competitors (I used CC for that), support tickets exported from Zendesk, user interviews, and feedback from stakeholders (sales and customer service). I then used CC for the following questions:\n\n* What are the top 3 pain points? (Top = shared the most number of times) \n* Who mentioned them (pattern by user type) \n* Direct quotes that capture the pain \n* What are the contradictions between users? \n\nAnd a lot more. It helped me to narrow down the problem.\n\nB) I created 3 skills. One each for a principal engineer, a principal designer, and the founder. Then I asked CC to challenge the first draft of our Q1 2026 OKRs (yes, we’re late) as if it were each of them.\n\nThe feedback I got before taking this to the real people was honestly incredible.\n\nLikewise, I have already found some amazing use-cases. I think the tool has definitely helped me think through my decisions and thoughts. And it's surely special, mainly because of its ability to have the context all the time.",

I’m now trying to be more intentional about improving these skills and would love some practical advice or resources on how to do this and what has worked for you. \n\nI understand these are skills that are mostly developed through experience but I’d really appreciate pointers or even case studies that can help. I’ve been practicing but without the right approach it feels counterproductive.\n\nI’m specifically interested in:\n- How you evaluate opportunity size and decide what to build vs what not to build\n- How you define a clear product strategy that actually guides decisions\n- How you connect company goals to product bets in a concrete way\n- How you get better at identifying the right problems to solve, not just shipping solutions\n- Any frameworks, mental models, or exercises that made strategy “click” for you\n- How product leaders think about strategy differently from mid-level PMs",

When we decide features, we use RICE, when we decide MVP scope, we use MoSCoW etc.\n\n\n\n I would also say it depends on business goals too. If you're looking to augment specific KPIs, how will those features help. Not many features or items will increase EVERY metric, you have to teeter totter with knowing the pros and cons of each item.\n\n  \n2. If you think of your product strategy from a today POV you're only using yesterday's facts, you need to think about where you think your product will be in 3-5 years and what that domain looks like. How can we build steps to the second floor if we don't know where the second floor will be kind of thinking. \n\nThe steps can change, heck even the 2nd floor can change but the general idea is there's a second floor and you need to aim for it with specific items.\n\n  \n3. Experiment boards, run experiments that have business goals in line within your product. Example would be more subscribed users, run different pricing promos, trim the onboarding process etc\n\n  \n4. Not every problem has a solution, but every solution had a problem. Group your problems together, run problem analyses and tackle the problem at large not individually\n\n5. Problem > Idea > Data Validation > Solution > Data Validation > Build > Iterate. It's not a frame work or a model, but it's what I've used for a while in 3 platforms for 0-1s. \n\n6. Not so much a product leader, but I was a founding PM. It all came down to revenue goals for me when I was a founding PM. My CEO didn't care about users, kpis etc. Just wanted to know the P&Ls",

Any company that's any good shouldn't care about the ideas that you have, only that you are making reasonable assumptions, can bring in your knowledge to the problem and that you ways of thinking are sound.\n\nBest of luck!",

You have to actually do user research and develop a product strategy and vision, validate hypotheses, and iterate.\n\nI'd say mid size companies are the sweet spot, you don't typically have the founder product dictation of an early startup, and you don't have the bureaucracy of a big company either - so hopefully you can go fast and also own the product direction for your area.",

A lot of PMs end up stuck in execution even when they’re actively trying to grow, especially if day to day delivery pressure keeps pulling them back into the weeds.\n\nOne thing to be mindful of is that improving product sense or strategy on its own usually doesn’t unlock more autonomy or promotions if that's your broader goal. Leadership tends to respond more to whether they already see you as someone who owns a narrative, not just someone who executes well. How you frame problems, tradeoffs, and impact upward often carries more weight than adding another skill.\n\nGrowing those skills is still valuable, but it usually works best when it’s paired with being more intentional about how your work is understood.

This sounds simple but can be super complex if for example your company never agreed on what is the definition of an \"active user\". You can sharpen your metrics game by reading Lean Analytics by Alistair Croll.\n\n\n\n* How you define a clear product strategy that actually guides decisions\n   * Work from the abovementioned goal backwards. If you want to achieve that impact then what are the immediate steps? Organise work into milestones and make sure that at every milestone there is user recognisable value. Something that is visible for the user and measurable by metrics.\n\n\n\n* How you connect company goals to product bets in a concrete way\n   * Any product bet should impact some user or business metric. But those don't happen in a silo.\n   * Try to build a funnel. E.g.: you want to increase profit from car rentals? Profit = revenue-cost. Revenue=rented cars \\* days \\* daily price. Cost=leasing fee+insurance+maintenance.\n   * If you want to increase profit you have to make more money or spend less on the cost items. \n   * What can you build that can impact any of the components of your income or cost.\n\n\n\n* How you get better at identifying the right problems to solve, not just shipping solutions\n   * Use the above metric game to identify which one has more chance to move a number meaningfully. To find it out you can do data analysis (quantitative analysis) and ask users for their feedback (qualitative analysis)\n\n\n\n* Any frameworks, mental models, or exercises that made strategy “click” for you\n   * I practised with consultatncy job applicants on a website called PrepLounge. If you become good at Consultancy interviews, you will nail the strategy questions!\n\n\n\n* How product leaders think about strategy differently from mid-level PMs\n   * PMs think: this feature moves that metric, making us more money.\n   * Leaders think: this big bet will make us this much profit and it will cost us that much in development cost. We have an opportunity cost of not working on that other initiative, but we secure our marketleading position for the next 12 months against competitor XYZ.",

All the info already exists. It's in Jira, Linear, ProductBoard, GitHub. I'm just copying and pasting from 4 different tools and rewriting it into sentences.\n\nSprint reviews, status emails, leadership updates - same info, different format.

They felt pointless, a waste of time, and yeah, the information is available in multiple places. I swore I would never ask my team to do such pointless work. \n\nNow I manage an organisation with 18 squads across 3 tribes, and every product manager handles their day to day SLIGHTLY differently. Some have details in confluence. Some in Figma boards. Some in PowerPoint. Some in Jira. Which I’m fine with because I want people to utilise things that work with their flows. But it makes my life 1000% more difficult, because I don’t have an easy way to find anything when I need to get answers, and it’s hard to easily stay on top of the overall state of things and know where I need to focus my attention. I cannot tell you how many times in the last few years I have thought “it would be so nice to just have an email from each product manager each week letting me know what’s going on.” And then I chastise myself. 😆 But honestly, I’m so close to asking for it. \n\nI know it sucks because when everything is fine, the report feels useless. But I need to know where things are fine vs where they’re not, or where I see dots that need connecting that aren’t, or any other number of factors I can see from a different perspective. I also get asked random questions from lots of folks, including the CEO, board members, and other VIPs that I’m expected to answer quickly. If that comes at 10pm, I don’t have the luxury of exploring 20 different sources and hoping I can figure out what different documents are saying. \n\nI would encourage you to find out who is really asking for your weekly reports, and ask them what would be useful within it. Hopefully you’ll find that someone is actually getting value, and it will make the exercise feel less pointless.",

We've settled on written team-level updates in an OKR planning tool that anyone in the org can see. My team often complains that it's copying the same info as Jira. I try to remind my teams that effective communication is a skill. It's unlikely the COO/CTO can get what they need for Jira,  we need to tailor our comms to the audience's needs - which doesn't often come through in ticket comments. The CPO/CTO want to know what have we learnt, where are we potentially delayed, risks to overall timelines or wider dependencies, how can we mitigate it, where can they help, what are we testing and are we missing a valuable opportunity elsewhere etc..Engineering ticket comments don't tend to have this nuance. \n\nReporting either verbal or written is a catch 22. It all coms down to company culture around planning, autonomy/collaboration and comms in my mind. Lite written reports require a baseline common understanding across key stakeholders, but how do you get that common understanding I.e bringing people along the journey. \n\nFrom my experience, I don't want teams to do so much planning that they become waterfall, just so they can deliver \"accurate\" async updates. I also don't want them to spend so much time talking about verbally updates, which could be solved with an effective async report...  so I come back to company culture. Our company values open communication  given complicated structure, so I lean towards over communication but making them *really effective* for the audience. In my company communication is the job. So the question is.. how can you get AI to deliver effective nuanced status reports for relevant stakeholders?",

      "text": "I'm a therapist and product leader (18 years in tech, currently IBM). In my practice I spend a lot of time talking to people who've \"made it\" but feel empty.  \nThis loss of meaning usually hits mid-career... and it's rarely what people expect it is.\n\nTypically you've done the same job for so long that  there's no challenge left. Or you've reached your definition of success and realised... wait... this is it?\n\nFor high achievers especially, impostor syndrome is normally the source of fuel.  \nYou work extremely hard because you feel \"not enough.\" Then the day comes when  you hit your goals, look around and ask yourself: \"Is this all there is?\"\n\nSometimes it's in your environment: I've watched people in SaaS burn out like chickens because the industry is so competitive that everyone's playing on super hard mode all of the time.  \nYou're exhausted, things barely work, successes are rare and at some point you think: \"What's the point of killing myself to make this business more money?\"\n\nThe thing is, when people ask \"what's the meaning of this?\" they're really asking \"am I good enough?\" It's an intellectualised version of the same question.  \nIf you were wildly successful at this game, would you still question if it makes sense? I don't think so.\n\n**! Understand this before you quit your job or start that business:!**\n\nThe loss of meaning is multi-factor. Some reasons are real and rational, others are circumstantial. I've seen people do a slight industry pivot and find meaning because their work suddenly helps people in a more tangible way. A few others found it by taking a break, starting a hobby, or monetising something on the side for the challenge.\n\nI've also seen people leave corporate jobs thinking entrepreneurship will save them, only to realise they just traded one type of shit for another type of shit they hate more.  \nThen they fall into a deeper crisis because, well -  they didn't like the first thing, don't like the second thing - now what???\n\nWhat worked for my case:\n\nI went on without meaning for 3-4 years, lost clients and nearly went bankrupt. Really bankrupt. Ironically, the process of making back that money gave me meaning and drive again. So did the therapy work, helping people one-on-one.\n\nBut a year before this, if you'd asked me, I would've said that I'm not cut out to be a therapist.\n\nI had to go through very structured exercises to deeply understand: What makes me feel whole?\n\nThis question is insanely difficult because when you're happy and whole you don't notice it.  \nThose moments pass directly to the subconscious, skipping your active awareness.\n\nAnytime you're thinking \"does this make me happy?\" you're not there yet.\n\nI had to ask: Who am I? What do I love doing when no one's watching? What's my default activity?\n\nFor me, the answer was in front of my eyes the whole time: using my skills and knowledge for helping people but I just couldn't see it.\n\nIt took isolation, reflection, me-time, and crucially… I had to stop worrying about finding meaning in order to find it.  \nThree or four years of intensive effort, and then one day over coffee something just clicked.\n\nMy advice if you're “in the fog” right now:\n\nDon't make big decisions while you're still in crisis.  \nIf you think running a business will make you happy, run it on the side first. If you think changing companies will help, send some resumes. If you think golf will help, play golf.  \nTry minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability.\n\nYou might not be supposed to find meaning in your corporate job either, that might just not be its purpose. I've seen people treat their 9-to-5 as the source of every problem until they lost it and realised the grass wasn't greener.\n\nThe meaning might be in front of your eyes, you just can't see it yet because you're too deep in the crisis and the pressure clouds you.\n\nGet some distance. Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.  \nIt's hard to be the driver and the observer at the same time.",

Doing 1 and its ebbs and flows has shown me not to quit my steady thing that gives me the most stress. Looking at the satisfaction from my partner and children about what I can do from the money made by doing the boring steady state thing does allow me to feel happy.\n\nFound a mirror in my partner and also some very critical friends. The latter did take me down more than I needed to but they are not as close to me as my partner so having some healthy self respect helped me figure out noise from signal. \n\nNumber 3 is the easiest check and love it. I have been using it for the last 2 years to avoid dipping into things that would distract and make it all worse. ",

I'd survived 3 rounds of layoffs at this place but the layoff cycle really hit me hard since I'd been laid off from my previous place in early 2023 despite great performance in all my reviews. After the last official round in summer 2024 they started just silently firing people to where I'd be chatting with some stakeholder on Slack about when they'd have something ready and the next day their Slack would be deactivated. Tons of exec turnover, no clear strategy, projects that I knew would go nowhere, super slow moving, pain in the ass stakeholders always mad at me for things outside my control, manager was only interested in optics and implementing whatever framework he read that weekend...yeah. I got my annual bonus and had some vest in March I realized that I couldn't stick around, my performance had suffered and I'd lost all interest and was too burnt out to interview.\n\nI explored pivoting to a different field entirely, did a bunch of networking, went to some networking events and workshop type things, tried to find my niche. Also focused on physical and mental health, getting back into a gym routine, getting offline more. Ultimately I realized that starting from the bottom again and grinding my ass off was just not what I wanted to do at this point in my life, and it was a field that's notoriously hard to break into, so decided to look back to tech and PM. I was extremely selective though, only looked at the sector I was interested in (health tech), only looked at earlier stage startups (Series A-B), and didn't really focus on the specific product/offering because I know by now that stuff is all fungible and there's good and bad to each. Really paid attention to vibes and culture and rejected a few companies outright because my bullshit/douchebag detector went off when I talked to the founders (this happened a LOT in final stages).\n\nEnded up signing with a Series B startup and joined in December, so was off for about 7 full months living off savings. A recruiter had reached out and the company/role was different than I'd been focusing on, and it was in office more than I'd have preferred, but I kept the convo going because why not and it turned out to be a great fit. Been there about 2 months, going great so far. The switch back to a small company has definitely been invigorating, the in-office culture is a huge improvement (previous place was 1-2 days in office, but very corporate and sterile).\n\nAnyway, happy to chat more via DM. All in all I'd say it was worth it and I'm feeling much more optimistic and energized even though I'm working longer hours now than I have in a while. More than anything I'm glad I gave myself the chance to explore another field instead of always wondering \"what if,\" I got it out of my system and made a firm decision and I haven't second guessed it at all.",

For sabbaticals, 4 months (career break, unpaid leave), 12 months between 'proper' jobs, and another 18 months between jobs.\n\n**For how long were you away from work? And how did you spend that time?**\n\n4 months traveling with my partner. Amazing. And at the time, not very expensive to do. My work kept me 'employed' but unpaid, so still accrued benefits and time-served and went straight back in to my old role.\n\n12 months between full time PM role, i did a short 3 month contract job, built an industry blog that was great for creating leads for work and made a small amount of beer money from sponsorships. \n\n18 months total disconnect from all work. Did 12 months not even thinking about work, then started casually looking for my next full time PM job.\n\n**Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?**\n\nNo and no. Every time I've gone back to work it's been essentially the same. Its a function of the company and your colleagues more than anything. A sabbatical won't help.\n\nStudy, sure. I've doen PM referesher course, AI/data scenience course etc. during the sabbaticals and that can help with finding a job and give you some new ideas to apply in the next job. keeps it fresh. But fundamentally, because I've stayed in very similar industries (b2b, enterprise software) PM-ing is PM-ing just the same.\n\n**Would you say it was worth it?**\n\nYes. YES. I have convinced friends to do the same and they are now sold on the sabbatical or 'mini-retirement'. I still meet people who don't get it, assume I'll get bored, or tell me I'll never find a job afterwards... But for me personally, they've all been much needed and benefited my physical and mental health no end.\n\nAnd on the job front, it gives you time to see whats out there. Something will come along. Sometimes just being the guy who's available NOW, without 1-3 months notice period, is enough to get you on to the short list and selected.",

I drove a motorcycle in the northern mountains of Vietnam via the Ha Giang Loop. It was awesome. I’ll always look back on it as the most fun I’ve had. \n\nHow it changed my relationship with work: In the US, your work is your identity. I lived in Silicon Valley where people asked “what do you do?” before “what’s your name?” traveling allowed me to decouple my identity from work because people traveling really don’t care or think it’s impressive you’re a “product manager”. People care more so about different values — where you’re from, kindness, adventure, etc. It really allowed me to tackle work with fresh eyes and the right priority/stress. \n\nRecommendation: Treat your sabbatical like you would making corporate goals— make them SMART goals. Personally, I’d make them about learning a new skill. \n\nI love my previous sabbatical, but honestly i was traveling every 4 days so there wasn’t much stability. My next sabbatical (hopefully in 5 years), im gonna make it wellness oriented and probably get certified in yoga/fitness or something. Learn a martial art like Muay Thai for a couple weeks— maybe train for a fight. Go to a tennis academy, etc.",

I mostly spent my time travelling alone, but also took time in between to spend with family. We live far from our parents so this was very nice.\n\nIt 100% changed my relationship with work.

I appreciated conversations, beauty of places, paid true attention to things that I was just running through while working and on constant deadlines. Once I realised there was so much joy to be felt in so many avenues of life, I realised I didn’t have to just look at work for some sense of worth or happiness. I feel the same stress exists at work even today, but it doesn’t get to me very easily. I’m able to more easily compartmentalise and remind myself that work is only just work, and when I’m home, there are other things in my life that I truly care about that I get to focus on. I’m still ambitious and I still work hard when I’m working, but it just doesn’t impact me in a very negative way when sometimes things get stressful or toxic. \n\nIt was 1000% worth it and I recommend it to everyone who can afford it/has a good support system.",

I'm fairly data and design savvy but the more social components I'm now realizing I struggle with particularly around articulation and communication which are critical for the role ofc.\n\nMy previous team was quite lax so I'm probably underdeveloped as a contributor that can work in ambiguity without guidance and structure and if I give up my facade of confidence and ask for help, people are concerned about my ability to deliver. Honestly, I think a task oriented job might fit me more (maybe a data analyst or data engineer? or something else?). I can do the PM job but I'm just slow I guess.\n\nIdk I'm feeling quite a bit demoralized and want to quit, but thought I'd reach out to this group of peers on what are reasonable career changes to consider. I think certain aspects of being a PM are just not rewarding to me when I reflect. Thank you all!",

Big tech PM often rewards influence, storytelling, and stakeholder management more than execution.  It's a different skill set but learnable.\n\n2. Asking for help is not the problem.  It is in how you frame it.  Lead with options or recommendations.\n\n3. A lot of data-oriented PMs feel \"slow\" in fast cultures.  But thoughtful PMs become assets later after the early perception phase.\n\n4. Before pivoting careers, consider some PM adjacent roles like product ops?\n\n5. Don't feel demoralized.  It is just a signal and one rough environment doesn't define your entire career.  I had an old boss tell me I was not really good at my job.  Months later he praised me for my performance.\n\nCould you ask your manager for 2-3 specific behaviors they expect you to show in ambiguous situations and how they will evaluate progress?",

I'm assuming you're being a little overly critical of yourself, since you were, after all, hired into the role. Your manager's concerns could just be a cultural mismatch with their leadership style.  \n\nProduct Management spans a spectrum depending on the org.  Many PM roles are much more technical and data-driven and others are much less.  What is it that drew you doing Product Management and has that changed?  I'd love to learn more about what skills and interests you have before suggesting other career paths. I'm wondering if is there just more of a cultural mismatch at your current company about what a PM does and if you can find a PM role elsewhere that fits.\n\nI wouldn't suggest you proactively quit.  You're already in the door there and getting a new job in this market is not a sure thing.  I'm assuming your manager hired you for a reason, and perhaps this feedback is their (hypocritically unclear) way of suggesting improvement.\n\nIt could be that fundamentally your soft skills need to improve.  That's a valuable life skill regardless.  Use this opportunity as a forcing function.  Fail upward, as quitting downward wont get you closer to any of your goals.",

To be fair, I kind of just took any interviews from college landed a pseudo-PM role and I guess that's defined me.

          "text": "A lot of this resonates for me. I think two different things here to separate out is the executive presence stuff from the dealing with ambiguity, i definitely wouldn’t conflate the two. \n\nIt’s important because executive presence is almost always something that improves over time in a new role because as you drink from the firehose it’s overwhelming and you don’t feel confident in your read on things. 6 months later you have the full stack nailed down, and confidence builds naturally outward to that executive presence. Natural communicators level up significantly at this point, but introverts improve too.\n\nInability to deal with ambiguity is quite different. Sure it can be developed, but it’s more something that you either have or you don’t, it’s often how we’re wired and our emotional/cognitive regulation. It’s a very, very important skill for product people more important than anything else when combined with problem solving. Sure, some companies like high growth startups have it worse than legacy companies with the level of ambiguity, it’s not going away, and it gets worse the way up the chain.\n\nIf I were you I’d pause to see if building your toolkit of the new role can build your confidence to then better deal with the ambiguity over time or if it only gets worse when you’d rather be on the other side of the sprint board in data or something more task oriented. Give it some time and maybe some momentum starts shifting their narrative of you.",

Still collaborative but way more structured - you get clear deliverables, timelines, dependencies to manage. Data analyst could work too but might feel limiting after PM work. Another option is product ops or analytics - you stay close to product but focus more on systems, metrics, processes vs the fuzzy strategy stuff.

Be able to articulate what \"found\" is and why you're confident they're not there. Realistically, your VP likely sets your strategy so I'd find it odd that they're not on the strategy they defined. It's much more likely you believe they should set a new strategy and you've not yet made a case compelling enough to warrant pivoting.\n* You feel you're performing at least one level above where you are? Again, what's the bar, and how are you confident you're meeting that and also doing so relative to your peers. Maybe everyone met the bar and you met it the least?\n* How does the feedback that you're frustrated about receiving relate to the next level expectations and your leaders strategy?

          "text": "Apart from all the wonderful comments shared, here is something more to consider. Don't judge your boss's skill levels or competence in the corporate world. I made this mistake in my career too. It is a punishing outcome and foolish thing to do.   \nA boss is chosen to operate at a certain level not by employees under him/her but by leaders above your boss. Even in a tightly operated and open communication culture, like say, an early stage startup, you have no idea what your founders are thinking through before choosing a set of leaders above your level.   \nA leader being incompetent, distracted or lost is your mapping of the leader's behaviors and actions to your expectations. You may be right (as I thought about myself too), but that doesn't mean you write off a leader as an underperformer.   \nThe simple reality is that for wherever your company is headed towards and whatever your company wants to do, your boss (and the hierarchy above) have mapped certain measurable outcomes and certain subjective behaviors/attitudes/communication imperatives as things that will work and are worth rewarding. They could be wrong, illogical or impossible to meet in reality (or per your judgment), but that doesn't take away the fact that you are not being promoted because you have been deemed as not ready to be promoted yet. You are not being heard because your claims and frustrations are not changing the world for your leaders.  \nSo, how do you deal with such a leadership? - You do what your boss wants you to do, exactly the way they want it done. This is advice not just coming from me, but from also coaches and advisors that you pay thousands of dollars to be trained in. Don't immediately jump ship and try to join another company. You will face the same issues and this \"feature\" of yours will never die. You will find new ways to find and complain about yet another incompetent boss. Instead, improve your presence, your communication and your awareness of the corporate world outside of things cooking in your head and your nearby teammates gossip chambers. This is a skill that takes time to develop and you need to put the effort into it. Good luck!",

They are firm when they are being proactive or have high conviction in their response, but that isn't always. They talk around when they are reacting and aren't quite sure.\n\nIn the long haul, people will respect you more if you are methodical and consistently prove to make good, rational choices.

You're definitely not alone - there's something about high-stakes rooms that just flips a switch in our brains.\n\nWhat I see happen most is that people lose their anchor when the pressure ramps up. In your regular meetings, you've got familiar faces, established dynamics, and clear context about what everyone wants. But in stakeholder reviews or cross-functional sessions, suddenly there are all these competing agendas you're trying to read in real time. Your brain goes into people-pleasing mode because you can't quickly assess what's actually important versus what just sounds urgent.\n\nThe teams that handle this well usually do two things: they prep not just their content but their boundaries beforehand (literally writing down what they will and won't commit to), and they get comfortable with pausing conversations. Something like \"That's an interesting direction - let me think through the implications and circle back with you tomorrow\" buys you time to get back to your normal decision-making self instead of reactive mode.",

          "text": "Being able to fall back on good process can help give you more conviction. Start with good product discovery, requirement documentation, and data before you even get close to the roadmap review. Try to get more touch points earlier to avoid surprising people. \n\nRun proper product inceptions that include all of the stakeholders so they understand the problem being solved. Defining what is in and out of scope is possibly the most important aspect of this. Inviting stakeholders to this process will get ahead of future conflicts. \n\nWhen disagreements inevitably arise, you will have a paper trail of decisions and data. Different teams have varying levels of dysfunction, but in most cases having hard evidence and strong processes trump feelings and off the cuff remarks. \n\nIt’s always helpful to emphasize the “iron triangle” of software development. You have quality, scope, and speed — you can only pick two. \n\nOne trick I like to do is describe different scenarios to make them imagine the future based on different choices. If an exec wants speed of delivery, it’s certainly possible, but explain what that will mean for quality and scope reduction. Similarly if they want a laundry list of requirements, explain how much longer it will take. If they want both fast delivery and wide scope, really make them feel what a low quality product will be like. \n\nSo - do your homework. Communicate early. Be able to point back to process. Be confident in the plan, but leave options for flexibility. If there are disagreements, follow up individually to understand the problem. \n\nAs others have said, don’t be afraid of saying what you don’t know. Hopefully all of your prep makes that less uncomfortable. \n\nAnd finally, if you’re a nervous person, you just need to do the reps and practice. It’s a skill",

Meanwhile, AI has been able to take that particular product operating model day-to-day function and compress it into a one-day affair with similar outcomes to the 3-week journey. \n\nAnother area these framework and canvas hustlers fall down on is, you don't get hired fired or promoted for filling in the boxes. You get paid and your project get sponsored because it pulls economic levers, business model and/or operational model. Any training that doesn't include that, might make your resume look good and get you past the first gatekeeper. It's not going to get you the job. \n\nAnd then there's the other extreme, the people pimping tools and techniques. Especially tools these days. The amount of cursing I do have my screen as someone who teaches and coaches product management over those who are telling people their $500 Maven course will turn them into a lean mean agent generating machine ... well, again, I really don't want to use the colorful words that come to mind when I see that tool tyranny being sold as a career solution.\n\nLike I said, after 20 years of product management, and 15 years of software engineering before that, I've spent the past three and a half years sending the damn ladder down working for Productside. So I've had conversations with the executives who sponsor individual or corporate training. I can tell you where they're willing to invest $2k or not.\n\nPoint is, take a step back and figure out where you want to be 5 years from now and 10 years from now, and find the people who have actually done that shit, we're also good at teaching that shit, and get training from them. And be warned, being a good product manager does not necessarily make you a good pedagogue.",

I honestly have no idea why they hired me, as the impostor syndrome when I started was through the roof. So far, I’ve grown in confidence and trying to develop my softer skills. I’m more of an introverted strategic thinker, but so much of the job is externalising your thought process, which I’m learning and slowly (emphasis on slowly) getting better at. It’s highly fast paced, and I’m learning to navigate all of that, but I don’t feel like I’m providing any real value to my team. I feel like an intern. I’m not sure if that’s normal 4 months into an APM role but I know other APM’s at this company who are confident, business savvy, and just exponentially more skilled already at the job.\n\nI am willing to grow, but I feel ‘slow’ if that makes sense. I guess I’m curious from more experienced PM’s, or maybe even APM’s, how you grow in this role. ",

I would say reliably I had 1 week per month where I thought, \"wow, this place absolutely does not need me, and I am providing no material value.\" Turns out, it's always a balance. My teams swore I was essential to their survival, and the only leader they trusted. So gratifying! Then I left after 5 years, and they had no idea how they were going to survive... it wasn't plausible. And you know what, they did. In fact they are doing just as good (maybe better) since I left. \n\nAll that to say, you can both be extremely valuable and replaceable. Most importantly, everyone is replaceable. I stay grounded to that because no place ever shut down after I left, but it doesn't mean I didn't make a positive impact.\n\nSo what can you do about it?\n\nLook for gaps in your product team. Are there projects/initiatives that are important but always get bumped? Is there a certain \"man, I wish someone would finally do that\" type project that you can just take over. Even if you aren't prepared for it, making any kind of progress would be win. Common types of these I've seen are:\n\n\\- Become an expert on your customer's POV. Listen to every call, read every G2 review, feedback comments, support ticket. Talk to sales/success/support teams. Turn these disparate data points into a cohesive view of the world with highlights that could impact the strategy. Headlines like Biggest Customer's Biggest Needs, Top Complaint from Users, Biggest Unlock for XYZ Industry, High Risk High Result Opportunities. Then supported with cited user feedback, examples, customers/revenue, customers who look like those customers, etc.\n\n\\- Competitive intelligence. Put together the most basic outline of competitor segments, and listing competitors. Company, founded, company size, customer count, website, recent PR funding/acquisitions, general feature breakdown, target industries, links to walkthroughs/screenshots, and a 1-2 sentence summary of their business and how they compete with you. Rank them/bucket them. Highlight areas where you think you win vs. them, and where they beat you. These can turn into battlecards to support the sales/marketing teams, and inform future roadmaps. If you want to go real deep, then be the person who searches your company and competitors on Reddit and finds the discussions/convos then give real customer insight and summarize that meaningfully.\n\n\\- Product, sales man's best friend. Embed yourself with the sales team. Get on customer calls, product demos, and help them take notes. Document customer needs, use cases. Offer to support them by doing part of the demo, talking about exciting things on the roadmap, or answering more complex questions for them. It's easier to sell with two people, and product people can speak passionate without the pressure of a quota. Help them close more sales. Build trust with them and get the insights that they don't readily share. What do they hate demoing? What don't they understand? What questions do their customers ask that stump them? Build them notes, tools, cheat sheets, collateral, pre-recorded demos, great demo accounts, etc. that help them win more business.\n\n\\- Customer Success and renewals. Same as above, but for the success team and enterprise clients, upcoming renewals, or potential industry/target customer focuses.\n\nThose are some of the things I tried to do to add value as a PM. It didn't always show up tied to me on the scoreboard, but it helped me become the glue for how things worked. Then all of a sudden my opinion became the most critical in strategy or how to approach it because I amassed all of these perspectives from spending the time and grinding through it.\n\nOverall, just by the tone of your post, you're probably over thinking it.\n\nKeep trying hard. Have a good attitude. Ask questions. Ask how you can help. Then do it, even if it's not perfect. Get the ball rolling.",

I kinda \"lucked into\" that insight but it turned out to be incredibly valuable so I kept doing it, and now I do it even more. You can never have enough user feedback and trying to take the feedback to gather insight is a fun and useful skill\n\n\\- not sure what kinda company or industry this is in, but the best pms are incredibly knowledgeable in the service they're providing - aka it's hard to be a rockstar PM at coinbase if you have no deep insights into crypto (how the tech works, who the big players are, what the trending stories are..) because at the end of the day, you want to be valued based on your opinion of where things go in the next 1-3 years \n\ngood luck friend!",

I do miss the social interaction with colleagues, not full time but when your colleagues are all your age and fun, it's a little lonely being remote. \n\nI'm also approaching 40, and I feel like I should really be getting more varied experience and working on my skills.

Plus man management of PMs that are under your umbrella: weekly's for running topics, half yearly performance reviews, salary adjustments & promotions, trainings etc.\n\nHow does this look at your side, curious to hear?",

Once you’ve shipped enough features and experiments, individual results blur together quickly.\n\nAt first, I thought that meant the work was ephemeral. If I couldn’t recall the exact metric movement months later, then surely the 2–4 weeks spent designing and running the test hadn’t mattered much.\n\nWhat changed was how collaborative the work became. I started talking through post-launch reflections with willow voice, organizing insights in Notion, and reviewing trends in Amplitude, often alongside designers and engineers. Seeing how design intent and technical constraints shaped outcomes made individual metrics feel less central.\n\nIn my second year as a product analyst at Robinhood, working closely with both design partners and backend engineers across 10+ experiments touching 100k+ users, judgment started to replace recall. I could tell which ideas were worth pursuing long before numbers finalized.\n\nWhat sticks is taste around tradeoffs, especially at the intersection of user experience and system constraints.\n\nSo the value of product work was never in remembering every result. It was in learning how to make better decisions with imperfect information.\n\nMakes me wonder how much product sense forms in conversations rather than dashboards.",

Of which lead to sharing, discussion, collaboration, and alignment like you said, bringing everyone in to make decision based on empirical evidence. This I believe is the core value of a product manager instead of be the sole responsible person to make a product decision.\n\nThe effort used in designing and running the experiment is just to make sure the result is relevant. e.g. knowing the experiment fails because the initiative doesn’t perform instead of entry-point not clear leading to not enough data points. \n\nThe effort should be just enough to know that. The tooling itself can even be suboptimal or manual. I only need a feature flag with randomizing capability and tracking. That’s it. \n\nSo, I think it’s natural to forget about an experiment itself? You remember the decisions and how decisions were made instead because that’s the point.\n\nSame thing with dashboard. Heck, same thing with “data-driven”. In the end, it’s about the conversation. Good ideas don’t come from data. It comes from conversations.\n\nBut naturally conversation drifts into personal bias and believe, so the whole data-driven and hypothesis driven product development is tool, a guardrail framework for humans to be less bias, and error tolerant.  It let us know when it’s bad (and most of the time it’s bad), and allows people in a conversation to make bad decisions and come back to make a better decision based on previous result.  That’s about it. Nothing grand about it.\n\nI even made a point to founders I worked with: Look, you can disagree, ignore data, and make decision based on intuition and all, but you need to measure the outcome. An AB test is one of the most conclusive data to determine the outcome.",
