Being a solo dev, you constantly hear that the \"AI space is too crowded\" or \"nobody pays for desktop utilities anymore.\"\n\nYesterday, I finally hit launch. I didn't have a marketing budget or a big following. I just shared my story on a couple of subreddits, like genuinely, no spamming and then went to sleep.\n\nI woke up to 3 DODO payment notifications... It’s not \"quit my job\" money yet, but seeing that three total strangers found enough value in my local-AI screenshot tool to actually pay for it? It’s the most insane feeling in the world 🥹\n\nNow reality is hitting me. I’ve proved people want this, but I have no idea how to actually \"scale\" a business. I'm a dev, not a marketer. I’ve done the Reddit thing, but I know I can't rely on that forever.\n\nTo the veterans here, How do you go from those first 3 users to the first 100? Where should I be looking next to grow this without losing that \"human\" connection?\n\nWould love any advice (or even just some \"keep going\" energy).\n\nI have already tried posting in on ProductHunt: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/screensorts](https://www.producthunt.com/products/screensorts)\n\nBut honestly, it all feels void suddenly...",

Three strangers chose to trust something you made that’s the hardest part.\n\nFrom here, the shift isn’t about scaling fast or becoming a marketer overnight. It’s about understanding why those 3 people paid and not losing that signal. Talk to them. Ask what problem this solved for them, what nearly stopped them and what made them choose you instead of doing nothing.\n\nMost founders stall because they keep “trying channels” without really learning from them. What I recommend use every post, launch or message as a small experiment and actually keeping track of what led to real interest or payments.\n\nReddit and Product Hunt are fine to start, but the long-term edge comes from having a simple way to observe what works, adjust and repeat without burning out or losing the human feel.\n\nYou already proved demand exists. This phase feels quiet and weird for everyone but it’s where real businesses are built. Keep going.",

That's your unfair advantage as a solo dev. People connect with real stories, not polished pitches.\n\nWhat worked for us when we launched our first SaaS:\n- Document the journey publicly (your struggles are content)\n- Find 2-3 communities where your users hang out and actually help (not pitch)\n- DM your first users and ask what made them buy\n\nThe scaling part comes later. Right now, talk to those 3 users like they're gold. They'll tell you exactly what to build next.\n\nI write about this kind of early-stage bootstrapping stuff in my newsletter if you want more tactical tips: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

That first paying customer feeling really is something else.\n\nOn the 3 to 100 question - the advice I've seen work best for desktop utilities is to obsess over the distribution channels where your users already hang out.\n\nFor a screenshot/AI tool, some ideas:\n\n1. **Find the workflows** - Where do people take a lot of screenshots? Design review, bug reporting, documentation. Look for communities around those workflows specifically.\n\n2. **Make your users your marketers** - What if every screenshot exported with your tool had a subtle \"Made with ScreenSorts\" watermark on free tier? It's organic distribution every time someone shares their screenshots.\n\n3. **Content that ranks** - \"Best screenshot tools for Mac 2026\" type posts get a lot of search traffic. One or two well-SEO'd comparison articles can drive consistent organic leads.\n\n4. **Integrations** - Can you export directly to Notion, Slack, or wherever devs/designers spend their time? Integrations are both features AND distribution channels.\n\nThe void feeling is totally normal. Launch day dopamine crashes hard. But you've got signal now - people paid for this. That's more than 90% of side projects achieve.\n\nKeep shipping, keep talking to users. You're further along than you feel.",

The temptation is to immediately think \"how do I scale to 100\" but honestly, just obsess over understanding why those 3 people paid.\n\nFor me it was talking to early users and realizing the problem was way more specific than I thought. Turned out they weren't just looking for \"invoicing\" - they needed EU cross-border VAT compliance and every other tool made them figure it out themselves. That clarity completely changed how I talked about the product.\n\nYour screenshot tool is solving a real pain (I have 500+ unorganized screenshots myself). Find out if those 3 users are designers, QA testers, researchers - whoever they are, there's probably 100 more just like them in a specific community somewhere.\n\nThe \"void\" feeling after ProductHunt is real. PH traffic is often tourists, not buyers. Your Reddit post got actual revenue because you told a real story. Keep doing that in places where your actual users hang out.",

That'll tell you way more than any marketing tactic.  \n  \nFor getting to 100, I found the best route was going where your users already hang out. For a screenshot tool, that might be communities for content creators, designers, product managers, whoever your ideal user is. Don't post your product, just be genuinely helpful in those spaces and people will check your profile.  \n  \nAlso, your existing users are gold. If they're getting value, they'll tell people. Make it stupidly easy for them to share or refer friends. Even just a simple \"hey, glad you're liking it, mind sharing with anyone else who might find it useful?\" can work.  \n  \nThe Reddit launch strategy clearly worked once. You could do the same in other relevant subreddits where your target users actually are, just spaced out over time.  \n  \nWhat problem were those three users specifically trying to solve with your tool?",

Thats your unfair advantage as a solo dev. People connect with real stories, not polished pitches.\n\nWhat worked for us when we launched our first SaaS:\n- Document the journey publicly (your struggles are content)\n- Find 2-3 communities where your users hang out and actually help (not pitch)\n- DM your first users and ask what made them buy\n\nThe scaling part comes later. Right now, talk to those 3 users like theyre gold. Theyll tell you exactly what to build next.\n\nI write about this kind of early-stage bootstrapping stuff in my newsletter if you want more tactical tips: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

Like actually get on calls with them. Ask what almost made them not buy. Ask what they'd need to tell a friend about it. The answers will tell you exactly where to find more of them.\n\nThe \"human connection\" thing doesn't go away if you don't want it to. I'm at 143 users now and I still reply to every single support message myself. Takes maybe 30 min a day. People notice and it shows up in retention.\n\nOn the marketing side - you don't need to become a marketer. You need to find 2-3 channels that work and ignore everything else. For me it was short video content and showing up in communities like this one. Tried Twitter, SEO, paid ads early on. Waste of time at this stage. Pick what feels least painful and just be consistent.\n\nThe void feeling is normal btw. Launch high wears off fast. What helped me was setting a stupid simple goal for the next 30 days. Not \"scale the business\" but like \"get to 10 paying users\" or \"talk to 5 customers this week\". Small enough that you can't fail if you actually try.\n\nYou're further than most people who just talk about building. Keep going.",

              "text": "I cant say that SaaS is dead, but has become over crowded recently. But its not as simple as copy pasting into claude code and building it, but the innovation lies in ensuring the app and features to be precise and helpful. And speaking about the apps like this (productivity), if the user has time to claude code it and build their own, it defeats the whole point ! Coz apps like this are meant to save time and not killing it. \n\nSo, devs like us, do spend time on this, to understand the requirement and improve the product. And the users can benefit from time for a small fee. So, the users are apparently paying for time. So, I see this as a win-win... \n\nLemme know your thoughts on this ; )",

That feeling never gets old.\nReality check while you're scaling: Your tool processes screenshots (potentially with sensitive info—passwords, API keys, customer data) through \"local AI.\"\nThree questions most founders miss at this stage:\nWhere does the AI model actually run? (Local = your machine, or cloud API?)\nWhat happens to screenshot metadata? (GPS, window titles, clipboard history often embedded)\nIf a user processes a screenshot with a customer's credit card visible, do you have a data processing agreement?\nI ask because \"local AI\" tools often accidentally trigger GDPR if any data touches cloud for model updates, error reporting, or sync. First enterprise customer will ask for your DPA and retention policy.\nGrowth advice: Keep the human connection by being the \"security-conscious\" screenshot tool. Most competitors ignore this. Post about how you handle data (even if it's \"we delete everything instantly\")—it differentiates you in a crowded space.\nHappy to audit your data flow if useful—takes 2 mins and might save you a headache at user #50.",

I thought that\r\nexperience would help us level up.\r\nWhat actually happened each time was a mismatch. They were used to having support functions we don't\r\nhave. They wanted to build teams before we had the revenue to support headcount. They expected clarity\r\nand structure that doesn't exist at our stage. They were frustrated and we were frustrated.\r\nThe best hires we've made are people who've worked in messy, scrappy environments. Maybe they were\r\nat a startup that failed. Maybe they were in a small team inside a bigger company that operated like a\r\nstartup. They know how to function without perfect information, without dedicated support, without clear\r\ncareer ladders.\r\nExperience matters but context matters more. Someone who was great in one environment can struggle in\r\nanother. I now specifically ask candidates about times they operated with limited resources and ambiguity.\r\nTheir comfort with that tells me more than their resume.",

You memorize hundreds of pages of company policy to make sure you follow the rules; there is safety and security in conformity. You train yourself to become a herd animal.\n\nAt a startup, you have to do things solo. It is an inherently uncomfortable place for a herd animal. As a result, herd animals retreat even further into rules and process to recreate a sense of safety.\n\nIt is very hard to screen for this in an interview. It is a shame, though, to disqualify someone simply because they worked at a large company.

They would hire ex-EMC/Dell/NetApp people because they ran 100MM business units, but then they couldn't move back to actively driving growth from 10MM to 100MM.

I’m glad OP learned something and changed their hiring interview questions. That’s one step in the right direction. In my experience, people who have worked at certain big companies know how to hire, because big companies put time and money into improving hiring. \n\nYou shouldn’t stereotype people based on where they worked. Instead you should learn to interview them and find out how they will work at your company. If you know that you need people who don’t require support, ask them to tell you about times they’ve worked without support. Get them to be specific. Also ask the same questions to people from small companies, so you have a point of reference. Ask the questions to your current employees too.\n\nI’ve worked at big and small companies, and I’ve always had good feedback (so I disprove the stereotype). A company needs a mix of experiences to be successful, IMO. I found at some formerly-small companies that were scaling and had recently tripled headcount, that I could tell the team exactly how to optimize for where they were at the moment, but the managers who had never worked at a large company weren’t skilled enough to do their part, and some refused to even try. Team size kept increasing, and output and quality increased a little, but not by anywhere close to 3x or even 1.5x. When I respectfully discussed this with managers and skip levels and suggested action items and ways to evaluate the success of said actions, my next performance review included a comment saying a growth area for me was to stop “pointing out problems but not solving them”. So I left for more pay and less stress elsewhere. I feel that OP may be this kind of manager, who isn’t actually doing what’s necessary and is blaming their direct reports for suggesting better ways to do things.",

      "text": "If you are tired of posting on LinkedIn for 0 likes, hate the idea of sending 100 cold emails a day, or just feel like \"standard\" growth tactics are too slow, this is for you.\n\nI just hit $27k MRR with my new project, Rebelgrowth.\n\nAnd i did it by ignoring most of the standard \"SaaS advice.\"\n\nHere is the thing.\n\nEveryone focuses on the tool.\n\n\"Look at my AI wrapper.\" \"Look at my new feature.\"\n\nBut the money isn't in the tool.\n\nIt’s in the **Offer + The Funnel.**\n\nI learned this the hard way.\n\nBefore this, I sold my previous startup (CreativiU) to 7-figures.\n\nI spent years obsessing over what Russel Brunson teaches in Expert Secrets.\n\nAnd here is the \"ugly\" truth about how i actually grow.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Free Trial\" Offer**\n\nStop asking people to marry you on the first date.\n\nStandard 14-day free trials are boring. They have no urgency.\n\nFor my previous company, i used a \"free + shipping\" model. I gave away physical supplies and just charged $7.99 for shipping.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause getting someone to pull out their wallet changes the relationship.\n\nIt is 10x easier to upsell a customer who paid $7.99 than it is to convert a free user.\n\nI’m using this same logic for Rebelgrowth (an AI SEO tool).\n\nInstead of a generic trial, my offer is: **3 Days Free + First Month for $9.**\n\nThe regular price is $97/mo, which kicks in at Month 2.\n\nThis works because it stops the scroll.\n\nIt’s an \"unusual\" offer in a sea of sameness.\n\nThen, inside the app, I upsell to a $299 plan.\n\nThis \"tripwire\" approach covers my ad spend so i can acquire customers for essentially $0.\n\n**2. The \"Trojan Horse\" SEO Strategy**\n\nI love SEO, but waiting 6 months for traffic sucks.\n\nSo i cheat.\n\nI call this the **Trojan Horse Interview.**\n\nBack in the day, i started a marketing podcast.\n\nBut the goal wasn't listeners. The goal was backlinks.\n\nI would interview experts and run a \"contest\" for their audience.\n\nTo enter the contest, the guest had to host the participation guidelines on **THEIR** website.\n\nAnd guess what was in those guidelines?\n\nA juicy backlink to my site.\n\nThey got engagement/traffic. I got domain authority.\n\nWin-win.\n\n**3. Paid Ads (For people who hate losing money)**\n\nI treat ads like a vending machine.\n\nI put $1 in, i need to know when $2 comes out.\n\nI built a massive spreadsheet where every row is a touchpoint (CPM, CPC, Click rate, Churn).\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend, knowing i’ll be profitable in 3 months.\n\nMy strategy is stupidly simple:\n\n* **Meta:** I target broad. US + Europe. My creative is my targeting. I use UGC style videos (15-30 seconds). I use tools like Sora Pro to make hooks because i’m lazy.\n* **Google:** I only bid on **Competitor Keywords**. I don't use their name in the text (don't get sued), but i pin my \"$9 Offer\" in the headline.\n\n**4. Being an Early Adopter (The \"Shiny Object\" Strategy)**\n\nYou have to be where your competitors aren't.\n\nIn Nov 2025, i saw John Rush launch TinyAdz. I jumped on it immediately. Cheap traffic.\n\nWhen Marc Lou launched TrustMRR, I bought an ad spot instantly.\n\nIt was the best ROAS i’ve ever had.\n\nBut you win some, you lose some.\n\nI also burned $500 paying an X influencer who got me zero clicks.\n\nThe point is to move fast.\n\n**Summary of the playbook:**\n\n1. Create an irresistible, \"weird\" offer (low friction entry).\n2. Use that offer to liquidate your ad spend (break even immediately).\n3. Use \"Trojan Horse\" tactics for authority.\n4. Upsell the backend to make profit.\n\nMost people are trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.\n\nFix the offer (the bucket), and filling it becomes easy.\n\nHas anyone else tried a $1 or $9 \"tripwire\" offer for SaaS? Or is everyone still stuck on \"Freemium\"?\n\nBorja Obeso, founder [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

The psychological shift of someone paying anything, even small, is massive.  \n  \nOne thing that bit us though was churn. People who came in on the tripwire churned faster than those who signed up at full price. We fixed this by adding a proper onboarding sequence in that first week, basically forced them to get value before the price went up.  \n  \nYour Trojan Horse tactic is clever. I've been experimenting with something similar using video messages to podcast guests before interviews, which gets shared around and builds brand awareness in specific circles.  \n  \nThe Google competitor keyword strategy is solid too. We've been doing this for 8 months now and it's our most consistent channel.  \n  \nWhat's your actual churn rate on those $9 first month customers versus people who might come in through other channels?",

      "text": "Quick background: I left my PM role at a Series B about 11 months ago to build a SaaS that automates compliance reminders for dental offices. Small TAM — around 4,200 practices in the US. 6,800 if you count veterinary, which I've started doing in my projections.\n\nReal pain though. I watched our office manager spend 40 minutes a week on this. Built the MVP in 3 weeks (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel). Whole thing costs me $8.11/month to run. I know the exact number because I check Vercel billing every morning.\n\nLaunch was rough. Posted on HN, got 3 upvotes and one comment: \"Is this AI?\" It's not. It's cron jobs and Twilio. But I did start putting \"AI-powered\" in my meta tags for SEO, because the cron job evaluates a condition before sending each reminder, and at some level that's what inference is.\n\nSo I started grinding outreach. Scraped every dental practice within 200 miles off Google Maps, found the office managers on LinkedIn, and sent 1,847 personalized messages over 6 weeks. Personalized meaning I swapped the practice name in the first line. One office manager replied \"Hi \\[PRACTICE\\_NAME\\]\" so I know at least one person read the whole thing.\n\n11 replies. 2 asked me to stop. 1 was a lawyer — not about the product, his practice genuinely needed compliance reminders, he just also wanted me to know I was violating CAN-SPAM. The other 8 booked demos or asked for more info, 6 converted, those 6 referred 14 more, and cold email plus Reddit brought another \\~30.\n\nCurrent numbers: 53 paying customers, $4,150 MRR, \\~12% MoM growth. Churn is 4.7%, but most of that is practices closing or merging. If I exclude involuntary churn, seasonal adjustments, one guy who I'm pretty sure signed up by accident, and a practice that emailed me \"please stop texting our patients\" — which I'm classifying as a feature request — it's closer to 1.8%.\n\nThe problem: I got a letter last week from a practice's legal team calling my outreach \"unsolicited commercial messaging.\" Which — yes. My plan was to hire a VA to scale to 500 messages/day across LinkedIn, email, and Facebook groups. I've already created a second LinkedIn profile for this. The question is whether a third is overkill or just good redundancy. Has anyone dealt with this?\n\nThe other problem: I haven't paid myself in 11 months. My girlfriend keeps asking about this. I keep explaining that $4K MRR is essentially $48K ARR which is essentially a salary, the business just needs it right now. She asked when the business won't need it and I said probably around $15K MRR. She Googled how long that would take at my growth rate, showed me her phone, and didn't say anything. We had a quiet dinner. I've started referring to her as my \"co-founder\" in conversations because it feels more accurate than \"person who pays rent.\"\n\nThinking about raising prices from $49 to $79. Some customers already say $49 is a lot for automated text reminders, but I think they're undervaluing peace of mind. You can't put a price on peace of mind. Well, you can. It's $49. But it should be $79. I ran a Van Westendorp analysis on this but only surveyed myself.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Not linking the product because last time someone called it \"just Calendly with extra steps\" and I'm still processing that emotionally.\n\nEDIT: Sorry if i don't respond to your comment/dm, never got so many before so i'm adjusting.",

          "text": "Alright, so you've built a real business solving a real problem. $4K MRR in 11 months from a standing start is solid, especially in a niche this small. Most people talking on here never get past $0 MRR, so you're already ahead.\n\nBut let's address the actual problems:\n\n**The legal letter thing:**\n\nStop the scaled outreach plan immediately. You already know it's legally sketchy because someone literally sent you a letter about it. Hiring a VA to blast 500 messages a day with your second (and planned third) LinkedIn account isn't \"good redundancy,\" it's speedrunning an account ban and possibly a lawsuit.\n\nHere's what actually works at your scale without getting sued: double down on referrals. You said 6 customers referred 14 more. That's a 2.3x referral multiplier, which is insane for B2B SaaS. Most companies would kill for that. Build a referral program. Give existing customers $20 off per month for every practice they refer that converts. Or give them a free month after 3 referrals. Make it stupid easy and actually reward them.\n\nAlso, your churn is low because the product solves a genuine pain point. That means your customers probably know other office managers dealing with the same problem. Ask them directly: \"Who else do you know struggling with compliance reminders?\" Then ask for a warm intro, not their contact info to cold blast.\n\nYou'll get way more than 11 replies from 1,847 messages, and you won't need a legal defense fund.\n\n**The pricing thing:**\n\nYou're undercharging, but don't jump to $79 for existing customers. That's a 61% increase and you'll spike churn. Here's the play: grandfather existing customers at $49 forever (builds loyalty and referrals), charge new customers $79 starting now.\n\nRun it for 90 days. Track conversion rate on trials at the new price. If it tanks, you know $79 is too high for cold acquisition. If it holds, you just increased revenue by 61% on all new customers without touching churn.\n\nThe \"peace of mind\" positioning is fine, but the real value prop is \"your office manager gets 40 minutes back every week.\" That's 35 hours a year. If their hourly rate is $25, you're saving them $875/year for $588/year at $49/month. At $79/month it's $948/year, still ROI positive. Lead with that, not vibes about peace of mind.\n\n**The TAM concern:**\n\n4,200 practices (or 6,800 with vet) is small, but you're at 53 customers. That's 1.2% market penetration if we're being generous with the vet inclusion. You've got room to grow before TAM becomes the limiting factor. The bigger issue is that this market caps you around $340K ARR at 100% penetration and $49/month, which is... not a venture outcome, but is a reasonable lifestyle business if you can get to 20-30% penetration.\n\nIf you want to grow beyond that, you'll need to expand TAM (other healthcare verticals, international, add features that let you charge more) or accept this is a nice $100-200K/year business and optimize for profitability and your sanity.",

They're what happens when you pick the right problem.  \n  \nThe one criterion that's actually a search method is your #3: niche audience already paying for a solution. That's not one filter among five - it's the filter that makes the other four inevitable. If people are already spending money on a painful workaround, the business is practically designed for you: small market (small team), known demand (fast profitability), clear deliverable (productized).  \n  \nI'd flip the whole search. Instead of designing what the business looks like and then hunting for ideas that fit the shape, find three niches where money already flows toward tools people complain about. The boring $20k/month businesses aren't found by specifying the business first - they're found by noticing where budget already exists and the current solution is hated.",

On the other hand it doesn't require writing code in Playwright or Puppeteer or similar. \n\nSo it's very simple to set up compared to full E2E testing (as in, it just goes from one page and starts trying out links/logging forms) and it catches the types of problems that tend to happen at some point during production like a form stopping to work when an underlying service disappears or somebody changing a route and forgetting to update all the links or maintaining a redirect. \n\nIt turned out to be more complex to build than I was hoping. One of the large problems is that for running E2E tests even for 5 users can mean needing to scale up the hosts doing the scanning as it's quite memory/processor intensive, so unfortunately it's not just a single server + database.\n\nI started it because I needed it myself and although there are some competitors, I pretty much wouldn't be able to afford them. So worst case scenario - it's useful for at least myself. It already has been actually, because it's detected few issues in itself by now that I missed in my automated test suite.",

Right now our main supplier is out of key raw materials until March, and we're too small to stockpile a year's worth of inventory. That kind of dependency is what pushed me to start building a side software project with a $10-20K/month goal.\n\nThe idea came directly from our own pain. As a manufacturer, we were drowning in spreadsheets trying to track materials, batches, and production costs. Someone in this thread literally mentioned \"simple inventory management for industries stuck using pen and paper\" - that's almost word for word our problem and what we're solving.\n\nIt's a \"boring\" problem by every definition. But the hardest part isn't building, it's distribution. There are maybe 5 direct competitors in this niche, but most Google search queries overlap with enterprise ERP keywords where a single click costs $40+. You can't just throw money at ads. So you end up finding creative, non-obvious channels to reach people, which is both frustrating and kind of fun.",

      "text": "I've been a software engineer for over two decades. I've built products for other people; telecom, banks, medical software. I watched colleagues launch startups in their 20s. And I always thought \"maybe next year.\"\n\nLast month, I finally stopped thinking and shipped Allscreenshots.com - a screenshot API for developers.\n\nHere's what 30 days taught me that 20 years of building software didn't:\n\n**The thing that almost killed me:**\n\nI spent months building. Perfecting the cookie banner detection. Rewriting the SDK three times until it felt right.\n\nYou know what I didn't do? Tell anyone it existed.\n\nMarketing felt scary. Building felt safe, something I know I can do. I could hide behind my code and convince myself I was \"making progress.\"\n\nThe truth? I was avoiding the hard part. Putting myself out there. Risking rejection. Having someone look at my work and say \"this isn't for me.\"\n\nFor a 46-year-old with two decades of experience, this is embarrassing to admit. But it's the trap I fell into, and I suspect a lot of developers here are in it too.\n\n**What changed everything:**\n\nSomeone recommended \"Traction\" by Gabriel Weinberg. I finished it in 2 days while on a holiday. The core idea hit me hard: you should spend 50% of your time on product and 50% on traction. Not 95/5. Not \"marketing comes later.\" Half and half, from day one.\n\nBefore this, I was doing maybe 98% product, 2% traction. And that 2% was mostly tweeting into the void.\n\nSo I forced myself to flip. For every hour coding, an hour on outreach, content, or talking to potential customers.\n\nIt felt wrong at first. Like I was neglecting the product. But here's what happened: the conversations I started having actually made the product better. I learned what people cared about, not what I assumed they cared about.\n\nThe cookie banner detection I spent weeks perfecting? Users expect it to just work. They don't care how. The features I almost didn't build because they seemed boring? Those are the ones people actually mention.\n\n**For anyone over 40 reading this:**\n\nThe common wisdom is that startups are a young person's game. You need the energy, the risk tolerance, the runway.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: at 45+, you have something better than energy. You have pattern recognition. You've seen enough projects succeed and fail to know which work actually matters.\n\nMy problem wasn't lack of skills. It was hiding behind the skills I had to avoid the skills I didn't.\n\nBuilding is comfortable. Marketing is vulnerable. At 46, I finally stopped hiding.\n\nIf you're a developer sitting on a product you haven't shown anyone yet: the code isn't what's holding you back. The fear is. And every day you spend \"perfecting\" instead of shipping is another day you're letting that fear win.\n\nRead Traction. Apply the 50/50 rule. Ship the thing.\n\nCurious what we're building?

Sometimes it's hard, so I skip them, but my goal is to have at least 2-3 ideas per channel. You might think that's hard, but for some channels I eventually ended up with more than 20 ideas!\n\nwhat I then do, is every week I make an approximate plan. like, I pick up ~4-6 tickets. 2-3 for product improvements, 2-3 for promotion/marketing/etc. It could be a blog, could be a tweet, could be meetup, could be an ad campaign, depends. \n\nfor every item, be it in the product or promo category, I measure the impact. for example, when I tweet, I look at the number of clicks, number of impressions, and adjust future tweets based on that.\n\nrinse and repeat. I find Reddit an amazing place, it's 95% of the time an incredibly supportive and friendly place, so it's where I get the most conversations, and conversions from. But I don't try to sell, I try to understand everybody's usecase. If our service is a match, great, if it's not, I'll tell them, and give them advice as best as I can.",

Also, are competitors are asking double or triple the money we're charging at this stage.\n\nIt's really not our plan to compete on cost btw, we will increase the price to our target price once we have onboarded enough people at our lower rate, but I think the price difference between $9 and $18 really is the breaking point, you probably shouldn't use a screenshot service at all.",

I mean, just press cmd+shift+1-5 and you're done. And how had can it be to make a full page screenshot on an endless page which loads dynamically, contains video elements, has a cookie overlay a chat widget, and some banners here and there? And then someone says: would be nice to support dark mode. And light mode. And would be nice if the screenshot is taken from China and from Denmark. Also, please make the screenshot with a Galaxy Pixel, Firefox, Chrome on Windows, and... etc. The list goes own.\n\nIf you're focusing on the price of things, I think you're doing things wrong. If you're selling something for 2-4 dollars, I probably wouldn't buy it, cause it can't be good for a price like that (and I'm sure you disagree on this point, but no service in my life is worth $2-$4. It's either worth a lot, or it's worth nothing. I don't really care what your price it, I care what it's worth to me, and I think that's a very important distinction). \n\nIn other words: if something is going to save me 10 hours per month, of course it's worth $9. It would be worth $100, probably more. And I don't think you'll find many people here who have $4 problems, not even in Denmark. Happy to be proven wrong though.",

Then again, if you listen too much to your users, the thing they'll say is they want faster horses, instead of cars, so I think the key is understanding users.\n\nWhen people come to us, I never ask them: what do you want to use screenshots for. We'll get there eventually, maybe. What I ask is: what is the problem you're trying to solve, and how can we help in that.\n\nSometimes we can't help. Sometimes the answer isn't screenshots. That's fine. We rather help people the right way by listening and giving some (hopefully) right advice, than trying to convert every lead into a sale. Maybe it's bad for our business to do it like this, but I hope it works out well in the long run. \n\nThanks for sharing your experience with research as well, I think it's sort of universal flaw in many domains!",

Make an offer to the first users which doesn't make sense, like build service X for me for a $99 lifetime deal. Don't go the free route, get people to commit.

A screenshot API is a crowded space, so the real unlock is nailing a sharp wedge like “handles cookie banners reliably” or “best for OG image generation at scale” and then targeting the exact people who feel that pain. Also, don’t beat yourself up about avoiding marketing, most devs aren’t scared of selling, they’re scared of hearing “meh” and realizing the market doesn’t care. If you keep the conversations tight and measurable (who, what use case, what would make them switch), you’ll iterate faster than any amount of polishing.",

It's not really about the $ amount, though it helps, but it's a great validation when people are willing to pay for a service you're offering, since that apparently brings them enough value. But you're absolutely right that validation is part of the goal here, but I think a bit of marketing is required to make people aware of it. And yes, screenshots is quite crowded, though I think we're doing a slightly better job than most APIs out there, but it's only part of our offering, our next release will be more unique, but it requires a solid (screenshot) foundation to work well.",

I've been catching myself doing the exact same thing, refactoring code that works perfectly fine because it \"doesn't feel clean enough\" when in reality I'm just avoiding writing that first cold email or posting on social media.\n\nOne thing I'd add to the Traction point though - the 50/50 rule works great early on but I think it shifts over time. Once your product is stable and you have real users, it's probably more like 30/70 toward distribution. The product should be shaped by what users tell you, not by what you think needs perfecting in isolation. At some point the product work IS the marketing work because you're building what people are actively asking for.\n\nAlso as a fellow dev - screenshot APIs are one of those things that sound simple until you actually try to build one. Headless browsers, weird rendering edge cases, timeouts on heavy SPAs, sites that detect and block automated browsers... I can only imagine the rabbit holes you went down with cookie banners on top of all that lol.\n\nWhat's your infra setup if you don't mind sharing? Puppeteer/Playwright on containerized instances or something custom?",

We took the \"build in public\" maybe a bit too literally, and we've documented almost everything here:\n\nhttps://allscreenshots.dev/\n\nIt's our dev blog. We have an extremely simple setup, basically a big VPS with too much memory, but we can scale in a several ways when required without too much effort, but that scaling costs time, complexity, money, so at the moment, we keep it simple, and we can still handle a decent amount of screenshots per minute, and much more when we do async screenshots.\n\nI'm not sure about the shift of 50/50 to 30/70. We'll let you know when we get there, but based on my experience, the marketing and sales teams usually required more pizzas to feed than the dev teams, the Traction just went a bit beyond blogposts and stickers, but is more focused on relationship building, marketing, (pre)sales, etc. Or maybe this is the 70%?\n\nAnd you're very right on the screenshot complexity! Most people think: I can do it using my browser, why would I need you? But we're looking at automation, endless scrolling, dynamic loading, videos, the web is a crazy place, which is what makes it interesting. \n\nI can tell you I learned more about the internet in the last few months than in my whole 20+ years of building software. It's great fun, and we're improving every day, just a little bit.",

There was neither focus nor structure - I was just sending tons of messages, hoping to catch a lead. When I noticed that we were not growing at all, I shut everything down for a week to review everything. I noticed who actually replied, which channels worked, what kind of messages felt natural.\n\nA few things completely changed how I approached outreach:\n\n* I understood that every good company is not a target market; it doesn’t bring more - it’s the opposite. So I wrote down size, industry, buying power, tech stack, and 80% of the companies I was chasing didn’t make sense.\n* I learned that different professionals live in different channels: C-level respond on LinkedIn in the morning, mid-level managers usually check emails after lunch, and sales pick up cold calls.\n* I didn’t have an organization system. I was just using linkedIn, notion for notes, google docs for templates, and a calendar. But it was a mess, so I had to learn how to build automated flows and manage it. Now, for me, it's a combination of pipedrive, sales navigator, and linked helper.\n* I realized people don’t react to lists of features, they react to the one thing that’s currently painful, so I began writing mini-essays about something specific.\n* Personalization is not {FirstName}; it’s showing that you looked at the person. I refer to recent posts or updates on their product or to something happening in the market.\n* I decided to track 3 metrics that really show the process and results: connection-to-meeting rate, reply rate by channel, win/loss ratio.\n* I decided to test changes in small bites - not to change the entire template or funnel, but only the CTA or only the hook. It showed better what really worked.\n\nNot saying it’s the right way to do outbound, but it really worked for me, so hope it helps.",

      "text": "Okay so this has been bugging me for weeks now. I watched someone just casually get 2000 signups with literally nothing. No product. No code. Just a landing page.\n\nAnd it made me think about how backwards most of us do this.\n\nLike, most founders (myself included, guilty) do this: Build the thing → Launch it → Hope people care about it. Which is kind of insane when you think about it. You're basically betting months of work on a hunch.\n\nBut the really successful people I've been following? They flip it completely. They market first. They validate demand when it costs them literally nothing. Then they build.\n\nDropbox did this with a demo video and got 75k signups overnight.   \nRobinhood had a referral waitlist that hit a million users before they even had a real product. Buffer validated their entire business model with just a pricing page in 48 hours.\n\nThe pattern is wild once you see it.\n\nWhen you market before building, you're not just wasting time. You're actually testing if people give a shit. You're building an audience while you're in the development phase. You're validating demand with zero code written.\n\nThat last part is probably the biggest thing. If you can't get people excited about the problem you're solving before you build the solution, honestly... you probably shouldn't build it at all.\n\nThe best validation isn't code. It's attention.\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around how differently this changes everything. Like, we're so obsessed with shipping the perfect product that we forget to check if anyone actually wants it first.",

I have seen plenty of big waitlists turn into ghost towns after launch.\n\nMarketing first is great for de-risking demand, but it does not replace learning from real usage. Some problems only reveal themselves once people touch the product and get frustrated. The real trick is knowing what question you are validating at each step, attention, retention, or willingness to pay.",

      "text": "After watching a mind-bogglingly simple app cloning strategy video on Starter Story, I've gotten really into the app cloning space. *For the record, cloning isn't being a direct copycat - it can be finding what works, making it 1% better, cheaper, or applying to a different market.*\n\nI've been researching (what I think) is the best example of a crowded space where everyone is making money with only subtle variations on clones - **The Plant Identifier App** space.\n\n**8+ apps do essentially the same thing. They all make $100K-$13M/month.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the ecosystem works and some takeaways for how to apply the same strategies.\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → Get name → See relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $22M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# THE BREAKDOWN\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they were first in the space and are kings. \n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" (biggest numbers = perceived leader)\n* Latin pronunciation feature (tiny feature, but makes them seem sophisticated and as a \"serious botanical tool\")\n* Runs 300+ ads on Meta at any given time - crazy high adspend\n* $29.99/year pricing\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* First to go hard on paid acquisition\n* Obsessed with ASO - they rank #1 for every plant-related keyword\n* I've used it before (pre-LLMs) and it was impressive - made me go \"wow thats crazy\"\n\n**Clone lesson:** Be first and/or be willing to outspend on marketing\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Free for students and educators (viral growth in universities/social media)\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" (whatever the hell this is, but something for spiritual/astrology gardeners - different audience)\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature (human expert access)\n* Light meter tool (clever utility - measures if your spot has enough light)\n* Water calculator (another clever utility - tells you exactly how much)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Found audiences PictureThis wasn't serving\n* Free virality loop via social media\n* Added \"productivity tool\" features, not just identification\n* Ukraine-based team = lower costs\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't compete on the same features. Find an underserved use case or audience and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nBuilt by AIBY - a company that clones successful apps at scale.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't really\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n* They know paid acquisition better than most\n* Fast execution\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes you don't need differentiation, you just need solid distribution. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Launched in Turkish/regional markets first (less competition - an interesting strategy to discuss another day)\n* Better multi-language support\n* Expanded to English markets after proving the model\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded US expansion\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Targeted a completely different user base\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't start in the US. Start where it's cheaper to acquire users, then expand. Less rich users, but easier to capture market\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Won a Webby Award\n* Edible garden planning calendar (vegetable gardeners, not just houseplants)\n* Garden journal feature (track your plants over time)\n* \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" badge everywhere\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Awards = trust = \"this must be the best app\"\n* Carved out \"edible gardening\" niche that others ignored\n\n**Clone lesson:** Enter awards even if they're nonsense and get press. Social proof converts really well.\n\n# 6. Plantiary - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nAlso Turkey-based.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Again, very little differentiation if any\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n* 8th place in a market this size still = $100K/month (especially for Turkey)\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to win, just need to float in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Completely free. No ads. No subscription.\n* Open source, citizen science project\n* NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification\n* 68% accuracy (second-best tested)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Being free made them the \"recommendation\" pick\n* Scientists and serious botanists use it (prestige)\n* Press (and customers) loves recommending free alternatives\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They get grants, academic funding, and goodwill that pays off in other ways. I'm sure their employees are getting paid well.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30K/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Low overhead\n* $30K/month from a side project is still life-changing\n* Proof that even 10th place in a big market works\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to build a huge business. A \"small\" slice of a massive market is still significant.\n\n# THE PATTERNS\n\nLooking across all 8 apps, here's what actually creates differentiation:\n\n**1. Audience niching**\n\n* PlantIn → students\n* Blossom → vegetable gardeners\n* Same product, different positioning\n\n**2. One \"hook\" feature**\n\n* Moon calendar (PlantIn)\n* Ask a botanist (PlantIn)\n* Edible garden planner (Blossom)\n* Latin pronunciation (PictureThis)\n\nNone of these are hard to build or are groundbreaking, but certain people want them.\n\n**3. Social proof**\n\n* Awards (Blossom's Webby)\n* Press coverage (PlantNet in NYT)\n* \"Most accurate\" claims (PictureThis)\n\n**4. Geographic strategy**\n\n* Start in smaller markets\n* Build profitably\n* Then expand\n\n**5. Just showing up**\n\n* Plantiary and LeafSnap prove you don't need to be special\n* A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market\n\n# THE TAKEAWAY\n\n\"Competition\" in this large market means:\n\n* 8+ apps making $100K+/month\n* The leader makes $13M/month\n* The 8th place player makes $100K/month",

My University helped me with the startup through it’s entrepreneurship program, but it really didn’t get me anywhere tbh.\n\nSince few months, I got heavily invested in working with AI to make better apps and softwares, to earn living, I uses to work in a retail shop, do cleaning, work in hospitality, and what not. I did all kinds of stuff! It always bothered me that I was not doing my best, and I always use to hate myself for not standing up to follow my dreams. I have a best friend, and we did everything to get somewhere, whether it be applying to YCombinator with a startup idea, or pitching investors with a unready product…but we only failure.\n\n2 weeks ago my friend had a good enough idea that he decided to work for fun, and soon I joined him to build that idea with him. We got somewhere and boom 💥 we built something cool that gave amazing results. But we still didn’t know what to do, so we went on to show it to other people in local communities, design groups, entrepreneurship groups, and all…and immediately we started getting people signup all organically to few users. Just two days ago, we decided to launch it on ProductHunt, and all the whatsapp, discord, slack groups we know would have people who’d find this cool, I also tried to post in Reddit (but got removed because of low karma oops), and interestingly just few hours after the launch, we started getting a lot of people signups!!!!! I still feel like it’s a dream, seeing the users table in the database grow from 15 uers to 62 users it was crazy!!! And soon we got our first paid user and the second. Though we just got 12 upvotes, somehow it spread and people started to signup to the point that we are now at 118 users 😭. We had 7 paying customers till the morning today, and just few hours ago we got our 8th user. I still don’t know how to describe this feeling .\n\nThank you so much universe for everything! I had one of my best unexplainable feeling in the last 48 hours. I never thought a simple side project with an unsure idea would get this much traction.\n\nI have still no idea what I am doing and what will the future hold, but I swear I am not gonna give up, and try again and again until I achieve what I want. As of now, me and my friend are so serious about this, and we’re working hard to improve ourselves with all the feedbacks we got. But let’s see what happens next.\n\nThank you all 😭😭😭. you all will win too!!!\n\ncheck it out: [https://markup.one](https://markup.one)",

          "text": "The feeling you're describing right now is the most dangerous moment in a startup's life. Not because something is wrong, but because the high of those first paying users makes you want to do everything at once.\n\nI had the exact same experience. First few users came in, I felt invincible, and I immediately started thinking about scaling, marketing funnels, content strategies, partnerships. I tried to do all of it simultaneously. Result: I did nothing well and the momentum died within 3 weeks.\n\nHere's what I wish someone had told me at your stage:\n\nTalk to those 8 paying users like they're the only people on earth. Send them a personal message. Ask them why they paid. What almost stopped them from paying. What they'd need to see in the next month to keep paying. Their answers will be worth more than any growth strategy you'll find on Reddit.\n\nThe gap between 3 users and 100 users isn't a marketing problem. It's a retention and word-of-mouth problem. If those first 8 users love it enough to tell one friend each, you'll hit 100 without spending a dollar on marketing. If they don't love it enough to tell a friend, no amount of marketing will save you.\n\nDon't build new features. Resist the urge. Your product got 8 people to pay in its current state. Make that current experience bulletproof before adding anything.\n\nThe void feeling after ProductHunt is normal. Every founder I know describes the same post-launch crash. The dopamine spike of launch day followed by the silence of day 3. It doesn't mean something is wrong. It means the novelty wore off and now the real work starts.\n\nYou and your friend built something people paid for. That puts you ahead of 95% of builders who never get a single dollar from a stranger. Don't let the anxiety of \"what's next\" steal the fact that you just proved the hardest thing in startups: someone you've never met values what you made enough to give you money.",

I had the same conversation today morning with my friends where I wanted to build this and that, but it’s good to have a partner as he fave me a reality check.\n\nI really value your feedback.

      "text": "tbh the current state of 'AI App Builders' is a total minefield right now.\n\nSpent the last few weeks trying to launch a mobile companion for my SaaS project. Since I’m mostly a backend guy, I thought I’d let AI handle the frontend. I threw way too many prompts at Lovable, Readdy, FlutterFlow, and a few others.\n\nHere is the reality check: Building a website with AI is basically solved. Building a real mobile app? still feels like the wild west.\n\nI wanted to share my breakdown because I wasted about $500 and 40 hours figuring this out. hopefully this saves you some time.\n\nThe 'Responsive Web' Limit (Lovable, Readdy, etc.)\n\ndont get me wrong, Lovable is solid for web dashboards. If you need a React web app, go for it.\n\n* The catch: These aren't actually \"app builders\" in the mobile sense. They create responsive websites. If you try to view them on a phone, they look okay, but they aren't \"apps\" you can find in the App Store.\n* The Dealbreaker: I needed deep system API access and that \"snappy\" feel. You can't get that from a browser-based site, no matter how well it's optimized for mobile screens.\n\nThe 'Cross-Platform' Giants (FlutterFlow, etc.)\n\nI used FlutterFlow for a bit. It’s a beast and definitely lets you ship to the App Store using one codebase.\n\n* The catch: While it's great for maintaining one logic for both iOS/Android, it introduces a \"bridge\" between the code and the hardware.\n* The Dealbreaker: I realized that if I'm hitting a performance wall or need a very specific native gesture, debugging that bridge is a nightmare unless you're a Flutter expert. More importantly, if AI is now doing the heavy lifting of writing code anyway, why should I settle for a cross-platform compromise? If the \"cost\" of writing code is dropping to near zero, I might as well go for the highest performance possible.\n\nThe Shift: Why I want Pure Native\n\nThis was my turning point. I didn't want a bridge, and I didn't want a responsive site. I wanted actual native source code, the stuff real mobile devs use (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).\n\nwhy? because when you’re building something that relies heavily on system sensors or complex UI animations, native is the only way to ensure it doesn't feel \"janky\" on older devices. Plus, if I scale and hire a dedicated mobile lead later, they won't have to untangle a low-code framework—they get the clean source code they expect.\n\nThe Alternative: [Sketchflow.ai](https://www.sketchflow.ai?utm_source=reddit&utm_content=0203)\n\ni stumbled on  Sketchflow recently (they just pushed a major update), and it’s the only one I’ve found focusing on this 'Pure Native' angle. instead of trying to squeeze a website into a phone, it actually generates structured, multi-page native code.\n\n* Actual Native Source: I exported the code, and it gave me clean Swift and Kotlin files. I could open them directly in Xcode and Android Studio.\n* Simulated Run: You can run the app in a browser simulator to test flows before even bothering to download the code. saved me a ton of time.\n* One-Shot Multi-Page: Unlike some tools that generate one screen at a time, you can prompt a full user journey (Login -> Dashboard -> Settings) and it wires up the navigation logic automatically.\n\nMy Verdict:\n\n* If you are building a Web-only SaaS: Stick with Lovable.\n* If you need a simple cross-platform MVP and don't care about the underlying stack: FlutterFlow is a solid choice.\n* If you want a high-performance app with no technical debt from the start: Give Sketchflow a shot.\n\nHas anyone else found tools that export decent native source code? I feel like the industry is finally moving past the \"web wrapper\" era but it's still early days.",

Went through a similar journey.\n\n  \nOne thing I landed on after testing different approaches: for native iOS apps specifically, Claude Code turned out to be surprisingly effective. The key insight is that Claude actually writes solid Swift/SwiftUI when you give it the right context. You can iterate much faster than with visual builders because youre working directly with the source code.\n\n  \nThe workflow I settled on: describe what I want, let it scaffold the screens, then refine. No export step, no code translation, just actual Xcode-ready Swift files from the start.\n\n  \nFor the backend guy who needs mobile apps angle you mentioned - if you already know how to work with APIs and understand data flows, Claude Code closes the gap faster than learning FlutterFlow or Sketchflow IMO. The mental model transfer is more direct.\n\n  \nOne tip: if you want to iterate on mobile stuff from your phone (like reviewing what the AI did while commuting), theres an app called Moshi that gives you terminal access to Claude Code sessions over SSH. Useful for kicking off changes or reviewing code when away from your desk.",

They are building specifically for sales teams to auto-inject prospect data (logo, name, specific pain points) into templates. It’s less “creative canvas” and more “deal-closing machine.”\nGamma is great for speed and looking modern/web-native (perfect for async sending), but for live 1:1 calls, it can feel a bit too casual for enterprise buyers.\nThe Pro Workflow:\nDon’t over-engineer the visuals. Pick Beautiful.ai for the “Master Deck” (locked branding so sales reps can’t ruin it) and use their “Smart Slides” for the variable data. It constrains you, but that’s a feature, not a bug, when scaling without designers.\nIf you really want to automate (e.g., generate a deck from a CRM trigger), you might need to look at Google Slides API + Zapier, but that’s a build, not a buy.",

We kept our proposal decks simpler but started sending personalised video messages walking through the deck instead of just emailing PDFs. It let us use a basic template but the personalisation came through in the actual walkthrough, pointing out the bits relevant to their specific situation.  \n  \nThe competitor comparison slide especially - instead of trying to customise that for each prospect in the deck itself, I'd just screen record myself talking through it with their name and specific pain points mentioned. Took 3-4 minutes per prospect vs 20-30 minutes redesigning slides.  \n  \nIt won't solve your scaling issue completely, but we found prospects engaged way more with a video + simple deck than a beautifully designed static proposal. Response rates jumped quite a bit.  \n  \nOut of curiosity, are you finding prospects actually want these heavily customised decks upfront, or could you get away with a solid template and customise deeper once there's real interest?",

      "text": "If you want to scale your marketing with influencers but dont want to burn cash on bad deals, get scammed by fake bot views, or waste months listening to \"gurus\" who have never actually booked a sponsorship... then you might enjoy this.\n\nI work as a Marketing Director for a pretty big brand and I also run my own SaaS on the side. \n\nBetween the two, I've hired over a thousand influencers and spent millions in partnership dollars.\n\nHere is the brain dump on what actually works:\n\nYouTube longform first until you max out on youtube longform, dont do any other format.\n\nNothing beats the power of the attention spam and the direct CTA with link in description as longform does.\n\nIgnore all the gurus telling you to hire one million micro influencers on TikTok, even if you’re target audience is on TikTok/Reels, I guarantee there are also channels on youtube with longform videos for that same audience, dont waste your time don’t lose your sanity, do longform until there’s none else to partner with on that format.\n\nYou need to have a solid proven offer before you try influencers. Have scarcity in the CTA, like “First 1,000 people to click the link get this special offer”\n\nTest 60 second integrations vs fully dedicated videos (more expensive). Have them put the 60 second promo in the first 5 minutes of the video to maximize eyeballs on your offer.\n\nBeware of scammers, several channels inflate their views and engagement with bots, look for suspiciously consistent high views across all videos, look for repeated and sometimes identical comments praising the influencer, too many emojis, and celebrities in the profile pictures even.\n\nIf you’re a startup strap for cash, you will want to push for commission only deals, for my startup Rebelgrowth, that’s 30% on every generated subscription for life, but in my experience most influencers don’t like performance deals even when they would be making more money in the long term, they dont know this so its your job to explain the math on why this is the case, make a simple spreadsheet, make a loom video, praise their last video, explain why you think your startup would be a great fit and explain why the commission offer is better than flat rate.\n\nHowever, if you’re an established startup/company with a budget, you’ll want to do flat rate deals because YOU will make more money in the long term as opposed to having to pay 30% of your revenue forever.\n\n30% of deals will succeed, those are the channels you will want to nurture and repeat and that will carry the whole effort, another reason why you need to stay away from flat rate as a bootstrapped startup, you can’ afford to have your first 10 deals fail looking for the 3 that will work. This is a numbers game.\n\nWhat I look for in a channel (this is less important when doing performance deals): Audience affinity; how relevant is the topic to your business, what are audience demographics (age, location, genre), how consistent are views across the last 12 videos, how often does the channel publish, what’s the engagement rate (high engagement = high conversions), I can afford more on a channel with 7,000 views but 15% engagement rate than a channel with 10,000 views but 5% engagement rate. Engagement is comments to subs (or views) rate.\n\nOn flat rates, always negotiate down aggressively, argue why with the channels using your analysis from the above paragraph. I personally look for sub $50 CPMs when doing flat rate (irrelevant when doing commission deals).\n\nTo find channels, ask your favorite AI chat to do “Deep Research” and find the top 100 channels that meet your preferred criteria. If doing commissions, aim for small channels to improve your chances of getting a “yes”, so channels with under 10k subs. You can also simply search youtube, or one of the millions of apps out there that have a youtubers database. Gather the list and then it's time to find the emails. I pay a guy on upwork $50 per 100 researched channels because youtube only lets you unlock 5 emails per day. This guy has a bunch of accounts he uses to unlock emails quicker.\n\nOnce you have the emails, use your favorite outreach tool to schedule 4 - 7 emails (the money is in the followups). Keep it simple, lead with “Paid sponsorhip?...” in the subject and first line of email copy so the influencer knows you’re down to business.\n\nHave dedicated landing pages per influencer or dedicated coupon codes or if you’re doing affiliate commissions it doesn’t really matter since they will have their affiliate link to your product anyways.\n\nYou’ll want to stay compliant if you’re a big company, which means making sure the influencer clearly discloses its a sponsorship when the Ad begins, have them put your logo as soon as they say the video is sponsored by your company.\n\nCheers\n\n[**Borja, let's connect i'm looking for a cofounder**](https://x.com/borja_obeso)",

That 15% engagement vs 5% engagement example you gave is exactly right - the audience quality difference is night and day.

I got approved by LinkedIn/ microsoft's and shipped the only safe multi tenant scheduling product in the market for LinkedIn (no extensions, etc). \n\n**the result:** launched last August. just hit $600 MRR in 3-4 months. not life-changing money yet, but it's growing and people actually use it daily.\n\nthe feature set also evolved from the “pain I personally felt”…\n\nthe tool ([oiti - ai ghostwriter for linkedin](https://ghostwriting-ai.com/)) does something i couldn't find elsewhere - it has built in long term memory, so if you say, “hey I don’t like x”, just like a real ghostwriter, it will not make that mistake again.\n\n**biggest lesson:** your first 3 ideas probably suck.\n\nthat's normal. the difference between success and failure isn't having perfect ideas, it's learning from the sucky ones.\n\nstill have a long way to go (targeting $10k mrr by end of year) but finally feels like i'm building something that matters.\n\nanyone else been through multiple failures before finding something that worked? how did you know when you found the right idea?",

The LinkedIn ghostwriting tool worked because you actually do the job yourself. You know what's annoying about writing LinkedIn posts, what existing options feel like, where they fall short. That's not something you can research your way into - you either have that lived context or you don't.\n\nI've seen this same arc play out with a lot of founders (myself included). The products where I was guessing at the customer's world all stalled. The one where I was the customer moved faster than anything I'd built before, because every decision was obvious - I already knew what mattered and what didn't.\n\nIf you're thinking about what to build next, the question isn't \"what market is hot\" - it's what job do you personally hire bad solutions for right now. That's where your next $567 turns into $5k.",

It's so easy to let a project bloat into a six-month \"masterpiece\" that nobody actually wants. Also, solving the LinkedIn extension issue is a massive technical moat—anyone who has had their account flagged because of a sketchy Chrome extension knows that \"safe\" and \"no-extension\" are huge selling points.\n\nAs for your question: I think you know you’ve found the right idea when you stop trying to *convince* people they have a problem and they start asking you when they can pay to solve it.\n\nGood luck on the road to $10k!",

The CRO audit tool for agencies sounds like it could've worked, you just built it backwards. Same idea but starting with agency conversations first might've had a completely different outcome. Sometimes it's not the idea, it's the order of operations.\n\nCurious about the long term memory feature - are you storing user preferences as some kind of vector db / structured profile, or is it more like appending corrections to the system prompt?

I gave myself 30 days on my current project specifically because I knew I'd overthink it otherwise. Ended up launching something ugly that worked, then fixed it based on what users actually complained about instead of what I imagined they'd want.\n\nTo answer your question I knew it was the right idea when people started asking me for it before I built it. I was doing the work manually (video ad editing for DTC brands), clients kept asking if I could do it faster/cheaper, and I realized the bottleneck was the same repetitive process every time. That's when it clicked: if I'm already getting paid to solve this problem by hand, there's probably a market for the automated version.\n\nThe \"long term memory\" feature sounds smart btw.

We spent days trying to manually map where potential customers hang out, what language they use, which threads are active.\n\nKeyword tracking tools like ParseStream are great for the \"alert me when X topic comes up\" use case. But there's a step before that — figuring out which communities matter in the first place, what the conversation patterns look like, and where your specific audience actually congregates. That's the discovery layer that's missing.\n\nIt's the difference between \"monitor these 5 subreddits for mentions\" vs \"tell me which subreddits, Discord servers, and forums my target customer is already active in.\" The first is monitoring. The second is audience intelligence. Both matter, but most tools only do the first.",

      "text": "If you want to scale your SaaS with Google Ads but you are afraid of burning your budget on broad keywords, getting outbid by giant competitors, or just feeling like the platform is a giant \"black box\" that eats money... then you should read this.\n\nMost people try to bid on massive, high-volume keywords like \"SEO tool\" or \"Marketing software.\"\n\nUnless you have a VC-backed war chest that's really hard\n\nHere is the playbook I use instead to actually see a return on spend.\n\nThe secret is bidding on competitor keywords first, then clusters of niched high intent keywords\n\nMake a list of your 10 closest competitors. Those people already have the \"problem awareness\" you need.\n\nAnd often, they are googling the competitor because they saw them on Facebook Ad first.\n\nThis means Facebook targeted those people because they are \"buyers\", they have triggered a conversion event before.\n\nThe goal is to have a better offer than anyone else and pin it right in the headline. A better offer can be price, features, bundles, both?\n\nJust better value for whatever is being paid\n\nFor me, the headline is usually something like: Automate SEO: Outrank Today | 3 Days Free + $9 First Month.\n\nOr \"Automate SEO and Social Media in One Single Place\"\n\nBecause none of my competitors also offer Social Media automation.\n\nI pin those because it is unusual and it stops the scroll.\n\nAvoid putting the competitor's name in your actual ad text.\n\nYou can try it, but you risk trademark violations and getting your account flagged.\n\nInstead, focus on the main benefit your product solves that they don't.\n\nForget about trying out a million headline variations like Google suggests in their \"Responsive Search Ads.\"\n\nGoogle wants you to test everything so they can spend more of your money.\n\nI prefer to take control and pin the headlines that I know convert based on my funnel data.\n\nLaunch with a single landing page for everyone. With a headline that addresses why you're better than all of your competitors. Here you can name them.\n\nYou can get fancy later and build dedicated landing pages for each competitor.\n\nA page that says \"Why \\[Your Company\\] is the best alternative to \\[Competitor\\]\" works wonders.\n\nBut if you are just starting out, you can test the waters with a single landing page that addresses the main pain points of your niche.\n\nAsk an AI to help you draft the comparison points with a \"Deep Research\" run, most providers have this feature, and get moving.\n\nBid on the people who are already looking for a solution and hit them with an offer they can't ignore.\n\nAfter you get this dialed, you can move on to high buying intent keywords, which is more work because ideally you want to have one lander per keyword and many keywords to make up volume.\n\nHave you tried Google Ads before? I would love to hear if you have found winning tactics to compliment something like this.\n\nThanks  \nAria from [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

They're not cold. They're warm.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Go to your top 3 competitors' LinkedIn company pages\n2. Look at their followers (or people engaging with their posts)\n3. Filter by your ideal job title (CMO, VP Marketing, Head of Growth, etc.)\n4. These people are actively researching solutions like yours\n\nBut here's the real hack...\n\nThe \"Influencer Scrape\" Method\n\nThis one's even better.\n\nFind 5-10 influencers in your niche who post about topics related to your product.\n\nExample: If you sell sales software, find people posting about cold email, outbound, SDR tips, etc.\n\nNow look at WHO'S ENGAGING with their content.\n\nThe people commenting \"Great post!\" or \"This is gold\" on sales content are:\n\n\\- Actively thinking about sales\n\n\\- Engaged and online\n\n\\- Self-identifying as interested in your space\n\nThese aren't cold leads. These are people who literally raised their hand and said \"I care about this topic.\"\n\nI've gotten 40-50% reply rates reaching out to these people because my message is: \"Saw you commenting on \\[influencer\\]'s post about \\[topic\\]. Thought you might find this relevant...\"\n\nIt's not cold outreach. It's warm outreach disguised as cold.\n\nThe tools:\n\nYou can use Trigify to scrape LinkedIn engagers and export them. Works well if you just need the data.\n\nBut honestly I use my own tool  Linkedify because:\n\n\\- It scrapes AND reaches out in one workflow\n\n\\- No more exporting CSVs, importing to another tool, deduping, etc.\n\n\\- You can set up automations that find new engagers daily and reach out automatically\n\nThe difference is like 2 hours of manual work vs. 10 minutes of setup.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\\- Week 1: 47 connection requests sent → 31 accepted → 12 conversations → 5 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 2: 52 sent → 38 accepted → 14 conversations → 7 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 3: You get the idea\n\nThe quality of these leads is insane because they're ALREADY warm. They follow competitors. They engage with niche content. They're in-market.\n\nStop buying lead lists. Start hunting where your buyers already are.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nInstead of cold outreach to random people, scrape your competitors' followers and influencers' engagers. These people are already interested in your space. Use Trigify for data export or Linkedify if you want scraping + outreach in one tool. My reply rates went from 3% to 40%+ using this method.\n\nHappy hunting. 🎯",

      "text": "Built 4 different SaaS between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing SaaS that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org) Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as SaaS. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building SaaS for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your SaaS failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

They were competing against tools people already used and had workflows built around. Reaching 10,000 agents on LinkedIn wouldn't have mattered because they already had a CRM. You'd be asking them to migrate data, retrain habits, convince their team. That's not a distribution wall - that's a switching wall. And more reach doesn't fix switching friction.  \n  \nThe content calendar worked because newsletter creators were doing that job with Notion templates and Google Sheets. The job existed, nobody owned it, switching cost was basically zero. You weren't convincing anyone to leave a tool - you were replacing a workaround.  \n  \n\"Can I reach 5,000 people for free\" is a good filter but it's incomplete. The second question is: are those people currently using a purpose-built tool for this, or are they duct-taping something together? Reachable + workarounds = organic growth. Reachable + entrenched tool = the same wall you hit, just with better targeting.  \n  \nBoth feel like \"I can't get customers\" from your side.

For the next SaaS, maybe try front-loading all your marketing *before* you even start building. I'm talking building up an audience on social media, writing blog posts, running free workshops, anything to establish a pre-existing community that's hungry for your solution. Think of them as your initial user base and marketing team rolled into one. Seeing the traction and engagement *before* you commit to coding can save you a ton of heartache.\n\nI totally get the frustration of putting tons of time into something no one sees. Since this is my YouTube channel, and video is my bread and butter, I've been obsessed with validating ideas *before* I spend days filming and editing. I actually built a tool called videoscore.app (still in early access, launching March 2026) to help with this. It analyzes video ideas and gives them a score, so you know whether it has potential to get views. It's been a lifesaver for avoiding videos that just sit there with zero views. It's a $9/month plan, but that tool might help in your next marketing endeavors.\n\nAlso, have you considered leaning into partnerships? Find complimentary businesses that already have the audience you're looking for and see if you can collaborate. Maybe offer them a free month of your SaaS in exchange for promoting it to their user base. Could be way cheaper than even thinking about paid ads!",
