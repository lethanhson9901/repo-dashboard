      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a project to track \"opportunity gaps\" on Reddit—specifically posts where someone describes a pain point and asks for a tool that doesn't seem to exist.\n\nI just finished processing a dataset of 9,363 unique opportunities from the last 6 months. I wanted to share the raw trends I found because they're pretty counter-intuitive for anyone looking to build a side project or SaaS right now.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Cloud\" Trend:**\n\nAbout 7% of all requests (640+ posts) specifically asked for offline-first or privacy-focused tools. People are getting \"subscription fatigue\" and want local-only versions of popular apps (especially in productivity).\n\n**2. The Big Categories:**\n\nProductivity: 1,231 requests (The most crowded, but highest volume).\n\nEducation/Self-Improvement: 698 requests (The highest \"willingness to pay\" sentiment).\n\nBusiness Tools/SaaS: 696 requests.\n\nHealth & Wellness: 656 requests.\n\n**3. The \"ADHD\" Niche:**\n\nSurprisingly, r/ADHD is one of the highest-signal subreddits. The users there provide the most detailed \"feature requests\" because current tools often fail their specific workflows.\n\n**4. App Type Breakdown:**\n\nMobile Apps: 61%\n\nSaaS/Web Platforms: 6%\n\nDesktop/Local Software: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~2% (Small but very high intent).\n\n**5. Timing:**\n\nMost \"frustration\" posts happen on Mondays and Tuesdays. People start their work week, hit a wall with their current software, and come to Reddit to complain.\n\n**6. Where the Money Is:**\n\nThe \"Willingness to Pay\" Index\n\nI scanned the data for keywords like \"buy,\" \"price,\" \"premium,\" and \"subscription.\" While Productivity has the most requests, it does not have the most people offering to pay.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Finance (193 pay signals): By far the most profitable niche. Users are asking for specialized portfolio trackers and risk analysis tools and are explicitly looking for \"premium\" versions that handle their data securely.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Online Commerce (76 pay signals): Shopify owners and small e-commerce sellers are vocal about paying for tools that save them time on shipping, inventory, or order syncing.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Travel (42 pay signals): This is a high-intent category. People are looking for \"pro\" travel planners or specific regional transit apps and are willing to pay for the convenience of a \"working\" solution.\n\nInsight: If you want a faster path to revenue, Finance or E-commerce tools beat \"General Productivity.\"\n\n**7. The \"Pain Level\" (Frustration Score):**\n\nI measured the length and detail of the posts. Longer posts generally indicate higher frustration and a deeper \"pain point.\"\n\nThe highest frustration scores come from:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Developer Platforms (229 avg length): Developers write long, technical \"rants\" about missing features in Spark, AWS, or NetSuite. If you solve these, you have a customer for life.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Cooking & Recipes (223 avg length): Users are angry about modern recipe sites being bloated with ads and \"backstories.\" They want ultra-minimalist, high-speed tools that just show the ingredients.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Parenting (221 avg length): Parents are highly descriptive about their needs (tracking sleep, milestones, or school schedules). This is an emotional, high-retention niche.\n\nInsight: Don't just look for many posts; look for long posts. A long post is a blueprint for a feature list.\n\n**8. The \"Last 60 Days\" Trend (What's Heating Up)**\n\nLooking at the data from November to January, we can see which categories are gaining momentum right now:\n\n\\\\\\\\- Health & Wellness & Gaming: These both spiked in December/January. This follows the \"New Year, New Me\" trend. People are currently hunting for gym trackers, habit-builders, and gamified life-management tools.\n\n\\\\\\\\- Smart Home & IoT: There is a recent wave of interest in \"Data Visualization\" for smart homes—people have the sensors, but they want better graphs to see how their home’s temperature/humidity changes over time.\n\n**Summary for your \"Action Plan\":**\n\n1. High Revenue / High Volume: Build in Finance. People are screaming for better portfolio analytics.\n2. High Gratitude / Low Competition: Build for Traditional Artists (Clean-up tools) or Parents.\n3. The \"Current Wave\": Build a Minimalist Smart Home Dashboard or a Gym Decision-Fatigue Tool.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nTop Niche by Pay Signal: Finance (193 signals)\n\nTop Niche by Pain Level: Developer Platforms (High Detail)\n\nFastest Growing (Jan 2026): Health & Wellness (New Year Trend)\n\nThe \"Anti-Bloat\" Opportunity: Cooking & Recipes (Users want text-only, no ads).\n\nI built a tool (neven. app) to help me parse all this data, but I thought these high-level stats would be useful for this sub.\n\nWhich of these categories is everyone currently building in? Happy to pull more specific stats from the data if you're curious about a niche.",

That’s where boring but durable SaaS lives.\n\nIf you ever productize this, I’d pay for a “Reddit opportunity radar” that pipes into my stack; right now I hack it with things like [Apollo.io](http://Apollo.io), Sparktoro, and Pulse for Reddit just to watch when a specific pain suddenly spikes.\n\nFinance + angry dev tools feels like the real gold here if someone’s willing to read between the lines, not just count posts.",

It's often not functional until a few seconds later when all the junk has loaded, but still, it significantly reduces the pain.\n\nAnd despite some early, hilariously bad, widely hyped fails like recipes with glue in them, LLMs do deliver recipes without ads surprisingly well now. Probably ripped them all off in their aggressive web spidering training phase, but the goods are there for the consumer to read. Not sure if there are enough AI-averse customers left over after taking that into account.",

Adding more humanity is the best angle to beat AI's growing dominance. What could be really cool is groups e.g., I'm always looking for trail runner snacks I can DIY to save costs and avoid certain ingredients. And those def need real world testing on runs. Etc. Gets more edge case but far more human only, if that makes sense. \n\n\nThe minimal clean recipe layout is great, ironically exactly what ChatGPT gives me when I paste a recipe into Notion. :)",

      "text": "Hello guys,\n\nIn theory, when launching a SaaS, you validate the need first.   \n  \nIf potential clients pay, you build.   \n  \nIn practice? We all make the same rookie mistake: We start with an idea, then try to find someone to sell it to.   \n  \nIt’s usually a disaster.\n\nIn 2023, I did exactly that. \n\nActually, I did worse. \n\nI copied someone else’s idea for my market without knowing if it would work.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nIt's 2023. I’m new to SaaS, naive, and I think \"YCombinator model = Guaranteed Success.\"    \n  \nI  spot a company called OneText. They do \"text-to-buy\" for e-commerce in the USA. \n\nI think: \"Let's bring this to Europe! But with WhatsApp.\"\n\nI spend 6 months building a clone. \n\nResult? We launch the MVP. Nobody wants it. \n\nNOBODY.   \n  \nEurope wasn't ready for text-based purchasing. \n\nA total zero. 6 months of work thrown in the trash.\n\n\n\nSo, I pivot. \n\nNew logic: \"Let's find companies already selling WhatsApp tools in Europe making real money, and just copy them.\" \n\nI find Shopify apps making $2-3M. \n\nNot a creative idea but at least there is a market.\n\nWe clone the MVP features in 2 weeks. I try to sell it... and miracle. \n\nClients. Happy clients. Retention.\n\nIn 6 months, we grew from $0 to $50k MRR almost exclusively through cold outreach.\n\n\n\nWe had no vision. We didn't love the project, and we didn't know how to innovate. \n\nSo, we contacted buyers and sold the SaaS for 7 figures in just a few weeks. \n\n(This was early 2025).\n\n[Here is the SaaS I sold and the proof](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremyhorowitz1_after-45-yrs-352-deals-5-lost-lois-i-activity-7297946777532391424-x-zZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6Qr-cBuSULRKCL1d1JL7e1LIgV7c6UZ3c) \n\n\n\nA few months ago, I launched a new SaaS. This time, before writing ONE LINE of code, I sold the solution using a PowerPoint deck. We hit $7k MRR before coding a single feature. \n\nToday, we are over $30k/month.\n\nThe lesson: Don't waste time. SELL BEFORE YOU CODE.\n\nDon't be a donkey like I was and waste 6 months of your life.\n\n\n\nBTW, [here is what I’m building now](https://gojiberry.ai) (I hope we will reach $1m ARR very soon) \n\nGood luck!",

I’d also look at adding any credentials you have to build trust (link to your LinkedIn or Socials) and create a community (discord, stool, WhatsApp) where people that interested can speak with you directly again building trust. ",

The funny part is your “dumb clone” phase is what most people secretly do anyway, just without admitting it or exiting for 7 figures.\n\nThe real unlock in your story isn’t just validation, it’s speed and honesty: copy something that’s already proven, ship a barebones version fast, and be brutally honest about whether you actually like the market. If you don’t, sell it and move on instead of dragging it out for years.\n\nFor folks doing this now: you can pre-sell using super simple tools - a deck, Loom demo, Stripe link, and something like HubSpot or Close for tracking conversations. I’ve tested ideas by pitching via cold email and Reddit DMs long before writing code; these days I lean on Clay and Apollo for prospecting, and Pulse for Reddit to find people already ranting about the exact pain I’m thinking of solving.\n\nSo yeah, sell before you code or you’re just practicing, not building a business.",

Selling before you code is useful for demand validation, but it does not surface delivery complexity, support load, or where customers get stuck after onboarding. The pattern behind many fast ARR ramps is that early traction looks great, then repeat contacts and edge cases explode once real usage starts. That usually shows up later as churn or heavy manual work that was never priced in. The lesson I’d take is validate willingness to pay early, but don’t confuse that with validating the full system. What matters is what happens after the first few customers say yes.",

Features that didn't work as expected. Workflows that were harder than they should be. UI decisions that confused them. Everything.\nFirst instinct was defensiveness. If it was so bad why did they keep paying. Why didn't they say something earlier. But I pushed past that and actually read it carefully.\nEvery point was valid. Not all of them were things I'd fix but every single one came from a real experience of friction. They'd just been living with it because switching would be worse. That's not loyalty. That's tolerance. And tolerance runs out eventually.\nSet up a call to dig deeper. They were surprised I wanted to talk. Expected to be ignored or get defensive pushback. Instead I spent an hour understanding their workflows and where we made things harder than necessary.\nFixed about 40% of what they mentioned over the next two months. Told them what we wouldn't fix and why. They went from tolerating us to actively recommending us. Became a case study. All because I treated their essay of complaints as a gift instead of an attack.\nMost customers won't tell you what's wrong. They'll just leave. When someone takes the time to write 1,400 words about your problems, that's someone who cares enough to try. Listen to them.",

What really stands out is that you closed the loop: you listened without defensiveness, clarified what you would and wouldn’t fix, and followed through visibly. That combination builds trust fast. It’s also a good lesson for founders that the most important feedback often comes after renewal, not before,once customers feel safe enough to be honest. treating criticism as a gift instead of an attack is hard, but when you do, it can turn near-churn into advocacy.",

Oh and we renovated our house and had a newborn in between.\n\nLately I notice my son understands more and more every day. He's watching. And I don't want to be the absent dad behind a laptop.\n\nI love what I'm building. But I'm also exhausted. When this product launches I'm taking a real break. My kids won't be young forever.\n\n**So why am I posting this?**\n\nFor the younger people here: the time is now. You have something I don't anymore: time without tradeoffs. No kids waiting for you. No mortgage. No partner wondering when you'll be done.\n\nLearn. Take chances. Build. Fail. Do it again. You can absorb the hits differently at 25 than at 40.\n\nMake some fun too obviously.

She'd be editing photos at 2am, then up at 6 with the toddler, running on coffee and pure stubbornness. Her husband helped but there's only so many hours in a day. She eventually scaled back and picked it up again once the youngest started school. Said she wished she'd given herself permission to slow down earlier instead of grinding herself down trying to do everything at once.\n\n\n\nNot saying that's the right call for everyone but \"they won't be young again\" cuts both ways - you also won't get this time back and you can't be present if you're running on fumes",

I can learn faster, and I don’t need to go to a school or pay big money for everything. I can study little by little, even in the evening or on weekends.\n\nAlso, I think in your 20s and 30s it is the perfect time to try something. You have more energy, and you can take more risky bets. Even if you fail, you still have time to start again. So if someone is young and thinking about a business or a new skill, I would say: start now, don’t wait too long.",

It was really tough, but quit my full-time to build and launch a fitness and nutrition app. Time is indeed fleeting but I will say, without a partner in my life, I struggle to stay focused and to stay motivated. I feel like having a supportive partner is a cheat code. I did really well in my 20s thanks to my partner, we had a far from perfect relationship but It was pretty predictable. I can't imagine having a wife and kids, that's my goal man. I don't care if I don't have a ton of money as long as I have that, I would be happy. I hope I can attract the right person someday.",

Wanted to share our 2026 setup for personalizing cold emails at scale since our team spent a lot of time & money refining this process.\n\n**Here's our workflow that's been working:**\n\n1. In our CRM we prepare two custom fields under people leads: 'prospect\\_post' and 'custom\\_message'\n2. The 'prospect\\_post' field will get filled with a LI post from the prospect, that we scrape using predictent.ai\n3. We then run GPT 4o mini over the 'custom\\_message' field and generate a custom message based on the data in 'prospect\\_post'. If the messages aren't good enough we refine with a stronger model e.g. GPT 5 or Gemini 2.5 Pro\n4. We export this data to CSV and import directly into our cold email provider, the custom\\_message gets parsed as a {{custom\\_message}} variable in the first line.\n\nThe difference vs generic outreach is night and day. Instead of *\"Saw you're hiring\"* we're hitting them with\n\n*\"Noticed you just announced your Series B and are expanding into EMEA - here's how \\[our product\\] helped \\[similar company\\] scale their \\[specific use case\\] across 12 countries...\"*\n\nThe signal monitoring with custom messaging is what makes it actually scalable. We're not manually researching every prospect or relying on basic firmographic triggers. We're catching real-time events that indicate genuine buying intent, and the AI layer makes it sound human and relevant.\n\nResponse rates are up \\~3x compared to our old approach. Worth considering if you're still spending hours on manual research per prospect.",

      "text": "Every time I see someone post about building a \"passive income SaaS\" I want to ask what exactly they think passive means. Because I've been running a product at $19K MRR for two years and there's nothing passive about it.\n\nMonday this week I spent 3 hours on support tickets. Tuesday was a bug that broke checkout for about 6 hours and cost us roughly $400 in lost sales plus my entire afternoon to fix. Wednesday I wrote a blog post for SEO that took 4 hours. Thursday was calls with two enterprise prospects and updating our roadmap. Friday I dealt with a customer who found a way to abuse our free tier and had to decide whether to grandfather them or cut them off.\n\nThat's a pretty normal week. Sometimes it's lighter. Sometimes it's worse. But the idea that you can build something and then just collect checks while sitting on a beach is a lie people tell to sell courses.\n\nThere's always support. There's always maintenance. There's always marketing that needs doing. There's always the random emergency that appears out of nowhere. The business doesn't run itself. It runs because I run it every single week.\n\nWhat I do have is flexibility. I can work from anywhere. I can structure my days how I want. I can take a week off if I really need to and things won't completely collapse. But that's not passive income. That's self-employment with good boundaries. The distinction matters because if you're getting into SaaS expecting to automate yourself out of a job you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe real pitch for SaaS isn't passive income. It's leverage. It's the ability to serve thousands of customers without thousands of hours. It's income that can grow without proportional increases in time. But it's still work. Always.",

The fantasy breaks people because they think the hard part is launch, when the real game starts after product-market fit.\n\nThe only semi-passive part I’ve seen is when you build tight processes and guardrails: aggressive monitoring, solid incident runbooks, async support with clear SLAs, and documentation so you’re not the bottleneck. Tools like Intercom/HelpScout for support, Customer.io for lifecycle, and stuff like Pulse for Reddit or SparkToro to quietly sit on top of organic channels so distribution keeps running in the background.\n\nSaaS is work.

I think the damage of the passive-income myth is that it attracts people who hate ongoing responsibility, when SaaS actually rewards people who are willing to show up consistently, fix boring problems, and keep the machine healthy. what you’re describing isn’t failure of the model, it’s the model working exactly as it does at sustainable scale.",

Between 150 B2B customers and 50k B2C end-users, my weekly workload is mostly limited to handling minor support issues.\n\nWhile the 'beach lifestyle' is great, I’m aware that staying idle is a long-term risk for the business. It’s definitely possible to achieve this level of passive income at this scale, but it requires a constant trade-off between total freedom and future growth.",

No acquisition cost. Just show up and collect.\n\nAbout 230 of them migrated over. Revenue jumped overnight. I was celebrating.\n\nThen the support tickets started.\n\nThese customers had been using a different product with different workflows. They didn't want to learn our way. They wanted us to work like the old thing worked. Every ticket was basically \"this isn't how I used to do it.\"\n\nFeature requests flooded in. Things the competitor had that we didn't. Things I'd never build because they didn't fit our vision. But these customers expected them. They'd paid for them before.\n\nThe churn started at month three. About 40% of them left within six months. They'd tried to make us work, couldn't adjust, and gave up.\n\nThe ones who stayed are actually good customers now. But the math wasn't what I thought.\n\nExpected: 230 new customers at $89/month = $20,470/month added\n\nReality: about 85 stayed long-term = $7,565/month added\n\nSupport cost during migration: probably ate half of that in the first year.\n\nStill a net positive. But not the windfall I expected. Inherited customers come with inherited expectations. And those expectations are expensive to disappoint or expensive to meet.\n\nFree customers aren't actually free.\n\nHas anyone else inherited customers from a dying competitor?",

Around $800K ARR I realized I was the bottleneck. Strategic thinking wasn't happening because I was buried in operations. Hiring was slow because I couldn't let go of anything. The team was frustrated because everything had to go through me.\n\nA advisor told me something that stung. \"You built a great product. You're not a great CEO. Those are different skills.\" He wasn't wrong.\n\nHired someone to be CEO. Someone with actual experience scaling companies. Someone who'd done the thing I was trying to figure out. Gave them real authority, not just a title.\n\nThe first few months were brutal on my ego. Watching someone else make decisions about my company. Disagreeing sometimes and not getting the final say. Feeling like a visitor in my own house.\n\nBut the results were undeniable. She restructured the team. Fixed processes I didn't know were broken. Made hires I wouldn't have made who turned out great. Revenue doubled in 18 months.\n\nI'm still involved. Focus on product now, which is what I actually love. The company is better because I got out of the way.\n\nFounder ego is real. The belief that because you created something, you should run it forever. But creation and operation are different skills. Being honest about that made everything better.\n\nHave you ever stepped back from a role you identified with?\n\n\n",

Been CEO since the beginning, scaled us to nearly $2m ARR, but hitting plateaus. \n\nThe last couple years I've been distracted and it shows. My boyfriend (now fiance) was diagnosed with terminal cancer and while it was just manageable before, I'm needed more at home than ever before, just as the company needs a tighter grip on the wheel. \n\nI found that I was hitting my limits in terms of real and emotional energy (when something BIG hits home, you just stop caring about that metrics dashboard 🥲) and was reaching decision fatigue, unable to make clear fast decisions when that used to be one of my strong suits. The burnout was slow, and then all at once. \n\nI'm officially stepping back as of the new year, with my chairperson taking over in my seat. They've had experience scaling and exiting businesses bigger than mine, and knows our story and team well enough to do it justice. \n\nThe next few months will be telling, though, as we put this change into practice. I suspect I'll struggle with aspects of it, like OP, but I'm optimistic that our new CEO will take us to new heights while giving me some much needed breathing space 🙏",

From some experience new ‘senior leadership’ has only been a discussion once small equity % (like 1%) means something. At 800k ARR, assuming a ceo costs 200-300k/yr (low end) you are likely at a ~2m valuation so would either be giving almost all of your margin to the new CEO in form of salary, or giving them ~10% of your equity every 12 months.

      "text": "Today I’m going to share with you exactly what my brother and I are doing to grow our [SaaS](https://taap.it/oyneU0f) and reach 10K MRR.\n\nJust a method we’ve been applying every single day for months.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Step 1 Build in public on TikTok & Instagram**\n\nFor over a year, we’ve been documenting everything. Every day.  \nWe share our doubts, the features in progress, the struggles, the small wins everything. And that’s what creates a real connection with our audience.  \nWe don’t sell in the videos, we just build a relationship.  \nAnd today, TikTok and Instagram have become our number one acquisition channel.  \nIt’s simple: people follow us, they see our dedication, they understand our product.  \nAnd the day we offer them to try it, they’re already convinced.\n\n**Step 2 LinkedIn: outbound + content**\n\nEvery morning, I reach out to 50 to 60 people on LinkedIn.  \nHighly targeted profiles. No randomness.  \nI check who liked or commented on a post related to our topic, and I start a real conversation.  \nNothing aggressive, I just suggest a chat.  \nThen I post on my profile, once a day.  \nEither educational content, storytelling, or a lead magnet.  \nThe posts that work best for us right now are niche lead magnets with a real promise.  \nYou get people to comment, create engagement, send them a DM and that’s how conversions happen.\n\n**Step 3 Cold Email**\n\nWe send about 500 emails a day with Instantly.  \nBut before that, we make sure our domain is warmed up, the copy is solid, and the targeting is right.  \nWe don’t go in all directions.  \nWe only target people who have shown intent.  \nFor example: if we’re offering an analytics tool, we’ll target SaaS founders who recently hired in marketing or posted a job for a SEO consultant.  \nThat changes everything.  \nBecause the message fits, and the reply rate skyrockets.  \nWhat matters is the substance of your emails not the style.\n\n**Step 4 X (formerly Twitter)**\n\nX works totally differently from other platforms: here, **interaction is the game**.  \nSo every day, I post 4 tweets spaced out during the day.  \nAnd I comment on at least 50 posts.  \nBut I don’t comment just to comment.  \nI bring a real perspective, I open a conversation.  \nAnd little by little, it brings followers, visibility, and conversations that can turn into customers.  \nWhat’s crazy is that there’s a strong SaaS community on X super valuable connections.\n\n**Step 5 Reddit**\n\nReddit is underrated in France.  \nBut when you start understanding how it works, it’s an incredible channel.  \nWe got over 200K views in 7 days with one well-written post.  \nBut be careful, Reddit is strict.  \nYou have to first interact with the community, get “accepted”, and then you can start posting.  \nWhen I post on Reddit, I never mention our tool directly.  \nI tell a story, share a lesson or a struggle.  \nAnd if people engage, I reply in the comments or redirect gently.  \nIt’s a powerful channel but you have to handle it with care.\n\n**Step 6 Patience and consistency**\n\nAll these channels take time.  \nBut you have to do it every day.  \nNot for 2 weeks. Not for a month.  \nWe’re talking **at least 6 months** for compound effect to kick in.  \nAnd it’s exactly because most people quit too early… that those who stick with it end up winning big.  \nWhat we apply is a simple discipline: each channel has its routine, we set clear goals, and we keep iterating.",

One thing I’d add is the importance of refining your product based on feedback as you go. The more you listen to what your audience needs, the better you can adjust your messaging and offer.

The harder part is deciding which metrics earn the right to influence spend and effort.\n\nWe see teams drowning in dashboards while still guessing at revenue because engagement metrics travel well across channels, but buying intent shows up sparsely and late. Views, likes, replies, and conversations all inflate fast. Only a small slice correlates with closed deals.\n\nWhat’s worked for us is tagging every inbound or outbound touch with a concrete next state. Did this interaction advance a deal stage, introduce a decision maker, create a budget conversation, or trigger a trial tied to usage? If it didn’t change account posture, it stays classified as awareness.\n\nOver time the channels separate themselves. Some are great for priming. Some create timing signals. Very few reliably move money. Until that distinction is enforced, “tracking everything” still leaves you optimizing for activity instead of revenue.\n\nCurious how you’re defining and enforcing that line internally.",

      "text": "I’m writing this from a place of deep burnout and physical exhaustion. A few years ago, I made a career decision that I thought would be my \"big break.\" Instead, it turned into a multi-year downward spiral that cost me my health, my family time, and my sanity—all for a salary that wasn't even worth the medical bills I’m paying now. I'm shouting into the void here because I need to get this off my chest before I lose my mind.\n\nIf you’re a dev currently eyeing a \"remote startup,\" please read my story before you sign that offer.\n\n**The \"Flexible Timing\" Trap.** They sold me on remote work with \"flexible hours.\" What that actually meant was flexible for them, not for me. I was essentially on-call 24/7. My phone would blow up at 2 AM, 6 AM, midnight, or on Sundays (this happened more often than you think). It didn’t matter. If they had a random thought or a minor bug, they expected me to fix it ASAP. I failed multiple times trying to set boundaries.\n\n**Management by Chaos.** We were a \"team of 5,\" which sounds intimate until I realized it meant I would be managed by five different people. I was the only one actually implementing anything; the other four were just there to ask me for \"quick updates\" every hour. Because there were no clear meeting times, my day was a constant stream of individual calls. Instead of having one manager, I had five different stakeholders breathing down my neck, none of whom bothered to talk to each other before dumping their conflicting priorities on me. The mental overhead was exhausting—I was in a state of perpetual context switching, which made it impossible to find any 'flow' or build deep expertise.\n\n**The WhatsApp Hellscape.** We didn't use Jira. We didn't use Teams. We used WhatsApp. It is the single worst tool for professional work. Instructions were lost in encrypted calls and random texts. Because there was no paper trail, they would change requirements mid-stream and then blame me when the result didn't match the imaginary goalposts they moved three times in their heads.\n\n**The Physical Toll.** The worst part was the time zone difference. I was working nights, fighting against my own circadian rhythm. My immunity tanked. I caught every infection going around, and my medical bills started eating a huge chunk of my paycheck. My family had to suffer too—staying up late to make me dinner, adjusting their entire lives around my schedule. It wasn’t just my job; it was a lifestyle disease.\n\n**The \"Junior CTO\" Scam.** I was mid-level, but they expected me to build the entire business infrastructure from the ground up even though I was hired as an Individual Contributor (and not as a CTO or Architect). They hired me because I was cheaper than a Senior Architect, then forced me to learn new frameworks in days and apply them flawlessly. When the \"un-scalable\" systems (that they rushed!) inevitably broke, I was the one who had to bear the failure.\n\nThey used the phrase \"growth mindset\" to mask the fact that they had no plan. I wasn't growing; I was just being used as a guinea pig for a million directionless experiments.\n\n**TL;DR:** I took a \"flexible\" remote role at a tiny startup. I ended up with zero boundaries, five bosses, a broken body, and a career that felt directionless. Don't let \"learning opportunities\" be the bait that hooks you into a toxic environment.",

          "text": "This hits on something people rarely talk about, remote work exposes broken leadership much faster than office work. When everything is async, the lack of ownership, priorities, and decision making becomes your problem by default. A good takeaway here is not to avoid startups, but to interview them just as hard on process, communication norms, and time zone expectations. Those answers usually tell the real story long before the offer does.",

          "text": "I'm in a startup too and the management can be a little chaotic or nonsensical. But, related to the actual work, my big issue is the opposite. The standard is very low and there's no one to teach me or mentor me anything (I know there're plenty of videos on yt and courses, but some things are learned with experience, for example, you don't learn how to manage people just by watching videos online), there's no growth opportunity, no leadership opportunity. No one talks to me about anything, there's no vision for the business, no growth, no nothing. I barely have anything to work on. \n\nYou might think this is great, no one bothers you, you have no pressure, and no work even. Well, that's what I thought too, but it also means that my work has no purpose, it's meaningless; it means that my laziness got the best out of me and I've learned nothing; it means I'm alone all the time with no one to talk to for days.\n\nAfter some years (too many), I look back and I have to be accountable. I got too comfortable, too complacent, and now I'm paying for it with regrets. I should have left much earlier, I should have pushed myself more, learn more...\n\nI'm not just telling you this to show you my lack of character, it's a warning for everyone. You need some pressure in order to grow and it can be external or internal. Not too much, not too little. In your case you had too much external pressure and it broke you. I had too little internal pressure and it broke me. This is no where near where I want to be, nor the person I want to become.\n\nTLDR: Stand up for yourself, push just passed your limits, don't chase comfort, don't be complacent, escape full-speed from what's preventing you from growing (professionally and personally), live large, live fully, take risks, try many things, don't stop learning, take care of your loved ones and protect your time with them at all costs. \n\nBest of luck,\n\nHappy new year!",

It could be that you need to grow (sometimes a lot) to fit the position you're in, even entry positions. But it also could be that they are expecting senior amount and quality of work and responsability to a junior to save on paycheck. \n\nCheck with peers what the \"normal\" looks like for them with plenty of details. If you don't know any people on similar positions, ask on Reddit or send dms on LinkedIn (I recommend this one, now and then you'll find amazing helpful people).\n\nBesides this, don't run away from difficulty, stress or anxiety immediately after it presents itself. Don't try to find people to blame because you'll find them. Take a break, breathe first, and reflect on your character and what you can control. \n\nWhat's your dream (a great career, a family, money, freedom, helping others...)? Do you really want to pursue this career? Are you good at it? Do you enjoy it? Is it meaningful to you? Do you really want to grow in this profession? Are you looking for a rapid growth (more pain, more gain)? Or do you prefer a more steady and progressive growth? How much are you willing to sacrifice (time, money, hanging out with friends, with family, free time on your own...)? What's your timeframe? What is success to you (don't compare yourself with others, give me your answer)? Where would you have to be in 1 year (5y, 10y...) to call it success? Did you lie on your resume? Did they not communicate properly their expectations during the interview? Did you specifically asked them during the interview?\n\nBe very clear and very specific, rich in details, during interviews about what you are willing to do and what not. Be realistic with the world and yourself. If it's not a match, skip. I know it's hard to find a job and it is tedious, but it doesn't compare with being miserable a 3rd of your day every day, every week, every month, every year...\n\nBest of luck",

Next time, negotiate upfront about decision ownership, async norms, incident escalation, tools, and off-hours expectations and treat vague answers as real answers.

That quickly destroys focus, health, and personal time.\n\nThe chaos you mentioned also comes from missing systems.

Parts of it read more like a constructed cautionary tale than a fully organic experience.\n\nThat said, on the substance:\n\nThe moment core work communication happens on **WhatsApp**, that should be an immediate red flag. Any experienced professional should recognize this as amateur-level operations and start looking elsewhere. Lack of proper tooling means no traceability, no accountability, and constant scope drift.\n\nI also find it hard to believe a startup operating with that level of chaos could survive for long. With no clear processes, no documentation, and conflicting priorities, the money would almost certainly run out long before a real product ever materialized.\n\nWhere I disagree strongly is the conclusion that there was no growth. There *was* growth — just the hard kind. You now understand, firsthand, how *not* to build a startup, how expensive bad communication and weak boundaries are, and how quickly poor technical and organizational decisions compound. Many founders only learn these lessons after burning investor money. Learning them on your own skin is painful, but it’s real.\n\n*Note: This comment was originally written in a non-English language and then translated and reformulated with the assistance of AI.*",

          "text": "the trick i've used (and its a massive pain in the ass to code) is 'when necessary' onboarding. \n\nI learned the concept from a dude i worked with and just kept it for my own projects. \n\nstep 1.) understand the 'perfect' onboarding is above all else just really good and intuitive UX. Your users should be able to 'intuit' next steps in your user flow and when/how to use features. If you're not focusing on that above all else, fix it. \n\nstep 2.) is realizing no matter how well you do step 1..... users are still dumb as hell. So have flags to point them in the right direction when needed and only do it once. \n\nexample:  \n\\- user signs up for my app (idk lets go with an expense tracker for example) \n\n\\- they see a dashboard with a bunch of options (start a budget, add income, upload account, etc)   \n\\- ideally your UX makes it so they start uploading the right data in the right order (lets say 'accounts => income => expenses => budget builder)   \n\\- have a pop up/tooltip/whatever say \"most users start here\" then add a flag (bool value) to your user profile database table that once they click it, change the bool value so it doesn't show up again (to avoid annoying them)\n\n\\- then when they do the first step and have an account set up have the next pop up/thing go \"great job, the next step is to set up expenses\" and navigate them there with one click. \n\n\\- repeat this flow for everything. \n\nwhenever a user 'starts' a feature flow, make sure you have tool tips/pop ups that show them how to finish it, shows them options they have (only when its time to make choices on the options, not before), etc.   \n  \nKeep it simple, don't overwhelm them with everything upfront cause they'll do what all of us do \"skip, skip, skip, skip, jesus christ stop asking me stuff and let me use the damn app, skip, skip, finally\" \n\n  \nthats the best experience i've had for my users and while its a harder to do, its worth it.",

      "text": "Yo.\n\nJust to get things straight right away: this post isn't BS.\n\nSEO is in a terrible state these days. Experts share contradictory advice, agencies try to make SEO very complex so they can charge more. And AI search makes it even more blurry as people claim GEO is completely different from SEO when in reality there's like a 80% overlap between SEO & whatever you call the new \"AI SEO\".\n\nSo this is a **curated** list. What doesn't work isn't listed here.\n\nIf you do just the first 2 and you weren’t doing it before, I guarantee you'll get +6-10 positions for the associated pages on Google depending on your niche.\n\nI know this works because I ran experiments on 4 different websites I own and I helped about 30 different websites implement these strategies.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**1. Refresh old content (easiest win)**\n\nGo to Google Search Console. Find posts ranking positions 8-20. These are *so close* to getting traffic but invisible on page 2.\n\nUpdate them: add a new section, fix outdated stats, improve the intro. Then update the published date.\n\nI've seen posts jump 10+ positions within weeks. Lowest hanging fruit in SEO.\n\n**2. Add authors to your blog posts**\n\nGoogle's E-E-A-T framework cares about *who* wrote your content. Add a visible author with a short bio, and **a link to LinkedIn/X**.\n\nEvery time I apply this to a site that wasn't doing it, posts climb 4-8 positions within 2 weeks. Stupid easy.\n\n**3. Integration marketplaces = free high-authority backlinks**\n\nYou're building a SaaS? Then it's very likely you'll want to build an integration with another platform at some point. Get listed on their marketplace: it's free DA 90+ backlink.\n\nHubSpot App Marketplace, Zapier, WordPress plugin directory, Chrome Extensions web store. These listings also drive actual users, not just SEO juice.\n\n**4. Exact domain match still works**\n\nIf you haven't started your venture, you can get a huge SEO boost on a specific keyword if your domain & brand matches it exactly.\n\nGoogle nerfed this years ago, but it still helps when combined with quality content. If you haven't bought your domain yet, spend an extra hour finding one with your primary keyword in it.\n\n**5. Build a free tool**\n\nCalculator, checker, generator - doesn't matter. People love linking to useful resources. One weekend project can earn you backlinks for years.\n\nI built a simple [Domain Rating checker](https://blogseo.io/tools/dr-checker). It takes seconds to use, costs me almost nothing to run, and it gets linked a lot on social media.\n\n**6. Fresh, regular content**\n\nGoogle rewards sites that publish consistently. It signals your site is active and worth crawling frequently. Each article = new entry point from search.\n\n**7. Find keyword gaps**\n\nEveryone tells you to copy competitors. But the real opportunity is what they're *not* doing.\n\nFind terms competitors aren't targeting well. One overlooked keyword with decent volume can become your traffic goldmine while everyone else fights over high-competition terms.\n\nI've seen single well-chosen keywords bring 80% of total traffic on niche sites.\n\n**8. NAP consistency**\n\nYour brand name, URL, and social links should be identical everywhere: Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, X, directories.\n\nWhen Google sees the same info repeated across trusted sources, it builds confidence you're legitimate. Inconsistencies create doubt.\n\n**9. Curated directories only**\n\nIf it's free and anyone can post, don't expect much. Generic directories are worthless.\n\nWhat works for SaaS: Product Hunt, G2, Capterra, \"There's an AI for That\", places that actually vet submissions or require payment.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO**\n\nOne template + structured data = thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords.\n\nClassic example: Zapier's integration pages. But you need a decent backlink profile first, or these pages won't rank.\n\n**11. FAQ sections**\n\nFAQs let you target long-tail keywords and qualify for rich snippets. More SERP real estate = higher CTR.\n\nEven more important now with AI search. When AI fans out your query into sub-queries, FAQ content formatted as Q&A is exactly what they're looking for.\n\n**12. Backlinks outreach**\n\nCold outreach still works:\n\n- Guest posting (you provide content, they get a backlink)\n- Broken link replacement (find broken links on relevant sites, suggest your content)\n- Unlinked mentions (find articles mentioning you without linking, ask for the link)\n\nIt's time consuming. But it works. The only downside to traditional link exchanges is that when scaled, reciprocal links can look suspicious to Google. Site A links to B, B links back to A. Google knows it's a trade.\n\nIf you want to automate link building, I built an ABC backlink exchange into [BlogSEO](https://blogseo.io/). Users get matched with sites in similar niches and the system inserts contextual backlinks using a triangle structure (A→B→C→A) so there's no direct reciprocation. No cold outreach & no reciprocal penalty.\n\n**13. Comparison pages**\n\n\"[Competitor] alternatives\" and \"[Competitor] vs [Your brand]\" searches are bottom-of-funnel gold. These people have already decided to buy - they're just picking which option.\n\nBe honest in these. If you're worse at something, say it. Builds trust and filters out bad-fit customers.\n\n**14. Schema markup that matters**\n\nMost sites skip this or add useless generic markup. Three that actually help:\n\n- `Person`/`Author` - links content to a real human\n- `FAQPage` - qualifies for rich snippets\n- `SameAs` - tells Google all places your brand exists\n\nIf you do this, and are patient enough, I can guarantee you'll get more organic traffic within 3 months.\n\nResults of some websites I've helped with the aforementioned tactics:\n\n- SaaS 1: https://imgur.com/a/OXcw9Ob\n- SaaS 2: https://imgur.com/a/PTozQLx\n- Gaming Directory website: https://imgur.com/a/aU4KK71\n\nHappy to answer questions if needed!",

The tech worked fine but nobody could figure out how to make people comfortable with it. Fast forward to now and it's the same problem... the capability exists but the trust doesn't. I've watched companies try to package this as \"security enhancement\" or \"personalization\" but consumers aren't stupid - they know when they're being tracked. Even at Cloudastra Technologies where we aggregate content, we specifically avoid any facial data collection because the liability alone would kill us.

If you don't - you loose.\n\nPeople who're on the bottom of the funnel, for them - it's about hiring the right people to do the job.\n\nTry to estimate how long it would be until you reach this point. And don't forget that even if you product has someone who needs it - doesn't mean they see enough value in that to make you profitable.\n\nDon't want to sound negative.

Once you add vpcs and databases even in development the costs get real. \n\nMy simple sass app is running about $65-$75/mo for aws. Then add a Claude subscription at $100/mo. Even the most basic apps start at $200/mo. \n\nMaybe it’s a mistake on my part but I like to work on several projects at once and I can see my monthly development costs getting too expensive. \n\nWhat would you recommend?  How early do you launch your mvp?  The last thing I want is something fragile for first experience. Just curious if anyone has a good pattern here.",

      "text": "First real employee. Spent months recruiting. Found someone great. Offered the job. They accepted and I was thrilled. Finally had help after doing everything alone for two years.\nThree weeks later they resigned. Said it wasn't working out. I was devastated. Thought I'd found the right person. Thought we were building something together. Asked if they'd do an honest exit interview since there was nothing to lose at that point. They agreed and didn't hold back. Everything they said was about me not them.\nI gave contradictory instructions and got frustrated when they didn't know which to follow. I said I wanted autonomy but then micromanaged every decision they made. I communicated goals without context so they never understood why things mattered. I was so busy I never made time to actually train them properly. Three weeks in and they felt confused and untrusted and set up to fail. So they left before it got worse. The hard part was that everything they said was true. I'd been so focused on getting help that I didn't prepare to actually provide leadership. I expected them to read my mind. I treated training as interruption rather than investment.\nTook six months before I hired again. Spent that time building processes. Writing things down. Creating actual onboarding. Thinking about what it would feel like to start fresh with no context. Next hire stayed two years. Same basic role. Different outcome because I'd fixed myself not just filled a seat. The first hire failing was entirely my fault. Their exit interview was a gift I didn't deserve but desperately needed.\n\n",

I believe some of my issue is expectations are not being met fully that and my product is naturally where you come in, extract value then leave.

The address of your registered agent will typically not work for Stripe and most EMIs or online banks. There are services you can use however that will provide you such an address and will give you a lease agreement which you can use for verification. The Farm Soho and Start in Wyoming both offer this.

Easiest path is usually: 1) update your LLC records to list a real mailing/principal office (home or coworking) and 2) mirror that in Stripe. In most states you can amend the LLC to show a principal office that’s your Canadian home, then upload a utility bill or bank statement for that. Second option is a legit office/coworking lease (e.g., Regus, Industrious) with your business name on it; Stripe usually takes that. I’d avoid random virtual mailboxes unless they explicitly say Stripe/banking-compliant. I use Wise for cross-border banking, Mercury for the US side, and Pulse for Reddit to find how other SaaS folks solved similar Stripe KYC headaches.

In my opinion, in that scenario best way to go about it is to validate the idea by having people prepay. The idea is that if it is truly a pain point for people they are going to be more than happy to pay even before the product or service is available. If you are able to generate even a little bit of interest, then you can leverage that to either raise more funds or you could even get a loan at that point because you have just proven the idea works.

              "text": "u/DaveLLD That is very interesting! You found a technical co-founder who build the entire app and infra, all by themselves? Or are you the technical person who did that?\n\nMy second question would be how young were you when you first did it?\n\nIn my experience, unless your technical person lives with their parents and practically have no expenses, they are going to be distracted with their paid job and will have very little energy to be able to built a really product. I am not at all saying it is impossible, but very rare. Also, someone who is being paid and isn't constantly worried about money will have a better incentive to do the job, in my opinion. (they might not do the best job but it often is good enough to get started)\n\nI have seen good ideas dye because the technical co-founder could commit enough time to build the idea.\n\nFor context, I am a technical person. My new approach is to only look for projects where the non-technical cofounder has done some serious validation and preferably have generated some presale revenue.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts!",

                  "text": "First time around was mid 20's, it was a unique situation as I had a agency initially and the technical cofounder and I worked together on other projects before we launched our SaaS. The verbal agreement that we ultimately acted on was spec work to the SaaS that went to a ledger which would ultimately be his \"buy-in\" to the business, or a debt he'd be able to collect on at some point if we decided to not bring him in as a co-founder.  Exited that before it was got big, (around 1M ARR). When we started this one, I thought I knew everything, but I knew next to nothing, we just kept going until we figured it out, it was hard and time consuming. \n\nSecond time, started early 40's, first co-founder was a great friend, but his life blew up right after we got started, so he phased out and I spent months searching for a new co-founder. Found an experienced engineer with experience at multiple companies with names you'd recognize, had the option to be part time for less equity and full time for more, after a few months decided to focus on the project full time. In starting this business, I have a wealth of experience and knowledge I've gained over my career that's allowed us to shortcut so many things, it's been way, way easier this time around, but still a challenge.  The experience and knowledge I have was why I was able to attract a high quality co-founder. \n\nBuilding a successful startup that will last is \\_really\\_ hard, it takes privilege or incredible grit, and sometimes both.  You have to be a little crazy to found a Startup, because you need to accept that all the odds are stacked against you and the vast majority of people who go down this route fail,  but you're going to be the exception to the rule. \n\nTrying to \"own it all\" can work, but statistically one technical and one non-technical founder gives you the best chances of success.\n\nI've seen some commentary in the thread complaining about non-technical founders just having an \"idea\" and this is for sure a problem, there are many people who want to be the non-technical founder, but what that means to them is they have an idea and someone else does all the work...this is just the same thing as \"technical co-founder who can't get it done, either out of lack of time or experience\" but for the non-technical co-founder. Everyone needs to bring value or it's not going to work long term, founder conflict is what kills most startups before they reach their potential. \n\nThe honest truth is, while solid technical development really makes things so much easier, unless you are building the next Netflix , Facebook etc. (which only .00000001% of people are, and you will know that you are. If you aren't sure...you aren't), a working product is more important than a technically adept one. \n\nThe biggest myth I had when I started in this career many years ago was the belief that all these companies have built really really solid software products, but somehow I will be able to build a better one, the reality is there are many, many, MANY products that make millions and millions which are an absolute train wreck shit show under the hood. \n\nPresale revenue can be very hard depending on the space, but yes as a technical co-founder you need to have confidence that the non-technical co-founder is going to bring value, but honestly their most important jobs is going to be to sell the product, so if they can't sell you on it....\n\nAlso, make sure you get a proper vesting agreement in place before you really get going, it can save you a lot of heartache if someone decides to walk away after a few years but you want to keep going.",

You could potentially hit that $50/month faster while you figure out what problems people actually want to pay to solve.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to go the SaaS route I'd echo what others said - don't look for \"ideas,\" look for specific problems you've personally experienced or seen others struggle with.

Given limited time, a thin SaaS that replaces a spreadsheet, script, or recurring manual task for a niche audience is more realistic than a full platform. Another pattern is starting as a paid service or script and only turning it into SaaS once you see repeat demand.

Focus hard. Ignore everything else. (here’s a list of GTM options I found, pick what fits your ICP: [https://x.com/iamqhsin\\_luna/status/2004407306268897584](https://x.com/iamqhsin_luna/status/2004407306268897584))\n\n1. ⁠Test each one properly. \n2. For us, after trying a few things, LinkedIn DMs worked best. We’re seeing \\~40% connection rate and \\~25% reply rate, with calls booked.\n3. ⁠Once something works, automate and double down. We built an internal LinkedIn BD system that sends \\~40 personalized connection requests per day. (Tools like Phantombuster can help, but we found filtering + personalization was the real win so built our own! hehe)\n\n**PLG system**\n\nWe also designed a simple PLG loop.\n\n→ Users create and share AI lead magnets using our product.  \n→ Those get shared  \n→ new users discover us  \n→ some convert.  \n→ also builds credibility because people see the product in action.\n\n**Lead Magnets**\n\nWe built and shared a lot of AI Tools as lead magnets using [QuickGen AI](https://quickgen.ai/) to attract our ICP\n\nHope this helps! Early GTM is brutal, but focus + repetition really compounds! Don't give up.\n\np.s. other approaches I tried and have explore the automation tools so let me know if you need:\n\n* twitter DM\n* Reddit DM\n* UGC brand ambassador on Tiktok\n* UGC video share to 6 other platforms\n* paid collab system for linkedin creators",

That's how it's sold online and that's what I believed when I started. The reality is different.\n\nSupport tickets don't stop. Even with documentation and even with automation, people have questions. They get stuck. They find edge cases. They need help. That's about 8 hours a week just responding to things. The product needs maintenance too. Dependencies update. Security patches happen. Third party APIs change without warning. Things break for no apparent reason. Another 5 hours a week just keeping the lights on. Marketing can't actually stop either. The moment I pause content or outreach, growth stalls. Competitors keep moving. SEO needs constant feeding. That's another 4 hours minimum if I want to keep growing. Then there's the random stuff like billing issues and refund requests and feature requests that need responses even if I'm not building them and legal compliance updates. Another 3 hours of miscellaneous work that just appears.\n\nAdd it up and my \"passive\" income requires about 20 hours a week of active work. That's half a full time job. Better than a full time job for sure but nowhere near the fantasy of true passive income. I'm not complaining because the business is good and the flexibility is real. But I wish someone had told me earlier that SaaS passive income is more like SaaS reduced-active income. The work doesn't disappear. It just gets more efficient. Maybe at a much larger scale with a real team it becomes truly passive for the founder. I'm not there yet and might never be. I've accepted that the 20 hours is just part of the deal.",

One post won’t do sh\\*t. Do it 100 days in a row. Copy what went viral. Tweak. Repeat.\n3. Stalk your competitors. See where they’re listed. Submit your product there. Manually. Or use a tool. Just do it.\n4. AI + SEO = free traffic. Spin up blog posts with ChatGPT. 50 solid ones can move mountains. Get that domain rating to 15+.\n5. Run some damn ads. X, Google, Facebook... even Bing. Optimize it once, then let it run.\n6. Cold DMs / replies. Find your people. Be short. Be real. Be helpful. 1 sentence pitch. No spam.\n\nThis is how the internet is won. No secret. Just consistent, boring work. And boom—100 users. Then 1000",

Phone in my hand, I went around networking, first asked about them then they'd ask me what I was working on, so I showed them a Figma design bc. the iOS app wasn't ready. When I could see that they were interested, I would just add them on LinkedIn. Next day - one message thanking about the chat and that I'd be in contact when testflight link drops. This allowed me to send the message whenever I want bc. they would see the prev. chat and not think \"who tf is this guy?\"  \n  \n\\-> Researched potential ICP on linkedin, added them, sent reqs. When they accepted, sent them a message saying  \n\"Hi name,  \nI noticed you are saving a lot of stuff on LinkedIn, I am building a tool to make that easier, and also help you chat with everything you saved. If that interests you - would love to have 5 min chat.\"\n\nMy take : doesn't feel efficient at all, but you can get convos started which I think matters for the inital 100. I had around 15-20 interviews. half of them wanted to test the app on Testflight afterwards.\n\n\\-> I post on LinkedIn a lot. Compared to 4 years ago when I was also posting quite a lot, it seems views have fallen. So i dont necessarily get users from there, but a lot of cool people adds me and investors reach out.",

Three months ago the team launched [Anannas ](https://Anannas.ai)as this **unified API thing for LLM models** basically one endpoint to hit 500+ models without dealing with different providers' quirks and I figured maybe a few hundred developers would find it useful. That seemed like a win.\n\nFast forward to today and we're sitting at **5.5K users, 120+ organizations, and 2.5 million API requests** routed through the system. **Anthropic** is our top provider by token volume, which makes sense given how good their models are, but still. **14 billion** tokens routed.\n\nThe wildest part is **No launch on Product Hunt**, no cold outreach. Just built the thing, threw up some docs, and people... found it? Apparently there are a lot of developers out there who are as tired as I was of managing five different API keys and learning five different request formats just to compare models or build fallback logic & also tired with Current Solutions as well.\n\nThe growth curve has been kind of ridiculous we went from \"cool, someone signed up\" to \"wait, we need to optimize this endpoint because we're hitting rate limits\".\n\nIf you're building with LLMs and you're tired of the provider gymnastics, Anannas is running 20% off on all models for 10 days. Applies to every API provider on the platform.

When going through open router's keys it is well known that users get rate limited, and get 429s very often. \n\n\nThat is why its better to connect to openrouters routed models for which they dont use their own key, or directly to said providers BYOK way. \n\n\nThey handle 25T token traffic (only a tiny fraction of that goes through their keys). \n\n\nOP's service is new, and has everyone go through their keys, it is a recipe for disaster, unless they get custom rate limits.

In my experience, that transition from “nice adoption” to “oh this is real traffic” exposes things you didn’t even think to monitor early on.\n\nEither way, this is a great example of demand pulling the product instead of the other way around.",

I’d be curious how you’re handling failover logic, provider pricing pass-through vs margin, and long-term differentiation once the big clouds inevitably push harder on “one API to rule them all.” still, clearly you’ve hit a real pain point, and that’s not easy to do in this space.",

The users use them because they used them before, or the gps (google) sent them this way. They are not the destination, usually that's ugc or other sites. Imagine if you wanted to find out what people thought of your local highway? Put up a sign, who is going to care enough to pull over and call the number? They got stuff to do. Try to flag folks down? Again. Not happening. Go to your local rotary club? You are going to hear from a tiny minority of vocal users. \n\nI think the best ways are 1) watching what happens (session replays, analytics) 2) actually driving on the highway yourself. Build some empathy. 3) If there are accidents, then talking to those folks in more depth.",

When I launched my first app I did the same thing and got similar results makes you feel like youre bothering everyone. Thing is people are busy and if they arent already thinking about your product a random email isnt going to magically make them give feedback. What I found worked better was finding where people were ALREADY talking about the problem my app solved or related topics. For me it was mostly Reddit. By engaging in those conversations genuinely you can naturally bring up your product and get way more relevant feedback and even some early users. Plus its not as intrusive. I actually built a tool to help with this because the manual search was eating up all my time. It finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn based on the actual context of the discussion not just keywords. Its what brought me to your post. It started as an internal tool but turned into its own product. Might be something that could help you surface those organic conversations if you wanna check it out let me know happy to share",

We put some efforts into marketing but they were kind of naive. We misunderstood our audience and also had drawn some incorrect conclusion about our market, and the biggest mistake was that we assumed too much that potential users would think like we do. (They really don't.)\n\nThat experience is what led us to talking to quite a few people in different industries. We then turned that into a bit of a weird combination of human review + signal analysis + a bit of secret sauce and yes, a tiny bit of AI too. The tool is not really ready to go live yet but if you'd like to use it when we're ready to launch, you can join [the waitlist here](https://scratchpath.io). \n\nA few disclaimers: This is not an outreach, cold email, game the system, \"here's how to spam reddit subs with your SaaS link\" automation tool. It's rather a combination of different analysis, metrics and can help you make informed decisions on what steps to take to find actual users in your specific market. **This tool will not make you an overnight success, but we think it can help many people who don't know what to do after the MVP is out there.**",

Yes, you can talk to users early but you can't really \"iterate\" and the setup costs (let alone switching costs) are enormous. Also, as many have experienced, user feedback can be helpful but it can also be quite uninformed.\n\nAside from that, what we're trying to offer is a lot more hand-holding through the process and progress of developed product -> users.

I’d want concrete outputs like: “Run 10 DMs on LinkedIn with this angle,” “Reply to 5 threads on X using these phrases,” or “Spin up a 1-page landing test for segment B.” Clear next steps beat more dashboards.\n\nI’ve bounced between tools like Similarweb and SparkToro for this kind of signal, and lately Pulse for Reddit to hunt real phrasing and complaints in niche subs, but what’s missing is a single place that turns those scattered hints into one tight weekly playbook. If your tool spits out that kind of simple plan, people will keep using it instead of just poking around once and forgetting it exists.",

I’ve felt this exact creep before.\n\nWhen I was building and scaling a B2B product, I also assumed complexity would arrive in “steps” - like we’ll hire more people, then things get complex. In reality, it sneaks in sideways. One extra tool here, a few approvals there, more vendors, more subscriptions… and suddenly the product feels easier than running the company behind it.\n\nA few things that helped me in very practical ways:\n\n1. Accept that complexity doesn’t go away - it just needs boundaries\nInternal complexity does scale with the product, but unmanaged complexity scales faster. The goal isn’t to eliminate it, it’s to contain it early before it turns invisible.\n\n2. Create a single source of truth for spend (even if it’s ugly)\nBefore fancy tools, we started with:\n\n\t•\tOne shared sheet\n\t•\tEvery recurring expense listed (tool, vendor, salary bucket)\n\t•\tOwner per expense (one person responsible)\n\t•\tMonthly review cadence (30 minutes, no deep analysis)\n\nJust doing this surfaced “oh wow, we’re paying for that?” moments almost immediately.\n\n3. Tie spend to ownership, not departments\nThe biggest shift for us was assigning humans to costs, not teams.\nIf someone owns a tool or vendor, they’re responsible for:\n\n\t•\tWhy it exists\n\t•\tWhether it’s still needed\n\t•\tWhen it should be reviewed\n\nThis alone reduced back-and-forth dramatically.\n\n4. Build lightweight processes before you feel you need them\nFor example:\n\n\t•\tAny new tool = written reason + expected outcome\n\t•\tAny recurring cost = calendar reminder to review in 90 days\n\t•\tAny cross-team request = async doc before meetings\n\nThese sound small, but they prevent chaos from becoming culture.\n\n5. This phase is normal - but it’s also a fork in the road\nEvery company I’ve seen hits this point somewhere between ~10–25 people.\nThe ones that struggle long-term are usually the ones who delay “boring” internal systems because they still feel like a startup.\n\nYou’re not failing at operations - you’re encountering the cost of growth.\n\nCurious how you’re currently tracking spend today (tool-wise or process-wise)? There’s usually a small tweak that gives outsized clarity at this stage.\n\nThanks for posting this - a lot of founders feel it but don’t articulate it.",

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://temporal.io/) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing).\n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://mention.click/)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

What we got wrong is the fact that after this, LinkedIn has changed its TOS, and put previously public data behind the login screen, which has made public data not public anymore.\n\nReddit, on the other hand, does not require you to log in to see posts and comments.\n\nThis is a controversial topic and selective law application, in my opinion.\n\nSince Google, Perplexity, etc, scrape the entirety of the internet to power their products. \n\nYou could argue that they are pushing progress and evolving the tech (that's somewhat true), but in the end of the day, they are businesses whose main goal is to earn money. \n\nI think that scraping people's data or UGC, eventually making them lose money (like scraping Medium posts protected by the paywall), is piracy; LinkedIn is a different thing. At least in my opinion.\n\nFor us, we decided to stop playing this game of scrapping, even though the internet wouldn't be the place we know right now without it.",

I think from all the failed projects, I learned a lot. At least what not to do the next time.\n\n\n\nI remember building my first \"REAL STARTUP\", oh god, that was a mistake. We invested 1.5 years, probably around 10k USD, in really stupid things like getting a legal entity, paying an accountant to file our taxes, paying for the designs, servers, etc.  What did I get from that project? nothing, except the experience. \n\nI learned lots of cool things about PostgreSQL (we were doing PostgreSQL replication, kind of FiveTran), and met cool people. I met a guy, and we have been making all the projects mentioned in this post together since then. We got along only because of that first failed project I had. I think I even landed a good 9-5 job because of that project.\n\nI remember I sucked at the interview (live coding), so in the end, I just acknowledged that and said something like \"I know I sucked, but here is my GitHub, there is a project I worked on. All the code is mine there,\" and I think that could have played a role in their decision.\n\nSo, think about whether you should stop making it, and see if you can sell it. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is stop at the right time and work on damage limitation.\n\nHope that helps at least somehow.",

Even more for mission-critical systems or those where rolling out bugfixes is very costly (e.g. airplanes, banking, unpatchable embedded systems).\n\nSure, you can demand more testing from your developers, but you're:\n\n* Paying extra: Devs usually cost more than QA at the same level of experience\n* Doing a worse job: Devs know how to build stuff and think constructively. QA know how to look for holes and think destructively. Completely different mindset.\n* Slowing down development.\n\n3-4 days cycle times aren't necessarily a problem, you can accommodate that by changing your release strategy to once every two weeks or so. However, with your dev to QA ratio, you're likely building up more and more QA debt over time since they won't have the capacity to write and maintain test specifications, test data, and automated tests all while spending most of their time executing manual regression tests.\n\nFrom your post I'm assuming you're an engineering manager or product manager, is that right? If you're the CTO, you can push back on the CFO and make sure you get more QA before expanding dev further. Otherwise you can raise that concern with your CTO.  \nDo you have an experienced senior QA who knows how to define a suitable test strategy and coordinate QA work overall? If you don't that might be another important factor; QA without a strong leader is just playing catch-up rather than taking ownership of quality.\n\n  \nFeel free to DM if you want to discuss any of this in more detail; it's a bit tricky to diagnose like this without relying on guesswork.",

The situation created deep suffering because users encountered problems with buttons which we had labeled as \"intuitive.\" Users needed to find features which we had placed under the settings menu.\n\nWe were manually onboarding them, basically acting as a human \"Customer Success\" layer.\n\nThe Lesson:\n\nThe process of trust development fails to become automated. The onboarding process fails to become automated when products remain imperfect during their initial development phase.\n\nWe recognized that Self-Serve access becomes available only to products which have achieved their full development stage. Businesses which generate less than $10k MRR should avoid using login forms to conceal their operations. You should provide complete assistance to every user until your hands develop bleeding from excessive use.\n\nThe Sign-Up button returned to our website after we completed 50 manual calls which showed us the exact changes we needed to make.\n\nHas anyone else purposefully added friction just to learn more? Or are we the only masochists here?",

The goal is to document everything: wins, losses, learnings, progress. This helps build trust in the eyes of people watching and also allows you to build an engaged and targeted audience aligned with your product\n\n\\-> LinkedIn outbound: 10–30 messages per day. Don’t do direct sales outreach, ask for feedback instead “I saw that you do X, do you face problem Y? We’re building Z”\n\n\\-> Cold email: send 20 to 100 emails per day. Of course, the money is in the follow-ups. You’ll start getting replies from the 3rd–4th follow-up, so put a strong focus on follow-ups and expect nothing from the first email\n\n\\-> Comments on X and Reddit: you need to do at least 10 comments on each platform. You can comment under posts like “I’m looking for an alternative to (your competitor)” and subtly mention your tool. You really need to focus on substance in everything you comment—the value in your comment should be your top priority\n\n\\-> Last thing to implement is to stick to this strategy for several months, minimum 6 months. If you only do it for 1 or 2 months, you won’t have time to see the compounding effects. This is one of the most important things: consistency and perseverance\n\nYou’ll see that the first days will be tough, but little by little it will start to pay off. Really trust this strategy and the compounding effects!\n\nFeel free to tell me what you would add on your side!",

      "text": "My SaaS was stuck at 40 users for 5 months straight. I kept building new features thinking that's what would make it take off. Added integrations, built a mobile app, created advanced analytics nobody asked for. Spent every evening coding, barely talked to the users I already had. Growth stayed completely flat. Everything shifted when I forced myself to stop coding completely for June and just scheduled calls with users. Reached out to all 40, got 23 to agree to 20-minute chats. Asked them why they signed up, what problem they were trying to solve, what was working and what wasn't. Those conversations were uncomfortable at first because I'm way more comfortable coding than talking, but they revealed something huge.\n\nTurns out the core feature I built was solving their problem fine, but my onboarding was confusing and they didn't understand half the features I'd added. Three people thought the product was broken because they couldn't figure out how to do something basic that was buried in settings. Five people were using it completely differently than I imagined, in ways that made way more sense for their workflow. I spent July fixing onboarding based on those conversations. Made the setup process way simpler, removed features nobody mentioned using, added one small thing that 8 people specifically asked for. Didn't build anything clever or complex, just listened and fixed the obvious problems they told me about. August I did 10 more user calls with new signups to understand their experience fresh.\n\nGrowth completely changed. Went from 40 users in May to 65 in August, 98 in September, 147 in November. Now at 203 users with 18% converting to paid versus 5% before. The difference wasn't building more, it was understanding what people actually needed versus what I assumed they wanted. I still do 4-5 user calls every week now, it's become the most valuable hours I spend. Found this pattern studying 300+ founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful founders talked to users constantly while struggling founders built in isolation. Made me realize my natural instinct to just code more was actually preventing growth.",

          "text": "Yes. I use my product [somraslabs.com](http://somraslabs.com) a lot. It provides cloud based AI enhancement for videos and images at fraction of the cost as compared to existing products that ask for $20/monthly subscriptions.  Here are my detailed use-cases :  \n  \nI upscale my recorded gameplay to 4k at 60fps with youtube specific settings for my gaming channel to preserve maximum quality after upload and to create high quality crisp thumbnails too. Youtube only allows 720p thumbnail but all assets that go into it are upscaled by 4x before making thumb appear crisp and it helps me with conversion. Have seen conversion go from 4% to above 10% with just good quality thumbs and video as the niche is so competitive.\n\nEnhancing memes as most of them are pretty bad quality.\n\nOther than this I have used it while digitising my old albums. Clicked picks manually from the album and then removed grain or corrected blur as per need. Then as a final step increased their resolution by 4x to remove any left out noise and turn them crisp.\n\nIf there is an old movie or anime or a cartoon ( yeah for nostalgic purposes ) that I liked too much, I run it through my product to watch it in good quality. Sometimes I screen record youtube for this purpose.\n\n  \nMy brother is a photographer, so he uses it to quality correct some of his images. And boy he is a total fanatic about preserving the original details. The feedback comes in as really harsh but is useful. So I keep giving him free credits. ( which he will take from me anyways )\n\n\n\nI in-fact created this product for myself, used it for many months. So finally decided to make it public with a web interface and some polishing changes.\n\nDisclaimer : Yes I am sharing my product here for visibility. But the use-cases mentioned are 100% true. Please feel free to ask for any questions.",

      "text": "Product Hunt launch three weeks ago went better than I expected. 400 plus upvotes,\r\nfeatured as product of the day, 1200 people signed up for free trials. Felt amazing\r\nwatching the numbers climb. Finally getting traction after six months of building in\r\nsilence.\n\r\nThen reality hit. Three weeks later I have 8 paid customers. Less than 1% conversion\r\nfrom all those signups. Most people tried it once and never came back. The Product\r\nHunt spike is completely gone and I'm back to getting maybe 2 signups per day.\n\r\nWhat I learned is Product Hunt gives you visibility but not necessarily customers. The\r\npeople browsing Product Hunt are mostly other founders, makers, and people who love\r\ntrying new tools. They're not necessarily your target customer and they're definitely not\r\nin buying mode when they're just browsing cool new products.\n\r\nThe 8 customers I did get didn't come from Product Hunt. They came from a tiny post I\r\nmade in a niche subreddit two days after the launch where I just showed what the\r\nproduct actually does instead of hyping it up. Made a quick walkthrough with Trupeer\r\nshowing a real use case and shared it there. Those people signed up already knowing if\r\nthey needed it or not.\n\r\nI'm not saying Product Hunt is useless. The brand awareness probably helps long term.\r\nGetting featured looks good. But if you're counting on it to be your big launch moment\r\nthat floods you with customers, adjust expectations. It's more like getting a bunch of\r\npeople to look at your thing for 30 seconds and then most of them moving on with their\r\nlives.",

(Reddit, Twitter/X, Facebook groups, SEO, cold outreach, Product Hunt, etc.)\n* Did you pivot, change messaging, or just keep shipping?\n\n**Feel free to share your product link** and briefly explain:\n\n* Where you launched\n* What actually worked\n* What you wish you had known earlier\n\nHopefully this thread can help anyone who’s currently stuck at “launched but no users” feel less alone and find a clearer path forward.\n\nLooking forward to your stories",

Cause a genuine market analysis exposes potential customers who are desperate for a solution. If there are no people in distress about the pain point your product is solving, then you should not launch it.\n2. **Free Trial**: It is important to have users (any kind of) to get feedback on atleast general usability. Please please please give out free trials. Also keep a discord page for people to have an accessible medium to rant in. Use reddit, twitter etc to reach people for free trials.\n3. **Content Marketing:** Write blogs, make youtube tutorials, write articles, engage with communities in twitter, reddit, discord of other products, basically share your knowledge. Knowledge shared is knowledge and users gained.  One of the most effective ways is latch on to a product that is being widely used, is trendy and is not flooded with tutorials to use as your helper. Eg if your product is a SaaS which interacts with LLMs, you can make a high quality project tutorial using LangChain and insert your product as one of the prerequisites for the project to work. This works exceptionally well, because your videos get traction, your product gets traction because users following your video will need to use your product to proceed, creates tutorial resources for your product and gives you user insights and feedback. If everything goes well, you may also be able to hook people to your product because everybody is using your tutorial to learn the other trendy one.\n4. **Dont be users obsessed, be product obsessed:** For the love of god dont think user popularity means better product or success. Actual users are the ones who are desperate for your product because their own jobs or commitments depend on yours. They will rant, be brutal, downgrade you because they are desperate for your solution to work. And they dont care how many users you have, they are more concerned about the quality of the product. If you optimize for user traction, there is a high probability you will fail them. These important users will drive long term consumer growth. The SaaS world is a graveyard of products that had huge traction due to to maybe being featured in Product Hunt etc, and then they die out as quickly as they gained traction, because real customers are not in vibrant and savvy parts of the internet. They are in boring old blogs and articles.\n\n\n\nPS: This post has not been written using AI. Protect our community against the dead internet.",

The magic is niche communities (like this one, ProductHunt for tech, Slack communities, etc). Your first 100 users won't come from Twitter randos.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*The GTM pivoting\\*\\* - Once launched, talk to the people who DO sign up obsessively. Don't change the product yet. Change your messaging/positioning first. Most products aren't the problem - the pitch is.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Content + Social proof\\*\\* - Share the journey. People love supporting underdogs. Weekly updates on what you're learning, not just what you're building.\n\n\n\nBiggest mistake I see: waiting for perfect product before talking to users.

You need to actively seek out your target audience where they naturally congregate and directly engage with their stated problems. For instance, tools like LeadsRover can be quite effective by scanning platforms like Reddit 24/7 to identify high-intent leads and even draft authentic responses mentioning your product.\n\n\n\nBeyond automated identification, direct engagement in relevant forums and communities is crucial. Offer to solve specific problems for early users in exchange for honest feedback, which provides invaluable insights that cannot be gained through internal testing alone. This iterative feedback loop is essential for refining both your product and its messaging to resonate with real needs.",

I had to learn where my users actually hang out and show up there consistently.\n* **I put the product where early adopters already look for tools** I listed it on places like Product Hunt, Pitchwall, and similar platforms—not for scale, but to get blunt early feedback and spot messaging gaps fast.\n* **I treated zero users as feedback, not failure** No usage meant no value.

We already get annual summaries for music, spending, and fitness, but a huge portion of modern life happens in chats and rarely gets surfaced in a meaningful way.\n\nBefore going further, I wanted to sanity-check the concept with other builders here:\n\n* Does this feel like a novelty feature, or something people would actually return to?\n* Where do you think the line is between “interesting insight” and “too invasive”?\n* If you were building this, would you focus more on personal reflection or shareable outputs?\n\nNot pitching, just genuinely curious how others here would evaluate this kind of product from a SaaS perspective especially around retention and trust.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or pushback to help make this even better.",

Maybe less \"look at my stats\" and more \"huh, I didn't realize I was messaging way less during Q3—was I burned out?\"\n\nThe invasiveness line is tricky too. I think people are fine with stats (message count, peak hours), but the moment it feels like it's \\*reading\\* their conversations (tone analysis, word clouds), it might cross into creepy territory even if it's technically their own data.\n\nCurious how you're thinking about the privacy/trust angle.

So as a SaaS, the biggest question for me is: who pays for it and *why*? If it’s for end users, I’m not convinced many would subscribe. If it’s for businesses (communities, apps, internal teams, creators, etc.), it starts to make more sense.\n\nWhere I think this works best is if “Chat Wrapped” is just the surface layer. Underneath, it could be real analytics: trends over time, engagement patterns, sentiment shifts, power users, onboarding drop-offs, etc. The wrapped becomes the shareable output of something that’s useful year-round.\n\nAlso worth thinking about data access and privacy. Pulling chat data from platforms is often the hardest part, and users are (rightfully) sensitive about summaries of private conversations—even anonymized ones.\n\nTL;DR: fun idea, but I’d validate hard whether it’s a feature vs. a product. If you can anchor it to a real, recurring analytics use case, the wrapped aspect becomes a nice bonus instead of the whole business.\n\nJust my 2 cents—curious what angle you’re leaning toward.",

Takes about 20 minutes to properly set up.\n\nWe've been using Appcues for 18 months. The tours are well-designed, our UX team spent weeks on them. Doesn't matter. Users click \"skip\" or spam through the steps without reading. Tour completion is technically 60% but activation is stuck at 32%. Users \"complete\" onboarding and still don't know how to do basic things.\n\nI think the fundamental problem is that tours show users where buttons are when they dont care yet. Nobody wants a tour of a product they havent decided to use. They want help when they're actually trying to do something and get stuck.\n\nWe've tried Pendo (better analytics, same skip problem), looked at WalkMe and Whatfix (enterprise pricing, same tour-based approach). Chameleon, Userpilot - all variations of the same thing.\n\nOur trial-to-paid is 16% and I'm convinced it's because users never reach the \"aha moment.\" They bounce before they see the value.\n\nSo, I'm looking for ideas and solutions.\n\nWhat I actually need:\n\n* Help that shows up when users are stuck\n* Something that understands what users are trying to do\n* Actually guides them through completing tasks\n* Moves activation metrics\n\nStarting to think the whole \"product tour\" category is the wrong approach.

I work for user onboarding platform and what you saying is not uncommon. \n\ntry these:\n\n* **Replace tours with a checklist** The big win is that when users skip, they can come back and pick up right where they left off. And if you embed it in the UI (vs the widget form), it feels like part of the product, not bolted on, which is the nature of tours.\n* **Move the tour into the help center** A lot of users do skip the initial walkthrough but hit a wall a minute later. Housing the tour in the help center makes it easy for them to access when they’re actually ready for it.\n* **Trigger tours based on behavior** Instead of showing a tour on first load, wait and see what they’re doing. If someone hasn’t integrated Slack after a few minutes, then offer help. Framing it as “need a hand?” works better than forcing a tour when they’re not ready to care.\n\nHope it's useful.",

People relate to struggle way more than highlight reels.\n\nThe 500 emails/day thing is aggressive but yeah, it works if your offer is dialed in. The key is making sure you're not doing that before you've talked to enough people. Cold email with a half-baked message just burns your domain reputation.\n\nAlso curious about the Reddit part. 3-4 posts per week feels like a lot depending on the sub. Some communities will flag you as spammy if you're posting that often, especially if it's all about your product.

Those conversations often convert better than “building in public,” and they don’t require pretending to be a content creator. Social media is optional; talking to real users isn’t.",

Many businesses suffer because they don't understand supply and demand tension. AKA, your product has no HOT BURNING OFFER!!! that grabs your Ideal client by the throat and forces them to pay attention because you have done the one thing that all great businesses have done.\n\nSolve a real pressing, hair on fire problem for your prospect or created the type of transformation people desire.\n\nIf your product doesn't have demand attached to it and it's just another nice to have product then you've already failed and if you truly desire to get ahead, and make all your effort worth it, you're going to need a \n\ncult level belief in your product and a deep understanding of what it does and how it helps users. \n\nI'm not talking about the features of your product or how cool it is, but the core benefits it offers.\n\nIf you can't list in great detail, the exact pressing issue your clients face, how they feel, what's their fear, worry, aspirations and desire then you won't be able to create a proper product that fit those needs and drive attention in the marketplace.\n\nMany start-ups I have consulted created nice to have products and commoditized services and they try to go-to-market but the product is dead!!. \n\nNo one Desires it. Demand is low, churn is high, retention keeps dropping and you're left helpless and crying on social about your wasted time and effort.\n\nI would love to share more on this but I am short on time and I am a caught up with building a high level ICP system for B2b clients. \n\nPS. Take marketing for what it is. A distribution and creational source that allows you to connect with folks for different reasons. to build in public only means that you're connecting with user/clients who love your offer because you communicated how it helped people and why they stay.",

This is a lesson learned for you. \n\nPosting every day isn't fake. Building in public isn't fake, but know this, it really only works if your public cares about how it is being built. They will only care if how it is being built affects how they build around it. Basically, only products for developers are good \"build in public\" types of things. \n\nI have one SaaS that makes money. I didn't \"build in public\" so much as I \"built with my customers\". I found my customers, setup an email invite, and when I got to 100 emails, I created the authentication for the app and installed a forum (Discourse) that used SSO from the authentication. The users then started chatting with me about what they wanted to see in the application. \n\nMy only regret is that it is a B2C, but I found the customers for it first so, that's what got built. I had an e-commerce store which was making money until my primary vendor decided to start selling on Amazon and locked me out. The marketing for that e-commerce store was here on Reddit, which is why I went with a forum for the B2C SaaS. I have yet to try the forum trick with a B2B, but I think it will work the same.\n\nFind the customers first. Then have real conversations with them before you start building. Sometimes the conversations will be awkward because they will \"want a faster horse\" because they \"know how to use a horse\". It is a lot of \"I promise, I've done the research, this will be better.\" They will grumble but you will get them on your side by saving them time and money.",

Thought leadership does not mean posting every day or building in public if that feels fake. It can be as simple as writing thoughtful posts about problems you have already solved, or leaving supportive, insightful comments on other people’s posts where your experience is relevant.\n\nPick one or two channels and get good at them instead of spreading yourself thin. LinkedIn works well if you like long form thinking. Substack works if you prefer writing quietly and letting people find you over time. Consistency matters more than volume.\n\nMost early traction comes from trust, not reach. When people see you helping and thinking clearly, they get curious on their own.",

Because we needed a tool like this to improve our tech project management based on  Linear.   \n  \nThen?   \n3 months later → first $MRR. Slow, steady growth, 100% organic, driven by:  \n\\- SEO  \n\\- GEO  \n\\- Communities like Discord (people started refering our tool)   \n  \n18 months later → $1,000 MRR. At that point, we decided to sell it and refocus on marketing automation tools.  \n  \nDecember 2025. Sold for $20,000 (roughly 2× ARR)  \n  \nNot huge. Not life-changing money. No Forbes article.  \n  \nBut I’m extremely proud of the team and the journey. We shipped a tool in a week, grew it organically, and exited it, everything very smoothly, end to end.  \n  \nNext for us?  \nScaling our LinkedIn automation tool to follow the same path… with a few more digits hopefully 😉🤞  \n  \nMy learnings: \n\n* Acquire is a great marketplace to sell micro SaaS\n* organic growth > \"fake\" paid MRR \n* independant stripe account is mandatory \n* 3 months minimum to sell it\n* Selling an asset isn't the same as selling a company \n* Until $100,00 ARR, it's NOT a x5 ARR valuation \n\nKeep it up, SaaS builders! It will pay one day! ",

Building in public to get initial traction: I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. Reaching out to influencers with organic traffic and sponsoring them: I knew good content leads to people trying my app but I didn't have time to write content all the time so the next natural step was to pay people to post content for me. I just doubled down on what already worked.\n3. Word of mouth: I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. Removing all formatting from my emails: I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\nWhat didn't work:\n\n1. Writing articles and trying to rank on Google: Turns out my product isn't something people are searching for on Google.\n2. Affiliate system: I've had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it's extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n3. Instagram: I tried instagram marketing for a short while, managed to get some views, absolutely no conversions.\n4. Building features no one wants (obviously): I've wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I'm not going to try any new marketing channels until I'm doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can't stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won't talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

Friends and family help with testing, but they usually don’t give you real signal.\n\nWhat’s worked best is picking one very specific user type and hanging out where they already spend time online Reddit communities, niche Discords, Twitter replies, or even small forums. Talk about the problem openly, share what you’re building, and invite feedback instead of pushing the product. The first few users usually come from those conversations.\n\nI work closely with early-stage founders at Coldframe Growth Co, and the common pattern I see is that traction starts once founders stop trying to “launch” and start treating distribution as learning. The goal early on isn’t scale, it’s clarity on who actually cares and why.\n\nCurious what kind of B2C user you’re building for. The channel really depends on that.",

Pick one channel where your users already are\n2. Talk to 10–20 real people (DMs > posts)\n3. Use their words to explain the product\n4. Add a very low-friction entry (waitlist, free tier, invite)\n\nYour first users are messy, unscalable, and slightly uncomfortable to get. That’s normal, and necessary.\n\nCurious: what kind of B2C app is it?",

If you plan to use Reddit for getting your first users, I HIGHLY recommend you use a tool like Bazzly which will help you be consistent in getting your product out there.",

Friends and family are great for initial feedback but not really scalable for actual user acquisition. What really worked for me was getting involved in relevant communities especially on Reddit. Id search for discussions related to my apps niche and offer helpful advice subtly mentioning my app if it fit the conversation. It was time consuming af and I used a bot to scan for keywords but half of the results were noise. The good thing is the users you get are usually passionate and really engaged and if they like the app they tend to promote it themselves by mentioning it in other places in reddit. Since I hate wasting time I actually built a tool to automate finding these conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn it filters out all the irrelevant stuff and just shows you the discussions where you can actually make a difference its the reason I saw your post today. It started as an internal thing but it turned into my main project now I almost neglected my first app because of it lol If you think something like that could help you out Im happy to share it with you.",

For most B2C side projects, the first users come from places where you can have context and trust, not ads or broad social posts. the fastest path for early traction is almost always direct distribution to a very specific group. Start with people who already feel the problem sharply. if your product solves something you personally experience, you already know where those people hang out  specific subreddits, Discord servers, niche forums, Twitter replies, or even comment sections on YouTube videos about the problem. don’t “launch.” Show up, talk about the problem, and mention you built something to solve it. early users respond to relevance, not polish. friends and coworkers are useful, but mostly as testers, not real validation. They’ll be nice. What you want are users who don’t care about you and still choose to use the product. a good move is to DM people who are already complaining about the problem online and ask if they want early access. keep the message short, personal, and specific  no pitch deck energy. social media works only if you treat it as conversation, not promotion.",

Social posts did almost nothing early on. What moved things was shipping something usable fast, getting feedback, then iterating in public so those early users felt invested. The first few customers came from conversations, not campaigns.",

That is it.\n\nMost of my customers came from:  \nAnswering questions with useful context  \nSharing tiny wins or lessons instead of pitching  \nFollowing up when someone asks for help and giving them a real fix  \nPosting progress in places that value transparency instead of hype\n\nIt got me past 500 a month without ads.

This keeps replies timely and cuts hunting time. Use editable templates that still sound personal. They speed replies but avoid canned tone. Set a lightweight follow up schedule. Following up converts curious folks and surfaces issues you can actually fix. If you start scaling you'll need help finding threads and drafting replies so I built SignalScouter to surface relevant posts and draft founder-style responses you approve to post.
