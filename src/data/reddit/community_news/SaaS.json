      "text": "A few months back, I finally sold my ecommerce SaaS for a decent exit after hitting $500K ARR in 8 months.   \n  \nTook me three tries to get there - the first two were complete disasters.\n\nThis whole thing was brutal. I'm talking thousands of hours, doing the same tedious tasks over and over, saying goodbye to weekends, constantly second-guessing myself, running tests that went absolutely nowhere. But it worked out in the end.\n\nNow I'm working on [this SAAS ](https://gojiberry.ai)(helps B2B companies find and contact high-intent leads), and if I had to do it all over again, these are the exact habits I'd stick to every single day to get to $10k MRR as fast as possible.\n\nI've screwed up in every way you can imagine:\n\n* Wasted 6 months building something nobody wanted\n* Created a \"brilliant\" product that nobody would pay for\n* Got 2,000 people on my waitlist but couldn't convert a single one to paid\n\nSo this is me paying it forward.\n\nIf you're just starting out, trying to get from zero to actual traction, just do these 5 things. Every day with no exceptions.\n\nYour brain's going to fight you on this. It'll whisper \"don't send that message,\" \"don't post that - you'll look like an idiot,\" \"it's beautiful outside, take the day off.\" Don't listen.\n\nGrowth happens when you're uncomfortable. Not when you're cozy.\n\nPush through that voice. Do the work anyway. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nHere are the 5 daily habits that actually move the needle:\n\n1. Send 20-30 LinkedIn connection requests to your ideal customers. Just 20 minutes. Do it manually. Pick the right people. Connect. Done.\n2. Message 20-30 people on LinkedIn. Don't sell them anything. Just talk. Ask questions. Share what you're building and see if they have the same problem.\n3. Send 20-100 cold emails 20 if you're writing them yourself, 100+ if you're using tools. Keep them short. Don't be pushy. Just start real conversations. The magic happens in your follow-ups - send 2-3.\n4. Comment on 10 Reddit threads in your space. Go where your customers hang out. Jump into \"looking for alternatives to X\" posts. Actually help people. Only mention your product when it genuinely fits. People can smell fake help from a mile away.\n5. Post something on LinkedIn every day. This builds up over time. Write about problems your customers face, share what you've learned, tell quick stories about wins and losses. Give away good stuff for free. Build your lead magnets into the content. Just show up consistently.\n\nAt the beginning, it feels pointless.\n\n* 1 like on your posts\n* 1 response for every 20 messages you send\n* Radio silence on your first batch of emails\n\nBut stick with it every single day, and things start to compound.\n\nYou get better at writing. Your messages start working. People begin to recognize you. Someone books a call. Then 2 more. Then 10. Then they start referring people.\n\nThat's how you actually win. Not by getting lucky, but by showing up every day.\n\nEven when it's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nThe boring stuff is what actually grows your business.\n\nTrust me, it's worth it ! ",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.  \n  \nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.   \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Good ones say “here’s what I know, here’s what I need to verify, here’s the safest next step.” Mediocre ones are just nodding their heads.\n\nWhen you hired the two great ones, did you find them through referrals, trials, or a structured interview process?",

Your engineer that “refactored middleware” could be either a good engineer trying to accelerate development process or a complete a*hat. You can’t tell by that alone. You need to hire someone actually know s*** to tell you that.\n\n2. Commit frequency should never be used as the metrics for this. It can maybe be used to judge your team’s moral based on past pattern. But the worst devs or proxy devs also know this trick well. They will literally space out small commits to flood the graph. \n\n3. If your dev is not completing “almost done” items in short period of time, it almost certainly means there’s some other underlying sickness. It doesn’t mean it’s a lie, it means part of the process or codebase is broken. \n\n4. Both best and worst dev WILL push back on your ideas especially if they know you don’t know s*** and lack of confidence in your technical leadership.\n\n5. Weekly demo make devs working on UI features look good. If taken too seriously, devs will start trading tech debts for quick UI feature wins. You’ll soon be drowning in debts.\n\n\nLesson? Know if you are a people manager or teamlead manager. How to tell? Can you understand the architect and can replace any engineer of the project? If you can’t, you are people manager.

          "text": "I think you'll still have problems telling apart the peaches from the lemons. My bet would be that now with AI, lemons can more easily produce the demo without excuses, commit to git often, etc.\n\nGeorge Akerlof won the 2001 Nobel prize in economics for his theory of the effects of information asymmetry on markets (Best described in the paper \"The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\")\n\nDeveloping software is the ultimate market for lemons, because of the enormous information asymmetry between non-coder buyers (managers, entrepreneurs, PMs, and muggles in general) and sellers (\"devs\" be them great, awful, mediocre or 10Xers).\n\nThe interesting part is the Adverse selection. From Wikipedia: \"Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a \"peach\") and a low-quality car (a \"lemon\"). Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a \"peach\" and \"lemon\" together (p-avg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold \"lemons\" (since p-lemon < p-avg) and they will leave the market when they hold \"peaches\" (since p-peach > p-avg). Eventually, as enough sellers of \"peaches\" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop. Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an adverse selection problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse.\"\n\nThe very best \"Devs\" get tired of employers not being able to tell them apart from the pretenders, so they take themselves out of the market.\n\nI still remember how I felt one day in 2011 when I found out that I barely made a little bit more money than a much much less skilled coworker. In 2012 I switched careers (into IT management) and never looked back. Today AI coding s making that choice seem even wiser.\n\nThere are reasons why there are so few peaches and so many lemons. If you truly believe you're now able to tell them apart, then the question becomes what will you do to retain your peaches before they take themselves off the market.",

Sometimes they'll code for a week or two and then make one clear, descriptive merge commit (like \"feat: overhaul user settings page\").  \nMeanwhile, they're still giving you solid weekly demos from that branch.\n\nIn that case, is one 'big' commit actually a red flag? Or is the real signal the **combination** of clear demos + clear commit messages, regardless of frequency?\n\nMaybe the rule isn't *'small commits good, big commits bad'*, but *'visible progress good, radio silence bad'*?\n\nWhat do you all think?

      "text": "Two years ago I walked away from a $200k base salary. I wanted to focus on building something on my own and leveraging my skills. On paper everything seemed flawless. In reality this was the hardest decision I have ever made.\n\nMost people talk about going all in like it is a movie montage. It is not. It is a messy, isolating grind that breaks most people.\n\nThe Structure Shock When you are a Staff Engineer you have built in momentum. You have stand ups, tickets, and peers who validate your existence. When you go solo that scoreboard vanishes. I spent the first three months working 14 hour days and feeling like I had accomplished zero. There is no done state anymore. There is just an endless void of tasks where coding is actually the easiest part of the day.\n\nThe Work Multiplies and the Clock is Ticking People think quitting means you finally get time to build. It does. But now you are the entire company and you are bleeding cash. Every single department shows up at your door every morning and the financial weight is heavy. You are responsible for:\n\n* Product Improvement: This is critical. You are constantly obsessing over the roadmap and refining the vision to ensure the core value actually exists.\n* Financial Pressure: You are paying thousands in infrastructure and operations. You are spending thousands more on ads to get eyes on the product. The clock is ticking and it is ticking fast.\n* QA and Support: You are the one answering every customer question and ensuring the product actually works when people log in.\n* Marketing and Sales: Trying to get anyone to care while running demos for people who might never buy.\n* Onboarding and Retention: Making sure users stay after they sign up and figuring out why they churn.\n\nThe Skills Gap is a Wall I am technical enough to have won multiple hackathons running on a few hours of sleep including OpenAI and Horizon AI. That is just the easier part of the game. Scaling a SaaS is the real sauce. Distribution is the game and the product is just your entry ticket. That is a hard truth for an engineer to swallow. Marketing is a specific type of pain because it is so broad. You have to learn SEO, paid ads, funnels, and copy that does not sound like a robot.\n\nThe Momentum Mismatch In engineering effort usually equals output. In a startup you can push a boulder uphill for a month, lose your grip, and end up further back than where you started. That mismatch is brutal. I have spent countless nights staring at a screen until 2:00 AM brainstorming improvements and wondering why the momentum is not matching my expectations. You put in the work but the needle just does not move.\n\nThe Loneliness is Underrated My friends think I am living the dream because I work from home. They see the sweatpants and assume the lifestyle is chill. It is not chill. There is no teammate to share the burden or say we are fine. Nobody else fully understands the specific problem you are trying to solve. You move from confidence to anxiety and from hope to frustration daily. It is not just building a product. It is managing your own psychology.\n\nWhere it stands now The SaaS is growing and making thousands in MRR but I am always with the constant thought that it is not growing fast enough. I have stopped romanticizing motivation and started treating this like a long war. I ship, I measure, I talk to users, and I repeat. Some weeks nothing works. Then one small thing clicks and you remember why you started.\n\nI have learned more in these 24 months than in a decade of traditional jobs because the market does not care about your feelings. It only cares if you solve a problem.\n\n# Question for the community\n\nFor those who quit a high-paying job to build SaaS:\n\nWhat was the hardest part for you?  \nAnd what do you wish you knew before you made the jump?",

They might ghost you, they might not get back, they might say that you are at a very early stage, or maybe they will wait for a few months before they can connect with you again. There might be pseudo or wrong signals of growth, and you might need a course correction after going down the wrong path. Speed is the king or speed is the key of working at a start-up or building your own company. If you do not work with speed, not only will you get bored, but someone else will build it instead of you. Finally, you will get thousands of thoughts whether I should be doing this or not.

It’s a much different challenge than programming or fixing bugs, it’s uncharted territory that requires critical thinking and creativity. It’s a struggle sometimes, but enjoy the learning process as much as you can.",

Basically, any time someone had a problem my app could solve, Id jump in. It got me my first users and actually helped with SEO down the line. The problem was just how much time it took. I ended up building a tool for myself that automates finding those conversations across Reddit, X and even LinkedIn, its crazy how much time that saved. It was just an internal thing at first, but I realized other founders might be dealing with the same problem. I found organic outreach through relevant conversations a great way to get my first users, and they tend to be more engaged as they came from a genuine conversation around their needs If you think it could help you surface more of those entry ticket opportunities, let me know.",

I kind of dread it tbh because like you've mentioned, marketing and sales does not reflect the effort you put into it.

These are the things that I will allow, and won't allow. I will only spend $X out of pocket, I'll only go 18 months without funding. I will work from a co-working space 3 days a week.  \n  \nAdding a co-founder is extremely beneficial if you can. The best co-founders are people you've previously worked with.\n\nJournaling is critical. Real inner thoughts collected daily. Not just meeting notes in Notion. I tried that (and Obsidian and Reflect) and figured out nobody had created exactly what I needed as a founder. It was something I had to have, so I started a side project just to get this right. Now I have a second brain following the evolution of my company and tracking my mood/productivity.\n\nPeople. You have to have your people too. Your community and support network is critical. A spouse will be supportive, but you probably shouldn't burden them with the full weight of your journey. Friends will not get it, like you said. What then? Other founders! And not online. Find your startup spaces, clubs, groups, etc. and have IRL conversations. Put in the reps (show up), and people will get to know you and what you're building. Founders can't help but ideate. They will be a wellspring of fresh connections, the inside track on opportunities you didn't know existed and much more.\n\nSleep and exercise. You can't sacrifice your health for your company. Your company needs you to be healthy. Exercise fights depression and a lot of the feelings that come with trying to bring your idea to life. The right gym bakes in another layer of community too.

So take this opportunity and go for it, if it’s successful stick money in your pension cos your successful today doesn’t mean you will be tomorrow (even if everyone says you can and you do a few times - we have a shelf life).\n\nWish you the best of success - if your feeing down or want to ask for help dm me - you never know I might be able to help (there is still life some life left in this old dog)",

Same thing with distribution on Reddit/communities – I’ve seen a mix of SparkToro for discovery, Apollo for targeted outreach, and then tools like Pulse for Reddit to catch and reply to high-intent threads work way better than just throwing more money at Meta/Google.\n\nAlso co-founder ambition alignment is huge, but I’d stress expectation alignment too: who owns which decisions, what “done” means, and how much risk each is actually willing to take.

I deleted the Free Tier and replaced it with a 14-day trial (credit card required).\n\n**The Result:**\n\n* Signups dropped by 70% (scary at first).\n* **Revenue increased by 40%.**\n* Support tickets dropped to almost zero.\n\nIf you are a solo founder, stop devaluing your work.

Lowering the barrier of entry unlocked a lot of creativity, but it also led to a massive wave of low-effort businesses. I think SaaS is heading toward a similar sloppification, possibly on a much larger scale.\n\nWe’re probably going to see more low-quality SaaS than ever, and I don’t think that’s just because of AI tools (even though they clearly accelerate this). The bigger shift is that the barrier used to be capital and deep technical skill. Now it’s much lower, which invites more non-technical founders, opportunists, and people trying to extract value quickly. This feels similar to how VC and PE incentives often lead to enshittification subscriptions everywhere, ads in cars, etc.\n\nThe effects already seem obvious: companies getting flooded with cold emails, distribution channels becoming completely saturated, and SaaS starting to resemble dropshipping more than product building. LinkedIn “build in public” and hustle culture just adds more noise on top of it.\n\nTech people can grift too, but more often there’s at least curiosity and a real attempt to understand the problem. My concern is that making a real living from SaaS will become much harder when every distribution channel is filled with low-effort, look-alike products.\n\nHow do you think this plays out over the next few years? Does the market self-correct, or does SaaS just become increasingly noisy with fewer real winners?",

The slop dies because the founders quit after a few months of zero traction, not because users get smarter. What survives is either distribution (you own a channel that's hard to copy) or taste (you actually know what to leave out). The Shopify comparison is spot on—dropshipping stores died but real brands survived. Same thing will happen here. The noise is annoying but it's also the filter.",

It’s just happening at a much higher velocity now.",

AI actually amplifies the ability of good Software Engineers to produce anything.\n\nIt is really faster by A LOT. It doesn't mean you can finish 100 different tasks in 1 hour. It just means that you can improve even code quality by setting standards once throughout all codebases, and you don't have to repeat fixing hallucination loops. The slow ones are very junior. They don't even know what to write on a standards mini book for example. They have no concept of it. And this is why companies have no open junior Engineer roles. It's all 5+ years.

      "text": "Most SaaS founders think building the product is 70% of the work.\n\nI thought the same until I shipped my MVP and realized... it's actually the opposite. Building is maybe 30%. The other 70%? Getting people to actually use it.\n\nI'm a technical founder. I'd rather write code than cold DMs. But here's what I learned getting my[ SEO tool](https://blogseo.io) to $50k ARR ([proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/iROCSdxX)):\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nI messaged everyone I knew – ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, random people I'd met at events. But instead of pitching directly, I asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo things happen: If they're interested, they say \"yeah, me actually.\" If not, they might intro you to someone. You win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell.\n\n**2. Posting consistently (even with a small audience)**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing fancy. Just sharing what I was building and learning. Multiple people DM'd me asking about the product who became paying customers. The compounding effect is real, even if your posts only get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email (but targeting the right people)**\n\nThis didn't work great at first because my sequence sucked. But here's what I learned: spend 80% of your time on targeting the RIGHT people (nail your ICP), 20% on the copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly – much higher leverage.\n\n**4. SEO (the most underrated channel for SaaS)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks, pages started ranking and I got traffic from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most SaaS founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pulling from web content too. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of your potential customers.\n\nOne of my users reached 450+ clicks a day from organic search alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend ($200 each on Google + Meta)**\n\nOnly did this AFTER I had organic conversions. Ads amplify what's already working – they won't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't buy gave me their email. That list became valuable later.\n\n**6. Obsessing over first customers**\n\nTreated my first 10 customers like they were paying me $10k/month. Jumped on calls. Fixed bugs same-day. Asked for feedback constantly. Result? They became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies.\n\n**7. Affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. Made it dead simple to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = ongoing customer stream, not just one sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nLaunched on \"There's an AI for That\" – got a nice traffic spike. Lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug though (painful lesson: test your critical flows obsessively).\n\n**The honest truth about SaaS growth:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. These tactics aren't sexy. None of them went viral. But they compound.\n\nWhile everyone's chasing the next viral strategy, you can quietly stack Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders, it's SEO. Not because it's fast – it's not. But because it compounds. Every article you publish keeps working for you months (even years) later. And now with AI search pulling from web content, the surface area for discovery is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR. No fluff, just the stuff that actually moved the needle:\n\n👉 [15 High-Reward SEO Tactics I Used to Grow My Business to $50k ARR](https://www.notion.so/15-High-Reward-SEO-Tactics-I-Used-to-Grow-My-Business-to-50k-ARR-2d68871b675680c88878fa41f33cb0a6?source=copy_link)",

I’ve seen so many solid products die because the founder assumed “if it’s good, people will find it.” Distribution is a skill, not a one-time event, and starting that habit early compounds just like product improvements do.\n\nCurious in hindsight: which channel gave you the fastest signal that something about onboarding or the core feature was off?",

We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

In products Ive worked on to achieve activation uplift, it usually comes down to a couple of things:\n\n1.Design for the first win, not the product:\nSo, What’s the single task that proves value? Eg. Generating something, seeing a result, viewing and answer. I’d design the entire first session around just getting them there. It’s the “oh I get it” moment.\n\n2.Show the result before explaining it:\nBlank dashboards and “start here” text are the friction points you’re describing. Instead, show awesome examples, outputs, or a visible end state. Let users reverse engineer the value, not just read about it.\n\n3.Remove choice until after activation\nIt’s tempting to showcase the products flexibility but it can create paralysis for new users. Clear hierarchy and defaults act like guardrails (like bumpers on a bowling alley). it should be obvious where to go and hard to go anywhere else until they’ve had the first win.\n\nOne pattern I’m seeing a lot is shipping a heap of great features quickly (now easier than ever), but miss the work of ensuring the first experience has one clear job to be done.\n\nIf you’re getting 80% bouncing after first login, it’s usually not the product.

You've started off right by getting someone to use the app while you watch them. Now you need to iterate on the design and logic of the UI. See where they got confused and how you can make that more evident now. You might even need re-think everything, but that's ok. It's the process. \n\nAn intuitive UI shouldn't need hand-holding, so you want to get to a stage where users can navigate the features *without* it.

Most of us find something great on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, save it with the intention of coming back, then it gets trapped in a fragmented mess, buried inside each platform’s hard-to-find Saved/Bookmarks section. Those interfaces aren’t built for revisiting, they’re annoying to navigate, so the content just sits there until you forget it exists. Tavlo pulls all those saves into a single, user-friendly library that’s easy to browse, search, and actually use, and it still feels doomscroll-friendly, just without the chaos.\n\nUsing it is simple. Install the Chrome extension, and when you’re on a post or video you want to keep, click Save to Tavlo. It captures the content and drops it straight into your Tavlo feed, and it can add AI summaries and enrichment so you can skim fast and pick the good stuff to revisit later.\n\nAs an added bonus, if you save a youtube video, you can view it on Tavlo ads-free 😉\n\nLanding page: [https://www.tavlo.ca](https://www.tavlo.ca/)\n\nChrome extension: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tavlo-save-to-your-feed/enjgpnmebahcbmkgnndjbmgceocelgpa?authuser=2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tavlo-save-to-your-feed/enjgpnmebahcbmkgnndjbmgceocelgpa?authuser=2)",

If one bans you, the others keep running. No single point of failure.\n\nI’ve heard good things about [**resub.io**](http://resub.io) for this specific headache. Their whole pitch is \"payment sovereignty\" for high-volume merchants to stop exactly what just happened to you. They basically let you build your own infrastructure so you aren't at the mercy of one provider.\n\nMight be the middle ground between \"Stripe hell\" and \"Crypto chaos\" you're looking for.

It could probably fix your platform risk with stripe but you need to have a plan for the UX side or risk your tanking conversion.\n\nDo your users have a crypto wallet already? If not you need to think hard about how to onboard them and get their accounts funded. Stable coins probably the easiest to conceptually understand. But then you also need to consider the transaction fees which must be paid in the native currency of the blockchain unless you employ some form of fee abstraction.\n\nAnd then you have to deal with network selection. You’ll likely choose ethereum since that where most volume is. But that ecosystem alone has many “flavors” of chains (rollups are the technical term).\n\nLike others have mentioned, you’ll be inviting a lot of new technical and UX problems if you go down this route. If you still want to go down this route feel free to DM if you wanna talk about it more, I’ve got some experience so might be able to help you speed run things as much as possible.",

Also consider reaching out directly to people who've commented on related problems in those communities.\n\nFor early tester recruitment, offering extended free access or lifetime deals can work wonders. People love being part of something early, especially if there's a tangible benefit.

The biggest hurdle is often just getting past the gatekeepers and noise to reach the person who actually cares about your solution.\n\nA few things that can help: 1) Focus on very narrow ICP initially - the more specific you are, the easier it is to find and reach the right people. 2) Leverage any existing networks or warm intros you can get, even tangentially. 3) Consider bottom-up adoption strategies where individual contributors can start using your tool and become internal champions.\n\nThe LinkedIn/cold email spray-and-pray approach rarely works anymore. Building genuine relationships and creating content that demonstrates deep understanding of their specific problems tends to be more effective, though slower.\n\nHappy to compare notes - feel free to DM me!",

      "text": "If you’ve launched a SaaS anytime in the last ten years, you’ve probably had the same advice shouted at you from every corner of the internet: Just use Stripe\n\nFor a long time, that was the gold standard. Stripe’s API was a work of art. They took the nightmare of legacy payment gateways and turned it into a developer’s playground. But lately, if you're building in Europe, the vibe has shifted\n\nThe reason isn’t that Stripe has become less capable… FAR FROM T... Rather, the very nature of what’s required to sell software in the european union has fundamentally changed.\n\n*The European Tax Dragon got hungrier.*\n\n**1/ VAT quietly became the real problem**\n\nStripe did not get worse. The environment did. When you use Stripe directly, you are the seller of record.\n\nThat means you are responsible for knowing where every customer lives, registering for OSS, filing quarterly VAT returns and dealing with multiple EU tax authorities..\n\nWhat feels like a simple payment decision slowly turns into ongoing legal and admin work\n\n**2/ Merchant of Record changes the equation**\n\nPlatforms like Paddle, Polar and Lemon Squeezy take a different approach. They act as the Merchant of Record and become the legal seller of your product.\n\nThey calculate and collect VAT, handle remittance, and manage compliance. You get paid out, minus their fee, without worrying about tax filings or cross-border rules.\n\n**3/ Payments are no longer enough**\n\nModern SaaS is much more than simply charging a card. The purchase often needs to unlock a dashboard, grant Discord access, invite someone to a GitHub repo, issue a license, or upgrade an account..\n\nWith Stripe, you assemble all of this yourself using webhooks and custom logic. Newer platforms treat entitlements as a core feature.. often making these flows configuration instead of code\n\n**4/ The Economics of Time Versus Money**\n\nMerchant of Record platforms usually charge higher fees than Stripe. But that comparison misses the hidden costs. Time spent on VAT, maintaining integrations, and managing compliance risk adds up quickly..\n\nFor many founders, paying a bit more per transaction is worth avoiding those distractions\n\n**5/ Why this matters more in Europe**\n\nStripe’s still great if you’re keeping things simple or selling in one place. But if you’re a small team trying to grow across europe, you’ve gotta ask yourself: what actually lets you focus on your product.. instead of drowning in tax forms and weird edge cases?\n\nFor more and more founders in EU, that answer is turning out to be a Merchant of Record",

But be careful trading one master (Stripe) for another (MoRs like Paddle/Lemon Squeezy).\n\nThe hidden cost of MoRs isn't just the 5% fee, it's \"Risk Policy Lock-in.\"\n\nWhen you use an MoR, you are subject to *their* risk appetite. I work with a founder who exited for $9M in the subscription space, and we saw this constantly: if the MoR decides your new AI feature or vertical is suddenly \"high risk,\" they shut you down. Because they are the legal seller, you have zero recourse. You don't just lose payment processing; you lose the ability to sell entirely.\n\nThe alternative path (which we built our infrastructure around) is Payment Orchestration. You keep direct relationships with multiple gateways (like Mollie + Stripe + Adyen) so you control your own routing and risk, and you just layer a tax automation tool on top. We ended up building our own infrastructure ([Resub.io](http://Resub.io)) to solve this because the existing options were too clunky for e-com, but the principle applies regardless: stop using aggregators and get your own direct MID.\n\nIt’s slightly more setup than a \"one-click\" MoR, but you actually own your revenue stream instead of renting it",

I was running outbound for my agency, had like 8 months of connections and active deals in the pipeline.Linkedin didn't send me any warning, I just got a full permanent ban.\n\nSpent two weeks researching wtf happened because their support just said that I violated platform terms of service.. I really thought I was careful with automating my outreach. I was using Waalaxy extension with what I thought were safe limits maybe 40-50 connection requests a day sending personalized messages.\n\nturns out I f\\*cked up in a couple of ways with this automation. My limit was not so safe at all, it's better to send around 25 a day, especially for accounts like mine, without much platform activity history. But the thing that was surprising for me is that the chrome extension I was using actually injects javaScript code into the LinkedIn page, so LinkedIn sees that something foreign is running, found it[ in this article](https://www.linkedhelper.com/blog/bad-linkedin-extensions/). Found out that there are also some other types of using automation. Services that make API calls to linkedin servers, they are expensive as hell, but much better than extentions, although can also be detected by Linkedin, so money is no guarantee here, I guess. And the last one is separate browser, LinkedIn just sees it as regular Chrome. during all this research I kept running into articles from LinkedHelper (they make a standalone browser). I was skeptical because obviously they're promoting their product, but the explanations actually made sense.\n\nso I started testing it about 2 months ago on my main account. setup was annoying, it took me like 3 hours to figure out the campaign settings because their UI, and I had to get used to keeping my computer on all the time it works. But by now it works ok, I send invites and messages without restrictions, even booked 8 meetings through this outreach. But I still worry what if LinkedIn is gonna block me in a couple of months again? Has anyone else used standalone browsers long-term (6 months or so) and how it's been?\n\n",

The standalone browser approach does seem safer than extensions since you're avoiding that JavaScript injection issue you mentioned. One thing worth considering though is whether all this automation headache is even worth it compared to just using a proper sales engagement platform.\n\n\n\nI've heard great things about [sales.co](http://sales.co) for LinkedIn outreach since they handle the compliance stuff and you don't have to worry about keeping your computer running 24/7. The risk with any automation is that LinkedIn keeps changing their detection methods, so even if something works for 6 months now, there's no real guarantee it won't get flagged tomrrow. If you're already booking meetings and building pipeline, might be worth investing in something more stable rather than sweating every login",

A lot of accidental exposure came from old buckets, analytics tools, backups, or overly broad permissions.\n\nWe paired a classic DLP (Purview / Netskope-type controls) with a separate data discovery and context layer (Sentra) instead of relying on DLP alone.

We’ve had good results combining a data catalog / classifier (BigID in our case, Varonis at a previous gig) with cloud-native stuff like Purview, then wiring that into DLP and access reviews. That’s how you catch the weird edge cases: stale S3 buckets, random SaaS exports, over-privileged service accounts.\n\n\n\nAlso worth thinking about how you operationalize it: short-lived exceptions, regular “permission cleanup” sprints, and tight integration with your identity stack. I’ve used BigID and Netskope before, and now Pulse plus internal tooling to surface which teams are actually moving sensitive data across tools. The main point is still: don’t start with blocking, start with knowing exactly what you’re protecting and how it flows.",

      "text": "I have built and launched over 30 SaaS MVPs for clients in the last few years.\nThe ones who launched a \"Community Discord\" on Day 1 almost always regretted it.\n\nHere is the trap: You think a community will create \"engagement\" and \"superfans.\"\nWhat it actually creates is a **Union for Angry Customers.**\n\n**1. The \"Bug Riot\" Effect**\nWhen a user finds a bug via email support, it’s a private 1-on-1 conversation. You fix it, apologize, and they stay.\nWhen a user posts a bug in your `#support` channel, three other people jump in: \"Yeah, me too!\" \"This app is always breaking!\"\nSuddenly, a minor edge-case bug feels like a systemic failure. The vibe shifts from \"help me\" to \"let's grab pitchforks.\" I’ve seen perfectly good products die because the Discord sentiment turned toxic over one bad weekend deployment.\n\n**2. Your \"Superfans\" are actually distracting you**\nThe people who hang out in SaaS Discords all day are usually not your ideal enterprise customers. They are the tinkerers.\nThey will demand niche features, complain about pricing, and eat up 4 hours of your day.\nMeanwhile, your *real* customers—the business owners paying $99/mo—are too busy working to chat in a Discord. They just want the tool to work.\n\n**3. Email is a Feature, not a Bug**\nWhen I build MVPs for clients, I intentionally integrate boring, old-school support widgets (like Help Scout or Crisp).\nWhy? Because it forces **async communication**.\nIt gives you breathing room to triage bugs, fix them, and reply calmly. Discord forces you to be \"always on.\" If you don't reply in 10 minutes, the chat assumes you're dead.\n\n**My Advice to Founders:**\nBuild the product. Put a support email on the landing page.\nOnly launch a community when you have 1,000+ happy users and you can afford to hire a full-time Community Manager to police the toxicity.\nUntil then, control the narrative. Don't hand the microphone to the guy who is cancelling his subscription.\n\n**Unpopular opinion? Maybe. But I’d rather have boring support and low churn than a lively Discord and a leaking bucket.**",

Every week, I watch teams manually pull data from Jira, Linear, and GitHub to write status reports for leadership.\n\n**The problem I'm solving:** Teams spend every Friday copying tickets into Google Docs, rewriting everything in \"business language,\" then emailing it to stakeholders who probably won't read it anyway.\n\n**What I built:** ProductOrbit connects to your work tools, pulls your tickets and PRs, uses AI to turn technical updates into executive-friendly reports, then emails them automatically.\n\nTakes 30 seconds instead of the usual Friday grind.\n\n**Current stage:** MVP working. Demo mode live at [https://productorbit.ai/](https://productorbit.ai/) (you can try it without connecting any tools).\n\n**Why I'm here:** I've talked to 10 PMs who all say they hate status reports. But when I ask if they'd actually change their workflow and trust AI to generate these, they hesitate.\n\nSo I need to know: is this a real painkiller or just a vitamin people complain about but won't pay for?\n\n**What I need from you:**\n\n1. Do you send regular updates to leadership? How long does it take?\n2. What would stop you from using something like this?\n3. Honest answer - would you pay $20/month for this or nah?\n\n[https://productorbit.ai/](https://productorbit.ai/)",

We fetch the data, clean the headers, and return it to your browser instantly.\n\n* **Simple:** Just a proxy URL wrapper.\n* **Secure:** SSL, rate limits, and token-based access.\n* **Versatile:** Works with GET, POST, custom headers, and images.\n* **Production-Ready:** Built for real workflows, not a \"demo\" project that crashes.\n* **localhost is free**\n\n**New Launch Offers (Limited Time)**\n\nSince we just went live, I'm offering two huge deals for early adopters to help stress-test the system:\n\n* **NEW1** \\- Get the **Pro Level FREE** for 1 month.\n* **SUMER26** \\- **30% OFF** all plans for life.\n\n**Try it out:** [**https://fixcors.com**](https://fixcors.com)\n\nFeedback from real developers matters more to me than marketing right now.

If you know that world, it’s all about high volume. I was spending 2+ hours a day just typing odds, stakes, and teams into a spreadsheet to track my ROI. It was a horror show—one typo and my data was useless.\n\n**The Gap in the Market:**\n\nI looked at existing bet trackers. Most of them feel like they were built in 2010. But the worst part? Almost all of them paywall manual data entry. They limit you to 15-100 bets unless you pay $20/month.\n\nTo me, that felt backwards. Tracking your own data manually shouldn't be the product—the automation and analytics should be.\n\n**What I Built:**\n\n1.  **AI-Powered Automation:** I built a Chrome extension that lets you just snapshot a betslip. My backend uses AI to parse the image and sync the data instantly to the dashboard. No more typing.\n\n2.  **The \"Lead Magnet\" Model:** I decided to make **Unlimited Manual Entries 100% Free.**\n\n\\*   My logic: Get users off their spreadsheets and into my ecosystem for free.\n\n\\*   Once they see the value of the dashboard but get tired of manual entry, the $9.99/mo upgrade for the AI-Automation becomes an easy \"yes.\"\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the Freemium strategy or any feedback on the UX!\n\nCheers!\n\n",

It's essentially feeding the model a focused, high-contrast image of data.\n\nIf a user uploads a full screenshot (e.g., from mobile), the pipeline is a bit smarter.

It complimented my \"strategic vision.\" It scraped my LinkedIn history perfectly.\n\nI didn't just delete it. I blocked the domain.\n\nI’m seeing a lot of hype on here about scaling outreach with AI agents to hit 5,000 prospects a week. But you guys need to know what's happening on the other side of the table.\n\nWe aren't just ignoring these. In 2026, if it smells like a bot, it dies. IT is literally flagging domains that send high-volume, low-context fluff as \"Spam/Marketing.\"\n\nIf you want to actually get a reply from enterprise buyers right now, stop trying to pass the Turing test. The \"Uncanny Valley\" is real.\n\nWhen I get an email that says \"Congrats on the Green Supply Chain Award! I’d love to see how we can help optimize your logistics\" I know it's fake. It connects a public fact to a generic pitch. It's too polished. It has zero soul.\n\nThe only emails I reply to lately are the ones that are slightly messy or \"Anti-Sales.\"\n\nI had a rep last week write: \"Honestly, if you’re already deep into SAP Ariba, our tool is probably overkill for your main workflow. But it might help with that tail-spend leak.\"\n\nThat got a reply. Why? Because a bot is never programmed to disqualify itself.\n\nWe’d rather get one 3-sentence email from a human who actually looked at our problems than 1,000 \"personalized\" novels from your AI swarm.\n\nStop burning your total addressable market with high-volume noise.\n\nEDIT:  I put together the exact list of questions procurement teams use to trap bots (and the specific \"Anti-Pitch\" templates that bypass them) on my [InsideProcurement Blog](https://open.substack.com/pub/insideprocurement/p/why-i-now-auto-delete-personalized?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web)",

Most companies, especially the smaller ones, are intoxicated by the belief that if they just 10x the volume they would 10x the revenue. They've been led to believe that sending 5,000 emails, all of which are pseudo-personalised using the publicly available signals that you've just talked about, would magically start getting meetings with CXOs.\n\nIn reality what's happening is that they're just burning their total addressable market with feature messaging. We predict that in 2026 the only outreach that actually survives will be low-volume, high-relevance, contains zero AI tells, and has a real human on the back of it.\n\nKeep blocking them.

The economics, on the face of it, just works for them as agent is cheaper than human at this stage. They often lack the sophistication to do it themselves, so they get an agency to do it for them. The agency doesnt care about burning TAM, nor do they undertsand it well enough. They just care about volume metrics. When the client churns, they can just mark it up to “not a good fit for us”. \n\nFor most large enterprises, the problem is inverted. Their IT hasnt yet greenlit the AI agents. So the reps use whatever they want from duct-taped n8n sequences to saas tools that slip under the radar. We’re seeing this as a MAJOR risk for enterprise sales, but it isnt on the radar for most companies yet. I suspect this will start becoming more prominent in H2, after which we’ll see an over indexation into digital and field marketing.",
