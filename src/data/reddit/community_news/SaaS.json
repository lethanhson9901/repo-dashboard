      "text": "A few months back, I finally sold my ecommerce SaaS for a decent exit after hitting $500K ARR in 8 months.   \n  \nTook me three tries to get there - the first two were complete disasters.\n\nThis whole thing was brutal. I'm talking thousands of hours, doing the same tedious tasks over and over, saying goodbye to weekends, constantly second-guessing myself, running tests that went absolutely nowhere. But it worked out in the end.\n\nNow I'm working on [this SAAS ](https://gojiberry.ai)(helps B2B companies find and contact high-intent leads), and if I had to do it all over again, these are the exact habits I'd stick to every single day to get to $10k MRR as fast as possible.\n\nI've screwed up in every way you can imagine:\n\n* Wasted 6 months building something nobody wanted\n* Created a \"brilliant\" product that nobody would pay for\n* Got 2,000 people on my waitlist but couldn't convert a single one to paid\n\nSo this is me paying it forward.\n\nIf you're just starting out, trying to get from zero to actual traction, just do these 5 things. Every day with no exceptions.\n\nYour brain's going to fight you on this. It'll whisper \"don't send that message,\" \"don't post that - you'll look like an idiot,\" \"it's beautiful outside, take the day off.\" Don't listen.\n\nGrowth happens when you're uncomfortable. Not when you're cozy.\n\nPush through that voice. Do the work anyway. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nHere are the 5 daily habits that actually move the needle:\n\n1. Send 20-30 LinkedIn connection requests to your ideal customers. Just 20 minutes. Do it manually. Pick the right people. Connect. Done.\n2. Message 20-30 people on LinkedIn. Don't sell them anything. Just talk. Ask questions. Share what you're building and see if they have the same problem.\n3. Send 20-100 cold emails 20 if you're writing them yourself, 100+ if you're using tools. Keep them short. Don't be pushy. Just start real conversations. The magic happens in your follow-ups - send 2-3.\n4. Comment on 10 Reddit threads in your space. Go where your customers hang out. Jump into \"looking for alternatives to X\" posts. Actually help people. Only mention your product when it genuinely fits. People can smell fake help from a mile away.\n5. Post something on LinkedIn every day. This builds up over time. Write about problems your customers face, share what you've learned, tell quick stories about wins and losses. Give away good stuff for free. Build your lead magnets into the content. Just show up consistently.\n\nAt the beginning, it feels pointless.\n\n* 1 like on your posts\n* 1 response for every 20 messages you send\n* Radio silence on your first batch of emails\n\nBut stick with it every single day, and things start to compound.\n\nYou get better at writing. Your messages start working. People begin to recognize you. Someone books a call. Then 2 more. Then 10. Then they start referring people.\n\nThat's how you actually win. Not by getting lucky, but by showing up every day.\n\nEven when it's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nThe boring stuff is what actually grows your business.\n\nTrust me, it's worth it ! ",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.  \n  \nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.   \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Good ones say “here’s what I know, here’s what I need to verify, here’s the safest next step.” Mediocre ones are just nodding their heads.\n\nWhen you hired the two great ones, did you find them through referrals, trials, or a structured interview process?",

Your engineer that “refactored middleware” could be either a good engineer trying to accelerate development process or a complete a*hat. You can’t tell by that alone. You need to hire someone actually know s*** to tell you that.\n\n2. Commit frequency should never be used as the metrics for this. It can maybe be used to judge your team’s moral based on past pattern. But the worst devs or proxy devs also know this trick well. They will literally space out small commits to flood the graph. \n\n3. If your dev is not completing “almost done” items in short period of time, it almost certainly means there’s some other underlying sickness. It doesn’t mean it’s a lie, it means part of the process or codebase is broken. \n\n4. Both best and worst dev WILL push back on your ideas especially if they know you don’t know s*** and lack of confidence in your technical leadership.\n\n5. Weekly demo make devs working on UI features look good. If taken too seriously, devs will start trading tech debts for quick UI feature wins. You’ll soon be drowning in debts.\n\n\nLesson? Know if you are a people manager or teamlead manager. How to tell? Can you understand the architect and can replace any engineer of the project? If you can’t, you are people manager.

          "text": "I think you'll still have problems telling apart the peaches from the lemons. My bet would be that now with AI, lemons can more easily produce the demo without excuses, commit to git often, etc.\n\nGeorge Akerlof won the 2001 Nobel prize in economics for his theory of the effects of information asymmetry on markets (Best described in the paper \"The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\")\n\nDeveloping software is the ultimate market for lemons, because of the enormous information asymmetry between non-coder buyers (managers, entrepreneurs, PMs, and muggles in general) and sellers (\"devs\" be them great, awful, mediocre or 10Xers).\n\nThe interesting part is the Adverse selection. From Wikipedia: \"Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a \"peach\") and a low-quality car (a \"lemon\"). Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a \"peach\" and \"lemon\" together (p-avg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold \"lemons\" (since p-lemon < p-avg) and they will leave the market when they hold \"peaches\" (since p-peach > p-avg). Eventually, as enough sellers of \"peaches\" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop. Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an adverse selection problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse.\"\n\nThe very best \"Devs\" get tired of employers not being able to tell them apart from the pretenders, so they take themselves out of the market.\n\nI still remember how I felt one day in 2011 when I found out that I barely made a little bit more money than a much much less skilled coworker. In 2012 I switched careers (into IT management) and never looked back. Today AI coding s making that choice seem even wiser.\n\nThere are reasons why there are so few peaches and so many lemons. If you truly believe you're now able to tell them apart, then the question becomes what will you do to retain your peaches before they take themselves off the market.",

Sometimes they'll code for a week or two and then make one clear, descriptive merge commit (like \"feat: overhaul user settings page\").  \nMeanwhile, they're still giving you solid weekly demos from that branch.\n\nIn that case, is one 'big' commit actually a red flag? Or is the real signal the **combination** of clear demos + clear commit messages, regardless of frequency?\n\nMaybe the rule isn't *'small commits good, big commits bad'*, but *'visible progress good, radio silence bad'*?\n\nWhat do you all think?

FizzBuzz \nWrite a function that outputs the numbers 1-100 except;\n\nIf it’s a multiple or 3, output fizz\n\nIf it’s a multiple of 5, output buzz\n\nIf it’s a multiple or 3 and 5, output fizzbuzz \n\n\nThe key on the first one is: “infinite loop”  First of all if you’ve been a developer, you’ve done it and it’s quite annoying as the cpu fan starts to growl. Weaker candidates will say things like “the syntax is wrong because you can’t convert an integer” or something. They can’t differentiate between small and big problems; meaning you constantly will seem to get nowhere as they choose to solve the wrong problems.\n\n\nThe key on the second one is that… well for starters the first question gives you a hint. So I see if they pick up on that. Can they use information on their own or do you have to apoonfeed feed them all the requirements and logic?\n\nAlso it’s just a tiny bit tricky because he requiments are sort of written in the wrong order.\n\nIt usually gives me an opportunity to tell them: there’s a bug in your code, and see how they handle it.\n\nIn the old days when we did this in person I would give them a paper printout to work on. The space for question 2 would be purposely too small. I want to see if they are smart enough to use the back of the paper instead.\n\nAlso it should take them literally 1-3 minutes. Some take a good 10-15+ minutes, and say I’m trying to stump them with a trick question, or haggle about syntax. Dude, no one cares about syntax! The IDE handles all that.",

      "text": "Two years ago I walked away from a $200k base salary. I wanted to focus on building something on my own and leveraging my skills. On paper everything seemed flawless. In reality this was the hardest decision I have ever made.\n\nMost people talk about going all in like it is a movie montage. It is not. It is a messy, isolating grind that breaks most people.\n\nThe Structure Shock When you are a Staff Engineer you have built in momentum. You have stand ups, tickets, and peers who validate your existence. When you go solo that scoreboard vanishes. I spent the first three months working 14 hour days and feeling like I had accomplished zero. There is no done state anymore. There is just an endless void of tasks where coding is actually the easiest part of the day.\n\nThe Work Multiplies and the Clock is Ticking People think quitting means you finally get time to build. It does. But now you are the entire company and you are bleeding cash. Every single department shows up at your door every morning and the financial weight is heavy. You are responsible for:\n\n* Product Improvement: This is critical. You are constantly obsessing over the roadmap and refining the vision to ensure the core value actually exists.\n* Financial Pressure: You are paying thousands in infrastructure and operations. You are spending thousands more on ads to get eyes on the product. The clock is ticking and it is ticking fast.\n* QA and Support: You are the one answering every customer question and ensuring the product actually works when people log in.\n* Marketing and Sales: Trying to get anyone to care while running demos for people who might never buy.\n* Onboarding and Retention: Making sure users stay after they sign up and figuring out why they churn.\n\nThe Skills Gap is a Wall I am technical enough to have won multiple hackathons running on a few hours of sleep including OpenAI and Horizon AI. That is just the easier part of the game. Scaling a SaaS is the real sauce. Distribution is the game and the product is just your entry ticket. That is a hard truth for an engineer to swallow. Marketing is a specific type of pain because it is so broad. You have to learn SEO, paid ads, funnels, and copy that does not sound like a robot.\n\nThe Momentum Mismatch In engineering effort usually equals output. In a startup you can push a boulder uphill for a month, lose your grip, and end up further back than where you started. That mismatch is brutal. I have spent countless nights staring at a screen until 2:00 AM brainstorming improvements and wondering why the momentum is not matching my expectations. You put in the work but the needle just does not move.\n\nThe Loneliness is Underrated My friends think I am living the dream because I work from home. They see the sweatpants and assume the lifestyle is chill. It is not chill. There is no teammate to share the burden or say we are fine. Nobody else fully understands the specific problem you are trying to solve. You move from confidence to anxiety and from hope to frustration daily. It is not just building a product. It is managing your own psychology.\n\nWhere it stands now The SaaS is growing and making thousands in MRR but I am always with the constant thought that it is not growing fast enough. I have stopped romanticizing motivation and started treating this like a long war. I ship, I measure, I talk to users, and I repeat. Some weeks nothing works. Then one small thing clicks and you remember why you started.\n\nI have learned more in these 24 months than in a decade of traditional jobs because the market does not care about your feelings. It only cares if you solve a problem.\n\n# Question for the community\n\nFor those who quit a high-paying job to build SaaS:\n\nWhat was the hardest part for you?  \nAnd what do you wish you knew before you made the jump?",

People would have told me obviously, but in those earlier stages, you're very excited to build things. I still am, but I didn't think about those at that point in time seriously.\n\n1. The highs are higher - even if someone uses my product and gives me a good feedback, I'm excited.\n2. The lows are lower - if a user even emails that I want to deactivate my account or delete my data, it hits bad - even though there might be thousands of users.\n\nInvestors do ghost you no matter how diligently and seriously you prepared and how much good of a fit you might be. They might ghost you, they might not get back, they might say that you are at a very early stage, or maybe they will wait for a few months before they can connect with you again. There might be pseudo or wrong signals of growth, and you might need a course correction after going down the wrong path. Speed is the king or speed is the key of working at a start-up or building your own company. If you do not work with speed, not only will you get bored, but someone else will build it instead of you. Finally, you will get thousands of thoughts whether I should be doing this or not. The only question that you need to remember is, \"If you stop doing it, will you be able to live with the question that this unanswered? How far could I have taken it had I still been doing it?\"\n\nFocus and consistency while eliminating noise is a very difficult task!

You lose your employees, lose confidence in yourself, run into debts etc. I am starting over again with a proper SAAS this time. I studied engineering but my coding sucks.

You push the judgement from start to finish, AI just assist in the technicalities. What I have built would definitely do better than the first. Just waiting to launch in a couple of days.

Basically, any time someone had a problem my app could solve, Id jump in. It got me my first users and actually helped with SEO down the line. The problem was just how much time it took. I ended up building a tool for myself that automates finding those conversations across Reddit, X and even LinkedIn, its crazy how much time that saved. It was just an internal thing at first, but I realized other founders might be dealing with the same problem. I found organic outreach through relevant conversations a great way to get my first users, and they tend to be more engaged as they came from a genuine conversation around their needs If you think it could help you surface more of those entry ticket opportunities, let me know.",

As much as he is giving me tons of product advise and insights, bulk of the work has been on me for the past several months given that he doesn't possess the technical know-how to build a product/platform. \n\nI'm currently at the juncture where a mentor of mine told me recently to stop building and to instead start looking for actual customers/indicators of demand in the market. I kind of dread it tbh because like you've mentioned, marketing and sales does not reflect the effort you put into it. No idea, how it will turn out in the coming months but I guess I will try to make the best out of what I can do.\n\nWishing you luck as well",

The best co-founders are people you've previously worked with.\n\nJournaling is critical. Real inner thoughts collected daily. Not just meeting notes in Notion. I tried that (and Obsidian and Reflect) and figured out nobody had created exactly what I needed as a founder. It was something I had to have, so I started a side project just to get this right. Now I have a second brain following the evolution of my company and tracking my mood/productivity.\n\nPeople. You have to have your people too. Your community and support network is critical. A spouse will be supportive, but you probably shouldn't burden them with the full weight of your journey. Friends will not get it, like you said. What then? Other founders! And not online. Find your startup spaces, clubs, groups, etc. and have IRL conversations. Put in the reps (show up), and people will get to know you and what you're building. Founders can't help but ideate. They will be a wellspring of fresh connections, the inside track on opportunities you didn't know existed and much more.\n\nSleep and exercise. You can't sacrifice your health for your company. Your company needs you to be healthy. Exercise fights depression and a lot of the feelings that come with trying to bring your idea to life. The right gym bakes in another layer of community too.

The moment volume hits, you are dealing with edge cases, angry emails, refunds, and things breaking at the worst possible time. What I wish more founders knew is that reliability and boring fixes often matter more than clever features.

You are the source to their success\n* I would never be able to build a good product if I didn’t use it myself\n* Always monitor logs after pushing new updates\n* Bugs are fine as long as you fix them fast\n* People love good design\n* Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far\n* Always refund people that want a refund\n* Asking where people heard about you during onboarding makes marketing 10x easier\n* Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n* Don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more\n* A surprising amount of users are willing to get on a call to talk about your product and it’s super helpful\n* Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product\n* Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success\n* Even when things are going well you’ll have moments when you doubt everything, just have to shut that voice out and keep going\n\nFor context, [my app](https://aicofounder.com/) guides users through researching and planning their product.",

Same thing with distribution on Reddit/communities – I’ve seen a mix of SparkToro for discovery, Apollo for targeted outreach, and then tools like Pulse for Reddit to catch and reply to high-intent threads work way better than just throwing more money at Meta/Google.\n\nAlso co-founder ambition alignment is huge, but I’d stress expectation alignment too: who owns which decisions, what “done” means, and how much risk each is actually willing to take. That clarity early saves a ton of drama later.\n\nYour list basically shows that boring fundamentals compound way harder than clever growth hacks.",

I don’t have any shame to admit there is no secret, there is no hidden talent. it’s all about consistency and commitment. trust me I am still learning and still making tons of mistakes and there are so many things to learn and grow. my brain is still running at night, thinking about users, bugs, infra cost, growth, churn, support emails, next features.\n\nevery time I open youtube, twitter, tiktok, I see people saying stuff like:  \n“build a SaaS in 7 days”  \n“anyone can make 6 figures in 24 hours”  \n“no code, passive income” - tbh there is no passive income. you have to invest your time and you have to commit.\n\nI don’t even get mad, I just laugh. not because it’s impossible, but because it’s extremely unlikely and it ignores everything that comes before.\n\nif someone says they had overnight success, ask them how many years they were grinding before that. how many products nobody used. how many nights they couldn’t sleep. how many times they thought about quitting.\n\nwhat people don’t talk about is how much this takes from your life, especially at the beginning. you miss family stuff, you see friends less, relationships get hard because not everyone understands why you’re still working late or stressed all the time.\n\nbuilding SaaS isn’t just coding an app. it’s committing years to something that might not work at all. you give a lot upfront and get almost nothing back for a long time. momentum comes later, if it comes at all.\n\nI’m not complaining. I chose this, if I have to build it from scare I’d probably still choose it again. and I am loving it enjoying it even it’s very stressful.\n\njust writing this because if you’re building and feel behind or stupid because things aren’t working fast that’s normal. keep building.",

They were the most demanding, the rudest, and expected enterprise-level features for $0.\n2. **Server Costs:** I was paying AWS bills to host thousands of users who were never going to pay me a dime.\n3. **False Feedback:** Free users give bad feedback. They ask for features that solve \"nice to have\" problems. Paying users ask for features that solve \"business critical\" problems.\n\nLast month, I ripped the band-aid off. I deleted the Free Tier and replaced it with a 14-day trial (credit card required).\n\n**The Result:**\n\n* Signups dropped by 70% (scary at first).\n* **Revenue increased by 40%.**\n* Support tickets dropped to almost zero.\n\nIf you are a solo founder, stop devaluing your work.

Watched a stranger try to use my app on zoom and it was the most brutal 10 minutes of my life.\n\nI've been grinding on these complex backend features for months thinking that’s what people wanted. Turns out, the guy couldn't even find where to start. He literally just sat there looking at my clean dashboard and said okay. so what do i do now then he closed the tab.\n\nIt’s so easy to forget that new users don't have our brains. I thought my UI was intuitive but it's actually just empty and confusing to anyone who isn't me. I'm seeing like 80% of people bounce after the first login and I finally realized it's because I'm not actually teaching them how to win.\n\nHow are you guys hand holding users without it feeling like a 1990s microsoft office tutorial?\n\nIs there a way to guide people that isn't just a massive wall of text or a boring video?",

In products Ive worked on to achieve activation uplift, it usually comes down to a couple of things:\n\n1.Design for the first win, not the product:\nSo, What’s the single task that proves value? Eg. Generating something, seeing a result, viewing and answer. I’d design the entire first session around just getting them there. It’s the “oh I get it” moment.\n\n2.Show the result before explaining it:\nBlank dashboards and “start here” text are the friction points you’re describing. Instead, show awesome examples, outputs, or a visible end state. Let users reverse engineer the value, not just read about it.\n\n3.Remove choice until after activation\nIt’s tempting to showcase the products flexibility but it can create paralysis for new users. Clear hierarchy and defaults act like guardrails (like bumpers on a bowling alley). it should be obvious where to go and hard to go anywhere else until they’ve had the first win.\n\nOne pattern I’m seeing a lot is shipping a heap of great features quickly (now easier than ever), but miss the work of ensuring the first experience has one clear job to be done.\n\nIf you’re getting 80% bouncing after first login, it’s usually not the product. The first 30 seconds just aren’t doing enough work for them yet.",

All this to say that it is just a very hard problem, no matter the experience level, so don't let this demotivate you. \n\nI would recommend not focusing on adding the hand-holding just yet. You've started off right by getting someone to use the app while you watch them. Now you need to iterate on the design and logic of the UI. See where they got confused and how you can make that more evident now. You might even need re-think everything, but that's ok. It's the process. \n\nAn intuitive UI shouldn't need hand-holding, so you want to get to a stage where users can navigate the features *without* it. Once you're there, then you can add some onboarding / usage guide as a nicety.",

      "text": "Hey guys, I see a lot of people asking questions about marketing and I know our results so far aren't that impressive (we want to be hitting minimum $100k months).\n\nBut I thought I'd at least share what we've done so far so that if you're behind that point, perhaps it will help you.\n\n**Step 1:** **My Favourite Way To Stack New Users Profitably**\n\nEveryone seems to talk about \"reply to people in forums\" or \"post in Facebook groups\"...\n\nBut to me that's such an unscalable and slow way to grow a new business.\n\nNow, no disrespect to people that are doing it - 7 years ago when I first launched my first business... Guess what I did haha... yeah.\n\nBut IMO there are 100x better ways to build a business in 2026 and this is one that I think a lot of Saas founders have never even heard about.\n\nInfo product frontend -> software backend\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIf you run ads to a free trial of your software you're basically going to lose a sh#t load of money.\n\nAnd pray your trial conversion is high enough + your churn is low enough that in 2-9 months you'll be profitable.\n\nSince I don't have a software background (thank youuu vibecoding) I was able to implement a new way of selling saas that most people I speak to don't do or don't even know about.\n\n**Step 2: Executing The Strategy**\n\n1. You create a low ticket ($1-$47) information product that your ideal market wants\n\nFor example if your software helps people create youtube thumbnails you create \"The Ultimate YouTube Growth Method\" pdf or mini course. Where you actually teach them something valuable, and inside, you show them how to use your software.\n\n2. Upsells + funnel\n\nYou won't get profitable selling a single $27 info product... But you CAN be profitable or at least breakeven on your adspend if you have a few products.\n\nOur best funnel was:\n\n$1 frontend offer\n\n2x $19 offers on the checkout page people could add if they wanted\n\n$37 upsell if they want that after purchase\n\nBy doing that we were able to make MORE than what we spent in ads...\n\n...Just on the info...\n\nThe best part, and why this strategy is relevant for everyone here.\n\nIs that every single person that purchased... ALSO signed up for a 14 day free trial of the software.\n\nWhich is how we *profitably added 2,000 users in the first 30 days...*\n\n**Step 3: The Kicker**\n\nThe kicker is that we did this with:\n\n1. Brand new Instagram accounts with ZERO followers\n2. AI avatars (no real people did any filming)\n3. 100% AI generated ads\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nIf there's one thing I want you to take away from this post after you read it...\n\n...It's that you CAN launch a Saas business PROFITABLY from the beginning.\n\nThey don't need to be either extremely slow growing organic never-really-scales businesses...\n\nOr cash eating monsters.\n\nIf you've read this far, I deeply appreciate you trusting me today with your most valuable asset: your time.\n\nI hope the value was a positive exchange for you.\n\nAnd good luck with your software!!\n\n\\-Tom",

We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

Most of us find something great on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, save it with the intention of coming back, then it gets trapped in a fragmented mess, buried inside each platform’s hard-to-find Saved/Bookmarks section. Those interfaces aren’t built for revisiting, they’re annoying to navigate, so the content just sits there until you forget it exists. Tavlo pulls all those saves into a single, user-friendly library that’s easy to browse, search, and actually use, and it still feels doomscroll-friendly, just without the chaos.\n\nUsing it is simple. Install the Chrome extension, and when you’re on a post or video you want to keep, click Save to Tavlo. It captures the content and drops it straight into your Tavlo feed, and it can add AI summaries and enrichment so you can skim fast and pick the good stuff to revisit later.\n\nAs an added bonus, if you save a youtube video, you can view it on Tavlo ads-free 😉\n\nLanding page: [https://www.tavlo.ca](https://www.tavlo.ca/)\n\nChrome extension: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tavlo-save-to-your-feed/enjgpnmebahcbmkgnndjbmgceocelgpa?authuser=2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tavlo-save-to-your-feed/enjgpnmebahcbmkgnndjbmgceocelgpa?authuser=2)",

If not you need to think hard about how to onboard them and get their accounts funded. Stable coins probably the easiest to conceptually understand. But then you also need to consider the transaction fees which must be paid in the native currency of the blockchain unless you employ some form of fee abstraction.\n\nAnd then you have to deal with network selection. You’ll likely choose ethereum since that where most volume is. But that ecosystem alone has many “flavors” of chains (rollups are the technical term).\n\nLike others have mentioned, you’ll be inviting a lot of new technical and UX problems if you go down this route.

      "text": "I have built and launched over 30 SaaS MVPs for clients in the last few years.\nThe ones who launched a \"Community Discord\" on Day 1 almost always regretted it.\n\nHere is the trap: You think a community will create \"engagement\" and \"superfans.\"\nWhat it actually creates is a **Union for Angry Customers.**\n\n**1. The \"Bug Riot\" Effect**\nWhen a user finds a bug via email support, it’s a private 1-on-1 conversation. You fix it, apologize, and they stay.\nWhen a user posts a bug in your `#support` channel, three other people jump in: \"Yeah, me too!\" \"This app is always breaking!\"\nSuddenly, a minor edge-case bug feels like a systemic failure. The vibe shifts from \"help me\" to \"let's grab pitchforks.\" I’ve seen perfectly good products die because the Discord sentiment turned toxic over one bad weekend deployment.\n\n**2. Your \"Superfans\" are actually distracting you**\nThe people who hang out in SaaS Discords all day are usually not your ideal enterprise customers. They are the tinkerers.\nThey will demand niche features, complain about pricing, and eat up 4 hours of your day.\nMeanwhile, your *real* customers—the business owners paying $99/mo—are too busy working to chat in a Discord. They just want the tool to work.\n\n**3. Email is a Feature, not a Bug**\nWhen I build MVPs for clients, I intentionally integrate boring, old-school support widgets (like Help Scout or Crisp).\nWhy? Because it forces **async communication**.\nIt gives you breathing room to triage bugs, fix them, and reply calmly. Discord forces you to be \"always on.\" If you don't reply in 10 minutes, the chat assumes you're dead.\n\n**My Advice to Founders:**\nBuild the product. Put a support email on the landing page.\nOnly launch a community when you have 1,000+ happy users and you can afford to hire a full-time Community Manager to police the toxicity.\nUntil then, control the narrative. Don't hand the microphone to the guy who is cancelling his subscription.\n\n**Unpopular opinion? Maybe. But I’d rather have boring support and low churn than a lively Discord and a leaking bucket.**",

It’s a terrible experience for your customers that just want help and aren’t on discord all day (which is 95% of them for most B2B SaaS products). Honestly, I wouldn’t even use it for building a community when you’ve reached 1,000+ customers. It’s great for gaming communities, but terrible for most other use cases.",

They're high engagement, low revenue, and they'll demand features that don't move the needle for the people actually paying you.\n\nEmail support feels boring, but it's scalable and sane. You control the pace, you triage properly, and you don't end up in a never-ending chat spiral with someone who's about to churn anyway.\n\nCommunity is great once you've nailed product-market fit and have resources to manage it.

Just visuals.\n\nI posted it in a few founder communities, and within 5 days it had over 1,000 waitlist signups.\n\n\n\nI’m not linking anything because I know the rules here, but if anyone wants to see what it looked like or how I structured it, I can DM the quick demo.\n\n\n\nHappy to break down the method too, this stuff is fun.",

A lot of accidental exposure came from old buckets, analytics tools, backups, or overly broad permissions.\n\nWe paired a classic DLP (Purview / Netskope-type controls) with a separate data discovery and context layer (Sentra) instead of relying on DLP alone.

We’ve had good results combining a data catalog / classifier (BigID in our case, Varonis at a previous gig) with cloud-native stuff like Purview, then wiring that into DLP and access reviews. That’s how you catch the weird edge cases: stale S3 buckets, random SaaS exports, over-privileged service accounts.\n\n\n\nAlso worth thinking about how you operationalize it: short-lived exceptions, regular “permission cleanup” sprints, and tight integration with your identity stack. I’ve used BigID and Netskope before, and now Pulse plus internal tooling to surface which teams are actually moving sensitive data across tools. The main point is still: don’t start with blocking, start with knowing exactly what you’re protecting and how it flows.",

You'd be surprised, there's companies making money that don't even have a website at all.\n\nAt our company, we've seen the biggest shift this year away from spray-and-pray cold outreach. Before we would import a ton of leads into Smartlead, and just start emailing - this no longer works.\n\nWhat actually works now for getting customers is hyper-personalized outreach at scale. With the key being the personalisation. Simply putting '{{firstName}}' templates and 'spintax' does not count as personalisation. \n\nWe recently started using behavioral signals which we scrape using predictent.ai to identify prospects who are already showing buying intent (like posting about problems we solve or engaging with competitor content). Our response rates jumped from around 5% to over 15% just because we're reaching out to people who are literally already thinking about the problem.\n\nGeneric templates are basically dead at this point. Everyone can spot them instantly. The teams closing enterprise deals aren't necessarily the ones with the best websites - they're the ones reaching the right person at exactly the right time with a message that feels like it was written specifically for them.\n\nThe landing page barely matters at all, especially for startups.\n\n**So in summary - talk to people, do outreach, start or join conversations**",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI just launched[ **mybets.gg**](http://mybets.gg), and I wanted to share why I decided to go against the grain with my pricing model.\n\n**The Backstory:**\n\nI’ve been an arbitrage bettor for a while. If you know that world, it’s all about high volume. I was spending 2+ hours a day just typing odds, stakes, and teams into a spreadsheet to track my ROI. It was a horror show—one typo and my data was useless.\n\n**The Gap in the Market:**\n\nI looked at existing bet trackers. Most of them feel like they were built in 2010. But the worst part? Almost all of them paywall manual data entry. They limit you to 15-100 bets unless you pay $20/month.\n\nTo me, that felt backwards. Tracking your own data manually shouldn't be the product—the automation and analytics should be.\n\n**What I Built:**\n\n1.  **AI-Powered Automation:** I built a Chrome extension that lets you just snapshot a betslip. My backend uses AI to parse the image and sync the data instantly to the dashboard. No more typing.\n\n2.  **The \"Lead Magnet\" Model:** I decided to make **Unlimited Manual Entries 100% Free.**\n\n\\*   My logic: Get users off their spreadsheets and into my ecosystem for free.\n\n\\*   Once they see the value of the dashboard but get tired of manual entry, the $9.99/mo upgrade for the AI-Automation becomes an easy \"yes.\"\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the Freemium strategy or any feedback on the UX!\n\nCheers!\n\n",

It's essentially feeding the model a focused, high-contrast image of data.\n\nIf a user uploads a full screenshot (e.g., from mobile), the pipeline is a bit smarter.

Didn't want to spend months on the wrong one.\n\nSo before writing any code I ran Google Ads for 2 weeks to see which one people actually wanted.\n\n* AI voice assistant for dental clinics\n* Patient scheduling for orthopedic practices\n* Appointment reminders for physiotherapy clinics\n\nMade a simple landing page for each in Lovable. Headline, few bullets, email signup. No product behind any of them. Used Tally for the forms and Ryze AI to set up the ads since I didn't want to mess with Google Ads manager myself, and Microsoft Clarity to see where people were clicking and dropping off\n\nThe results:\n\nDental:\n\n\\--Dental:  22 signups (2.7% conversion)  \n\\-- Ortho: 4 signups (0.9% conversion)  \n\\-- Physio: 7 signups (1.4% conversion)\n\nDental converted way better. Wasn't expecting it to be that clear.\n\nFew things I learned:\n\n* The tech keywords flopped. \"AI phone system\" and \"automated receptionist\" got nothing. \"Dental answering service pricing\" and \"after hours answering service dentist\" worked. People search for categories that already exist.\n* Landing page copy changed everything. First version talked about AI and automation. Converted under 0.4%. Changed headline to \"stop losing patients to missed calls\" and it jumped to 1.2%. Nobody cares about the tech.\n* Ortho might have flopped because smaller market, not less interest. Hard to say.\n* Signups don't mean they'll pay. I'm doing calls now to check if there's real pain. 3 calls done so far. They all mentioned missing calls after hours. Wouldn't have known that without talking to them.\n\nWe were originally leaning toward ortho because we had a connection in that space. Glad we tested first.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this before building?\n\n",

From what you've said, I think \"dental answering service\" pricing or the words with \"dental\" worked better because it has a specific set of people associated with it. On the other hand, an AI phone system keyword is a very generic one. In the long run, you might definitely probably end up building an AI phone system which has a use case for dental answering service, and you will still be running ads probably on those keywords. So, consider it to be one software which fits into multiple use cases. That's why websites probably have a lot of use case pages.",

For anyone testing this LP + Traffic setup on Meta Ads:\n\n**Week 1: Audience & Hook Validation**\n\n* **Campaign Level Budget (CBO):** Set it to $20/day for 5 days.\n* **Ad Set 01:** Interest-based targeting.\n* **Ad Set 02:** Advantage+ Audience (Let Meta's AI find the users).\n* **Creative:** Test multiple hooks to see what stops the scroll.\n\n**Week 2: Scaling the Winner**\n\n* Move budget to the **Ad Set level (ABO)**.\n* Focus only on the winning audience and the top-performing hooks from week 1.\n* **Pro tip:** If you want faster results and have the budget, bump it to $50 - $100/day to collect data faster.\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Unlike Google, Meta is an **attention network**, not an intention network.

      "text": "Look, I know this isn't some $50k MRR flex... but hear me out.\n\nI see you grinding at 2 AM, convincing yourself that \"one more feature\" will finally get you customers. It won't.\n\nI wasted 6 months building shit nobody asked for before I realized something - as a solo founder stuck at $0, your problem isn't your product. It's everything else. Here's exactly what changed:\n\n**1. I Stopped \"Building\" and Started Talking**\n\nBig mistake: I spent 5 months coding in isolation thinking \"build it and they will come.\"\n\nThey didn't come.\n\nThen I forced myself to do something uncomfortable - I started cold messaging 50 people on LinkedIn every single day. Not copy-paste spam. Actually personalized messages to people who engage with top posts in my niche.\n\nResponse rate: 15-20%.\n\nThese people told me what they actually wanted. \n\nYour obsession with coding is just avoiding rejection.\n\n**2. Fuck Your Feature List**\n\nThis one hurt but... I deleted 7 features I spent weeks building.\n\nTurned out 3% of users ever clicked on them.\n\nStripped everything down to ONE thing: AI content that sounds like you, not ChatGPT.\n\nMade that 10x better instead of adding more mediocre features.\n\nYour feature bloat is killing you. Pick one thing and make it unfairly good.\n\n**3. The Pricing Move That Felt Insane**\n\nStarted at $19/month to \"compete\" with bigger tools at $39.\n\nConversion rate: 6%.\n\nThen I did something that felt stupid - raised it to $29/month.\n\nConversions went UP to 11%.\n\nPlus the customers who complained about the $10 difference:  \n  \nThey were going to be nightmare support tickets anyway.\n\nStop racing to the bottom.   \n  \nYour low price isn't helping you.\n\n**4. Reddit Became My Unfair Advantage**\n\nWhile everyone's trying to hack the algorithm on X, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote ONE valuable post per day on Reddit.   \n  \nNo promo links in the post. (Just let people ask)\n\nOne post drove 50+ qualified visitors. That's more than weeks of \"viral\" tweets with 50k impressions ever did.\n\nNow I repurpose that one post across 5-10 relevant subreddits.\n\nCost: $0. Time: 60 minutes per day.\n\n**5. SEO But Make It Actually Smart**\n\nEveryone told me: \"Write about LinkedIn growth tips!\"\n\nCool, I'd be competing with HubSpot, Neil Patel, and every marketing blog with DA 80+.\n\nI'd never rank.\n\nSo I went bottom-of-funnel instead:\n\n* \"Brandled vs \\[competitor\\]\" comparison pages\n* \"Best \\[competitor\\] alternatives\"\n* \"\\[competitor\\] review\"\n\nThese get 50-200 searches per month. But everyone searching is ready to buy.\n\nAnd I can actually rank for them.\n\nOne comparison page drives more revenue than 10 \"tips and tricks\" articles ever did.\n\n**6. I Stopped Pretending to Be a Big Company**\n\n**The Solo Founder's Actual Edge**\n\nYou can't outspend funded competitors. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them.\n\nEvery customer gets a personal response from me. Every feature request gets a Loom video (even if it's a \"no\"). Every cancelled user gets a real email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't even know their founder.\n\nYou ARE the founder. That's your moat.\n\n**Why I Almost Quit (And Why You Shouldn't)**\n\nMonth 3: $0. Thought about quitting. Month 4: $0. Definitely thought about quitting. Month 5: $0. Wrote my \"I'm shutting down\" post. Month 6: Changed everything. Hit $126 in 4 days.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: most founders quit right before things work.\n\nNot because their idea was bad. Because they ran out of patience.\n\nThe difference between $0 and $126 isn't talent. It's just refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\n**The Truth About \"Making It\"**\n\nI'm not at $20k MRR. I'm not at $10k. I'm at $126.\n\nBut you know what? I went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit, people are actually paying me.\"\n\nThat mental shift is worth more than the money.\n\nBecause now I know the model works. Now it's just about repetition.\n\nKeep doing outreach. Keep writing content. Keep talking to users. Keep shipping.\n\n$126 becomes $500. $500 becomes $2k. $2k becomes $10k.\n\nBut only if you don't quit at $0.\n\nLook, I'm not some guru. I'm just a solo founder who wasted 6 months doing everything wrong.\n\nBut if you're stuck at $0 like I was, maybe my mistakes can save you some time.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details.\n\n(And yeah, the tool is Brandled - helps founders grow on LinkedIn & X without sounding like ChatGPT. But more importantly: just keep building. Most people quit right before it works.)",

But you guys need to know what's happening on the other side of the table.\n\nWe aren't just ignoring these. In 2026, if it smells like a bot, it dies. IT is literally flagging domains that send high-volume, low-context fluff as \"Spam/Marketing.\"\n\nIf you want to actually get a reply from enterprise buyers right now, stop trying to pass the Turing test. The \"Uncanny Valley\" is real.\n\nWhen I get an email that says \"Congrats on the Green Supply Chain Award! I’d love to see how we can help optimize your logistics\" I know it's fake. It connects a public fact to a generic pitch. It's too polished. It has zero soul.\n\nThe only emails I reply to lately are the ones that are slightly messy or \"Anti-Sales.\"\n\nI had a rep last week write: \"Honestly, if you’re already deep into SAP Ariba, our tool is probably overkill for your main workflow. But it might help with that tail-spend leak.\"\n\nThat got a reply. Why? Because a bot is never programmed to disqualify itself.\n\nWe’d rather get one 3-sentence email from a human who actually looked at our problems than 1,000 \"personalized\" novels from your AI swarm.\n\nStop burning your total addressable market with high-volume noise.\n\nEDIT:  I put together the exact list of questions procurement teams use to trap bots (and the specific \"Anti-Pitch\" templates that bypass them) on my [InsideProcurement Blog](https://open.substack.com/pub/insideprocurement/p/why-i-now-auto-delete-personalized?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web)",

The economics, on the face of it, just works for them as agent is cheaper than human at this stage. They often lack the sophistication to do it themselves, so they get an agency to do it for them. The agency doesnt care about burning TAM, nor do they undertsand it well enough. They just care about volume metrics. When the client churns, they can just mark it up to “not a good fit for us”. \n\nFor most large enterprises, the problem is inverted. Their IT hasnt yet greenlit the AI agents. So the reps use whatever they want from duct-taped n8n sequences to saas tools that slip under the radar. We’re seeing this as a MAJOR risk for enterprise sales, but it isnt on the radar for most companies yet. I suspect this will start becoming more prominent in H2, after which we’ll see an over indexation into digital and field marketing.",
