Overall **1 Billions page view** in last 6 years.\n\n# What actually worked\n\n**1. Boring keywords beat trendy ideas**  \nInstead of ideas, I looked for problems people repeatedly Google.\n\n**2. Multi-language pages**  \nTranslating tools worked far better than writing blog posts.\n\n**3. Speed matters more than design**  \nFast pages massively improved retention.\n\n**4. Many small tools > one big product**  \nEach tool brings its own traffic source.\n\n# What didn’t work\n\n* Posting on social media for traffic\n* Product Hunt launch\n* Paid ads\n* Trying to build “a startup idea”\n\nRecently a few companies even asked about sponsoring placement on the site, which I never expected when I started.\n\nHappy to answer anything about SEO, structure, or scaling simple tools.",

You're your own user, so you naturally understand what \"good\" looks like. Compare that to someone who builds a utilities site purely for traffic arbitrage. They'll cut corners on UX because they don't actually use the tools.\n\nOne billion page views over six years with no marketing spend is a masterclass in compounding. The takeaway for anyone reading this: boring, consistent execution beats a viral launch almost every time. Most people quit after month three when their trendy idea gets no traction. Six years of steady building creates something that's genuinely hard to compete with.",

The systems that actually make money are never the sexy ones. They're the boring, reliable ones that solve a specific problem nobody wants to think about.\n\nThe multi-language play is smart. Most devs would never think of that because they default to English-only and then wonder why growth plateaus. You basically 10x'd your addressable market with translation instead of new features.\n\nCurious about one thing: at 600K monthly users, what does your infrastructure look like?

      "text": "Most SaaS founders think YouTube only works if your videos get thousands of views. \n\nThat's wrong. And it's costing them their best growth channel.\n\n1,400 paying subscribers. Zero ad spend. \n\nMy videos average 100-200 views. I recently broke this system down on \n\n[Starter Story](https://youtu.be/W48emwbUlUE?si=fWaV7ItogeOGGmWY)\n\nYouTube isn't a views game. It's a search engine. And if you treat it like one, even tiny view counts can drive serious revenue.\n\nI'm going to break down the exact system what I call the Content Flywheel Growth Engine   \nand fuel for this engine is Customer Pain\n\n# Why low-view videos outperform viral content for SaaS\n\nHere's the core insight:\n\n>100 views from people actively searching for a solution are worth more than 100,000 views from people passively scrolling.\n\nWhen someone searches \"how to create a full wrap mug mockup in Photoshop\" at 2 AM, they're not browsing. They have a problem right now. If your video solves it, they don't just watch, they buy.\n\nThis is the difference between content-for-audience and content-for-customers. Almost every YouTube strategy you see online is optimizing for the first. SaaS founders should be optimizing for the second.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice: 63% of my YouTube views come from search. Of that, 26% comes from Google directly, not YouTube's own search bar.   \n  \n\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDGO-xbkAECPMV.jpg)\n\n63% People coming for search. 26.4% coming from google search\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDHBQZbwAAWg0B.jpg)\n\nGoogle Search accounts for 73% of external search\n\nPeople are Googling their problem, my video appears in the results, they watch it, and they become customers.\n\nThe videos don't go viral. They go useful. And useful compounds in a way that viral never does.\n\n# The Customer Pain Content Flywheel\n\nThe system has three steps, and each step feeds the next:\n\n1. Harvest customer pain.\n2. Turn pain into tutorials.\n3. Turn tutorials into search assets.\n\nThen the assets bring new customers, who bring new pain, and the cycle compounds.\n\n# Step 1: Harvest customer pain\n\nDon't brainstorm content ideas. Harvest them.\n\nEvery piece of content should come from a real person with a real problem. There are four places to find them:\n\n1. Communities where your customers already hang out.\n\nFacebook groups, Skool communities, Discord servers, Reddit.\n\nDon't go there to promote. Observe. Look for:\n\n* Questions that repeat every few days\n* Posts with unusually high engagement\n* Long comment threads, these signal unresolved pain\n\nEvery repeated problem goes into a running list. That list is your content calendar.\n\n2. New user onboarding emails.\n\nAs soon as someone signs up, send an email asking if they want a custom tutorial for their use case.\n\nMost founders would never do this for a low-priced, self-serve product. But here's what happens: users reply describing exactly what they're trying to do, where they're stuck, and what confuses them.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDIDgVbIAIaSyJ.jpg)\n\nThey hand you longtail content ideas for free.\n\nThe key is framing: \"Want me to make a tutorial for your specific use case?\" gets honest responses. A generic feedback survey doesn't.\n\n3. Support tickets and live conversations.\n\nThis is probably the highest value source of all.\n\nWhen a customer reaches out, don't just resolve the ticket. Ask them to share their actual files. Then record a screen share tutorial solving their specific problem.\n\nDo this consistently and you'll build a library of private support recordings, real edge cases, real language, real frustrations that never show up in keyword tools.\n\nOver time, I've recorded 1,500+ of these.\n\nMany of my best public tutorials are simply cleanedup versions of private support videos. The content already exists. You're just making it public.\n\n4. YouTube comments in your niche.\n\nComments are unfiltered objections.\n\nFind videos in your niche with a high comment-to-view ratio. That ratio signals a content gap, people watched, but their problem wasn't fully solved.\n\nScrape the comments. List every objection, confusion, and unanswered question. Then create content that fills those gaps directly.\n\nSome of my best-performing videos came from exactly this approach.\n\n# Step 2: Turn pain into tutorials\n\nOnce the pain is clear, creating the content becomes almost automatic.\n\nThe rule: create content for one specific person with one specific problem.\n\nBecause the pain comes from real conversations , not brainstorming,  you already know the exact words they use, the exact step where they get stuck, and the exact outcome they want.\n\nThis changes everything about how you create:\n\n* One problem per video. Don't bundle multiple topics. Solve one thing completely.\n* Use their language, not yours. If customers say \"full wrap mockup,\" that's your title, not \"comprehensive mockup automation tutorial.\"\n* Mass appeal is not the goal. A video that solves a real problem for one customer will solve it for hundreds of others searching for the same thing.\n\nThe content practically writes itself when the source material is real customer pain.\n\n# Step 3: Turn tutorials into search assets\n\nThis is where most founders leave money on the table.\n\nThey upload and hope the algorithm picks it up. That's a losing strategy for low view, high intent content.\n\nInstead, treat every video as a long term search asset. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's recommendation engine.\n\nHere's why: if you want to rank on Google with a blog post, you need backlinks, domain authority, and months of effort. With video, the bar is dramatically lower.\n\nA well structured tutorial targeting a specific search query can rank on page one of Google with zero backlinks. Searches like \"mug mockup full wrap\" or \"wall art mockup\" surface YouTube videos directly in Google results.\n\nThe SEO itself is simple:\n\n* Put the keyword in the title\n* Put it in the description\n* Address it clearly in the first 30 seconds of the video\n* Add structured chapters so both Google and AI tools can parse the content\n\nThat's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nEvery video becomes a permanent acquisition asset that works while you sleep.\n\n>Pain → tutorial → search asset → new customer → new pain → repeat. That's the flywheel.\n\n# \"I don't have time for content\"\n\nThis is the most common pushback. And it's based on a false assumption, that content creation is a separate workload.\n\nIt isn't. Not with this system.\n\nThe support recording you made for one customer? That becomes a public tutorial with 20 minutes of editing.\n\nThe question someone asked in a Facebook group? That becomes a video title.\n\nThe comment thread under a competitor's video? That becomes your content plan for the month.\n\nYou're not adding work. You're recycling work you're already doing into assets that compound.  \n  \n\n\n# Why this matters even more in 2026\n\nThere's a shift happening right now that makes this system significantly more valuable than it was even a year ago.\n\nAccording to \n\n[Ahrefs' research on AI citations](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-cited-domains-ai-mode/)\n\n  \n, YouTube is the second most cited domain in Google's AI Mode , with 961,938 mentions, accounting for 9.51% of all AI citations. Only Wikipedia ranks higher.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDKzi3aYAEVTbQ.jpg)\n\nAnd this isn't just a Google thing. YouTube is also the sixth most-cited domain by ChatGPT.\n\n OpenAI trained GPT-4 on over a million hours of YouTube transcriptions. YouTube content is baked into both the input and output of every major AI assistant.\n\nWhat this means is simple: when someone asks an AI tool a question, the answer increasingly comes from YouTube. But not from all YouTube videos, from videos with clear structure, proper chapters, and well-written descriptions.\n\nIf your videos don't have that, they're invisible to AI. And that's a growing share of how your potential customers will find solutions in 2026.\n\nThis is one of the problems I'm working on solving. I'm building youTube tools specifically for founders and operators who use video as a revenue channel. \n\n# The framework, summarized\n\nFor founders who want the quick version:\n\nHarvest → Find real customer pain from communities, onboarding emails, support tickets, and YouTube comments.\n\nCreate → Make one video per problem, using the customer's own language. Solve one thing completely.\n\nOptimize → Treat every video as a search asset. Keyword in title, description, and first 30 seconds. Add chapters. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's algorithm.\n\nCompound → New customers bring new pain. New pain creates new content. The flywheel accelerates.\n\nStop chasing views. Start solving problems on camera.\n\nThe founders who figure this out early won't need to buy ads for a very long time.\n\nIf this framework clicked for you, share it with a founder who's been told they need to \"go viral\" to grow. They don't.\n\nEdit - I didn’t expect this to resonate this much.\n\nA lot of people are asking whether this only works for certain types of businesses.\n\nIt doesn’t work for every business.\n\nHere's where I have seen it work/or should work\n\n-Shopify apps\n-WooCommerce plugins\n-Webflow tools\n-Zapier-style automation tools\n-AI tools that require prompts or workflows\n-Design plugins (Figma / Photoshop / Canva)\n-Technical B2B SaaS\n\nExample: TinyHost an Indie Product, already does $1M ARR using the same strategy.\n\nP.S.

The shift from \"content for audience\" to \"content for customers\" is something we had to learn the hard way too.  \n  \nOne thing that's underrated in your framework is the speed at which you can validate demand. When someone replies to your onboarding email with a specific use case, you already know there's at least one person who needs that solution. Make the video, send it to them first, and their reaction tells you immediately if it's worth publishing wider.  \n  \nWe started doing something similar with screen recordings for sales calls. Instead of generic demos, we'd record specific solutions to prospects' problems. The conversion rate jumped because they could see exactly how it worked for their situation, not some hypothetical scenario.  \n  \nThe support ticket approach is brilliant because you're essentially getting paid twice for the same work. Once when you solve it for that customer, and again every time that video brings in someone new with the same problem.  \n  \nWhat's your process for deciding which support recordings are worth turning into public tutorials versus keeping private?",

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari. Brutal.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout.

And looking back at my client list, there's a clear line between the ones who went to zero and the ones who actually made money.\n\nThe ones who won? They were terrible \"product managers\" in the traditional sense.\n\nHere is what the successful founders did that the failed ones didn't:\n\n1. They launched incomplete.\nThe winners forced me to ship half-baked features. They didn't care if the \"Settings\" page was empty. They didn't care if the password reset flow was \"email me and I'll do it manually.\" They just wanted the core value prop live. The failures? They delayed for 3 weeks because the mobile menu animation wasn't smooth.\n\n2. They treated me like a partner, not a printer.\nThe failed founders sent me a 20-page PDF and said \"build this.\" The successful ones got on a call and said \"here is the problem, how can we solve this cheaply?\" They let me cut scope. They let me tell them that their idea was expensive and stupid. They wanted friction.\n\n3. They focused on one feature.\nI had a client who built a massive project management tool. It failed. Too many buttons. Another client built a tool that just did *one specific type of invoice reconciliation* for dentists. He's rich now. The winners don't build platforms. They build tools that solve a bleeding neck problem.\n\n4. They ignored the tech stack.\nThe failures asked me \"Are we using Next.js 14? Is it serverless?\" The winners asked \"Can we add Stripe by Friday?\" They didn't care if I built it in PHP or Python. They cared about the cash register ringing.\n\nIf you are a non-technical founder, stop trying to play CTO. Stop obsessing over the architecture.\n\nFocus on the problem. Be willing to ship something ugly. And find a developer who will tell you \"no\" when you ask for stupid features.\n\nThat's the pattern. It's not magic. It's just brutal prioritization.\n\nAnyone else notice this split in their clients?\n\n",

If they immediately ask \"what's the fastest path to getting this in front of users,\" that project usually works out.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: the successful founders almost always had a distribution plan before they had a product.

Not Product Hunt specifically, but a big splash launch that brought a flood of signups we weren't ready for. The thing nobody talks about is the opportunity cost - while you're firefighting infrastructure and support, you're not iterating on the product. So the users who might have stuck around get a frozen, buggy experience and leave anyway.\n\nThe pattern I've seen work better is what some people call a \"slow launch\" - intentionally throttle signups, onboard in cohorts, and use each batch to find and fix the retention leaks before opening the gates wider. Less exciting, zero champagne emojis, but you actually learn what makes people stay.\n\nAlso the competitive research signups thing is so real. After our launch about 40% of our \"users\" had competitor company emails. They inflated every metric and made it impossible to read our actual data for weeks.",

On any given Product Hunt launch in the SaaS space, I'd estimate at least 30-40% of signups are other founders or investors just poking around. They'll never convert and they skew every metric you try to learn from.\n\nThe lesson I took from a similar experience: treat your launch as the beginning of a funnel experiment, not a revenue event. The only number that matters from a launch is how many of those users are still active 30 days later. Everything else is noise that feels good.",

The answer-first formatting is something I've been testing heavily over the last few months and the results are real.\n\nWe track where our traffic comes from for a few service business clients, and what jumped out is that about 30% of their organic visibility now comes from AI-generated answers and featured snippets rather than traditional blue links. That number was closer to 12% a year ago.\n\nThe topic cluster approach you mentioned is huge. We rebuilt one client's entire blog from individual keyword-targeted posts into proper pillar structures - maybe 40 articles consolidated into 8 clusters. Organic traffic dipped for about 3 weeks then came back 2.2x stronger. The key was aggressive internal linking and making sure each cluster had a genuinely comprehensive pillar page, not just a thin overview.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: structured data markup is becoming way more important for AI scraping. FAQ schema, HowTo schema, even just clean heading hierarchies. We saw a noticeable uptick in AI Overview citations after implementing proper schema across a client's service pages.\n\nThe E-E-A-T piece is the one most people underestimate though. We started putting real author bios with verifiable credentials on every piece of content and it made a measurable difference in rankings within about 6 weeks.

Saw a 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook browsers are way lower than Safari, that's your hidden leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

          "text": "The \"everyone congratulating us while we were dying\" part is so painfully accurate. We had a smaller version of this. Got about 600 signups from a single Reddit post that blew up. Team was pumped. Two weeks later our DAU was actually lower than before because the infrastructure costs ate into our runway and we'd shifted focus from building for existing users to onboarding new ones.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about launch spikes is the support load. Those 2000 signups probably generated what, 300-400 support tickets in the first week? And most of them are from tire-kickers who will never convert, but you can't tell which ones are which so you have to respond to all of them. Meanwhile your actual power users who were there before the spike are getting slower response times and worse experience.\n\nI think the real lesson here is that launch readiness has nothing to do with the product being ready. It's about having the retention infrastructure ready. Do you have an onboarding sequence that works without hand-holding? Do you have a clear activation metric that you know correlates with retention? Do you have automated support for the top 10 questions?\n\nIf the answer to any of those is no, a big launch will actively hurt you because you're creating first impressions at scale and those first impressions are bad ones.\n\nThe Tuesday at 3pm test is perfect honestly. That should be the standard before anyone even considers a big launch push.",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from Rebelgrowth\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

I wasted a lot of time tweaking audience parameters when the real lever was always the ad itself.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add from my own experience — the $9 first month approach works great for getting people in the door, but watch out for the month 2 drop-off. When the price jumps from $9 to $97, you need the product experience in that first month to be really strong. I've seen founders do this successfully by having an automated \"win\" moment within the first 48 hours — something that makes the user feel like they've already gotten value.\n\n\n\nAlso curious about your churn numbers on the $97 plan specifically. Are most people who make it past month 2 sticking around, or is there another drop-off point?",

No front page domination. Just a handful of people engaging and a few thoughtful comments.\n\nBut here’s the part that caught me off guard:\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the App Store charts… and right now it’s sitting at **#142 in its category in Germany**.\n\nThree hours in.\n\nI genuinely didn’t expect to see a ranking at all. I always assumed those charts were reserved for companies with marketing budgets and coordinated launches. Seeing my tiny, self-funded app show up there — even at #142 — feels surreal.\n\nWhat’s wild is realizing how small the early momentum actually is. It doesn’t take thousands of downloads to start moving the needle when you’re starting from zero. A bit of visibility, a few shares, some organic installs… and suddenly you’re “on the chart.”\n\nThe launch is still happening. I’m still refreshing everything way too often. I have no idea where it’ll end up by tonight — it might climb, it might disappear.\n\nBut right now, three hours after launching, something I built is ranking in the App Store.

I have tried reaching out to freelancers and they charge crazy money for these videos and I am always short of time and can't make one myself.

At first, it seems very difficult to create such videos yourself.\nFor the video, we used several different tools:\nFor the voice-over and some sound effects, I used ElevenLabs. I chose the $20 plan, and the included token amount was completely sufficient.\nFor the phone mockups, we used Canva and added a matching background. The subscription costs around $15.\nThe video itself and most of the effects were edited in CapCut. Depending on your needs, you might consider upgrading to the premium plan.\nOf course, you need to familiarize yourself with different tools first, but they are relatively intuitive and offer plenty of options for beginners.",

The next 48 hours matter more than launch day: watch what keywords drove installs, what screenshots got the most engagement, where people drop off in onboarding.\n\n\n\nIf you're self-funded with no list, the real game is turning those first few users into your distribution engine.

          "text": "Congrats on shipping. The hardest part is always closing the editor and actually pressing publish, and you did that without an audience or a safety net. That takes guts.\n\nThe #142 thing is a great insight that most people miss. App Store charts in smaller categories aren't the impossible mountain everyone imagines. A handful of installs in a short window can move you up fast because most apps in any given category are basically dead. You're not competing against thousands of active competitors, you're competing against a graveyard of abandoned projects. That's good news for you.\n\nOne thing I'd think about now while you still have fresh launch energy: screenshot everything. Your Product Hunt comments, your chart position, your first few reviews. Six months from now when you're grinding through a slow week, those screenshots are rocket fuel. You'll forget how today felt. Don't let yourself.\n\nAlso since you mentioned no email list and no ads, the next 48 hours matter more than you think. Product Hunt traffic has a very short half-life. If there's any way to capture emails from people who land on your page but don't download yet (a simple landing page, a waitlist for upcoming features, anything), do it today. That traffic won't come back on its own.\n\nChecked out the App Store link. Kids stories with AI is a space that's heating up fast so your timing is solid. Curious what made you pick that niche. Do you have kids yourself or did you spot a gap from the outside?\n\nEither way, stop refreshing and go enjoy the fact that you shipped something real. The stats will still be there tomorrow.",

I’ve been so focused on shipping that I haven’t fully optimized for capturing traffic yet — definitely something I’ll act on now.\n\nAs for the niche: one of my co-founder’s moms works in a kindergarten and originally came up with the idea. She sees how stressed parents are and how powerful stories can be for teaching values. We also loved the idea of kids drawing their own characters and seeing them come alive in stories — that emotional connection is huge.\n\nAnd yes… I’ll try to stop refreshing now 😅",

That’s why we’re leaning heavily into personalization — letting kids create their own characters and see them evolve across stories.\n\nWe’re also planning themed story packs, small learning arcs (values, emotions, etc.), and giving parents reasons to return with new content regularly. The launch is exciting, but long-term this only works if kids ask for it again the next night.\n\nOpen to any retention tips you’ve seen work well in kids apps — always learning.",

      "text": "I have a SaaS,[ rebelgrowth](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit), doing around $321k ARR. On paper, things are great. In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

Revenue doesn’t automatically relieve pressure; sometimes it amplifies it because there’s now more to maintain and more at stake.\n\nI haven’t been at your exact number solo, but I’ve hit that “I am the system” phase before. The biggest shift for me wasn’t finding a co-founder immediately, but it was buying back my time in very unsexy ways. First support contractor. Then someone part-time for ops. Even 10–15 hours a week off your plate changes your mental state. You don’t need a visionary partner first. You might need oxygen.\n\nOn the YC point, I don’t think it’s crazy, but I’d be careful about using YC primarily as a co-founder matching service. A partner found under pressure can solve burnout short-term but create misalignment long-term. If you do look for one, optimize for values, working style, and stress compatibility, not just skill gap.\n\nAnd on burnout… momentum isn’t just about pushing harder. Sometimes it’s about redesigning the machine so it doesn’t require you to be the engine. You’ve proven the product works. Now the real work is building a structure where it works without you carrying it every day.",

If the main need is mental load sharing, a high-agency ops hire + clear ownership can get you 70% of the benefit with way less risk.\n\nCurious: what’s actually crushing you right now — support volume, incidents, sales calls, or just context switching?",

Hire a primary engineer if you're not a high level engineer, hire a sales person if you don't do well in sales, hire a support team if you're struggling there. Having a backup in case something happens to you is the biggest thing the financial people are looking for wine they say you need a co-founder. The good thing is that you probably have a lot of margin to work with at that ARR so you can make a mistake and it won't hurt too bad.  \n\nYou may also want to look into some VC funding and accelerate growth at that point. Then you can get their expertise too. Find other SaaS providers in your industry too and get their advice.

Hire for your specific bottleneck, not a general role** - At this ARR you can't hire a team, but you can hire ONE person who removes your top constraint. If it's support volume, hire for that specifically. If it's sales follow-up, hire for that. Don't hire a \"general VA\" - hire to eliminate your #1 time drain.\n\nThe burnout often isn't the volume of work - it's doing too many context switches between wildly different types of work.

That's genuinely impressive, and the fact that you recognize the burnout pattern before it breaks you is a good sign.\n\nI run a dev company and I've seen this exact inflection point with a few founders we work with. The common mistake is jumping straight to \"I need a cofounder\" when the real problem is \"I need to stop doing three jobs poorly instead of one job well.\"\n\nWhat worked for the ones who got through it:\n\n1. Audit your week honestly. Track where your hours actually go for 7 days. Most solo founders discover they're spending 40-60% of their time on support and ops, not building.\n\n2. Hire for the role you hate most, not the one you think sounds strategic. If support is eating you alive, a senior support person who can also do light QA will give you back 20+ hours a week overnight.\n\n3. Skip the cofounder search at this stage. At k ARR you have leverage. You can hire a strong operator or a fractional COO/CTO without giving up equity. A cofounder made sense at zero revenue. At k, what you need is a great first hire.\n\n4. YC is great, but using it primarily to find a cofounder when you already have product-market fit and real revenue feels like using a sledgehammer for a nail. Their value is in network and scaling advice, not matchmaking.\n\nThe burnout you're feeling isn't from lack of a partner. It's from lack of leverage. One great hire changes everything.",

Finding a co‑founder after traction is absolutely possible.  \nPeople love to say “you need a co‑founder from day one,” but the truth is:  \nRevenue is the strongest filter for aligned partners.  \nPlenty of operators, technical leads, and ex‑founders would join a proven product over a pre‑idea gamble.\n\n3. YC isn’t crazy, but it’s not the only path.  \nYC gives you a network, accountability, and potential co‑founders, but you’d be giving up equity for something you may be able to solve with:  \n- a senior engineer  \n- a fractional CTO  \n- a support lead  \n- or a true operations partner  \n\n4. The real question is: what kind of help do you actually need?  \nA co‑founder solves emotional load and strategic load.  \nA hire solves operational load.  \nBurnout usually comes from the second one.\n\n5.

A co-founder found under pressure rarely works out the same as one built through shared conviction. What worked better for me was finding senior contractors who could eventually transition into equity partners once we'd proven we work well together.\n\nAnd on burnout specifically — at $321k ARR you can absolutely afford to buy back 10-15 hours a week.

YC just to find one feels expensive. Burnout usually means the company depends too much on you. Redesign for sustainability, not more grind.",

          "text": "$321k solo is genuinely impressive. The burnout at this stage is real though and it's a specific kind of burnout that people without SaaS experience don't understand.\n\n  \nIt's not \"I'm working too many hours\" burnout. It's \"every customer conversation is potentially the most important thing I should be paying attention to but I don't have the bandwidth to actually process it\" burnout. You're answering support tickets but half your brain is thinking about the feature you should be building. You're building the feature but you keep getting interrupted by support. Neither gets your full attention.\n\n  \nThe thing that helped me was separating \"answering the customer\" from \"learning from the customer.\" Answering is reactive and urgent. Learning is where the real product insights come from - the patterns across conversations, the things multiple people are struggling with. Most solo founders at your stage are doing the first part fine and completely ignoring the second because who has time.\n\n  \nDon't bring in a co-founder just to share the load. That creates a whole new set of problems. Hire for the most repetitive stuff first and protect your time for the parts that actually require your brain.",

For what it's worth, I think hiring senior people makes more sense than hunting for a cofounder at this stage.\n\nYou've already de-risked the business significantly, so you can actually attract good operators now. A cofounder split at this point gets messy with valuation and equity expectations. Better to bring on a strong VP of Ops or Product Manager who can take entire functions off your plate.\n\nOn the burnout side, one thing that helped people I know is getting clarity on the financial side first so you can make confident hiring decisions without second-guessing every dollar. I came across AsteroCFO. Ai (https://asterocfo .ai) recently and their Hybrid CFO plan seems built for this exact situation. You get AI-powered insights daily plus a monthly call with an actual CFO for like $597, which is way less than a fractional CFO.\n\nHaving someone help you model out hires and runway might take some of teh pressure off before you pull the trigger on bringing people on.",

Like for growth/acquisition you don’t necessarily need a co-founder, you could delegate that to freelancers or small agencies who handle it end to end. Same for support, there’s solid options out there now.\nSometimes the answer isn’t finding a partner, it’s just stopping doing everything yourself.

              "text": "**you're entering the most well established \"alternative to\" category in all of saas.** plausible, fathom, umami, simple analytics, pirsch, [counter.dev](http://counter.dev), goatcounter, matomo. this space has been fought over for years. plausible alone has thousands of paying customers and is fully open source. fathom has been around since 2018. every single one of them says the exact same thing you're saying: privacy focused, no cookies, gdpr compliant, simple dashboard. word for word. so what makes gdprmetrics different? because after looking at your page i genuinely cannot tell.\n\n**the name \"gdprmetrics\" is both your biggest strength and biggest weakness.** strength: its extremely clear what this is and it probably has decent seo potential for people googling \"gdpr analytics\" or \"gdpr compliant metrics.\" weakness: it sounds like a compliance tool, not a product people get excited about. plausible sounds fresh. fathom sounds smart. gdprmetrics sounds like a government form. branding matters in a crowded space and this name makes you forgettable.\n\n**the design is clean but the gold/brown color scheme is an unusual choice.** not necessarily bad but it feels more like a law firm website than a developer tool. your target audience is indie hackers and saas builders who are used to modern dark mode dashboards with crisp blues and purples. the beige and gold aesthetic creates a subtle disconnect with who you're trying to attract. small thing but design signals matter when you're competing against polished products like plausible and fathom.\n\n**\"get started in 3 simple steps\" is fine but everyone has this.** sign up, add code, analyze. thats literally the onboarding flow of every analytics tool ever made. its not a differentiator, its table stakes. replace this section with something that shows why youre different. maybe its cheaper than plausible? maybe you have a feature they dont? maybe the dashboard is simpler? whatever it is, put THAT front and center instead of a generic onboarding diagram.\n\n**the live statistics preview showing 1.2k visitors is smart.** showing real data on the landing page gives people a feel for the dashboard. but is that your actual data or demo data? if its real, say so. \"this is our actual live traffic right now\" is a flex that builds trust. if its fake, people will wonder.\n\n**where you could win: price.** plausible starts at $9/mo, fathom at $14/mo. if you can undercut them meaningfully, like $3 to $5/mo or even a generous free tier, thats a real wedge for indie hackers who are watching every dollar. the \"analytics for indie hackers\" angle works but only if the price matches the audience. indie hackers will use umami for free and self host before they pay $9/mo for something that does the same thing.\n\n**your distribution should be comparison content and nothing else right now.** write \"gdprmetrics vs plausible\" \"gdprmetrics vs fathom\" \"gdprmetrics vs umami\" blog posts. people actively search for these comparisons. also post in r/selfhosted, r/webdev, r/indiehackers, r/saas, r/privacy. the privacy focused analytics crowd is vocal and active in these communities. but you need to lead with what you do differently, not just \"we also exist.\"\n\nthe space is crowded, the product looks competent, but theres no clear reason to pick you over plausible or fathom. find your wedge, whether thats price, a unique feature, or a specific audience, and make that the entire identity of the product. \"another privacy analytics tool\" is not a positioning strategy.",

SMB buyers want to know if they can afford you before investing 30 minutes in a call. even a \"starts at $X/month\" or a pricing tier page would reduce drop off massively. if you have a pricing page its not linked prominently enough.\n\n**your competitor landscape is weird and you need to own that.** youre not competing against deel or remote (EOR). youre not competing against quickbooks (accounting). youre competing against spreadsheets, email chains, and \"the finance person who manually builds SEPA files every month.\" your real enemy is the status quo. make that explicit. \"youre currently doing this in excel and email. heres why that breaks at 20+ contractors.\"\n\n**zero social proof on the page.** no customer logos, no testimonials, no \"trusted by X finance teams.\" for a product that handles money and compliance, trust is everything. even three early customers with logos would transform conversion. if youre pre revenue, get design partners and feature their logos with permission.\n\n**the name nectorpay implies you move money and you dont.** \"pay\" in the name sets an expectation that you process payments. you generate bank files. thats an important distinction that will confuse buyers and create support tickets. your page handles this well with the disclaimers but the name will always fight you on first impression.\n\n**distribution: this is a linkedin and content play, not reddit.** your buyers are heads of finance, finance ops managers, and controllers at companies with 20 to 200 contractors. theyre on linkedin. write content about contractor payment compliance, SEPA file formatting nightmares, audit readiness for contractor spend. partner with accounting firms and bookkeepers who deal with this mess for their clients. get listed in xero and quickbooks app marketplaces. target \"how to pay contractors in \\[country\\]\" for seo across every country you support.\n\nbest positioning and landing page structure ive seen today. your challenge is pure distribution and awareness. nobody knows this category exists yet so you need to create the demand through content that speaks to the pain, not the solution. get some customer logos on that page and consider showing pricing to reduce the demo call friction for SMB buyers.\n\nlmk if you have any other questions",

In GhostVote, results are cryptographically locked until the timer ends. No one can see the trend, forcing 100% honest, independent answers.\n\nRegarding the privacy claims: It’s not just a marketing promise, it’s zero-knowledge architecture. We don't hold the keys to decrypt the votes. When the timer hits zero, the data is mathematically destroyed.

As well as a potential API for UK property market - possibly another revenue stream.\n\nRevenue model: Tiered subscriptions unlocking additional features and analytics, services subscription/featured boosts, possible API.\n\nI’m mainly looking for early-stage marketing ideas: \n• how to attract initial homeowners listing locally\n• how to onboard service providers to advertise \n• and generally how to reach marketplace liquidity without agents",

The pattern we noticed is that LLMs heavily favor pages with clear structured data (schema markup, FAQ sections, comparison tables) over generic blog posts, even if the generic posts rank higher on traditional Google.\n\nThe reason is that LLMs are essentially doing extractive summarization. They need clean, structured information they can confidently attribute. A well-organized comparison page with clear data points gets cited way more than a 3,000-word thought leadership piece that meanders.\n\nThe other thing people miss: Reddit threads genuinely influence AI citations more than most realize. ChatGPT and Claude both pull heavily from Reddit because it represents \"real user consensus\" in their training data. So being genuinely helpful in relevant threads (not spamming) actually compounds over time.\n\nBut yeah, the core point stands. There's no shortcut.

Her dad said no.\n\nThe dad who does the books for their group of companies is secretly the behind the scenes influence.\n\nSo I finally had the meeting. A lot of you told me to get a number out of them before agreeing to anything. I did.\n\nTheir offer: $90,000 over 18 months. Plus 10% equity.\n\nFuck that.\n\nLet that sit for a second. I came up with the idea. I wrote the grant application that got us $300K in government funding. I’m the only developer. And their offer is $5,000 a month and a 10% slice of something that doesn’t exist without me.\n\nWhen I heard the number I didn’t react because of all the Chris’s Voss stuff I read over the years. . I just asked “how am I supposed to make that work?” And got the same “think bigger picture” line from the dad. The dad, by the way, is not a founder. Not an owner. He’s the CEO’s father and the company accountant.\n\nHere’s the part that really got me. The CEO - who actually owns 50% of the company - said “what if we met in the middle?” Which honestly? Reasonable.\n\nHer dad said no.\n\nThe person who actually has decision-making authority in this company tried to compromise, and a non-owner shut it down. In front of everyone.\n\nSo after the meeting I went through their full proposed investment agreement line by line. And I found some things:\n\n∙\tThe dad wants 20k for doing financial work pertaining to the project but the grant agreement explicitly prohibits payments to related persons.\n\n∙\tThe hourly rates the dad proposed for the two cofounders was 50k each. Doing maybe 5-10 hours of work per month. They’d be making 5-7x my rate per hour. For non-technical work. On a technology project. While I’m the one delivering every single milestone.\n\nAnd the grant clause states that paid labour must be aligned with reasonable market rates and can only be paid if the work is for the milestones.\n\nI left the meeting so I can chat with my lawyer (hired someone on retainer) and get the facts before going into another meeting.\n\nI really went into everything in good faith because the CEO is a good friend. The dad is fucking everything up.\n\nAnyways. I booked another negotiation meeting next week.\n\nMy strategy is to present the grant compliance issues first for leverage because related persons can’t get paid.\n\nAnd the founders can’t get paid 50k each for maybe 5-10 hours a month. That would put their hourly rate at 250-over 500 dollars per hour.\n\nThat’s would be above reasonable rates and directly conflict and would cause a red flag on how paying them 500 dollars per hour would contribute to the milestones.\n\nThat’s not ok.\n\nI am decently connected in the tech space in my local area. I can easily shop this around and get funding elsewhere cause I’ve already proved this is a validated product.\n\nI ain’t no bitch so I’m gonna try to work things out one more time.\n\nIf they come back reasonable, great. I want this to work. But if the dad shuts it down again, I’m out. I control the code. I have other opportunities. And a validated product.\n\nEven if they found someone after me to build it. They won’t be fast enough and the other person would demand market pay for to do it right.\n\nI’m here just ranting cause I obviously feel alone and fighting a battle by myself.   Appreciate any further insight y’all have.",

Screenshot the grant terms, save the proposed agreement with the inflated rates, and keep written records of who said what. If this goes sideways, you want a paper trail that shows you flagged compliance issues in good faith.\n\nAlso worth considering — even if you work things out, the dad situation doesn't go away.

I understand your position and I weighed the options. Considering I don’t own anything and not getting the fair rate for my work which is building the product and getting the grant AND that grant will fail because we are not complying their rules by paying relatives and also from over the market rates… this business will fail and I don’t want to be part of it. As I came up with the idea and built the product all by myself and I did the work for the grant, I can do the same thing alone with complete ownership or at least help a business which can comply with the grant requirements and pay me what I deserve. I followed your dad’s advice and “the bigger picture” lead me to this conclusion. I didn’t wanted this meeting to negotiate but to illustrate how things look right now. Choice is yours to comply with grant requirements and to pay me what I deserve by creating this company from scratch, or I’m out.”\n\nYou have to stop thinking this as being “a bitch”, what they’ve been doing all along is treat you as one. And because you didn’t ask for what you are owed, they are trying to run you down more. This won’t be selling your friend out or leaving them out in the open, if anything this will be the most eye opening experience for them to save this business whether you stay or leave. CEO is not your friend, even if he is you are not a priority; otherwise he would dealt with this situation more gracefully. They don’t value your work and they will find a way to get rid of you even if they offer you more now. His dad will create a hell of a situation for everyone if they “cave in”. He doesn’t want you, or at least he doesn’t want you to get paid fairly for your efforts. And everyone else thinks this is acceptable.\n\nAnd just look for a new job, I guarantee that there is no future there for you (or anybody for that matter, maybe except for the dad for the time being when he is sucking all the grant budget for himself).",

If they're squeezing you now when they need you most, imagine what happens after the product launches and they feel like they have leverage.\n\nA few things I'd consider:\n\nThe $300K grant is attached to a legal entity they control. That's your biggest risk. If you walk, figure out whether the IP and grant obligations follow you or them. Get a lawyer to review this before making any moves.\n\nIf the product doesn't exist without you, then your negotiating position is stronger than you think. But only if you're genuinely willing to walk. If they sense you won't leave, the offer won't improve.\n\n10% equity in an early-stage startup where you're the sole technical founder is insulting. Standard for a technical co-founder is 30-50%, especially when you originated the idea and secured funding.\n\nI've seen this dynamic play out multiple times with non-technical co-founders. The ones who respect their technical partners build great companies. The ones who don't, well, the technical person always leaves eventually. Better to leave on your terms than theirs.",

Both things are true, and if you are a signator of the grant, you have a fiduciary responsibility to let the grant making organization know. Have your lawyer draft the document to keep it above board. \n\nIt's possible you can also prohibit them from using the idea and any of your contributions to the original grant - if not based on your non-participation, then for intentional grant fraud and grantee malfeasance (i.e. the father trying to get money when the grant prohibits it,  non-payment of market rates, non-milestone based payment, etc). \n\nNow that I've typed that out, there is a whole bunch of problems here, including:\n\n- Misuse of funds\n- Deliberate misconduct \n- Noncompliance and willfull neglect \n\nGrants with the government are serious business.

We’ve been working on a lightweight hybrid model that basically runs on the same compute power needed for simple facial recognition.\n\nThe result:\n\n\\- Latency is near real-time (feels like a Zoom call).\n\n\\- Costs are finally down to standard text-chat levels (think Intercom pricing, not AWS GPU pricing).\n\n\\- It runs on mobile without killing the battery.\n\nWe're calling it Ieasysell.\n\nTechnically, the stack works. But now I need to figure out if this actually moves the needle on sales or if it's just a cool gimmick. I want to see if replacing the static \"chat bubble\" with a reactive face actually stops people from bouncing.\n\nIf anyone here has a site with decent traffic and wants to be a guinea pig:\n\nI’m letting people test it for free right now (usually a 1-month trial, but I'll extend it for feedback).  \n\nthe beta is open here:   https://www.ieasysell.com/en/\n\nSetup is just one line of code.\n\nDrop a comment or DM if you want to try it.

Yes, it's pesky, and social media is flooded with it, but it works.\n\nGet people to comment to trigger engagement signal to the algo then send them a guide in the comments.\n\nThe guide gives value + teaches how to automate the thing I'm teaching [with my SaaS](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)\n\nWe automatically write the guide targeting high buying intent keywords using rebelgrowth which also creates the linkedin post based on the automatically generated guide\n\nThe post itself follows a simple formula: Hook + Problem Agitation + Hint Solution + CTA (comment to get guide)\n\nUse a scroll stopping image for the post, something weird that makes people go \"wtf?\"\n\nTo anyone who comments, reply directly with the guide (this part is the boring time consuming part)...more comments, more engagement, more reach\n\nThen everyday I connect with 20 high intent leads, I look for people engaging with my competitors or with overlapping brands or that have recently raised money or changed job position for decision making roles or that have typed my high-intent keywords\n\nI also send DMs to people who have accepted my connection request the day prior, the DM is simple and non salesy, I just want to build rapport with people so when they see my posts, they engage. I send more salesy DMs to people who comment or like my posts.\n\nThat's it. Takes a couple hours per day but it converts very well.\n\nHave you tried something like this?",

A few tactical patterns that work:\n\n**Job change signals** - New VP Eng at target company = budget reset + tool evaluation window. Set up alerts for role changes in your ICP companies (Sales Nav or scrapers). Outreach window is weeks 2-8 (past onboarding chaos, before locked into inherited stack).\n\n**Hiring velocity** - Company goes from 2 to 8 backend engineer openings = scaling pain incoming. They need your infra/dev tools in 30-60 days. Job posting data is public gold.\n\n**Problem confession posts** - Engineers complaining about CI times, flaky tests, deploy anxiety. If your product solves it, reply with tactical advice first (free value), then \"we built X because we had this exact problem\" as closer. Zero pitch in the advice part.\n\n**Event attendance** - Speaking at/attending conferences signals active evaluation mode. People research solutions right after seeing talks about problems. Track conference hashtags + attendee lists.\n\nThe key is *timing + specificity*. Generic \"we help companies scale\" gets ignored. \"Saw you just joined as Head of Platform—congrats! Curious how you're thinking about observability as you inherit the stack\" opens doors.\n\nWhat intent signals are you tracking?",

It breaks your question into multiple specific searches.\n\n\n\nTry it yourself - ask \"best project management tools\"\n\n\n\nYou think it searches for \"best project management tools\"?\n\n\n\nNope. It searches:\n\n\\- \"project management software comparison 2026\"\n\n\\- \"free PM tools for small teams\"\n\n\\- \"Asana vs Monday vs ClickUp\"\n\n\\- \"project management tools under $50\"\n\n\n\nWhy This is Interesting:\n\n\n\nIf you're creating content and want it to show up in ChatGPT's answers, you need to know these sub-queries exist.\n\n\n\nSo I Built a Tool:\n\n\n\nIt's a free Chrome extension that captures every query ChatGPT runs in real-time.\n\n\n\nInstall it, ask ChatGPT anything, and it shows you:\n\n\\- All the sub-queries it generated\n\n\\- Which websites it pulled from\n\n\\- The exact sources used\n\n\n\nSome Cool Patterns I've Noticed:\n\n\n\n\\- Comparison questions generate 5-7 sub-queries\n\n\\- \"Latest\" or \"best\" questions trigger web search more often\n\n\\- ChatGPT uses Bing for search (it's a Microsoft product)\n\n\\- Tables and FAQs get cited way more than paragraphs\n\n\n\nIt's Completely Free:\n\n\n\nNo premium tier, no upsell. Just wanted this to exist.\n\n\n\nChrome Store: Search \"ChatGPT Query Insight\"\n\n  \nExtension Link : [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-query-insights-ai/knnmhmhmckepgcgfmclibjhkhjikifkb?utm\\_source=item-share-cb&pli=1](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-query-insights-ai/knnmhmhmckepgcgfmclibjhkhjikifkb?utm_source=item-share-cb&pli=1)\n\n\n\nCurious What You'll Find:\n\n\n\nIf you try it, drop what patterns you notice. I'm collecting data and the more users test it, the more we learn.\n\n\n\nAlso building versions for Claude and Perplexity if there's interest.\n\n\n\nThoughts?",

No Product Hunt launch. No Twitter. His users are on LinkedIn, so he sold on LinkedIn. Simple but most founders default to PH or HN.\n\nHard paywall from day 1. No freemium. His logic: if people pay, the product is validated. If they don't, move on fast. No months wasted on a free tier.\n\nHe hit €16k/month with just 2 products solving the same core problem (LinkedIn growth) for the same audience. No pivot, no new market. Just depth in one niche.\n\nStack : Next.js, Supabase, Stripe. Total infra cost \\~€50/month. No complex architecture.\n\nDistribution was 100% his own LinkedIn content. He posted daily about LinkedIn growth tips (not about his products). His audience was already his ICP so every post was indirect marketing.\n\nI interviewed him for about an hour and broke down his full funnel, pricing decisions, and mistakes.\n\nCurious what approach others here have taken, hard paywall vs freemium for micro-SaaS at launch ?",

So when they see a solution, the friction to pay is low.\n\nFor products where the problem is less urgent or where users need to \"discover\" the value, freemium probably wins. The key question is : does your ICP already know they have the problem?\n\nOn his LinkedIn strategy, that's actually the most interesting part of the whole case. He never posted about his tools. He posted LinkedIn growth tips (algorithm hacks, engagement strategies, profile optimization). His audience was people who wanted to grow on LinkedIn. His product helps people grow on LinkedIn.

At \\~€50/month overhead, he only needed like 5-6 customers to be profitable. That changes the math completely vs a SaaS burning $2k/month on servers.\n\nFreemium makes more sense when your acquisition is cold traffic (SEO, ads, app stores) because there's no pre-existing trust. The free tier's job is basically to build the trust that his LinkedIn content was already doing organically.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot is people defaulting to freemium because \"that's what everyone does\" without asking whether their distribution channel already handles the trust-building part. If it does, freemium just adds support overhead and delays validation.",

Seriously.\n\nThe \"your content IS the free trial\" insight is exactly what Yannis did without even theorizing about it. He just intuitively understood that if someone watches 20 of his LinkedIn posts about growth hacks, by the time they see Linkhub, the trust is already built. The product page isn't doing the convincing — 3 months of free content already did.\n\nYour cost structure point is key too. At €50/month infra, his break-even is basically 2 customers. That removes all the pressure that pushes founders toward freemium out of desperation. Most people choose freemium not as a strategy but as a fear response, \"what if nobody pays ?\" When your burn is near zero, you can afford to find out.\n\nI'd add one nuance from his case : he also used the hard paywall as a filter. The people who paid on day 1 were his most engaged users, the ones who gave the best feedback, reported bugs fastest, and became word-of-mouth advocates. A free tier would have diluted that signal with casual users who never really needed the product.\n\nI actually analyzed another founder recently : 248k followers, launching a SaaS, who took the opposite approach. Freemium V1, paid later. Completely different logic but equally valid given his distribution. That case study drops Monday if you want to compare the two strategies.\n\n",

The main upside isn’t revenue, it’s clarity: you instantly see if you’ve nailed a specific pain, pricing, and message. If no one pays, you tweak the offer or kill it fast instead of dragging a zombie product with 300 free users and zero signal.\n\n\n\nWhat’s worked for me is: waitlist → cheap “founding plan” → then proper monthly pricing. Keep it simple: one main plan, annual option, and a 7-day money-back guarantee instead of a freemium tier. That gives people a safety net without training them to expect free.\n\n\n\nFreemium makes more sense when there’s network effect, viral loops, or clear in-product upgrade triggers; most micro-SaaS don’t have that. For discovery, I’ve leaned on things like Phantombuster and Taplio for LinkedIn, plus Pulse for Reddit to catch threads where my exact ICP hangs out and join in with actual examples, not spray-and-pray cold outreach.\n\n\n\nSo yeah: for micro-SaaS, paid from day one with a soft refund > classic freemium.",

Yannis (the founder) literally never launched on Product Hunt. Zero. His logic was simple: my users spend 2 hours a day on LinkedIn, they spend 0 minutes on PH. Why would I launch where they're not?\n\nOn the paywall, exactly right. His ICP is people already paying for LinkedIn Premium, Sales Navigator, outreach tools. Adding €30/month for a commenting tool is a no-brainer for them. Totally different story if you're selling to consumers or students.\n\nThe infra cost thing is actually crazier than it looks. €50/month infra, and he built everything himself as a solo dev. No team. No designer. No cofounder. So his margins are essentially 99%. That's the micro-SaaS dream right there.\n\nOn churn : honestly, that's been his biggest challenge. Linkhub did have real churn issues. LinkedIn tools are fragile by nature, one API change and things break. He's been transparent about that. His answer was building LinkPost (content creation) as a second product for the same audience. So instead of relying on one tool, he diversified his revenue across two products serving the same ICP. Smart hedge.\n\nBut yeah, churn on LinkedIn tools is a real thing and anyone building in that space should plan for it.\n\nI wrote a deeper dive on his full acquisition funnel (how he converts LinkedIn followers → paying users step by step) if that's something you'd want to read.",

      "text": "I don't think any market is as saturated as the social media scheduler market. There are thousands of them, most die within a week or are stuck at 1k-3k MRR. **I managed to get mine to 20k - without having an audience.**\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022288626772770816)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022197853545017345)\n\n\n\n# The hard stuff (prologue)\n\nThe concept of a social media scheduler is simple: you connect your social media channels and then post (or cross-post) to all platforms at the same time.\n\nThere are a few dominators in this market, like Hootsuite and Buffer (making around $2m per month). You can't win against those beasts by offering the same thing; you must be super innovative and serve underserved markets.\n\nBut even if you do, you will see a lot of churn, because once users stop posting, they cancel their subscriptions.\n\nEven today, Postiz has 17% churn (which is enormous for SaaS tools), so this month it will lose $3,400 in paid subscriptions.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022288440763772928)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022200012407787520)\n\n# Starting in open-source\n\nPostiz started (and still) an open-source social media scheduling tool (26k stars), which means that all Postiz code is out (all of it)!\n\nBuilding everything in open-source been my mantra forever, especially in the world of AI, when everybody can copy your product, what does code even mean?\n\nThat made code less important, so to be transparent and reliable, I open-sourced everything and brought many developers into the app.\n\nDevelopers never paid me in cash, but they did contribute code, test the app, write about it in many places, and bring me to $3k in MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022289290533986304)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022202113372327936)\n\n# Stuck (until I discovered...)\n\nFor a few months, I was just stuck. I had the same MRR, but my customers changed frequently. There is a formula that you can use to calculate your [Max MRR](https://longform.asmartbear.com/max-mrr/)\n\nAccording to the amount of subscriptions you bring in every month and your churn, you can understand where you can be. And I was at a dead end.\n\nSo I started serving underserved audiences and added tons of channels to Postiz. While most schedulers have 11 channels, Postiz has 30.\n\nI started to serve:\n\n* Web3 users\n* Reddit users\n* Education users (Skool / Whop)\n* Chat users (Discord / Slack / Telegram / Whop / Twitch)\n\nThat opened up my market for a higher acquisition and offered a solution that doesn't exist anywhere else.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022204000805040128)\n\nAnd so, I got to $7k MRR (grinding my ass off) but got stuck again.  \nUntil I saw an interesting YouTube video - \"How to create viral reels on TikTok using Postiz and N8N\", the video was not selling Postiz as a tool, but selling Postiz as a part of an automated funnel.\n\nPeople take these n8n templates that do a lot of stuff:\n\n* Generate a video with veo3\n* Generate a cover picture\n* Put sound in\n* Post it using Postiz\n\nPostiz was just the last step to help you post to social media. And the workflow was automated, which means we don't need users to schedule their own posts, and that means much, much lower churn.\n\nSo it opened it up to automation people, and then OpenClaw opened it upto everybody.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022205767198420995)\n\n# Always run hypes - ALWAYS\n\nFor me hypes a sort of big marketing push to get a surge of trials and subscriptions - they can be long-term, they can be short-term, but they give you big jumps.\n\n* N8N had an incredible 2025, and I rode that hype like crazy.\n* MCP was also super incredible in 2025, so I ran fast, made a chat agent for Postiz and MCP that you can connect to your LLM, and launched it on Product Hunt.\n* [TrustMRR](https://x.com/@TrustMRR)  was booming like crazy, I listed Postiz there, got tons of traffic, and also got contacted by  [starter\\_story](https://x.com/@starter_story)   [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPM4ImzcIFc) .\n* [openclaw](https://x.com/@openclaw)  still going on - it's the biggest one. At the moment they announced it, I went to Clawhub and published a skill.\n* [moltbook](https://x.com/@moltbook)  \\- I created a social media channel in Postiz for it 😂\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022289671976529920)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022207786478972929)\n\n# Playbook (marketing) 💰\n\nNow that you understand my direction, I will describe my entire marketing funnel. Feel free to copy!\n\n1. Open-source - This is how I build every product. I make my [README.md](https://readme.md/) super compelling, add issues, make kick-ass docs, and start publishing it on Reddit r/selfhosted and Lemmy /c/selfhosted. At the start, it brought me around 250k views; over time, it dropped to 25k, and the channel saw me again and again. Total self-promotion is very rare on Reddit, except for open-source projects. [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l68fi2/postiz_v1470_open_source_social_media_scheduling/), [Example #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1mhhs94/postiz_v225_opensource_social_media_scheduling/).\n\n2. Product Hunt - Every number of months, I publish Postiz on Product Hunt, and every time I send a request to [ProductHunt](https://x.com/@ProductHunt) to publish before 8 months, luckily, they usually approve me 🙏🏻  \n  \nI won every launch almost. The trick here is outreach.  \nIf you have no audience, the chances of you winning on Product Hunt are low, because even when people see your posts, they don't upvote.  \nAlso, Product Hunt doesn't count votes of new users to reduce cheaters, so to win, I understood that outreach is key - might seem gray sometimes, but that's the only option. So every launch I message people on.\n\n* Active Slack Groups with founders\n* LinkedIn connections\n* X connections\n* Telegram Product Hunt groups\n\nIt's harder to say \"no\" to you when you message people directly.\n\n3. SEO - Postiz currently has 70 DA, mostly thanks to open-source.  \nThis is a channel that takes a lot of time; it's not enough to create blog posts, you actually need to get valuable backlinks and be mentioned in many places.\n\n* Open Source Directories - There are some strong directories in GitHub you can list your project on, like: \" [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) \", \" [awesome-oss-alternatives](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) \" There are so many more; look for 'awesome' on GitHub.  \n* SaaS Directories - Like most founders, I started listing my application in every possible directory. It usually boosts your domain DA (it costs money, prepare for it) and lists it on platforms like  [UneedLists](https://x.com/@UneedLists) ,  [tinylaunch](https://x.com/@tinylaunch) ,  [theresanaiforit](https://x.com/@theresanaiforit)  (They also give you traffic.)  \n* Paid Directories (recurring) - This brings a lot of traffic, like  [ossalternative](https://x.com/@ossalternative) ,  [selfh.st](https://selfh.st/) . While it doesn't bring purchases, it brings a lot of traffic to the open-source and, of course, increases my DR.  \n* Using  [outrank\\_so](https://x.com/@outrank_so)  \\- It writes me one blog post a day and brings tons of backlinks to my articles. This is super useful; it's a little AI Sloppy, but it works.  \n* Outreach - I am working with multiple people who outreach to other founders about my SaaS and ask for ABC exchanges. It means I (website A) send a link to website B, and website C sends a link to website A. You can't just switch with people A <-> B; Google will mark you as spam.  \n* Free tools (pSeo) - if you have seen  [pbteja1998](https://x.com/@pbteja1998)   [starter story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adl5_lJfkEE)  He created many free tools on the website to drive traffic to himself. I did something similar, created a tool like \"font generator\" and duplicated it to all my socials like \"Instagram font generator\", \"Facebook font generator\", etc. This brings the most traffic per month, but not the most conversions.  \n\n3. Outreach - the previous company I sold was a LinkedIn outreach tool. I have seen people using it so spammy all the time, just sending you a connection request offering their services 🤢 I hated it, and I don't think it works. What I did was a little bit different.\n\nI understood that people are using n8n automation with Postiz, and luckily, they were easy to target. If you go to [Skool.com](https://skool.com/) You can see tons of N8N groups. So I went to Upwork and paid someone to lead-gen the groups (I know you can write your own scraping code or use OpenClaw today), but I didn't have it back then, and it's so cheap and fast.\n\nI asked the person from UpWork to get me a list of the group owners (name, group name, email). I bought a new domain \"getpostiz .com\" and warmed it with Lemwarm, then I started an outreach campaign with Lemlist. The reason that I bought a new domain is that I didn't want it to be marked as spam (in case somebody does it)\n\nI started to send people this email:\n\n[https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh](https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220443953115137)\n\nThe goal was not only to \"ask\" but also to give. I gave tons of free lifetime deals for Postiz.\n\nI saw tons of new YouTube videos about Postiz, and many new n8n templates with Postiz.\n\nAnd that month, I doubled my revenue from $6k MRR to $12k MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220789702086656)\n\n# Joined every possible community\n\nI joined so many communities that cost money, so I can socially interact with people, and here and there push Postiz, notable ones are:\n\n* Smallbets - by  [dvassallo](https://x.com/@dvassallo)  \n* Starter Story by  [thepatwalls](https://x.com/@thepatwalls)  \n* Growth Mentor by  [FotiPanagio](https://x.com/@FotiPanagio)\n* AI Thinkers by  [thekitze](https://x.com/@thekitze)  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022225357655748608)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* Start today - You might be excited about all the things AI can do, and the possibility of what you can build, but actually, everybody thinks that, and everybody is building. SaaS becomes easy to build but hard to sell. I believe that if I built Postiz around 2020, I would be 1m+ ARR. Don't wait, it will become harder.\n* Build a good product - In the end, your product must be flawless (no bugs), more bugs = more churn. UX build/break a SaaS. Each feature you ship can cause more bugs. So before you ship any feature, make sure you fix your product.\n* Don't price it low - Even today, some people say that Postiz is more expensive than Buffer. I don't compete on the price; I compete on value. The lower your price is, the less you can spend on paid marketing channels and stay cash flow positive. Let's take an example. Imagine that it costs you $20 to acquire one person. Still, your pricing starts at $9, it will take 3 months to return your money, in that time you will be cashflow negative, that's hard - you would have to shut down your acquisition channel and focus only on organic channels eventually. Not to talk about spikes in your server costs.\n* Measure, Measure, Measure - If you don't know what's going on with your SaaS (can't measure it), it will be harder for you to grow. I used a website analytics tool called [PlausibleHQ](https://x.com/@PlausibleHQ). I love it, super slick. But very quickly, I realized it's hard to really understand where your purchases come from, so I switched to [marclou](https://x.com/@marclou) and [DataFast\\_](https://x.com/@DataFast_) because I want to know which blog pages / free tools brought me X amount of money so I can double down on them.  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022221743080058882)\n\n* If something doesn't work (like churn), stop doing the same thing. You might improve by 1%-5 %, but the better option is to pivot.\n* Always think short term and long term: Long term - brand, SEO. Short term - Hypes, launches, social media.\n* Be transparent - reveal all your metrics: total subs, money, churn - it's good for marketing, but let's face it, most chances you are not building a deep tech company. More of an AI-driven API orchestrator? Thousands more people are building something like that. Being transparent can put you above the others.\n* Growth takes time. You can build a \"hypey\" product and get tons of traffic fast (maybe also fast churn), but real growth and a brand take time. If you kept your marketing and did something for a year+, you will see an exponential growth in your SaaS, because of \"brand\" and word-of-mouth.\n* Find \"high reward channels\" - I see people who are super eager to \"build in public\" on X. It's nice, but you can find channels that will bring you a lot more views, like Reddit and TikTok. Just because some people are nailing it doesn't mean you have to.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022224464705196032)\n\n\n\n# What's next for me?\n\nI want to take my churn to the next level - \"0%\". I launched a new service called \"Postiz as a service.\" You can basically use Postiz inside your SaaS without exposing it. Since this is an infrastructure tool, it can have almost no churn. It's part of another SaaS.\n\nThank you for reading it :)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/status/2022361200932315279)",

Turning a manual tool into infrastructure that runs in the background changes the entire retention dynamic. Users don't cancel things they forget they're paying for, especially when those things are quietly doing their job inside a workflow.\n\nThe open source play is interesting too. Most founders in saturated markets try to differentiate on features, which is a losing game against Hootsuite and Buffer. Building community and ecosystem around the product creates a moat that feature parity alone never will.\n\nCurious about the Slack communities strategy. How did you identify which ones had your target audience versus just other founders promoting their own stuff? That signal-to-noise ratio seems like the hardest part to get right.",

Like, instead of being a general scheduler, focusing on something like podcast promotion, TikTok growth for e-commerce, or even internal comms for remote teams can really help you stand out. It lets you build features that actually solve very specific pain points that general tools miss, and it's way easier to market to a hyper-targeted group. Just a thought!",
