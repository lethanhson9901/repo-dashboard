      "text": "I'm a PM at [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) now, but before this I was the founding engineer at a startup that sold for $15M in 18 months. Sharing bc I think this is relevant for founders here.\n\nThe founders had been running this playbook for years. One had 8 successful exits, the other had 3. When they hired me, they told me exactly how it would go. I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as they said.\n\nHere's the playbook:\n\n**Step 1: Pick a legacy industry (this is the most important step)**\n\nFind an industry as far from Silicon Valley as possible. The key criteria: customers and competitors should not be able to build anything themselves. Ideally, you or your co founder has domain expertise. If you don't, find a co founder who does\n\nWe sold to benefits brokers, the people who handle 401(k)s and HSAs. Other good verticals: oil and gas, medical SaaS, logistics, construction tech.\n\nWhat to avoid: anything where your customers are technical. Dev tools would be a terrible choice. If your buyer can look at your product and think \"I could build this,\" you're in the wrong market.\n\n**Step 2: Build a product and raise money, but not for the reasons you think**\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: the product doesn't have to be great. You shouldn't waste too much time making it perfect. The product is the least important part of this playbook.\n\nWhat matters is legitimacy & credibility. Raising money signals to people in these industries that you're a real company, not two people in a garage. Most people in legacy industries don't know Sequoia from some random angel syndicate, so don't waste time chasing name-brand VCs. Just raise around $1M and move on.\n\nHiring a few people also helps. It makes you look like a \"real\" company. The whole point here is building trust and brand recognition within the industry.\n\n**Step 3: Sign design partnerships with potential acquirers**\n\nI know most people on the internet advise against design partnerships, but for this playbook they're essential, with one critical caveat: your design partners need to be companies that could eventually acquire you.\n\nWe partnered with 4 big names in the employee benefits space. If you can, get them to invest in your company. Give their CEOs board seats. You're not optimizing for product feedback here. You're optimizing for relationships and positioning.\n\n**Step 4: Build deep rapport over 12+ months**\n\nThis is the step that takes the longest, but it's what makes everything else work.\n\nOur CEO was talking to all 4 design partner CEOs on a weekly basis. You need to understand what initiatives they have going on, what they care about, what keeps them up at night. You need to become a trusted advisor, someone they see as a technology expert who actually understands their space.\n\nIf these companies have subsidiaries, start meeting with them too. Cast a wide net within the org.\n\nWhile this is happening, you can talk to other customers and generate some revenue, but honestly, revenue is the least important metric in this playbook.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the opportunity**\n\nIf you've done steps 1 through 4 correctly, this part is actually easy.\n\nIn our case, one of our design partners had a subsidiary that grew rapidly. They suddenly needed an AI solution to handle some stuff around the benefits they were selling. What they needed was adjacent to our product, but not exactly what we built.\n\nThis is the sweet spot. They had a problem. We had the team, the trust, and enough product to be credible.\n\nInstead of offering to build them a feature, we offered to sell them the whole company. If you can create this dynamic with multiple design partners at once, even better. Deal heat is real.\n\n**Step 6: Close**\n\nCall it an acqui-hire, call it a quick sale, whatever. Close the deal.\n\nYou'll probably need to stay on afterward to build the solution you discussed, but that's fine. You just sold your company for 8 figures.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Go into a narrow legacy industry where buyers can't build\n2. Build credibility as a tech expert and domain expert\n3. Sign design partners who could be acquirers\n4. Build deep rapport over 12+ months\n5. Identify an adjacent opportunity\n6. Sell the company, not a feature\n\nI know this seems counterintuitive. This playbook basically does everything most people online advise against. Don't obsess over product. Don't focus on revenue. Do design partnerships. Optimize for relationships over growth.\n\nIf you're trying to build a billion dollar company, this is NOT the playbook for you. Many people here are swinging for that, and that's great. But if you want a low 8-figure exit in under 2 years, this works. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

There are so many small companies in non-tech industries that don’t have the tech solutions they need, and all the smart devs are focusing on oversaturated tech-heavy businesses because that’s what they know and are comfortable with. \n\nIt’s also true that partnering with someone who knows that industry well is really important, as they are the ones who can identify the problems that need solutions, and equally importantly can give you access and credibility. \n\nThe slop part is saying that you should get design partners and then sell the company before you’ve developed any product, which is ridiculous. Develop the product, show the companies how it solves their problem, then expand and refine the product within that same industry.",

The whole strategy here is predicated on building credibility within your industry as someone who's a tech expert but someone who understands them.

Once that trust was there, the product just had to be good enough to be credible.\n\nThe design-partner-as-future-acquirer angle is especially smart. Most founders treat partnerships like feedback loops when they’re really long-term strategic chess moves.\n\nAlso refreshing to see someone say revenue isn’t always the north star in these setups. In legacy industries, access + influence compounds way faster than MRR early on.\n\nCurious. When you were building rapport with those CEOs, what actually moved the needle most? Regular strategy convos, delivering small wins, or just consistency over time?",

What seemed to move things most was consistency plus context. Showing up regularly, remembering the last conversation, and reacting to *their* reality rather than pushing a roadmap.\n\nThe beer example is telling. It’s not about the beer, it’s about removing the transactional layer. Once people stop feeling like they’re being worked, they open up. At that point trust compounds faster than any feature release.\n\nAlso agree on access and influence compounding early. Revenue follows later.

The industry is required , and usually government or large private companies are main clients.\n\nI’m trying to find a side project with enough salary to augment my current job. Ideally leave it. \n\n I feel kind of stuck and mentally drained. I know how hard it is to acquire clients in these industries, which makes me nervous.

The ones that have failed? Almost exclusively were B2C \"lifestyle\" apps. The ones making  $20k MRR right now? Boring, ugly B2B tools for unsexy industries.\n\nIf you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, B2C is a trap. You are playing the lottery. You need millions of users to make a living wage. You are competing with TikTok for attention.\n\nStop trying to be the next Zuckerberg. Be the guy who helps a plumbing company organize their invoices.\n\nHere is the \"Value\" part that most devs ignore:\n\n1. The \"Wallet Friction\" Reality\nI built a fitness app for a client once. Getting a consumer to pay $9.99 a month was like pulling teeth. They churned if the UI wasn't perfect.\nThen I built a crappy inventory management tool for a local warehouse. It looked like Windows 95. The owner paid $500 month without blinking. Why? **Because it saved him $2,000 month in lost stock.**\nBusinesses spend money to make money. Consumers spend money to be entertained (and they hate paying for it).\n\n2. You can't out design big tech\nIn B2C, your UI/UX has to be world-class. If your animation stutters, users leave.\nIn B2B, nobody cares. I have a client running a logistics SaaS where the main dashboard is literally a giant HTML table. No React, no Tailwind, just data. His users love it because it loads in 100ms and does the job.\nBoring problems = Lower technical bar = Faster MVP.\n\n3. Marketing is actually easier\nMarketing a consumer app means buying ads and praying for viral tweets.\nMarketing a B2B app? You find 50 plumbing companies on Google Maps and you email them. You can literally call your customers. Try calling your users for your \"AI dating coach.\"\n\nThe Actionable Advice:\nStop looking for ideas on ProductHunt. Go talk to your uncle who runs a roofing business. Go ask your dentist what software they hate.\n\nFind a business that is using Excel to manage a complex process. Build a SaaS that replaces that Excel sheet. Charge $100 month. You only need 80 customers to make six figures.\n\nOr keep building your \"Social Network for Gamers\" and wondering why you have 0 revenue.\n\nBoring pays the bills. \"Cool\" burns the runway.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.",

B2B is boring in a very specific way that not everyone can actually stick with. Calling plumbers, dealing with procurement quirks, weird payment cycles, legacy workflows, zero dopamine feedback. It pays but it’s not magically easier emotionally.\n\nThe wallet friction thing is dead on though. Once something ties directly to revenue or cost leakage, the conversation flips completely. I’ve seen businesses argue for weeks over a small monthly increase on a consumer product and then approve a chunky invoice in one call because it reduced some operational headache. It’s not about design or vibes at that point, it’s math.\n\nWhere I slightly disagree is the idea that B2C is always a lottery. It is if you’re chasing vibes and virality. It’s less so when there’s a very specific job being done and distribution is already there. Most people don’t have that, so they default to building for themselves and hope the market shows up.\n\nThe Excel replacement advice is evergreen. If you find a spreadsheet that someone is afraid to touch because it might break, there’s usually money hiding there. I’ve gotten into the habit of quietly tracking where time actually goes in these projects and it’s wild how often the boring stuff is what compounds.\n\nCurious how many folks here who swear by B2C have actually sat across from a business owner and watched how fast they decide when something clearly saves them money.",

I had very little money to invest in outbound tools after paying for my mentorship ($4k and totally worth it). \n\nMy mentor told me I should: \n- send 16 connection requests on LinkedIn to Clay aware people, he helped me find these people\n\n-Then another 16 DMs to anyone that accepts my request with a vetted message and offer \n\n- post once a day on LinkedIn\n\n- leave comments on 10 posts every day\n\nI did it everyday for the first 30 days no matter what, even when I hated doing it. It compounded. \nPeople reached out to me after reading my posts and responded to my messages.\n\nI closed 4 clients in 29 days.",

I enter the flow state. I spend months over-engineering the backend, setting up Docker/K8s for a simple app, perfecting the database schema. It feels like \"work\" so I feel productive.\n3. **The Reality:** App is ready. It works. Now I have to market it.\n4. **The Freeze:** I just... stop.\n\nI am a massive introvert. The idea of \"building a personal brand\" or doing tiktok dances makes me cringe. honestly i feel like a scammer whenever i try to \"sell\" something, even if i know the code is solid.\n\nSo the project just sits there. 0 users. eventually i lose interest, archive the repo, and start a new one. I’m tired of this cycle. I have the tech skills to build anything but i just cant sell to save my life. How do you force yourself to do the marketing side? Is it actually possible to grow a SaaS in 2026 without showing your face or being an \"influencer\"?\n\nAny advice for a dev tired of building ghost towns?",

So it’s been compounding as I find rhythm. \n\nFirst, I started learning to code last year. Piece by piece I built a system. Piece by piece I expanded the system. Went from building a simple tool for my clients to having an arsenal of tools of at least 40 now that have the ability to dominate an underserved industry. \n\nNext, was the marketing. And ugh what a drag.. Like all of you devs out there, I just wanted to build and my product to sell itself. Well with 100 or less users a month, that wast gonna happen lol. I have built a marketing system that is incredible now. Email marketing I can send out to everyone at any time, social media marketing that’s automatic (paid for some of this), and SEO is somewhat picking up. Still learning a lot and I am still faceless. I do use LinkedIn to generate a lot of buzz now though using myself to build trust. But no videos no dancing no nonsense. Just posting and hitting pain points. \n\nPoint being, it’s a slow process but you can do it. If you can spend 8 months crafting an awesome app, you can spend time creating a marketing system. Just improve 1% a day and you’ll see results months later.",

I've been coding for 10 years, started building SaaS projects around 5 years ago, and only 6 months ago my first one actually saw the light of day.\n\nMy background is different though. I have a ton of experience in sales. Cold calling, getting screamed at, hung up on. So marketing wasn't my freeze point, building was.\n\nHere's the thing. You don't need to show your face, build a personal brand, or dance on TikTok. You're building B2B. Your buyers check email, not reels.\n\nEmail marketing is the easiest form of advertising out there, and for someone who freezes at the thought of putting themselves out there, it's perfect. No camera, no followers, no public performance. Just you, writing a message to someone who might have the problem you solve. That's it.\n\nIt's what finally got me to start selling my product. I sent cold emails to companies in my niche and it just worked. No influencer stuff, no content calendar. Just clear emails to the right people.\n\nYou've already done the hard part. The code exists. Now you just need to let people know, and email is the lowest barrier way to do that.",

Give Claude your initial ICP definition and ask it to divide it into keywords, for example \"B2B software startups and scaleups with 1-10 employee count, revenue $500K-$5M and located in USA - targeting founders, co-founders, CEOs and VPs of sales, growth and GTM\" -> then divide location / revenue / employee count and some other keywords into multiple sub keywords -> example: USA -> NYC, SF, Chicago, ...\n2. \\[I use this tool and am happy, but any other similar platform can do the work\\] Go to Starnus (it's your Claude for Sales), choose one of their template lead gen prompt templates and dump your ICP keywords there (for sub keywords, choose 1 at a time). Then get a clean leads list with enriched data and contact info.\n3. Either manually connect with those leads on LinkedIn with a small note attached, or again use Starnus to send those requests.\n4. Track conversions, iterate and improve.\n\nSome tips:\n\n\\- You need 200-500 reachouts per week (at least), use 1-3 LinkedIn accounts (with LI Premium you get up to 250-300 connection requests per week per account).\n\n\\- Be hyper personalized, and it's not just saying Hi {{ first\\_name }}, you need to research the leads, Starnus will do it for you, or you can use Sales Nav to do manual search or other auto-signals and auo-enrichment tools.\n\nBottom line, start setting up your pipelines, and experiment, iterate and improve, until you find something that seems like it can scale.",

Because if I don’t know that you exist with the perfect solution for my painful problem then I can’t buy it.\n\nWhy Sales? People come in all sizes and shapes. Google “Surrounded by Idiots” and you learn personality styles and the many reasons that what comes out of my mouth is not necessarily understood THE SAME WAY by the other person. So somebody has to adapt the communication protocols. And people with tech backgrounds DON’T GROK their target audiences.\n\nDigital marketing is about reach people via the Internet. The tech part is home to tech people but voodoo magic to non-tech people. Tech people need to pick up a lot of “soft people skills” and the “people” dimension if they want to successfully connect, engage, and trigger the “buy” emotion.\n\nLost in all this GROK voodoo magic? Maybe start by creating a “Buyer Journey Map” for your product and/or service.\n\nIt provides a visual guide of the communication paths and protocols needed for making an effective two-way connection with YOUR target audience.\n\nIt also helps you identify noise and gaps on your communication channels.\n\n\nOnce you have your map, you can start thinking marketing and sales funnels. And building your communication stack with relevant metrics to measure signal strength and noise.\n\nBuilding SaaS solutions requires mastering some frameworks, connecting software blocks, mastering program interfaces and adapting databases to name just a few of the many necessary tasks for delivering a viable solution.\n\nA similar process is needed for triggering “buy emotions.” \n\nSo create your “Buyer Journey Map”, identify the communication channels, configure the communication protocols, and zero in on the “right” BUY frequency for YOUR SaaS solution.",

Our clients who actually grow B2B products do it through boring, unsexy tactics like cold outreach, SEO, and partnerships. No TikTok dances required.\n\nYour real problem is you're building products without validating demand first. Stop coding for months before talking to a single potential customer. Find 10 people who have the problem you're solving, get them to describe their pain points, then build the minimum version that fixes that specific issue. If they won't pay for it before you build it, the market doesn't actually want your solution.\n\nFor distribution without personal branding, cold email works damn well for B2B SaaS if you target right. Identify 200 companies that need your exact solution, write personalized outreach explaining how you solve their specific problem, and start conversations. Content marketing and SEO take longer but don't require being on camera either.\n\nStop hiding behind code. Sales feels like being a scammer because you haven't validated that anyone actually wants what you built. Fix that first, then distribution gets way easier.",

      "text": "If you are tired of posting on LinkedIn for 0 likes, hate the idea of sending 100 cold emails a day, or just feel like \"standard\" growth tactics are too slow, this is for you.\n\nI just hit $27k MRR with my new project, Rebelgrowth.\n\nAnd i did it by ignoring most of the standard \"SaaS advice.\"\n\nHere is the thing.\n\nEveryone focuses on the tool.\n\n\"Look at my AI wrapper.\" \"Look at my new feature.\"\n\nBut the money isn't in the tool.\n\nIt’s in the **Offer + The Funnel.**\n\nI learned this the hard way.\n\nBefore this, I sold my previous startup (CreativiU) to 7-figures.\n\nI spent years obsessing over what Russel Brunson teaches in Expert Secrets.\n\nAnd here is the \"ugly\" truth about how i actually grow.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Free Trial\" Offer**\n\nStop asking people to marry you on the first date.\n\nStandard 14-day free trials are boring. They have no urgency.\n\nFor my previous company, i used a \"free + shipping\" model. I gave away physical supplies and just charged $7.99 for shipping.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause getting someone to pull out their wallet changes the relationship.\n\nIt is 10x easier to upsell a customer who paid $7.99 than it is to convert a free user.\n\nI’m using this same logic for Rebelgrowth (an AI SEO tool).\n\nInstead of a generic trial, my offer is: **3 Days Free + First Month for $9.**\n\nThe regular price is $97/mo, which kicks in at Month 2.\n\nThis works because it stops the scroll.\n\nIt’s an \"unusual\" offer in a sea of sameness.\n\nThen, inside the app, I upsell to a $299 plan.\n\nThis \"tripwire\" approach covers my ad spend so i can acquire customers for essentially $0.\n\n**2. The \"Trojan Horse\" SEO Strategy**\n\nI love SEO, but waiting 6 months for traffic sucks.\n\nSo i cheat.\n\nI call this the **Trojan Horse Interview.**\n\nBack in the day, i started a marketing podcast.\n\nBut the goal wasn't listeners. The goal was backlinks.\n\nI would interview experts and run a \"contest\" for their audience.\n\nTo enter the contest, the guest had to host the participation guidelines on **THEIR** website.\n\nAnd guess what was in those guidelines?\n\nA juicy backlink to my site.\n\nThey got engagement/traffic. I got domain authority.\n\nWin-win.\n\n**3. Paid Ads (For people who hate losing money)**\n\nI treat ads like a vending machine.\n\nI put $1 in, i need to know when $2 comes out.\n\nI built a massive spreadsheet where every row is a touchpoint (CPM, CPC, Click rate, Churn).\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend, knowing i’ll be profitable in 3 months.\n\nMy strategy is stupidly simple:\n\n* **Meta:** I target broad. US + Europe. My creative is my targeting. I use UGC style videos (15-30 seconds). I use tools like Sora Pro to make hooks because i’m lazy.\n* **Google:** I only bid on **Competitor Keywords**. I don't use their name in the text (don't get sued), but i pin my \"$9 Offer\" in the headline.\n\n**4. Being an Early Adopter (The \"Shiny Object\" Strategy)**\n\nYou have to be where your competitors aren't.\n\nIn Nov 2025, i saw John Rush launch TinyAdz. I jumped on it immediately. Cheap traffic.\n\nWhen Marc Lou launched TrustMRR, I bought an ad spot instantly.\n\nIt was the best ROAS i’ve ever had.\n\nBut you win some, you lose some.\n\nI also burned $500 paying an X influencer who got me zero clicks.\n\nThe point is to move fast.\n\n**Summary of the playbook:**\n\n1. Create an irresistible, \"weird\" offer (low friction entry).\n2. Use that offer to liquidate your ad spend (break even immediately).\n3. Use \"Trojan Horse\" tactics for authority.\n4. Upsell the backend to make profit.\n\nMost people are trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.\n\nFix the offer (the bucket), and filling it becomes easy.\n\nHas anyone else tried a $1 or $9 \"tripwire\" offer for SaaS? Or is everyone still stuck on \"Freemium\"?\n\nBorja Obeso, founder [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

We built similar tracking for market signals - monitoring when certain topics spike in discussions helps predict which angles will resonate.

One thing I'd add: track sentiment around competitor mentions too. When people complain about specific pain points of a competitor, that's your ad copy right there.

We tested free vs low-friction paid access in another product and the paid users were 5–8x more engaged and way easier to retain.\n\nAlso love the point about timing vs waiting months for SEO. Too many founders treat growth like a patience game instead of a systems game.\n\nCurious. When you run that $9 offer, what percentage usually sticks past month one?

I've built everything from small business sites to big brand used by millions, and I'm currently working on my own SaaS.\n\nOne thing I've learned after all these years: even the most experienced developers and designers need a fresh pair of eyes.\n\nYou can stare at your own product for weeks and completely miss things that a stranger would catch in 30 seconds, whether it's a confusing UX flow, a landing page that doesn't convert, copy that misses the mark, or a technical choice that will bite you later.\n\nSo here's the deal: drop your SaaS link in the comments and I'll give you real, actionable feedback for free.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Don't tell me what your SaaS is for, I need to know it by looking at your page instantly.\n\nNo strings attached. I genuinely enjoy reviewing products, and I always learn something in the process too.\n\nDrop your links below!\n\n**EDIT:** With all the comments, I will not be able to review everyone unfortunately, I will do my best but here major issues I find in almost all sites:\n\n1. Add trust in your hero, like how many businesses or people use your tool.\n2. Add a video of your product right after hero.\n3. Add good testimonials.\n4. Add a great about page, many visitors will check this page to know who's behind the business.\n5.

              "text": "This is cleaner than most resume tools I've seen. \"The cleanest resume scanner\" is a specific claim and the page backs it up. No sidebar ads, no upsell popups mid-flow, no LinkedIn audit nonsense distracting from the core job.\n\nThe before/after comparison (48 -> 94) does real work. Showing weak bullet points transformed into quantified achievements makes the value immediately obvious. That's proof, not just promises.\n\nYour competitor comparison table is bold. Most tools avoid naming competitors directly. You're saying \"here's how we're different from Jobscan, Enhancv, and MyPerfectResume\" and backing it with specifics. That confidence signals you've actually thought about positioning.\n\nTestimonials are solid too. Real names, photos, verified badges, and specific outcomes (\"Score: 45 -> 92\", \"3 interviews in 1 week\"). That's how social proof should work.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nThe hero buries the outcome slightly. \"Optimize Your ATS Score\" is the mechanism. \"Land More Interviews\" is the outcome. I'd flip the emphasis. Nobody wakes up wanting a higher ATS score. They want callbacks.\n\n\"The cleanest\" is a strong claim but subjective. You might test something more concrete like \"No ads. No noise. Just your resume, optimized.\" You already have that as subhead copy. It's more defensible.\n\nThe page is long. That's fine for SEO and thoroughness, but the path from landing to \"Upload Your Resume\" could be shorter. Consider whether everything above the fold earns its position.\n\nVisually it's the same dark mode with teal accent that half of SaaS uses right now. Not a problem, just not distinctive. The product is strong enough that the design doesn't need to do heavy lifting, but it's worth noting.\n\nOverall this is well-executed. You understand your user's problem (\"75% of resumes never reach a human recruiter\") and you've built clear proof throughout the page. Most resume tools feel like they're trying to extract money. This one feels like it's trying to solve a problem. That comes through.",

Just small details that could help you look more trustworthy. When i opened your landing page the cta was actually cropped out from view. There was a lot of text I didnt even try to read since it became quite an overload, try to guide the user where to look and what to read because right now there is a bit too much going on at once and it's very hard to get a precise idea of what its about. Also I'd strongly suggest changing or dimming down these glow effects (green/blue/purple neons) also they could look cool they are strongly associating your saas to poorly generated AI software we see everywhere. It's not a simple task but if I were you I would try and look closely and understand the more premium designs of other software to obtain a more mature look. Hopefully this helps!",

It tells me what shelf you're on, not why I should pick you up. \"Get discovered without cold outreach\" is an actual promise. Lead with that.\n\nRight now the page explains the mechanism before establishing why I should care. Flip it. Outcome first, system second.\n\nOne other thing: \"FOR FOUNDERS. BY FOUNDERS.\" doesn't do much without a story behind it. Who built this? What did you fail at before building it? That context builds trust more than the badge.\n\nVisually it's clean but the dark mode with teal accent is everywhere right now. Nothing breaks through as distinctly GrowBase. Not a dealbreaker, just something to consider as you grow.\n\nYou're not a fundraising CRM. You're the anti-pitch-deck. Own that harder and the right founders will find you.",

              "text": "Hey, designer here. Looked into your app. Looks really nice just would advise some UI changes on your landing page. On my desktop your main hero section has a big blank section in the middle, it seems very scattered towards the sides of the view. When your users land on your landing page you want the primary focus to be on the center of the screen, it's where users most often expect to find their information. Having your heading and animation be seperated like that feels quite off. Also i would strongly suggest using ease in/ease out for your animations, to help smooth out the animations, they feel quite harsh right now. And as you scroll downwards it feels a bit too much free and might be hard for the user to understand whats going. I think there is a need for things to be sectionned off more precisely so that your user slowly reads the info one by one. Let me know if this helps!",

First, privacy is becoming a huge deal. Asking a company to upload thousands of sensitive IBANs or VAT numbers to a random server just to check a checksum is a massive security risk. I wanted to see if I could solve that by keeping 100% of the logic inside the browser.\n\nSecond, I've seen how messy data can be in most companies. Often, they don't bother cleaning up their databases because specialized APIs are just too expensive for a \"first pass\" validation. My tool lets them do that big initial scrub without the high costs or the risk of a data leak.\n\nRight now, I'm targeting SMEs, accountants, and other devs who deal with bulk financial records. If you have a messy CSV and need to make sure the data is mathematically sound before hitting \"pay\" or importing it into an ERP, this is for you.\n\nAs for the money, I literally launched yesterday, so I’m sitting at exactly $0 MRR right now ! This is my first project as a side-indie dev, so I’m mostly focused on proving the concept and getting feedback. I also open-sourced the core engine as a NuGet package because I genuinely think this kind of basic validation should be accessible to any .NET dev out there.",

I think this glow blue/purple effect starts to be seen in a lot of places and is starting to look like 'AI slop' or quickly generated website. I would suggest avoiding this aesthetic. Furthermore, your type needs a bit more refining, the kerning is too narrow on the header and too wide on the buttons/navbar feels quite off. And the use of uppercase and lowercase feels inconsistent. Also your CTA is a bit unclear, I get that you want to make the user try a feature but make it as simplest as possible in the landing page so that the user is easily guided to try it out. Just a few details that really wont hurt to adjust for creating trust.",

Just really weird how small your screenshot is and even weirder how you have to add a View Full Image button. That just creates friction for the user that did not need to be there in the first place.

Traffic doesn’t.  \n  \nOutreach #1 tip:  \n  \nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.  \n  \nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.  \n  \nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.  \n  \nJust start a convo like a human.  \n  \nAds #1 tip:  \n  \nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.  \n  \nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.  \n  \nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.  \n  \nSocial #1 tip:  \n  \nHooks are everything.  \n  \nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.  \n  \nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.   \n  \nPartnerships #1 tip:  \n  \nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.  \n  \nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.  \n  \nContent #1 tip:  \n  \nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.  \n  \nNot like a SaaS landing page.  \n  \nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.  \n  \nThat’s basically it.  \n  \nMost founders don’t need more tactics.  \n  \nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E  \n  \nWe're building [Rebelgrowth](https://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit) around this idea (owned distribution through SEO + leveraged citations), $26k MRR so far, still grinding.  \n\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?  \n\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria",

Answered questions, shared what was working for us, didn't pitch.\n\nEventually led to them mentioning us organically, which carried way more weight than any ad I could've run.\n\nThe other thing: I stopped trying to be everywhere. Picked one channel (LinkedIn for us), committed to it for 90 days straight, and actually learned how it worked instead of half-assing three platforms.\n\nCongrats on the $26k MRR.

Reddit, niche Slack/Discords, industry forums, whatever. Think “be the helpful regular,” not “drop my link everywhere.”\n\nTwo practical tweaks:\n\n1) Build a tiny “signal system”: F5bot or Mention for brand/keyword alerts, plus something like SparkToro to find where your buyers hang out, plus Pulse in the background surfacing high-intent Reddit threads so you’re not guessing where to jump in.\n\n2) Tie every channel to one clear ask that leads to a quick win (template, calculator, teardown). If that doesn’t convert, fix the offer, not the channel.\n\nSo yeah: early game is all about engineered serendipity, not generic “marketing.",

Strangers want chaos and laughs. That mix usually turns into trolling, not a product people pay for every month. Imagine your power bill or pipes if some bored dude decides “tropical vacation” at 3am all week.\n\nIf you like this space, flip the concept: same tech, but used for very small, trusted circles and clear value. Example: shared homes, student housing, or Airbnbs where guests can pick “scenes” (lighting, music, temp presets), and hosts get data on what configs people actually like. That’s closer to a hospitality tool than a social app.\n\nI’d prototype cheap: Home Assistant + a simple web UI, test in one building, see if anyone would pay actual money. I used Reddit plus tools like Zapier and Pulse for Reddit to sanity-check ideas like this before writing any serious code.\n\nSo: as pitched, fun joke, not a $14.95/mo for 50k users kind of thing.",

If no one is searching for it, there is no demand and if you don't have a multimillion dollar ad budget to create the market, then don't do it. \n\nA child could figure that out.\n\nNothing is over when there is demand. That's like saying \"restaurants are over\" or \"clothing is over\".\n\nNo market is \"saturated\". This is also a weird notion people have.\n\nSaturated means \"high demand\"... what YOU are supposed to be doing is building something better or simpler or cleaner and more intuitive or emphasizing a great feature that no one else does or whatever... not avoiding huge demand to get into spaces with zero demand and then spending months building something and then spending your days scratching your head wondering why your new money tree isn't bearing fruit.\n\nFrankly, its painful to watch.",

There’s still a lot to improve, but the foundation is solid.\n- The user actually found the product via ChatGPT, not ads or social media.\n- I’ve been heavily focused on SEO, with a fully automated blog publishing ~5 niche-relevant articles per day, translated into multiple languages without manual work.\n\nThis single paying customer already covers my entire \nmonthly stack.\n\nI’m not making money ye, but I’m not losing any either. I’ve reached break-even at the infrastructure level. The only real cost now is time.\n\nI’m not posting this to promote my SaaS (I won’t share the name here), but just to share something encouraging:\n\nWhen you focus on clarity, distribution, and actually solving a problem, even quietly, results eventually come.

That phase made me change a few UX decisions and some features pretty early.\n\nFor the launch, I kept it very simple:\n\n– an “official” announcement on LinkedIn with a short promo video\n– at the same time, a Product Hunt launch\n\nProduct Hunt didn’t really bring much, to be honest. The products that rank high usually have a strong network pushing votes. You do get a page for your product, which is nice, but I wouldn’t expect real traction from it.\n\nAfter that, it was mostly SEO grind. I also spent time making the website extremely simple to understand, clear value, no noise.\nI didn’t do anything extraordinary, except automating the blog completely. \n\nFor roughly ~$20/month, it replaces what would normally be a small SEO team (2 people easily). That’s probably what made the biggest difference long term.",

Publishing 5 niche articles daily with automated translation is smart – you're essentially building a content moat while competitors are still manually writing blog posts.\n\n\n\nA few things I've seen work exceptionally well at scale:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*LLM-powered semantic clustering\\*\\* – Instead of just keyword targeting, use embeddings to identify content gaps your competitors aren't covering. This helps you rank for long-tail queries that convert better.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Programmatic SEO + user-generated content\\*\\* – Since your product is fully self-serve, consider auto-generating landing pages based on actual user workflows or use cases. Each automated demo or integration becomes a unique indexed page.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*ChatGPT/LLM discovery optimization\\*\\* – You mentioned users found you through ChatGPT. This is increasingly important. Make sure your docs/content are structured for LLM retrieval (clear schema markup, FAQ format, API examples). We're seeing 20-30% of SaaS discovery shift to LLM interfaces.\n\n\n\nThe fact that users upgrade without hand-holding tells me your product positioning and UX are dialed in. That's the hardest part. The infrastructure investment paying for itself with one customer is a good signal – most founders over-index on features vs. distribution early on.\n\n\n\nKeep shipping. The self-serve motion with automated distribution is exactly how you scale without burning cash on sales teams.",

It means:\n\n✓ Your value proposition is crystal clear\n\n✓ The onboarding flow actually works\n\n✓ The product delivers immediate value\n\n\n\nMost founders overthink this. If users can figure it out themselves, you've already won half the battle.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The ChatGPT Discovery Channel\\*\\*\n\nThis is fascinating and honestly underrated. While everyone's chasing social media algorithms and paid ads, ChatGPT is becoming a real discovery channel. We've seen similar patterns in our user analytics.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip\\*\\*: Make sure you're optimizing for AI discovery:\n\n\\- Clear problem/solution statements on your landing page\n\n\\- Structured data that LLMs can parse\n\n\\- Documentation that answers \"how does X solve Y\" questions\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Break-Even Achievement\\*\\*\n\nReaching infrastructure break-even at 1 customer is RARE. Most SaaS founders struggle with this for months. You clearly:\n\n\\- Kept costs lean\n\n\\- Priced appropriately from day one\n\n\\- Built efficient automation\n\n\n\nThis gives you the runway to focus on growth without burning cash.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Your SEO Strategy\\*\\*\n\n5 articles per day, automated, multilingual - that's ambitious. One caution from experience: quality > quantity when it comes to SEO longevity. Google's getting smarter about AI content. Make sure you're adding genuine value and not just chasing keywords.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What's Next?\\*\\*\n\nSince you're at this milestone, here's what worked for us:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Talk to this customer\\*\\* - Even if they didn't need hand-holding, understanding their use case will unlock product insights\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Double down on what worked\\*\\* - ChatGPT discovery is working? Optimize for it. SEO is driving traffic? Keep refining.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Set up proper analytics\\*\\* - Track activation metrics, feature usage, churn indicators NOW while it's simple\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Build the testimonial relationship\\*\\* - This customer will be gold for future social proof\n\n\n\nThe journey from 0→1 customer is often harder than 1→100. You've proven product-market fit exists.\n\n\n\nWhat's your SaaS in? (No pressure to share if you want to keep it private). Curious what space is seeing this kind of immediate conversion.",

Traffic doesn’t.\n\n**Outreach #1 tip:**\n\nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.\n\nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.\n\nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.\n\nJust start a convo like a human.\n\n**Ads #1 tip:**\n\nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.\n\nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.\n\nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.\n\n**Social #1 tip:**\n\nHooks are everything.\n\nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.\n\nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.\n\n**Partnerships #1 tip:**\n\nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.\n\nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.\n\n**Content #1 tip:**\n\nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.\n\nNot like a landing page.\n\nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.\n\nThat’s basically it.\n\nMost founders don’t need more tactics.\n\nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria from [Rebelgrowth.com](http://rebelgrowth.com/) ",

Pretty good but when I started, I had no idea that the sales cycle for enterprise SaaS would be as long as they are.\n\nIn other words, those 2 years were an absolute struggle because we had no money coming in and towards the end - the pressure was crazy! \n\nMy days consisted of bullshit hellish dramas. I was either dealing with shitty investor personalities or being woken up at 3am because the entire site / app were down during a sales call because of some update we pushed through too quickly.\n\nIt was all chaos.\n\nBut we eventually found PMF and the storm calmed. We found our footing and now we're making good money.\n\nYay.\n\nBut just as my blood pressure has began reaching a normal human level - we found product market fit in a completely untapped area in a multi trillion dollar industry. \n\nTo make matters worst, we have already started selling our MVP and customers love it. \n\nThere's one small problem though - I'm burnt out (and I feel guilty about it).\n\nThe irony is that this opportunity is the greatest fiscal opportunity in my life! \n\nI would have given ANYTHING 4 years ago to have an opportunity like this fall on my desk but no matter how hard I try - I can't feel any excitement about it. \n\nNot one little bit.\n\nThe only joy that I get professionally recently is running a small group for founders (I'm not promoting! I wont link it).\n\nGenuinely helping people swerve mistakes that could have cost them years really gives me a sense of purpose. But the idea of making a new product and going through it all again makes me sick - even though I know that the outcome will be profitable.\n\nAnyone else been through this?",

In fact, people planning a divorce record a perceived increased happiness equal to those planning their wedding up until the event and afterwards. \n\nIn the case of constantly working under pressure, not only do the blood pressure rise, the amygdala in the brain is constantly looking for the tiger that it believes is the root of the perceived fear in order to run - preferably away from it. However, being in this constant fight/flight mode day after day without ever getting a chance to feel safe from the invisible tiger, decreases its ability to regulate, which eventually leads to burnout and even permanent brain damages.\n\nMoney can be obtained, increased, and even replenished, but time cannot.

Not stressed. Just tired in a deeper way.\n\nwhat helped me wasn’t more hustle, it was pulling myself out of the day to day grind. I started automating anything repetitive, delegating earlier than felt comfortable, and cutting my involvement down to the few decisions that actually moved the needle. That gave me some space to think again, not just execute.\n\none thing you said stood out, finding more meaning in helping other founders than in building again. I’ve seen that shift happen to a lot of people right around PMF. It doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful or broken. It usually means your role needs to evolve before the product does.\n\nhappy to swap notes if you want to talk it through. You’re definitely not alone in this phase",

You can build a coaching / advisory path around this and keep an economic stake in the SaaS without being the hero.\n\nOn the sales side, tools like HubSpot plus Apollo and even Pulse for Reddit to quietly surface enterprise conversations can let others handle growth while you protect your sanity.\n\nMain point: design a setup where the business scales but your nervous system doesn’t get dragged back into the blender.",

That stuff matters later.\n\nWe went with Intercom's Product Tours (cheaper tier) since we already used them for support. Not perfect, but got us 80% there for way less money. UserGuiding is another option that early-stage teams like. Self-serve pricing, no sales calls.\n\nReal talk though: are you trying to improve activation or just guide people through features? If it's activation, a good email sequence + custom in-app prompts often works better than any tour tool. Pendo sells the dream but retention comes from your product, not tooltips.",

      "text": "This is painful to write but I think it might help someone else avoid the same mistake.\n\nLast year we decided to go upmarket. Our self-serve product was doing fine—about $800K ARR—but we kept hearing that the real money was in enterprise. Longer contracts, higher ACVs, lower churn. The promised land.\n\nSo we spent 8 months and roughly $180K (mostly engineering time, some contractors) building enterprise features. SSO, SAML, advanced permissions, audit logs, custom integrations, the whole thing.\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n**1. We built before we sold.** We assumed if we had enterprise features, enterprise customers would come. We never actually validated that enterprises wanted what we built. We were building a checklist, not solving problems.\n\n**2. We didn't understand the enterprise sales cycle.** Turns out you can't just add features and have enterprises show up. They have procurement processes, security reviews, legal negotiations. The sales cycle went from 2 weeks to 4-6 months overnight. We weren't staffed for that.\n\n**3. Our pricing was wrong.** We priced our enterprise tier at $500/month thinking that was \"expensive.\" Enterprise buyers saw that price and assumed we weren't serious. Legitimate enterprise tools cost $2-5K/month minimum. Our low price actually hurt credibility.\n\n**4. The customers we did get were nightmares.** The few enterprise deals we closed came with custom requirements, constant hand-holding, and executive escalations. The support cost per customer was 10x our regular customers. Even at higher prices, the unit economics were worse.\n\n**5. We neglected our core product.** While we were chasing enterprise, our self-serve product stagnated. Competitors shipped features, we didn't. Our core customer base got frustrated.\n\n**Where we are now:** We've basically abandoned the enterprise push. Wrote off most of that $180K in development. Refocused on our core market. We're growing again but we lost a year.\n\nThe lesson I'm taking from this: if you're going to go upmarket, treat it like starting a new company. Different product, different sales motion, different support model, different everything. Don't try to bolt enterprise onto a self-serve business and expect it to work.\n\n",

          "text": "$500 is not an enterprise deal. Enterprise realistically starts around $100,000 per year, and even that number has very little to do with the product itself. What you are really paying for is hand holding.\n\nOnce you cross that line, you are dealing with procurement, security reviews, legal, financing, and a long list of custom edge cases. The first time you go through it, it is painful. After that, you learn how to do it, and it becomes easier each time.\n\nEnterprise is also about compliance. A lot of compliance. Going enterprise dramatically increases compliance costs, and that is not a value add to the product. In practice, compliance becomes a drag on product velocity, not a multiplier.",

Spent months building features nobody asked for.  \n  \nThe thing that would've saved us is what you mentioned but I want to emphasise it even more: sell before you build. I mean literally get 3-5 enterprise customers to commit (even just verbal LOIs) to buying if you build X, Y, and Z. Then build exactly those things for those customers.  \n  \nWe eventually figured this out on our second attempt. Found 4 target companies, got on calls with their teams, asked what they'd actually need to switch from their current solution. Two of them agreed to pilot it if we built specific integrations. That gave us a real roadmap instead of guessing.  \n  \nThe other thing is enterprise sales needs a completely different person than self-serve. The founder who's great at optimising conversion funnels usually isn't the same person who can navigate a 6-month procurement cycle with legal reviews. We had to bring in someone who'd done it before.  \n  \nHonestly though, going back to your core market sounds like the right call. $800K ARR in self-serve is solid and there's probably way more room to grow there.  \n  \nDid you have any enterprise customers actually asking for these features before you built them, or was it mostly assumptions?",

Building for a market segment you don't understand is the fastest way to burn cash.

More important you're hoping they would actually become the customer that pays and you're hoping that if there are any investors they see the vision earlier than after the fact. \n\nI have major respect for small teams and solo devs that are bootstrapping and when you build anything meaningful that isn't few prompt vibe coded system you realize the headaches the time the sleepless nights why one stupid function doesn't want to work. Let's not even get into the operational things these teams go through like registration, domains, dns configs,  gateways etc. They essentially put multiple hats on, developer, architect, code reviewer, analyst, marketing, admin in operations and whatever else that comes. \n\nThe grind is something not many can get through...at least without a sane mind when you're on the other side lol. Give my love to your friend and tell him to keep up the hard work it will all pay off one day, if it was easy everyone would be doing it and everyone would be rich over night.",

Users don’t need to open Squair often; they need to **remember it exists when panic hits**.\n* Push notifications are risky, but *contextual* ones could work (e.g. opt-in reminders during known stress windows like work hours).\n* The value might not be “open every day,” but “worked the 3 times I truly needed it.” That’s harder to measure but way more honest.\n* Monetization might align better with reassurance than usage: lifetime access, employer reimbursement, or “support the app” pricing rather than habit-based subscriptions.\n\nAlso: 400 downloads + daily use with only 2 subs doesn’t mean failure; it might mean you built something people rely on quietly, not something they binge.",

You could also consider adding a section with articles or tips on anxiety management that can help users feel supported and engaged.  \n  \nAnother tactic could be to implement some gentle reminders. Instead of push notifications that might annoy users, perhaps try sending occasional checkins with positive affirmations or quick breathing tips. This way, it feels less intrusive and more like a supportive nudge.  \n  \nLastly, consider reaching out to the users who are using Squair regularly but haven’t subscribed. Ask them what would make the app more valuable for them, this could lead to features you hadn’t considered but that could really enhance retention and conversion.",

Everyone talks about $10k in 6 months because, yeah that happens all the time right?\n\nI launched a website change detection tool 10 years ago. It took a decade to hit $6.5k MRR. Not a typo. Ten years.\n\nHere's what I got wrong and what actually worked:\n\n**Boring verticals > sexy markets.** I kept trying to market to \"everyone who needs to monitor websites.\" Too broad. Zero traction. Then enterprise compliance teams found me. Law firms. Banks. Regulatory tracking. They signed up and never left. 95%+ retention. Compliance monitoring isn't sexy, but compliance teams have budget and urgency.\n\n**Sticky beats viral.** Wasted years trying to get featured, go viral, hack growth. Meanwhile, my enterprise users just... stayed. Month after month. One sticky customer is worth 100 churned free trials.\n\n**The two real problems nobody warns you about.** Website monitoring sounds simple. Check page, detect change, send alert. In reality, noise kills you (sites change constantly, users drown in garbage alerts) and blocking kills you (Cloudflare, bot detection, CAPTCHA everywhere). Solving those two is 90% of the work. The \"detecting changes\" part is easy.\n\n**The long game is underrated.** Most competitors from 2015 are dead. I'm still here. Sometimes, just not quitting is the whole strategy.\n\nI just rebuilt Changeflow from scratch with modern tech and AI. Back to $119 MRR. Starting the climb again, but this time I know who I'm building for.\n\nWhat's the most counterintuitive thing you've learned building yours?",

          "text": "Hi!\n\nLate to the party, but this is exactly the struggle we went through... cost tracking that's either a full-time job or gets ignored entirely. A few things that actually helped us move toward \"cost awareness as a default\" rather than a side project:\n\nAutomated anomaly detection is non-negotiable. Manual checking will always fall behind. You need something that alerts you when costs deviate from baseline, not just when they hit an arbitrary threshold.\n\nPush reports to stakeholders, don't pull them. If DevOps is the bottleneck for cost visibility, you'll never escape it. Automated weekly/monthly reports to team leads means they own their spend without you playing middleman.\n\nTie costs to business context. Raw AWS costs are nearly useless for decision-making. What actually matters is cost-per-customer, cost-per-feature, or cost-per-transaction - that's what helps you spot inefficiencies and justify infrastructure decisions to leadership.\n\nFor tooling, if you want something purpose-built for this, check out Beakpoint Insights. It does the automated anomaly detection and alerting you mentioned, plus it maps your cloud spend to customers and features so you're not just seeing \"EC2 went up 30%\" but why it went up and whether it's actually a problem. Integration is fast (most teams are live in a few hours via OpenTelemetry + AWS), which matters when you're a small team that can't afford a multi-week implementation project.\n\nThe goal you described, cost awareness built into operations, not a separate initiative, is exactly the right framing. Good luck!\n\nCheck out BeakpointInsights.com. I think it’ll will help you. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nWinston",

The most valuable lesson I've learned: solve your customers' REAL pain, not the pain you think they have.\n\n\n\nWhen you deeply understand why compliance teams or law firms actually need monitoring (hint: it's rarely about the tech), you build features that stick and customers who stay.\n\n\n\nFast growth is sexy. Solving hard, boring problems that keep CFOs up at night? That's what builds a real business.\n\n\n\nThe fact that you're still here while competitors from 2015 are gone says everything. Persistence + focus on actual customer value > growth hacks.",

      "text": "I'm the founder of Linkedify, a LinkedIn automation tool with AI campaign creation and rental accounts so users don't risk their own profiles.\n\n60+ accounts on the platform. Thousands of campaigns. A lot of failures before we figured out what actually works.\n\nHere's everything we've learned.\n\n\n\n**Targeting is where most campaigns fail**\n\nMost people start with \"VP of Sales at SaaS companies with 50 to 200 employees.\" That's fine. But the real unlock is timing.\n\nTrigger based targeting beats static lists every time.\n\n**Job changers in their first 90 days** are gold. They're building their stack, trying to prove themselves, open to new ideas. Filter for \"started new position\" on Sales Navigator.\n\n**Recent posters and commenters** are 2 to 3x more likely to respond than ghost profiles. Someone active on LinkedIn actually checks their inbox. We built social signal scraping specifically for this.\n\n**Companies hiring for related roles** tell you what they care about. If they're hiring SDRs they care about pipeline. If they're hiring marketers they care about leads.\n\n**Funding announcements 30 to 60 days after** hit the sweet spot. Money just landed. They're spending. Too early and they're still planning. Too late and budgets are locked.\n\nHow we structure it: Start with ICP filters like title, company size, industry. Layer on a trigger. Keep lists to 500 to 1000 people max because smaller batches let you iterate faster.\n\n\n\n**The message sequence**\n\nConnection request needs to be under 300 characters. No pitch. No ask. Just relevance.\n\nWhat works:\n\n\"Saw you're building out the sales team at \\[Company\\], always interested to connect with folks scaling outbound.\"\n\nWhat doesn't:\n\n\"Hi \\[Name\\], I help companies like yours generate 50+ meetings per month using our AI powered platform. Would love to connect and share how we could help \\[Company\\] grow.\"\n\nFirst one feels human. Second one is obviously automated even when it's not.\n\n**Day 1 after they accept.** Acknowledge the connection. Give value. No ask yet.\n\n\"Thanks for connecting. Saw \\[Company\\] is pushing into \\[market\\]. Curious how you're approaching outbound there. We work with a lot of teams in \\[adjacent space\\] and happy to share what's working if useful.\"\n\n**Day 3.** Light follow up. Add specificity.\n\n\"Was actually looking at how \\[Competitor\\] structures their outreach. Noticed some patterns that might be relevant for \\[Company\\]. Worth a quick chat?\"\n\n**Day 7.** Direct ask. Make it easy.\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\], don't want to be that guy who keeps following up. If outbound is a priority right now happy to do 15 mins. If not no worries, timing is everything.\"\n\n**Day 14 if you want.** Breakup message. Works surprisingly well.\n\n\"Going to assume the timing isn't right. If things change feel free to reach out, always happy to talk \\[topic\\].\"\n\n\n\n**The numbers that actually matter**\n\nFrom our data:\n\nConnection acceptance rate. Average is 25 to 30 percent. Good is 35 to 45. Great is 50 plus.\n\nReply rate of people who connected. Average is 8 to 12 percent. Good is 15 to 20. Great is 25 plus.\n\nPositive reply rate. Average is 3 to 5 percent. Good is 6 to 10. Great is 12 plus.\n\nIf your acceptance rate is below 20 your targeting is off.\n\nIf your reply rate is below 5 your messaging is the problem.\n\n\n\n**What kills campaigns**\n\nPitching in the connection request. Instant ignore. You haven't earned the right to pitch yet.\n\nGeneric personalization. \"I noticed you work in sales\" is worse than no personalization at all.\n\nToo many follow ups too fast. More than 4 messages or less than 2 days apart feels desperate.\n\nTargeting too broad. \"Anyone in marketing\" means your message resonates with no one.\n\nUsing your real account at scale. One mistake and your network is gone. This is why we built rental accounts into Linkedify.\n\n\n\n**Account health stuff**\n\nSince we track this obsessively:\n\nDays 8 to 14 are the danger zone. New accounts get flagged here. Keep activity low.\n\n20 to 50 connection requests per day max depending on account age and warmth.\n\nIncomplete profiles get restricted faster. Fill everything out even the headline.\n\nAPI based beats browser automation. We moved to API and saw immediate stability improvement.\n\n\n\n**What we use internally**\n\nSales Navigator plus custom social signal scraping for targeting.\n\nLinkedify with API based sending for automation.\n\nClay for company data and custom scripts for hiring signals.\n\nEverything exports to Sheets then HubSpot.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this. What's working for you guys right now? Curious what others are seeing.",

One thing I’ve noticed with playbooks like this is that replies tend to scale much faster than actual buying conversations.\n\nThe harder part usually isn’t getting responses, it’s getting to a point where someone is reacting to a specific problem they already feel rather than just being polite. At scale, that gap seems to widen.\n\nDo you mostly rely on the back-and-forth to qualify intent, or have you found any early signals that consistently point to a worthwhile conversation?",

I posted on [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) and a couple of startup/entrepreneur subs. I was transparent, just said I built something and wanted feedback. No hype, no spam. I shared how it works, added a quick demo, and stuck around to answer every comment.\n\nTwitter helped too. I had no followers, but I tweeted my launch using #buildinpublic and replied to a few people who were actually looking to buy or sell startups. I also joined two Twitter Spaces and briefly shared what I made, surprisingly got a bunch of signups from that.\n\nThe crazy part? The first startups listed are already receiving adquisition offers.\n\nNo ads. No hacks. Just being honest, helpful, and responsive. Let me know if you have any questions!",

I'm curious about your follow-up strategy after those initial posts on Reddit; did you immediately start nurturing those 30 users or was the focus just on getting the initial signups? It sounds like the honesty in your approach really cut through the noise. I've found that being direct about needing feedback rather than pushing a product always works better when I'm sharing things I've built.",

          "text": "Being early and responsive is the real “growth hack” here. You basically tapped into intent, not just eyeballs: SideProject + startup subs + #buildinpublic + Twitter Spaces are all places where people are already thinking “I want to launch or buy something,” so your offer slotted right into an active desire.\n\nOne thing I’d double down on now: systematize what just worked. Make a simple Notion/Sheet with columns for sub, post type, angle, and conversion, then keep iterating on the formats that drove actual listings vs just traffic. Same on Twitter: log which replies or Spaces hosts brought signups and treat those like mini-channels, not one-off wins.\n\nIf you want to scale this without losing the honest vibe, tools like SparkToro or F5bot can help you find more intent-heavy convo pockets, and Pulse for Reddit is decent for catching those “I’m buying/selling a startup” threads in real time.\n\nMain point: you didn’t need tricks, you just put a clear offer in front of the right people and stuck around to talk like a human-keep tightening that loop.",
