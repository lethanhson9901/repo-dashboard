Being a solo dev, you constantly hear that the \"AI space is too crowded\" or \"nobody pays for desktop utilities anymore.\"\n\nYesterday, I finally hit launch. I didn't have a marketing budget or a big following. I just shared my story on a couple of subreddits, like genuinely, no spamming and then went to sleep.\n\nI woke up to 3 DODO payment notifications... It’s not \"quit my job\" money yet, but seeing that three total strangers found enough value in my local-AI screenshot tool to actually pay for it? It’s the most insane feeling in the world 🥹\n\nNow reality is hitting me. I’ve proved people want this, but I have no idea how to actually \"scale\" a business. I'm a dev, not a marketer. I’ve done the Reddit thing, but I know I can't rely on that forever.\n\nTo the veterans here, How do you go from those first 3 users to the first 100? Where should I be looking next to grow this without losing that \"human\" connection?\n\nWould love any advice (or even just some \"keep going\" energy).\n\nI have already tried posting in on ProductHunt: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/screensorts](https://www.producthunt.com/products/screensorts)\n\nBut honestly, it all feels void suddenly...",

You mentioned wanting to keep the human connection, that is actually your biggest growth lever right now.\n\nAt this stage, you don't need ads or complex funnels. You need to do things that don't scale: 1. Email those 3 users personally. Not an automated sequence. Just say thanks and ask exactly what problem they were solving when they pulled out their credit card. 2. Mirror their language. If a user says 'I hate organizing screenshots manually', that exact sentence becomes the headline on your landing page.\n\nThe first 100 users are almost always won through manual combat (like you did here) and direct conversations.\n\nQuick question: Since it's local-AI, is your main selling point privacy/security for them, or is it just the speed?",

Three strangers chose to trust something you made that’s the hardest part.\n\nFrom here, the shift isn’t about scaling fast or becoming a marketer overnight. It’s about understanding why those 3 people paid and not losing that signal. Talk to them. Ask what problem this solved for them, what nearly stopped them and what made them choose you instead of doing nothing.\n\nMost founders stall because they keep “trying channels” without really learning from them. What I recommend use every post, launch or message as a small experiment and actually keeping track of what led to real interest or payments.\n\nReddit and Product Hunt are fine to start, but the long-term edge comes from having a simple way to observe what works, adjust and repeat without burning out or losing the human feel.\n\nYou already proved demand exists. This phase feels quiet and weird for everyone but it’s where real businesses are built. Keep going.",

That's your unfair advantage as a solo dev. People connect with real stories, not polished pitches.\n\nWhat worked for us when we launched our first SaaS:\n- Document the journey publicly (your struggles are content)\n- Find 2-3 communities where your users hang out and actually help (not pitch)\n- DM your first users and ask what made them buy\n\nThe scaling part comes later. Right now, talk to those 3 users like they're gold. They'll tell you exactly what to build next.\n\nI write about this kind of early-stage bootstrapping stuff in my newsletter if you want more tactical tips: https://substack.com/@francoisdelpte",

Since ScreenSorts is a desktop utility, look into niche communities where people deal with 'screenshot clutter' (think UI/UX designers or researchers).

That first paying customer feeling really is something else.\n\nOn the 3 to 100 question - the advice I've seen work best for desktop utilities is to obsess over the distribution channels where your users already hang out.\n\nFor a screenshot/AI tool, some ideas:\n\n1. **Find the workflows** - Where do people take a lot of screenshots? Design review, bug reporting, documentation. Look for communities around those workflows specifically.\n\n2. **Make your users your marketers** - What if every screenshot exported with your tool had a subtle \"Made with ScreenSorts\" watermark on free tier? It's organic distribution every time someone shares their screenshots.\n\n3. **Content that ranks** - \"Best screenshot tools for Mac 2026\" type posts get a lot of search traffic. One or two well-SEO'd comparison articles can drive consistent organic leads.\n\n4. **Integrations** - Can you export directly to Notion, Slack, or wherever devs/designers spend their time? Integrations are both features AND distribution channels.\n\nThe void feeling is totally normal. Launch day dopamine crashes hard. But you've got signal now - people paid for this. That's more than 90% of side projects achieve.\n\nKeep shipping, keep talking to users. You're further along than you feel.",

That first payment notification feeling is unreal.\n\nOne thing I learned building a B2B SaaS - those first 3-10 users are gold because they'll tell you exactly what to build next. The temptation is to immediately think \"how do I scale to 100\" but honestly, just obsess over understanding why those 3 people paid.\n\nFor me it was talking to early users and realizing the problem was way more specific than I thought. Turned out they weren't just looking for \"invoicing\" - they needed EU cross-border VAT compliance and every other tool made them figure it out themselves. That clarity completely changed how I talked about the product.\n\nYour screenshot tool is solving a real pain (I have 500+ unorganized screenshots myself). Find out if those 3 users are designers, QA testers, researchers - whoever they are, there's probably 100 more just like them in a specific community somewhere.\n\nThe \"void\" feeling after ProductHunt is real. PH traffic is often tourists, not buyers. Your Reddit post got actual revenue because you told a real story. Keep doing that in places where your actual users hang out.",

Like actually talk to them if you can. Ask what problem they were trying to solve the day they decided to buy, what other tools they considered, what made them click purchase. That'll tell you way more than any marketing tactic.  \n  \nFor getting to 100, I found the best route was going where your users already hang out. For a screenshot tool, that might be communities for content creators, designers, product managers, whoever your ideal user is. Don't post your product, just be genuinely helpful in those spaces and people will check your profile.  \n  \nAlso, your existing users are gold. If they're getting value, they'll tell people. Make it stupidly easy for them to share or refer friends. Even just a simple \"hey, glad you're liking it, mind sharing with anyone else who might find it useful?\" can work.  \n  \nThe Reddit launch strategy clearly worked once. You could do the same in other relevant subreddits where your target users actually are, just spaced out over time.  \n  \nWhat problem were those three users specifically trying to solve with your tool?",

Thats your unfair advantage as a solo dev. People connect with real stories, not polished pitches.\n\nWhat worked for us when we launched our first SaaS:\n- Document the journey publicly (your struggles are content)\n- Find 2-3 communities where your users hang out and actually help (not pitch)\n- DM your first users and ask what made them buy\n\nThe scaling part comes later. Right now, talk to those 3 users like theyre gold.

Kept refreshing Stripe like an idiot.\n\nFor the 3 to 100 question - honestly the answer is boring but it worked for me: talk to those 3 users more than feels comfortable. Like actually get on calls with them. Ask what almost made them not buy. Ask what they'd need to tell a friend about it. The answers will tell you exactly where to find more of them.\n\nThe \"human connection\" thing doesn't go away if you don't want it to. I'm at 143 users now and I still reply to every single support message myself. Takes maybe 30 min a day. People notice and it shows up in retention.\n\nOn the marketing side - you don't need to become a marketer. You need to find 2-3 channels that work and ignore everything else. For me it was short video content and showing up in communities like this one. Tried Twitter, SEO, paid ads early on. Waste of time at this stage. Pick what feels least painful and just be consistent.\n\nThe void feeling is normal btw. Launch high wears off fast. What helped me was setting a stupid simple goal for the next 30 days. Not \"scale the business\" but like \"get to 10 paying users\" or \"talk to 5 customers this week\". Small enough that you can't fail if you actually try.\n\nYou're further than most people who just talk about building. Keep going.",

That feeling never gets old.\nReality check while you're scaling: Your tool processes screenshots (potentially with sensitive info—passwords, API keys, customer data) through \"local AI.\"\nThree questions most founders miss at this stage:\nWhere does the AI model actually run? (Local = your machine, or cloud API?)\nWhat happens to screenshot metadata? (GPS, window titles, clipboard history often embedded)\nIf a user processes a screenshot with a customer's credit card visible, do you have a data processing agreement?\nI ask because \"local AI\" tools often accidentally trigger GDPR if any data touches cloud for model updates, error reporting, or sync. First enterprise customer will ask for your DPA and retention policy.\nGrowth advice: Keep the human connection by being the \"security-conscious\" screenshot tool. Most competitors ignore this. Post about how you handle data (even if it's \"we delete everything instantly\")—it differentiates you in a crowded space.\nHappy to audit your data flow if useful—takes 2 mins and might save you a headache at user #50.",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

      "text": "Quick background: I left my PM role at a Series B about 11 months ago to build a SaaS that automates compliance reminders for dental offices. Small TAM — around 4,200 practices in the US. 6,800 if you count veterinary, which I've started doing in my projections.\n\nReal pain though. I watched our office manager spend 40 minutes a week on this. Built the MVP in 3 weeks (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel). Whole thing costs me $8.11/month to run. I know the exact number because I check Vercel billing every morning.\n\nLaunch was rough. Posted on HN, got 3 upvotes and one comment: \"Is this AI?\" It's not. It's cron jobs and Twilio. But I did start putting \"AI-powered\" in my meta tags for SEO, because the cron job evaluates a condition before sending each reminder, and at some level that's what inference is.\n\nSo I started grinding outreach. Scraped every dental practice within 200 miles off Google Maps, found the office managers on LinkedIn, and sent 1,847 personalized messages over 6 weeks. Personalized meaning I swapped the practice name in the first line. One office manager replied \"Hi \\[PRACTICE\\_NAME\\]\" so I know at least one person read the whole thing.\n\n11 replies. 2 asked me to stop. 1 was a lawyer — not about the product, his practice genuinely needed compliance reminders, he just also wanted me to know I was violating CAN-SPAM. The other 8 booked demos or asked for more info, 6 converted, those 6 referred 14 more, and cold email plus Reddit brought another \\~30.\n\nCurrent numbers: 53 paying customers, $4,150 MRR, \\~12% MoM growth. Churn is 4.7%, but most of that is practices closing or merging. If I exclude involuntary churn, seasonal adjustments, one guy who I'm pretty sure signed up by accident, and a practice that emailed me \"please stop texting our patients\" — which I'm classifying as a feature request — it's closer to 1.8%.\n\nThe problem: I got a letter last week from a practice's legal team calling my outreach \"unsolicited commercial messaging.\" Which — yes. My plan was to hire a VA to scale to 500 messages/day across LinkedIn, email, and Facebook groups. I've already created a second LinkedIn profile for this. The question is whether a third is overkill or just good redundancy. Has anyone dealt with this?\n\nThe other problem: I haven't paid myself in 11 months. My girlfriend keeps asking about this. I keep explaining that $4K MRR is essentially $48K ARR which is essentially a salary, the business just needs it right now. She asked when the business won't need it and I said probably around $15K MRR. She Googled how long that would take at my growth rate, showed me her phone, and didn't say anything. We had a quiet dinner. I've started referring to her as my \"co-founder\" in conversations because it feels more accurate than \"person who pays rent.\"\n\nThinking about raising prices from $49 to $79. Some customers already say $49 is a lot for automated text reminders, but I think they're undervaluing peace of mind. You can't put a price on peace of mind. Well, you can. It's $49. But it should be $79. I ran a Van Westendorp analysis on this but only surveyed myself.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Not linking the product because last time someone called it \"just Calendly with extra steps\" and I'm still processing that emotionally.\n\nEDIT: Sorry if i don't respond to your comment/dm, never got so many before so i'm adjusting.",

Like dental office manager Facebook groups, local dental associations, industry forums.\n\nPeople actively seeking a solution convert way better than cold outreach, and you avoid the legal gray area entirely. Plus you could probably get 2-3 referrals from each happy customer if you just asked.\n\nOn pricing: run the price increase test on new signups first. Grandfather existing customers. If 6 people signed up at $49, some will sign up at $79. The people who say $49 is a lot are not your real ICP anyway.\n\nWhat made the 14 referrals happen?

          "text": "Alright, so you've built a real business solving a real problem. $4K MRR in 11 months from a standing start is solid, especially in a niche this small. Most people talking on here never get past $0 MRR, so you're already ahead.\n\nBut let's address the actual problems:\n\n**The legal letter thing:**\n\nStop the scaled outreach plan immediately. You already know it's legally sketchy because someone literally sent you a letter about it. Hiring a VA to blast 500 messages a day with your second (and planned third) LinkedIn account isn't \"good redundancy,\" it's speedrunning an account ban and possibly a lawsuit.\n\nHere's what actually works at your scale without getting sued: double down on referrals. You said 6 customers referred 14 more. That's a 2.3x referral multiplier, which is insane for B2B SaaS. Most companies would kill for that. Build a referral program. Give existing customers $20 off per month for every practice they refer that converts. Or give them a free month after 3 referrals. Make it stupid easy and actually reward them.\n\nAlso, your churn is low because the product solves a genuine pain point. That means your customers probably know other office managers dealing with the same problem. Ask them directly: \"Who else do you know struggling with compliance reminders?\" Then ask for a warm intro, not their contact info to cold blast.\n\nYou'll get way more than 11 replies from 1,847 messages, and you won't need a legal defense fund.\n\n**The pricing thing:**\n\nYou're undercharging, but don't jump to $79 for existing customers. That's a 61% increase and you'll spike churn. Here's the play: grandfather existing customers at $49 forever (builds loyalty and referrals), charge new customers $79 starting now.\n\nRun it for 90 days. Track conversion rate on trials at the new price. If it tanks, you know $79 is too high for cold acquisition. If it holds, you just increased revenue by 61% on all new customers without touching churn.\n\nThe \"peace of mind\" positioning is fine, but the real value prop is \"your office manager gets 40 minutes back every week.\" That's 35 hours a year. If their hourly rate is $25, you're saving them $875/year for $588/year at $49/month. At $79/month it's $948/year, still ROI positive. Lead with that, not vibes about peace of mind.\n\n**The TAM concern:**\n\n4,200 practices (or 6,800 with vet) is small, but you're at 53 customers. That's 1.2% market penetration if we're being generous with the vet inclusion. You've got room to grow before TAM becomes the limiting factor. The bigger issue is that this market caps you around $340K ARR at 100% penetration and $49/month, which is... not a venture outcome, but is a reasonable lifestyle business if you can get to 20-30% penetration.\n\nIf you want to grow beyond that, you'll need to expand TAM (other healthcare verticals, international, add features that let you charge more) or accept this is a nice $100-200K/year business and optimize for profitability and your sanity.",

What I didn't understand is, did it take you 11 months to get to the current MRR? Or less? Try finding a good estimate, and keep that as a guideline. In general, you should increase the price, grandfather the current people, and see if you are able to at least hit that guideline in the following months.\n\nI'd also give you a wild idea and try a bigger number, something like $99. It might seem counterintuitive, but many see a more expensive product as something premium. Just be sure never to try and back down and say \"Oh yeah, we just recently raised the price\" or try to give a discount cause you feel bad. Do it as an experiment and see if it works.\n\nI'd also advise adding a yearly plan as well, something where you pay 9 months for the full year. It gives a good chunk on income early on, which you can use\n\n2. Now the important part, your girlfriend. She is totally in the right. You spent almost an entire year only to practically build a business with 0% margin. She is right to be worried and you should be at least a bit as well. This is not guaranteed to work even now and if it fails in the end it might be rough.\n\nPay yourself at least so you can cover half the rent or help somehow, get her to a nice dinner for once. You called her your co-founder, if you have a good enough accountant you can put those costs as business expenses.  \nBut I can't imagine your month to month costs for the business actually add up to the entire revenue. And if they are, you have to fix something. If you need 4k to keep a 4k business going, you're going to need 15k when it reaches 15k as well.\n\nYou are not a VC backed company, you are not here to do anything to grow revenue. You are a dude who is trying to make a living with a small product he built - that is your goal. If you are not able to take out a profit, it doesn't matter how much the product is making, the goal still failed.",

That's not one filter among five - it's the filter that makes the other four inevitable. If people are already spending money on a painful workaround, the business is practically designed for you: small market (small team), known demand (fast profitability), clear deliverable (productized).  \n  \nI'd flip the whole search. Instead of designing what the business looks like and then hunting for ideas that fit the shape, find three niches where money already flows toward tools people complain about.

It's somewhere in-between the two in that it monitors the entire website, but it also fills-in and tries out forms (although this part is not making MLP). On the other hand it doesn't require writing code in Playwright or Puppeteer or similar. \n\nSo it's very simple to set up compared to full E2E testing (as in, it just goes from one page and starts trying out links/logging forms) and it catches the types of problems that tend to happen at some point during production like a form stopping to work when an underlying service disappears or somebody changing a route and forgetting to update all the links or maintaining a redirect. \n\nIt turned out to be more complex to build than I was hoping. One of the large problems is that for running E2E tests even for 5 users can mean needing to scale up the hosts doing the scanning as it's quite memory/processor intensive, so unfortunately it's not just a single server + database.\n\nI started it because I needed it myself and although there are some competitors, I pretty much wouldn't be able to afford them. So worst case scenario - it's useful for at least myself. It already has been actually, because it's detected few issues in itself by now that I missed in my automated test suite.",

          "text": "This is exactly where I ended up. I run a small paint manufacturing company in Poland, and small-scale production is incredibly vulnerable to external factors. Right now our main supplier is out of key raw materials until March, and we're too small to stockpile a year's worth of inventory. That kind of dependency is what pushed me to start building a side software project with a $10-20K/month goal.\n\nThe idea came directly from our own pain. As a manufacturer, we were drowning in spreadsheets trying to track materials, batches, and production costs. Someone in this thread literally mentioned \"simple inventory management for industries stuck using pen and paper\" - that's almost word for word our problem and what we're solving.\n\nIt's a \"boring\" problem by every definition. But the hardest part isn't building, it's distribution. There are maybe 5 direct competitors in this niche, but most Google search queries overlap with enterprise ERP keywords where a single click costs $40+. You can't just throw money at ads. So you end up finding creative, non-obvious channels to reach people, which is both frustrating and kind of fun.",

In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from Rebelgrowth\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

I wasted a lot of time tweaking audience parameters when the real lever was always the ad itself.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add from my own experience — the $9 first month approach works great for getting people in the door, but watch out for the month 2 drop-off. When the price jumps from $9 to $97, you need the product experience in that first month to be really strong. I've seen founders do this successfully by having an automated \"win\" moment within the first 48 hours — something that makes the user feel like they've already gotten value.\n\n\n\nAlso curious about your churn numbers on the $97 plan specifically. Are most people who make it past month 2 sticking around, or is there another drop-off point?",

Si ton message ne convertit pas en organique, le payer ne le rendra pas meilleur, ça rendra juste l'échec plus cher.\n\nPar contre je nuancerais le point 7. \"Garder son job jusqu'à 1-2 ans de trésorerie\" c'est le conseil safe, et c'est le bon pour la plupart des gens. Mais j'ai étudié pas mal de lancements récemment et le pattern que je vois le plus chez ceux qui réussissent c'est un truc intermédiaire : ils gardent une source de revenus flexible (freelance, consulting, missions ponctuelles) plutôt qu'un CDI. Ça leur donne le cash pour survivre + le temps pour construire, sans le piège du 9-5 qui bouffe toute l'énergie créative.\n\nUn fondateur que je connais a fait exactement ça pendant 3 ans. Missions freelance quand il avait besoin de cash, SaaS le reste du temps. Le problème c'est qu'il n'avait pas de revenus réguliers, et chaque trou de trésorerie augmentait la pression sur ses décisions produit. Avec le recul il dit que son erreur c'était pas de se lancer — c'était de ne pas garder un filet minimum.\n\nEt le point 19 rejoint quelque chose que j'observe souvent : les fondateurs qui ont les meilleurs premiers mois sont ceux qui ont donné du temps en 1-1 gratuitement pendant des semaines/mois avant de lancer. Coaching, conseils, aider des gens en DM sans rien demander. Le jour du lancement, ces personnes achètent les yeux fermés parce que la confiance est déjà là.\n\nFélicitations pour les 12k/mois d'ailleurs. T'as mis combien de temps avant les premiers 1k ?",

I started with free but couldn't afford paying for everyone's accounts, so I removed the free plan from the signup page (for now). I had a few bots at first until I implemented phone number verification, but now both bot signups and user signups have dropped to zero. I even took a whole week to test my signup process and validate that it was working with test accounts.\n\nThe problem is if you don't have the capital to pay for someone else's account, you either need to get paying customers up front or find another way to support free accounts, like ads. I personally hate ads, but if they will support free accounts that convert eventually, then in time I can remove the ads when income becomes more sustainable.",

Then doing 20–30 1:1 conversations, pitching a simple landing page + Stripe link before adding features. HubSpot or Close can be overkill early, but even a spreadsheet plus Stripe is enough to track if your story lands.\n\nOn the daily posting point, I’ve found tools like Hypefury and manual Reddit searches useful, and lately Pulse alongside those to catch super specific Reddit threads right when people are asking about my niche.\n\nMain point: don’t just validate the SaaS, validate how you’ll repeatedly get in front of the same kind of buyer.",

      "text": "After watching a mind-bogglingly simple app cloning strategy video on Starter Story, I've gotten really into the app cloning space. *For the record, cloning isn't being a direct copycat - it can be finding what works, making it 1% better, cheaper, or applying to a different market.*\n\nI've been researching (what I think) is the best example of a crowded space where everyone is making money with only subtle variations on clones - **The Plant Identifier App** space.\n\n**8+ apps do essentially the same thing. They all make $100K-$13M/month.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the ecosystem works and some takeaways for how to apply the same strategies.\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → Get name → See relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $22M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# THE BREAKDOWN\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they were first in the space and are kings. \n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" (biggest numbers = perceived leader)\n* Latin pronunciation feature (tiny feature, but makes them seem sophisticated and as a \"serious botanical tool\")\n* Runs 300+ ads on Meta at any given time - crazy high adspend\n* $29.99/year pricing\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* First to go hard on paid acquisition\n* Obsessed with ASO - they rank #1 for every plant-related keyword\n* I've used it before (pre-LLMs) and it was impressive - made me go \"wow thats crazy\"\n\n**Clone lesson:** Be first and/or be willing to outspend on marketing\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Free for students and educators (viral growth in universities/social media)\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" (whatever the hell this is, but something for spiritual/astrology gardeners - different audience)\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature (human expert access)\n* Light meter tool (clever utility - measures if your spot has enough light)\n* Water calculator (another clever utility - tells you exactly how much)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Found audiences PictureThis wasn't serving\n* Free virality loop via social media\n* Added \"productivity tool\" features, not just identification\n* Ukraine-based team = lower costs\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't compete on the same features. Find an underserved use case or audience and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nBuilt by AIBY - a company that clones successful apps at scale.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't really\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n* They know paid acquisition better than most\n* Fast execution\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes you don't need differentiation, you just need solid distribution. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Launched in Turkish/regional markets first (less competition - an interesting strategy to discuss another day)\n* Better multi-language support\n* Expanded to English markets after proving the model\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded US expansion\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Targeted a completely different user base\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone lesson:** Don't start in the US. Start where it's cheaper to acquire users, then expand. Less rich users, but easier to capture market\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Won a Webby Award\n* Edible garden planning calendar (vegetable gardeners, not just houseplants)\n* Garden journal feature (track your plants over time)\n* \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" badge everywhere\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Awards = trust = \"this must be the best app\"\n* Carved out \"edible gardening\" niche that others ignored\n\n**Clone lesson:** Enter awards even if they're nonsense and get press. Social proof converts really well.\n\n# 6. Plantiary - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nAlso Turkey-based.\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Again, very little differentiation if any\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n* 8th place in a market this size still = $100K/month (especially for Turkey)\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to win, just need to float in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* Completely free. No ads. No subscription.\n* Open source, citizen science project\n* NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification\n* 68% accuracy (second-best tested)\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Being free made them the \"recommendation\" pick\n* Scientists and serious botanists use it (prestige)\n* Press (and customers) loves recommending free alternatives\n\n**Clone lesson:** Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They get grants, academic funding, and goodwill that pays off in other ways. I'm sure their employees are getting paid well.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30K/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nHow they differentiated:\n\n* They didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n\nWhat made them win:\n\n* Low overhead\n* $30K/month from a side project is still life-changing\n* Proof that even 10th place in a big market works\n\n**Clone lesson:** You don't need to build a huge business. A \"small\" slice of a massive market is still significant.\n\n# THE PATTERNS\n\nLooking across all 8 apps, here's what actually creates differentiation:\n\n**1. Audience niching**\n\n* PlantIn → students\n* Blossom → vegetable gardeners\n* Same product, different positioning\n\n**2. One \"hook\" feature**\n\n* Moon calendar (PlantIn)\n* Ask a botanist (PlantIn)\n* Edible garden planner (Blossom)\n* Latin pronunciation (PictureThis)\n\nNone of these are hard to build or are groundbreaking, but certain people want them.\n\n**3. Social proof**\n\n* Awards (Blossom's Webby)\n* Press coverage (PlantNet in NYT)\n* \"Most accurate\" claims (PictureThis)\n\n**4. Geographic strategy**\n\n* Start in smaller markets\n* Build profitably\n* Then expand\n\n**5. Just showing up**\n\n* Plantiary and LeafSnap prove you don't need to be special\n* A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market\n\n# THE TAKEAWAY\n\n\"Competition\" in this large market means:\n\n* 8+ apps making $100K+/month\n* The leader makes $13M/month\n* The 8th place player makes $100K/month",

      "text": "I have really no idea where to start from. I always wanted to do a startup ever since I remember. I came to Australia from Nepal with nothing but my whole life packed in 2 suitcases to study (and it’s been more than 3 years, I haven’t been home). I always wanted to earn money through startup, and I did try so may things to do, from software to hardware, even drop-shipping stuffs. Nothing nothing worked.\n\nSince last year, I started two different startups in software space, and did my best, but I couldn’t reach my goals, and earned no revenue. My University helped me with the startup through it’s entrepreneurship program, but it really didn’t get me anywhere tbh.\n\nSince few months, I got heavily invested in working with AI to make better apps and softwares, to earn living, I uses to work in a retail shop, do cleaning, work in hospitality, and what not. I did all kinds of stuff! It always bothered me that I was not doing my best, and I always use to hate myself for not standing up to follow my dreams. I have a best friend, and we did everything to get somewhere, whether it be applying to YCombinator with a startup idea, or pitching investors with a unready product…but we only failure.\n\n2 weeks ago my friend had a good enough idea that he decided to work for fun, and soon I joined him to build that idea with him. We got somewhere and boom 💥 we built something cool that gave amazing results. But we still didn’t know what to do, so we went on to show it to other people in local communities, design groups, entrepreneurship groups, and all…and immediately we started getting people signup all organically to few users. Just two days ago, we decided to launch it on ProductHunt, and all the whatsapp, discord, slack groups we know would have people who’d find this cool, I also tried to post in Reddit (but got removed because of low karma oops), and interestingly just few hours after the launch, we started getting a lot of people signups!!!!! I still feel like it’s a dream, seeing the users table in the database grow from 15 uers to 62 users it was crazy!!! And soon we got our first paid user and the second. Though we just got 12 upvotes, somehow it spread and people started to signup to the point that we are now at 118 users 😭. We had 7 paying customers till the morning today, and just few hours ago we got our 8th user. I still don’t know how to describe this feeling .\n\nThank you so much universe for everything! I had one of my best unexplainable feeling in the last 48 hours. I never thought a simple side project with an unsure idea would get this much traction.\n\nI have still no idea what I am doing and what will the future hold, but I swear I am not gonna give up, and try again and again until I achieve what I want. As of now, me and my friend are so serious about this, and we’re working hard to improve ourselves with all the feedbacks we got. But let’s see what happens next.\n\nThank you all 😭😭😭. you all will win too!!!\n\ncheck it out: [https://markup.one](https://markup.one)",

          "text": "The feeling you're describing right now is the most dangerous moment in a startup's life. Not because something is wrong, but because the high of those first paying users makes you want to do everything at once.\n\nI had the exact same experience. First few users came in, I felt invincible, and I immediately started thinking about scaling, marketing funnels, content strategies, partnerships. I tried to do all of it simultaneously. Result: I did nothing well and the momentum died within 3 weeks.\n\nHere's what I wish someone had told me at your stage:\n\nTalk to those 8 paying users like they're the only people on earth. Send them a personal message. Ask them why they paid. What almost stopped them from paying. What they'd need to see in the next month to keep paying. Their answers will be worth more than any growth strategy you'll find on Reddit.\n\nThe gap between 3 users and 100 users isn't a marketing problem. It's a retention and word-of-mouth problem. If those first 8 users love it enough to tell one friend each, you'll hit 100 without spending a dollar on marketing. If they don't love it enough to tell a friend, no amount of marketing will save you.\n\nDon't build new features. Resist the urge. Your product got 8 people to pay in its current state. Make that current experience bulletproof before adding anything.\n\nThe void feeling after ProductHunt is normal. Every founder I know describes the same post-launch crash. The dopamine spike of launch day followed by the silence of day 3. It doesn't mean something is wrong. It means the novelty wore off and now the real work starts.\n\nYou and your friend built something people paid for. That puts you ahead of 95% of builders who never get a single dollar from a stranger. Don't let the anxiety of \"what's next\" steal the fact that you just proved the hardest thing in startups: someone you've never met values what you made enough to give you money.",

Just a landing page.\n\nAnd it made me think about how backwards most of us do this.\n\nLike, most founders (myself included, guilty) do this: Build the thing → Launch it → Hope people care about it. Which is kind of insane when you think about it. You're basically betting months of work on a hunch.\n\nBut the really successful people I've been following? They flip it completely. They market first. They validate demand when it costs them literally nothing. Then they build.\n\nDropbox did this with a demo video and got 75k signups overnight.   \nRobinhood had a referral waitlist that hit a million users before they even had a real product. Buffer validated their entire business model with just a pricing page in 48 hours.\n\nThe pattern is wild once you see it.\n\nWhen you market before building, you're not just wasting time. You're actually testing if people give a shit. You're building an audience while you're in the development phase. You're validating demand with zero code written.\n\nThat last part is probably the biggest thing. If you can't get people excited about the problem you're solving before you build the solution, honestly... you probably shouldn't build it at all.\n\nThe best validation isn't code. It's attention.\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around how differently this changes everything. Like, we're so obsessed with shipping the perfect product that we forget to check if anyone actually wants it first.",

I have seen plenty of big waitlists turn into ghost towns after launch.\n\nMarketing first is great for de-risking demand, but it does not replace learning from real usage. Some problems only reveal themselves once people touch the product and get frustrated. The real trick is knowing what question you are validating at each step, attention, retention, or willingness to pay.",

I've seen landing pages convert at 30% for \"free early access\" and then 0.5% when you ask for a credit card.

      "text": "Hey Founders,\n\nI spent four years working in-house as an SEO specialist and on the agency side, handling various projects including SaaS, mobile apps, browser extensions, and even traditional B2B companies.\n\nOne question clients frequently asked was:\n\n**“Where should we list our product for backlinks and visibility?”**\n\nTo answer that, I started building my own directory and listing database, one entry at a time. This includes startups, SaaS directories, niche forums, free submission platforms, and local citations.\n\nThat effort has now resulted in a comprehensive list of over 820 hand-vetted places to list your startup. I've used this list myself and with more than 20 clients, and it consistently:\n\n- Provides early backlinks\n- Drives discovery traffic\n- Improves brand visibility\n- Gets you featured on roundup blogs and “best tools” lists\n\nMost of these listings are free. Some require manual entry, while others allow for API or submission tools.\n\nI’ve also added filters to help you navigate the list:\n\n- SaaS only\n- Local (USA/Canada)\n- AI Tools\n- Chrome Extensions\n- App Store/Alt Store listings\n- Funding-focused sites\n- Backlinks categorized by Domain Rating (DR) and indexing speed\n\nI created [this tool to automate directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) (so you don’t spend 8 hours filling out the same form). Founders are using it to secure 20–40 live links in just a week!\n\nFinally, I’m sharing the exact SEO checklist I used for my consulting clients, something I charged $1,500+ for, which I’m now giving away for free. No email gate, just good karma.\n\nIf you're interested, comment “send,” and I’ll share the full Notion document with you.",

I've been in a similar boat, trying to boost visibility for my side project.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is to not just blindly submit *everywhere*. Focus on quality over quantity. A link from a relevant, reputable site is way more valuable than 10 from sketchy directories. Also, make sure your listings are consistent across all platforms - name, description, etc. Google really seems to appreciate that consistency. Good luck, hope it helps!",

Start by tagging every directory with UTM params and a simple “intent” label (founders, devs, buyers, general traffic). Then watch which sites actually send signups or trials, not just clicks or DR. After 2–3 weeks, prune the ones that send junk and rewrite your listing copy for the 5–10 that are converting.\n\n\n\nI’ve had better results when I tailor the landing page by category (AI tools page for AI directories, comparison page for “best X” sites, feature page for niche forums) instead of dumping everything on the homepage. Also worth pairing this with Reddit/communities: use things like SparkToro, Ahrefs alerts, and Pulse for Reddit-style monitoring to catch threads where people ask for tools in your niche and drop your best-performing angle there.\n\n\n\nMain point: the gold isn’t the 820 links alone, it’s iterating on which 10 actually move revenue.",

      "text": "I've been doing B2B outreach for 3 years and this is hands down the most effective prospecting hack I've ever found.\n\nMost people are out here buying garbage lead lists or cold emailing random companies.\n\nMeanwhile I'm literally taking my competitors' best prospects and reaching out to them FIRST.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n\n\nThe \"Company Switch\" Hack\n\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator lets you filter by \"Company\" and \"Past Company.\"\n\nHere's what most people don't realize:\n\nIf you work at a marketing agency and want to find prospects who are actively looking for marketing help...\n\nJust look at who's following or engaging with your competitors.\n\nThese people are ALREADY interested in what you sell. They're not cold. They're warm.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Go to your top 3 competitors' LinkedIn company pages\n2. Look at their followers (or people engaging with their posts)\n3. Filter by your ideal job title (CMO, VP Marketing, Head of Growth, etc.)\n4. These people are actively researching solutions like yours\n\nBut here's the real hack...\n\nThe \"Influencer Scrape\" Method\n\nThis one's even better.\n\nFind 5-10 influencers in your niche who post about topics related to your product.\n\nExample: If you sell sales software, find people posting about cold email, outbound, SDR tips, etc.\n\nNow look at WHO'S ENGAGING with their content.\n\nThe people commenting \"Great post!\" or \"This is gold\" on sales content are:\n\n\\- Actively thinking about sales\n\n\\- Engaged and online\n\n\\- Self-identifying as interested in your space\n\nThese aren't cold leads. These are people who literally raised their hand and said \"I care about this topic.\"\n\nI've gotten 40-50% reply rates reaching out to these people because my message is: \"Saw you commenting on \\[influencer\\]'s post about \\[topic\\]. Thought you might find this relevant...\"\n\nIt's not cold outreach. It's warm outreach disguised as cold.\n\nThe tools:\n\nYou can use Trigify to scrape LinkedIn engagers and export them. Works well if you just need the data.\n\nBut honestly I use my own tool  Linkedify because:\n\n\\- It scrapes AND reaches out in one workflow\n\n\\- No more exporting CSVs, importing to another tool, deduping, etc.\n\n\\- You can set up automations that find new engagers daily and reach out automatically\n\nThe difference is like 2 hours of manual work vs. 10 minutes of setup.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\\- Week 1: 47 connection requests sent → 31 accepted → 12 conversations → 5 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 2: 52 sent → 38 accepted → 14 conversations → 7 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 3: You get the idea\n\nThe quality of these leads is insane because they're ALREADY warm. They follow competitors. They engage with niche content. They're in-market.\n\nStop buying lead lists. Start hunting where your buyers already are.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nInstead of cold outreach to random people, scrape your competitors' followers and influencers' engagers. These people are already interested in your space. Use Trigify for data export or Linkedify if you want scraping + outreach in one tool. My reply rates went from 3% to 40%+ using this method.\n\nHappy hunting. 🎯",

Where this usually goes wrong is when people confuse warm context with permission and then blast generic pitches at scale.\n\nAlso worth saying: the moment you automate scraping + outreach aggressively, LinkedIn tolerance, brand trust, and reply quality tend to fall off fast. High reply rates early often don’t survive volume.\n\nGood targeting idea, but the real differentiator is still the message and restraint, not the tool stack.",

Or they're just scrolling and double-tapping everything. I wasted probably 2 weeks reaching out to people who were interested in the topic but had zero budget or authority.  \n  \nWhat helped was adding one more filter: looking at recent job changes or promotions. If someone just became Head of Sales and they're engaging with sales content, that's a much stronger signal than just engagement alone.  \n  \nThe other thing I'd add is that video messages work ridiculously well with this warm audience. When you can reference the specific post they commented on and show your face, it feels less like automation (even if parts of your process are automated). I've seen response rates jump quite a bit just by swapping text for a quick 30-second video.  \n  \nHow are you handling the actual outreach message?

          "text": "You are hitting the classic wall between “design tools” (Beautiful.ai) and “automation tools.”\nIf your main pain point is scale and personalization (not just pretty slides), stop looking at pure design tools.\nTome pivoted hard into exactly this use case recently. They are building specifically for sales teams to auto-inject prospect data (logo, name, specific pain points) into templates. It’s less “creative canvas” and more “deal-closing machine.”\nGamma is great for speed and looking modern/web-native (perfect for async sending), but for live 1:1 calls, it can feel a bit too casual for enterprise buyers.\nThe Pro Workflow:\nDon’t over-engineer the visuals. Pick Beautiful.ai for the “Master Deck” (locked branding so sales reps can’t ruin it) and use their “Smart Slides” for the variable data. It constrains you, but that’s a feature, not a bug, when scaling without designers.\nIf you really want to automate (e.g., generate a deck from a CRM trigger), you might need to look at Google Slides API + Zapier, but that’s a build, not a buy.",

The approach that’s worked for us is: 1) lock a tight master template, 2) automate population, not design. We had a designer spend real time in Keynote and Google Slides to build 2–3 on-brand templates with clear slots: hero problem statement, 3 proof points, logos, 1 case study, pricing, etc. Then we wired up AI only to fill in those slots. \n\n\n\nConcrete flow: CRM → pull industry, role, company size, tech stack → feed into Claude or ChatGPT to draft tailored copy chunks and a short story arc → paste into the fixed template. For faster assembly, Templafy / Qwilr / Canva Docs have been better than generic slide tools for us; lately we’ve been testing Pulse alongside things like Clay and Apollo to mine Reddit and other channels for extra social proof and real phrasing prospects use. \n\n\n\nPoint is: pick any AI slide tool you like, but make the deck system template-first and AI-second so it feels crafted, not generated.",

We kept our proposal decks simpler but started sending personalised video messages walking through the deck instead of just emailing PDFs. It let us use a basic template but the personalisation came through in the actual walkthrough, pointing out the bits relevant to their specific situation.  \n  \nThe competitor comparison slide especially - instead of trying to customise that for each prospect in the deck itself, I'd just screen record myself talking through it with their name and specific pain points mentioned. Took 3-4 minutes per prospect vs 20-30 minutes redesigning slides.  \n  \nIt won't solve your scaling issue completely, but we found prospects engaged way more with a video + simple deck than a beautifully designed static proposal. Response rates jumped quite a bit.  \n  \nOut of curiosity, are you finding prospects actually want these heavily customised decks upfront, or could you get away with a solid template and customise deeper once there's real interest?",

Might be closer to your automation goal since it preserves what you already have.\n\nFor the AI-generated look - use your own brand templates as base. Start with your company colors, fonts, and slide layouts. Let AI fill content and adapt copy, but keep the visual foundation consistent.\n\nInclude one human touch per deck. Small stuff like hand-drawn arrows on key slides, actual team photos on the team slide, a handwritten note on pricing.

You are reaching out to people who are in a \"static\" state, so you have to work 10x harder to persuade them.\n\nThe Solution: Target Moments, Not People.\n\nInstead of scraping broad lists, look for Trigger Events that make your service an immediate priority:\n\n1. Recent Hires: A new Head of Marketing or Product usually has a budget and a mandate to change tools/processes.\n2. Visible Friction: If you find a bug on their site, a slow checkout, or a missing feature their users are complaining about on Twitter - that is your \"in.\"\n3. Recent Launches: Companes are most vulnerable and attentive right after a new release.\n\nThe \"Qualified Founder\" Workflow:\n\n* Step 1: Stop asking \"Who is my buyer?\" and start asking \"What problem are they desperately trying to solve this specific month?\"\n* Step 2: Find 10 companies experiencing that \"moment\" right now.\n* Step 3: Reach out with zero fluff. Don't be \"clever\" or \"persuasive.\" Just show up as the solution to the thing already on their mind.\n\nWhen you hit a buyer during an active moment of pain, you don't sound like a \"spammy salesman\" -you sound like a lucky coincidience.\n\nSlow down the volume, increase the context, and stop selling to \"abstract\" users.

What makes a lead “good”\n3 signals:\n\t•\tThey’re already trying to solve the problem (job posts, tools, hiring SDRs)\n\t•\tThey have revenue (or funding)\n\t•\tYou can clearly see the pain on their site\n\nIf I couldn’t explain why they’d care in 10 seconds, I didn’t contact them.\n\n4.

Start there.\n\nEmail is your best channel starting from zero, full stop. Instagram DMs and LinkedIn messages have brutal character limits and low response rates compared to a well written cold email. With our clients who started from scratch, the ones who got traction fastest all did the same thing. They picked one specific type of business to target, built a list of 200 to 300 contacts, and sent short personalized emails that led with a specific problem they solve rather than introducing themselves. Nobody cares who you are, they care what you can fix for them.\n\nThe \"sounding spammy\" fear is what keeps most people from ever sending enough volume to see results. You need to send at least 500 to 1000 emails before you have enough data to judge what's working. That's not spam, that's testing. Keep your emails under 80 words, ask one simple question, and don't pitch your whole service in the first message. Your only goal with email one is to start a conversation, not close a deal.\n\nNiche down before you send a single email. \"I help businesses\" is invisible, \"I help dental practices get more patients through X\" gets responses.

Every day I’d answer 2–3 posts with something concrete: a loom video, a mini checklist, or a quick script/snippet.

They're right there on the product page. That means your prospecting workflow can be way more targeted than \"scrape a list and blast emails.\"\n\nHere's what I'd actually do in your shoes:\n\n**1. Build your list from Shopify/ecommerce directories, not Google.**\n\nTools like Store Leads, BuiltWith, or even the Shopify app store reviews let you filter by niche, platform, and size. You want stores doing roughly $10K-$100K/month (big enough to care about conversion, small enough to not have an in-house photographer). The subjtochange comment in this thread about purchasing GDPR-compliant store lists is a real option too.\n\n**2. Audit before you outreach.**\n\nVisit their product pages. You're looking for specific visual problems: inconsistent backgrounds, bad lighting, phone-quality images mixed with studio shots, missing lifestyle/context photos, products photographed on a kitchen table. Screenshot the ones that are obvious. This takes 2-3 minutes per store, but it's the entire foundation of your outreach.\n\n**3. Your email writes itself once you've done step 2.**\n\nSomething like: \"Noticed your \\[specific product\\] listings are using mixed photo styles, some studio, some more casual. That inconsistency usually hurts conversion on product pages. I put together a quick before/after mock-up for one of your SKUs, would it be useful to see it?\"\n\nThat's not a pitch. It's a demonstrated observation with proof of work. The response rate on this kind of message vs. \"Hi, I offer product photography services\" is night and day.\n\n**4. The \"moment\" everyone keeps mentioning? For ecommerce, it's seasonal.**\n\nYour warmest prospects are stores about to enter a selling season (Q4 holiday, back-to-school, summer launch). Reach out 6-8 weeks before, when they're actively prepping their catalog. A store updating their listings in October is already too late. The ones doing it in September are your buyers.\n\n**5. One channel, 30 days, no switching.**\n\nCold email for this niche, specifically because you can attach or link visual examples. DMs work too (especially Instagram if the brand is active there), but email lets you embed the before/after or link a quick Loom showing their product page vs. what it could look like. Start with 15-20 personalized emails per day. Not templates with a {first\\_name} merge tag: actual emails referencing actual product pages.\n\nThe reason most outreach from zero feels impossible is that people are trying to sell to strangers who have no reason to care. When you show someone a screenshot of their own product page next to a better version, you skip the \"why should I care\" step entirely. That's your edge. Use it.",

The scraping/research part eats up so much time and you're right that most lists end up being garbage. One thing that worked for early SaaS founders I know: they focused on places where their ideal customers were already asking questions.\n\nReddit threads, niche Slack communities, industry forums. Not pushing offers, just answering questions helpfully with a light mention of what they're building. The conversion rate is way lower than email but the quality is 10x better because people are already in problem-solving mode.\n\nFor the email side, the biggest difference maker seems to be starting super narrow. Like not \"e-commerce companies\" but \"Shopify stores selling pet supplies doing $50-100k/month\". Makes the research harder but your message can actually speak to their specific situation.\n\nIf Reddit is part of your strategy, there are done-for-you services that handle the posting and engagement for you so you don't have to monitor threads all day or risk looking spammy. I came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions.com) recently and it seems like a good fit for B2B companies that want the organic reach without the time sink or ban risk. They handle finding the right convos and posting, which honestly sounds way better than trying to do it yourself while also building product.\n\nThe 30-day thing: I'd pick one channel, set a realistic daily number (like 10 personalized emails), and track reply rate obsessively. Most peopel give up after like 50 emails but you need way more data than that to know if your messaging works.",

      "text": "If you want to scale your marketing with influencers but dont want to burn cash on bad deals, get scammed by fake bot views, or waste months listening to \"gurus\" who have never actually booked a sponsorship... then you might enjoy this.\n\nI work as a Marketing Director for a pretty big brand and I also run my own SaaS on the side. \n\nBetween the two, I've hired over a thousand influencers and spent millions in partnership dollars.\n\nHere is the brain dump on what actually works:\n\nYouTube longform first until you max out on youtube longform, dont do any other format.\n\nNothing beats the power of the attention spam and the direct CTA with link in description as longform does.\n\nIgnore all the gurus telling you to hire one million micro influencers on TikTok, even if you’re target audience is on TikTok/Reels, I guarantee there are also channels on youtube with longform videos for that same audience, dont waste your time don’t lose your sanity, do longform until there’s none else to partner with on that format.\n\nYou need to have a solid proven offer before you try influencers. Have scarcity in the CTA, like “First 1,000 people to click the link get this special offer”\n\nTest 60 second integrations vs fully dedicated videos (more expensive). Have them put the 60 second promo in the first 5 minutes of the video to maximize eyeballs on your offer.\n\nBeware of scammers, several channels inflate their views and engagement with bots, look for suspiciously consistent high views across all videos, look for repeated and sometimes identical comments praising the influencer, too many emojis, and celebrities in the profile pictures even.\n\nIf you’re a startup strap for cash, you will want to push for commission only deals, for my startup Rebelgrowth, that’s 30% on every generated subscription for life, but in my experience most influencers don’t like performance deals even when they would be making more money in the long term, they dont know this so its your job to explain the math on why this is the case, make a simple spreadsheet, make a loom video, praise their last video, explain why you think your startup would be a great fit and explain why the commission offer is better than flat rate.\n\nHowever, if you’re an established startup/company with a budget, you’ll want to do flat rate deals because YOU will make more money in the long term as opposed to having to pay 30% of your revenue forever.\n\n30% of deals will succeed, those are the channels you will want to nurture and repeat and that will carry the whole effort, another reason why you need to stay away from flat rate as a bootstrapped startup, you can’ afford to have your first 10 deals fail looking for the 3 that will work. This is a numbers game.\n\nWhat I look for in a channel (this is less important when doing performance deals): Audience affinity; how relevant is the topic to your business, what are audience demographics (age, location, genre), how consistent are views across the last 12 videos, how often does the channel publish, what’s the engagement rate (high engagement = high conversions), I can afford more on a channel with 7,000 views but 15% engagement rate than a channel with 10,000 views but 5% engagement rate. Engagement is comments to subs (or views) rate.\n\nOn flat rates, always negotiate down aggressively, argue why with the channels using your analysis from the above paragraph. I personally look for sub $50 CPMs when doing flat rate (irrelevant when doing commission deals).\n\nTo find channels, ask your favorite AI chat to do “Deep Research” and find the top 100 channels that meet your preferred criteria. If doing commissions, aim for small channels to improve your chances of getting a “yes”, so channels with under 10k subs. You can also simply search youtube, or one of the millions of apps out there that have a youtubers database. Gather the list and then it's time to find the emails. I pay a guy on upwork $50 per 100 researched channels because youtube only lets you unlock 5 emails per day. This guy has a bunch of accounts he uses to unlock emails quicker.\n\nOnce you have the emails, use your favorite outreach tool to schedule 4 - 7 emails (the money is in the followups). Keep it simple, lead with “Paid sponsorhip?...” in the subject and first line of email copy so the influencer knows you’re down to business.\n\nHave dedicated landing pages per influencer or dedicated coupon codes or if you’re doing affiliate commissions it doesn’t really matter since they will have their affiliate link to your product anyways.\n\nYou’ll want to stay compliant if you’re a big company, which means making sure the influencer clearly discloses its a sponsorship when the Ad begins, have them put your logo as soon as they say the video is sponsored by your company.\n\nCheers\n\n[**Borja, let's connect i'm looking for a cofounder**](https://x.com/borja_obeso)",

In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

The burnout pattern I've seen: revenue grows but you're still doing everything, so revenue per unit of your time stays flat (or drops).\n\nTwo technical approaches that helped similar stage founders:\n\n**1. Instrument your time brutally** - Track what actually causes the interrupt-driven days. Often it's: support requests that could be self-serve, manual ops that could be scripted, or decisions that could be delegated with better context/documentation. Fix the top 3 time drains with automation or better systems first.\n\n**2. Hire for your specific bottleneck, not a general role** - At this ARR you can't hire a team, but you can hire ONE person who removes your top constraint. If it's support volume, hire for that specifically. If it's sales follow-up, hire for that. Don't hire a \"general VA\" - hire to eliminate your #1 time drain.\n\nThe burnout often isn't the volume of work - it's doing too many context switches between wildly different types of work. Reducing that variety (even if total hours stay same) can change the feeling dramatically.",

If the main need is mental load sharing, a high-agency ops hire + clear ownership can get you 70% of the benefit with way less risk.\n\nCurious: what’s actually crushing you right now — support volume, incidents, sales calls, or just context switching?",

I spent a few months on the YC matcher and I just didn't meet any perfect fits and most people want to start from day 1, while I continue to grow it solo. Maybe next time! \n\nGoing forward in your spot I would look at your weaknesses and start there. Hire a primary engineer if you're not a high level engineer, hire a sales person if you don't do well in sales, hire a support team if you're struggling there. Having a backup in case something happens to you is the biggest thing the financial people are looking for wine they say you need a co-founder. The good thing is that you probably have a lot of margin to work with at that ARR so you can make a mistake and it won't hurt too bad.  \n\nYou may also want to look into some VC funding and accelerate growth at that point. Then you can get their expertise too. Find other SaaS providers in your industry too and get their advice. I'm in a specific B2B niche and everyone has been so helpful, other than the 3 companies I'm disrupting. If you can find some peers to learn from in your industry that will help a lot.",

Revenue doesn’t automatically relieve pressure; sometimes it amplifies it because there’s now more to maintain and more at stake.\n\nI haven’t been at your exact number solo, but I’ve hit that “I am the system” phase before. The biggest shift for me wasn’t finding a co-founder immediately, but it was buying back my time in very unsexy ways. First support contractor. Then someone part-time for ops. Even 10–15 hours a week off your plate changes your mental state. You don’t need a visionary partner first. You might need oxygen.\n\nOn the YC point, I don’t think it’s crazy, but I’d be careful about using YC primarily as a co-founder matching service. A partner found under pressure can solve burnout short-term but create misalignment long-term. If you do look for one, optimize for values, working style, and stress compatibility, not just skill gap.\n\nAnd on burnout… momentum isn’t just about pushing harder. Sometimes it’s about redesigning the machine so it doesn’t require you to be the engine. You’ve proven the product works.

Audit your week honestly. Track where your hours actually go for 7 days. Most solo founders discover they're spending 40-60% of their time on support and ops, not building.\n\n2. Hire for the role you hate most, not the one you think sounds strategic. If support is eating you alive, a senior support person who can also do light QA will give you back 20+ hours a week overnight.\n\n3. Skip the cofounder search at this stage. At k ARR you have leverage. You can hire a strong operator or a fractional COO/CTO without giving up equity. A cofounder made sense at zero revenue. At k, what you need is a great first hire.\n\n4. YC is great, but using it primarily to find a cofounder when you already have product-market fit and real revenue feels like using a sledgehammer for a nail. Their value is in network and scaling advice, not matchmaking.\n\nThe burnout you're feeling isn't from lack of a partner. It's from lack of leverage. One great hire changes everything.",

Burnout at this stage is normal, not a failure.  \nWhen you’re doing support, dev, sales, roadmap, and firefighting alone, you’re not running a SaaS anymore… you’re carrying one.  \nThat pressure compounds fast.\n\n2. Finding a co‑founder after traction is absolutely possible.  \nPeople love to say “you need a co‑founder from day one,” but the truth is:  \nRevenue is the strongest filter for aligned partners.  \nPlenty of operators, technical leads, and ex‑founders would join a proven product over a pre‑idea gamble.\n\n3. YC isn’t crazy, but it’s not the only path.  \nYC gives you a network, accountability, and potential co‑founders, but you’d be giving up equity for something you may be able to solve with:  \n- a senior engineer  \n- a fractional CTO  \n- a support lead  \n- or a true operations partner  \n\n4. The real question is: what kind of help do you actually need?  \nA co‑founder solves emotional load and strategic load.  \nA hire solves operational load.  \nBurnout usually comes from the second one.\n\n5. Momentum comes back when the load is shared.  \nSolo founders don’t burn out because they’re weak, they burn out because they’re doing the work of 4 people under the pressure of 1 person’s brain.\n\nYou’ve already done the hardest part:  \nYou built something people pay for.  \nNow it’s about building the structure that lets you keep going without breaking.\n\nCurious what part of the business drains you the most right now support, dev, or decision fatigue?",

Few things that helped me:\n\nOn the cofounder thing -> at your stage I'd skip that honestly. You don't need someone to figure out what to build. You need someone to help you run it. A senior hire with equity upside will solve 80% of what you're feeling without the mess of splitting the company.\n\nYC -> great for 0 to 1. You're past that. Giving up 7% to find a partner feels expensive when you could just hire well.\n\nOn burnout -> this one hit home for me. The thing that actually helped wasn't hiring. It was cutting the number of decisions I had to make every day. I was spending hours staring at dashboards trying to figure out what needs my attention. Once I set up systems that basically told me \"hey, this thing is broken, go fix it\" instead of me hunting for problems manually, it freed up a ton of mental space.\n\nThat mental energy thing is real. Solo founders don't burn out from work. They burn out from decisions.\n\nMy honest take: before you look for a cofounder or apply to YC, audit how many daily decisions you're making that could be automated or delegated. You might be surprised how much breathing room that creates.",

      "text": "Built 4 different SaaS between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing SaaS that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org) Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as SaaS. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building SaaS for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your SaaS failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

They were competing against tools people already used and had workflows built around. Reaching 10,000 agents on LinkedIn wouldn't have mattered because they already had a CRM. You'd be asking them to migrate data, retrain habits, convince their team. That's not a distribution wall - that's a switching wall. And more reach doesn't fix switching friction.  \n  \nThe content calendar worked because newsletter creators were doing that job with Notion templates and Google Sheets. The job existed, nobody owned it, switching cost was basically zero. You weren't convincing anyone to leave a tool - you were replacing a workaround.  \n  \n\"Can I reach 5,000 people for free\" is a good filter but it's incomplete. The second question is: are those people currently using a purpose-built tool for this, or are they duct-taping something together? Reachable + workarounds = organic growth. Reachable + entrenched tool = the same wall you hit, just with better targeting.  \n  \nBoth feel like \"I can't get customers\" from your side.

For the next SaaS, maybe try front-loading all your marketing *before* you even start building. I'm talking building up an audience on social media, writing blog posts, running free workshops, anything to establish a pre-existing community that's hungry for your solution. Think of them as your initial user base and marketing team rolled into one. Seeing the traction and engagement *before* you commit to coding can save you a ton of heartache.\n\nI totally get the frustration of putting tons of time into something no one sees. Since this is my YouTube channel, and video is my bread and butter, I've been obsessed with validating ideas *before* I spend days filming and editing. I actually built a tool called videoscore.app (still in early access, launching March 2026) to help with this. It analyzes video ideas and gives them a score, so you know whether it has potential to get views. It's been a lifesaver for avoiding videos that just sit there with zero views. It's a $9/month plan, but that tool might help in your next marketing endeavors.\n\nAlso, have you considered leaning into partnerships? Find complimentary businesses that already have the audience you're looking for and see if you can collaborate. Maybe offer them a free month of your SaaS in exchange for promoting it to their user base. Could be way cheaper than even thinking about paid ads!",

You ship code quicker, spin up an MVP in days, crank out SEO pages, even draft outreach emails without breaking a sweat. Execution gets cheap. Almost too cheap.\n\nBut here’s the catch: none of that creates demand by itself.\n\nMarketing isn’t about how fast you can build. It’s about distribution. About being where your users already hang out, understanding the problem they actually feel (not the one you wish they felt), and showing up there again and again. Quietly, consistently.\n\nMost SaaS products don’t die because the tech is bad. They die because marketing starts after the product is “done”, instead of growing alongside it from day one.\n\nAI is a force multiplier, sure.

Add columns for “approved date,” “referral traffic,” “signups,” and “anchor/angle used.” Use smaller, faster-approving directories to A/B test your positioning, then roll the best-performing angle into higher-leverage launches (PH, Betalist, StackSocial, etc.). Add UTMs by directory so GA4 can tell you which ones actually send buyers vs. random tourists.\n\n\n\nI’ve used Product Hunt and Indie Hackers for bursts, then Reddit search + F5Bot + Pulse for Reddit alerts to catch those “what tools are you using for X?” threads that convert like crazy.\n\n\n\nPoint is: the grindy stuff compounds if you keep iterating the sheet as a live funnel, not a one-time chore.",

We started answering questions in Reddit, Discord servers, forums where our target users hang out. Not selling, just genuinely helping. Like someone asks \"how do I handle support for my Discord community\" and we share what we learned. After a few months people started DMing us asking what we use. That's when we mention our product.\n\n\\- Content that shows the actual problem being solved works way better than feature lists. Nobody cares that you have \"advanced AI algorithms\" but they do care if you show \"here's how to reduce support tickets by 60% without hiring.\" Specific, outcome-focused, showing not telling.\n\n\\- Also get comfortable being visible even though it's awkward.

Those people already have the \"problem awareness\" you need.\n\nAnd often, they are googling the competitor because they saw them on Facebook Ad first.\n\nThis means Facebook targeted those people because they are \"buyers\", they have triggered a conversion event before.\n\nThe goal is to have a better offer than anyone else and pin it right in the headline. A better offer can be price, features, bundles, both?\n\nJust better value for whatever is being paid\n\nFor me, the headline is usually something like: Automate SEO: Outrank Today | 3 Days Free + $9 First Month.\n\nOr \"Automate SEO and Social Media in One Single Place\"\n\nBecause none of my competitors also offer Social Media automation.\n\nI pin those because it is unusual and it stops the scroll.\n\nAvoid putting the competitor's name in your actual ad text.\n\nYou can try it, but you risk trademark violations and getting your account flagged.\n\nInstead, focus on the main benefit your product solves that they don't.\n\nForget about trying out a million headline variations like Google suggests in their \"Responsive Search Ads.\"\n\nGoogle wants you to test everything so they can spend more of your money.\n\nI prefer to take control and pin the headlines that I know convert based on my funnel data.\n\nLaunch with a single landing page for everyone. With a headline that addresses why you're better than all of your competitors. Here you can name them.\n\nYou can get fancy later and build dedicated landing pages for each competitor.\n\nA page that says \"Why \\[Your Company\\] is the best alternative to \\[Competitor\\]\" works wonders.\n\nBut if you are just starting out, you can test the waters with a single landing page that addresses the main pain points of your niche.\n\nAsk an AI to help you draft the comparison points with a \"Deep Research\" run, most providers have this feature, and get moving.\n\nBid on the people who are already looking for a solution and hit them with an offer they can't ignore.\n\nAfter you get this dialed, you can move on to high buying intent keywords, which is more work because ideally you want to have one lander per keyword and many keywords to make up volume.\n\nHave you tried Google Ads before? I would love to hear if you have found winning tactics to compliment something like this.\n\nThanks  \nAria from [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

What kind of Saas tool? b2b? B2C? Ur example tells me AOV is of course lower as it’s a Martech software. \n\nEven then, your RSA advice is spot on, but your keyword segmentation isn’t clear here.. are we saying competitor segmented ad groups? What KW modifiers… comparison focused ones? What’s the MSV for these? Or are you saying phrase or exact match on competitors without any modifiers to tailor copy on ads and LP to search intent? Also key note… you will most definitely be paying a premium in such comp. focused kw in an auction with lower CVR and CTR especially if it’s not geared towards comp aware prospects who are seeking alts.\n\n Also why wouldn’t you tailor it to your competitor within that ad group? Ur catch all LP won’t be a silver bullet for majority of brands cuz unless you have a UVP so strong that it trumps all the other UVPs your comp has… (and even this is an understatement). \n\nLastly… your tip on having a better offer or having a strong differentiator is more related to PMF within the comp. landscape… and I’m stoked for you on that… but what about your comp does auction insight analysis… sees you there… does a dive into what you are running & then if they have a PMM… they flag it to PE and your UVP is no longer U but just a VP that isn’t proprietary. But most importantly… what’s your LTV:CAC breakdown on these? What’s churn rate?\n\nAs I mentioned SaaS search marketing is much harder to create a template for. What works from my experience both as a consultant and in house individual…. Know your ICP & TAM, depending on your industry ICP structure you will likely have a primary industry & then a couple more…. This allows you to rationalize what UVPs align with the DM and what works for the champion.
