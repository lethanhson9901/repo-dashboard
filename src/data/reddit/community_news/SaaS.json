      "text": "So tired of these posts here which bring down all the value people put into their products. \n\nIt seems to be a general consensus on this subreddit that now you can build anything in under a day and there's absolutely no moat in the development.\n\nI disagree with this claim. \n\nPerhaps it's because I'm building something thought-out and meaningful, and not something that can be easily replicated in 8 hours? I'm a pretty good developer, I'm using Claude Code and Windsurf, I have a very solid and modular architecture and very clean and maintainable code in my product.\n\nAdding features, updating and removing them - I can do it extremely fast with Claude.\n\nAnd yet.... it takes me MONTHS of work to make it really good. \n\nNot only coding, but also planning out, learning, going through trial and errors, developing and re-developing features to finally GET THEM RIGHT. \n\nAnyone who says can they do it in a day, or a week, or even a month - I just don't believe them. Either they are just lying, or simply not competent enough to see the flaws of their product comparing to competitors.\n\nSure, you can create something that \\*seems\\* to replicate a mature and very thought-out tool. It will look and feel the same, and someone will even pay for it. But realistically, even if AI speeds up your work X10, it doesn't change the fact that you have to iterate, learn, build and re-build stuff over and over. And it takes TIME.\n\nFar more time than 8 hours of work. Far more than months of work. That is, if you're building something real.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one who thinks that way and who feels annoyed at all this crap that devalues the actual work people put into their projects.",

              "text": "I dont know why people selling Vibecoding tools do this false marketing. I work for a startup in the same space and we have multiple people building SaaS products on our platform (nonbios.ai) - and even the simplest ones takes a month to build something barely usable. The more ambitious ones have been at it for 3+ months - and they are building pretty much 10 hours a day. \n\nOne of our users built marketcity.org - a classified marketplace for Europe - with some interesting features - like bidding on listings - pay to market on whatsapp - but otherwise mostly a standard classifieds product. And this took upwards of 2 months with him working pretty much full time. And this is just getting started - I think it will be months before this can be ready to launch at scale. \n\nOne thing vibe coding has definitely done - is to make tech accessible. Some of our biggest users would never have build their SaaS if it wasnt for vibecoding. But it still takes real commitment and hours to get something moving. And most importantly you have to be ready to 'learn' a little bit of software engineering. You cant just fly blind and expect AI to do all the work. Our most successfull users are actually the ones who have used our platform to learn more about how software is built and used that knowledge to build their SaaS. If you account for marketing - and getting your first buyers, I think people should provision for atleast an year for any real traction.\n\nBut this is the other aspect of making tech accessible - semi-tech users and users who are willing to 'learn' can now start building themselves instead of finding someone on free lancer and expect to have a more predictable path to building out their SaaS. This in itself is a huge upgrade from what was possible a couple of years ago and I wish the vibecoding platforms would be more upfront and honest about it.",

Some of my colleagues would take a few days to get started because they aren’t used to standing things up outside our work patterns, but I do this stuff all the time.\n\nI can setup a full stack app with auth and deploy a wireframe in a new domain in 45 minutes. I’ve done it several times. Then, I have 7 more hours to add features.\n\nIt’s all about the idea now. I repeat the same patterns so I don’t fuss with the api or db or auth anymore, it’s just repeatable shit.\n\nTHIS PATTERN DOESNT FIT EVERYTHING, but the quickest workstream I have is AWS Amplify with a graphql api against dynamodb with cognito auth. I write the schema and it generates all my types and resolvers, all queries and mutations with subscriptions etc. Cognito stands up user accounts with 2 factor auth in minutes, adding groups for security is mad fast and easy. You can use federated very simply too with amplify.\n\nAgain, it’s not for everything, but it’s absolutely enough to standup a lot of saas ideas. It’s just one stack example that’s wild easy and fast to standup, full stack with auth. I usually use nextjs for frontend because of its built in routing/api and ssr.\n\nWith 8 hours and codex I can do what used to take me idk a week or something",

If I were to \"remake my SAAS\" and spent those 8 hours just writing plans and instructions and iterating on those, and I had a clear and COMPLETE task list that encompasses the full functionality of my very complex SAAS, and then, with the help of Claude Opus 4.5 broke that down into very small tasks, and then I set it all up to execute with parallelized agents and ralph loops. Yea I believe it may be possible to recreate my complex SAAS, from scratch, in about a day's work.\n\nThat's a lot of IFs and that requires a ton of planning and a pretty high level of expertise with the subject matter and with architecting complex apps. But if all the pieces come together and you have experts doing the planning then.... don't kid yourself... it is possible.\n\nNow try to imagine the next generation of everything we're using.. which realistically will be available in 3-6 months.\n\nWe are cooked.

Shit takes months and months whatever it is, if it's a solid system that's gonna make money. Now i do quantitative approach for trading of liquid coins. A year ago i was doing systems to rapidly buy crypto pumps, that shit was perhaps even more complicated than what i'm doing now, fucking memecoins you'd think its just memecoins.. it's really hard shit, to make some prototype yeah, but its not gonna be robust, as fast, as good, whatever it is that it has to be.

          "text": "Here's the thing.\n\nThe typical team only needs a sliver of the functionality that a lot of SaaS products provide. Product development for a SaaS is about serving the average hypothetical customer. You're trying to serve the needs of hundreds of thousands of customers. But I'm serving a team of 30. I know all of them by name, I know the turnover rate of my company, I know all of their technical capabilities, I know who needs a GUI, I know who can rely on a CLI. I know what my team likes and dislikes. I know what capabilities we do need at this moment, I know what they will need in 8 months, I know what the team will need in 3 years. You don't know that stuff about my team when you are selling us a solution. You are abstracting out the customer. At best you THINK you know what our business needs.\n\nAnd let's not pretend just because you're a big proper SaaS company that you guys aren't sitting on a mountain of tech debt. You think we can't feel it your half finished Ember, to Angular, to React migrations? All of the different loading spinners tell a tale management turnover and corporate restructurings.\n\nAnd I ALSO know, when we SHOULD get a SaaS product. The assumption with a lot of these latter day SaaS companies is that whatever sliver of functionality they provide is worth some ungodly subscription.\n\nWe didn't get rid of all of our SaaS products but we reduced our costs by 80% and we're about 50% faster than we used to be.",

          "text": "I get your frustration but the conversation’s more nuanced than that. “8 hours” is just a number. Selling vibe coding tools? It’s not really a lie; it depends entirely on what you’re building.\n\nDefine “something real”, right?\n\nCan you spin up a functional messaging app in 8? Sure, maybe.\n\nCan you reverse-engineer Stripe and claim you’ve reinvented payments (in 8)? LOL\n\nI’m far from a top-tier dev, but I did build the foundation for my current product in a weekend.   \n  \nWait, let me give you context: It wasn't witchcraft. This was my **third** **project**. The first two took me months of trial and error, rebuilding things I thought I understood, and they still aren’t ready. You’re not seeing those, by the way, lol. They were my learning process.\n\nThe third time. I realized the patterns and decisions from my earlier builds weren’t wasted. They overlapped in ways I could reuse. Like most surely do with form components, sign-in flows, etc. \n\nSo, I set up multiple AI agents with a “Manager Agent” that could direct tasks intelligently. Then, I put both of my previous projects in and basically said: “Read these. Understand my architecture. Use that knowledge to build this new one.”\n\nThe core build was done in a 48-hour, non-stop weekend sprint. Was it perfect? No. I spent another week debugging the slop I wasn't apt enough to catch in the rush. But that's what you do, you test. \n\nBack to that phrase “something real.” There’s a dogma around this, imo. The idea that a product only counts if you bled for it. That its legitimacy depends on how many nights you sacrificed rather than what it actually does. I think is harmful for our wellbeing. We shouldn’t romanticize the struggle, sure.\n\nThe point isn’t that you can build something complex from scratch in eight hours. It’s that, once you’ve put in the time (months or years), you can now build on that foundation in a way that just wasn’t possible before. If I can tell an LLM inside my IDE, “You’ve seen my last two projects. You know my architecture and priorities. Build this one the same way but for this idea, but tighten security and scalability, etc”m, then the whole timeline changes.\n\nSo yeah, “8 hours” isn’t about the first attempt. It’s about the third, the fourth, the ones built on your own evolution. The ones where AI finally stands on the shoulders of your past work. Not someone else’s hype.\n\nAnd I mean, I'm sure a lot of people do this. Fetch here and there from repos for things they think are good, spin those up and create solid builds in hours. If I can do it in a weekend, a monster dev can probably automate their setup to do it in 8? then review? I don't know, I'm not at that level, yet. \n\nTesting and debugging is another story. God damn, slop... LOL   \n  \nnote: I'm just playing devil's advocate, not polarizing :) idk, just 2 cents..",

      "text": "I’m done being polite about this. The current state of \"MVP development\" is an absolute clown show.\n\nI scroll through Twitter and see these \"founders\" bragging about building a SaaS in a weekend using nothing but vibes and Cursor. Then I see the poor non-technical founders hiring these guys, thinking they’re getting a steal.\n\nHere is the hard truth: You aren't getting a deal. You are getting scammed.\n\nI’ve spent the last six months cleaning up the mess left behind by these \"24-hour ship\" agencies. Honestly, it’s becoming the bulk of my consulting work lately. It is horrifying. These aren't developers. They are professional copy-pasters. They don’t know how code works; they only know how to hit \"Tab\" on an AI suggestion.\n\nThey are selling you a car with a glossy paint job that has a lawnmower engine and no brakes.\n\nHere is why your \"vibe coded\" app is absolute trash (and why I usually end up billing for a total rewrite):\n\n*   **They literally can’t read code.** If the AI hallucinates a security flaw, they ship the security flaw. I audited a project last week where user passwords were being stored in plain text because the \"dev\" didn't know what hashing was. That’s not a bug; that’s a lawsuit waiting to happen. I had to patch that emergency live while the client basically hyperventilated.\n*   **The shitty architecture.** They pile library on top of library because they don't know how to write a simple function. Your simple to-do list app ends up being 500MB because they imported the entire internet to make a button change color. When I come in to fix these, I’m usually deleting 60% of the codebase just to make the thing load under 5 seconds.\n*   **It’s unmaintainable garbage.** The second you ask for a feature that the AI can't easily one-shot, the project dies. They can't debug it because they never understood it in the first place. They ghost you, and that's usually when I get the desperate email to come save the sinking ship. You're left with a zip file of spaghetti code that no serious engineer will touch without a hazmat suit.\n\nStop falling for the \"we move fast\" hype. Moving fast into a brick wall isn't progress.\n\nIf you are hiring a dev and they can't explain how the database talks to the frontend without looking at a prompt window, fire them immediately. You are burning your seed money on digital landfill.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. No junior devs, no outsourcing, just solid code that scales. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.\n",

              "text": "A database does **not talk directly to the frontend** in most real-world systems. Instead, there’s a **backend in between**. Here’s the clear, practical breakdown from simplest to production-grade.\n\n---\n\n## The Standard Flow (Most Common)\n\n```\nFrontend  →  Backend (API)  →  Database\n```\n\n### 1. Frontend (Browser / Mobile App)\n\n* Written in **HTML/CSS/JS**, React, Vue, Swift, etc.\n* Makes **HTTP requests** (usually via `fetch` or Axios)\n* Example request:\n\n```http\nGET /api/users\n```\n\n⚠️ Frontends **cannot safely access databases directly**\n(You’d expose credentials, allow data corruption, and break security.)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Backend (Server / API)\n\nThis is the **translator and gatekeeper**.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Authenticates users\n* Validates requests\n* Runs business logic\n* Talks to the database\n* Sends back formatted responses (JSON)\n\n**Common backend stacks:**\n\n* Node.js (Express, NestJS)\n* Python (Django, FastAPI)\n* Java (Spring)\n* Go, Ruby, PHP, etc.\n\nExample backend code:\n\n```js\napp.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {\n  const users = await db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\n  res.json(users);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Database\n\n* Stores and retrieves data\n* Only talks to the backend\n* Uses **SQL** or database-specific query languages\n\n**Common databases:**\n\n* PostgreSQL, MySQL (SQL)\n* MongoDB (NoSQL)\n* Redis (cache)\n\nExample:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```\n\n---\n\n## How Data Moves (Step-by-Step)\n\n1. User clicks a button on frontend\n2. Frontend sends an HTTP request\n3. Backend receives request\n4. Backend queries database\n5. Database returns data\n6. Backend formats response (JSON)\n7. Frontend displays it\n\n---\n\n## Why This Separation Exists\n\n### 🔐 Security\n\n* Database credentials stay secret\n* Prevents SQL injection and data leaks\n\n### 🧠 Business Logic\n\n* Rules live in one place (backend)\n* Frontend stays simple\n\n### 📈 Scalability\n\n* Multiple frontends can use the same backend\n* Database load is controlled\n\n---\n\n## Exceptions (Rare / Controlled)\n\n### 🔹 Serverless / BaaS\n\nSome platforms blur the lines but **still use an API layer**:\n\n* Firebase\n* Supabase\n* Hasura\n\nEven then:\n\n```\nFrontend → Secure API → Database\n```\n\n### 🔹 Local Apps\n\n* SQLite in desktop/mobile apps\n* Still not exposed to the internet\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n> ❌ Database does **not** talk to frontend\n> ✅ Frontend talks to backend\n> ✅ Backend talks to database\n\nIf you want, I can:\n\n* Draw a diagram\n* Show a real React + API example\n* Explain how auth fits in\n* Explain GraphQL vs REST\n\nJust tell me 👍\n/s",

O pessoal mais junior acaba gastando energia demais aprendendo a ferramenta da vez em vez de entender como software funciona de verdade: arquitetura, fluxo de dados, segurança básica, por que as coisas são do jeito que são.\n\nSoma isso com a cultura de bootcamp de 12 semanas que forma gente pra fazer CRUD bonito mas não pra pensar em manutenibilidade, e você tem a receita perfeita pra esse cenário.

O problema é vender isso como \"produto pronto pra escalar\" quando claramente não é.\n\nA pergunta que fundador não-técnico deveria fazer não é \"você usa IA pra codar?\" e sim \"me explica como você estruturou isso e por que\".

      "text": "I got restricted on LinkedIn twice in 4 months while doing legit B2B outbound, and it was the overall pattern of my account looking “low-trust.”\n\nHere’re my mistakes. This is not “how to evade,” it’s what reduced restrictions once I cleaned up behavior and stopped chasing volume.\n\n1/ I had 380 pending connection requests just sitting there. Apparently LinkedIn gets suspicious when you have too many pending invites because it means low acceptance rate, so you look like spam. They recommend keeping it under 500 but from what I read now even that's pushing it, more like 200-300 is safer. Now I just withdraw old invites, LinkedIn doesn't notify these people, so I can re-invite them in 3 weeks.\n\n2/ there's a weekly invitation limit now, 100-200 invites per week depending on your account. I was aiming for 230 a week to get the following. I thought I was fine because I stayed under daily limits. But the weekly number matters just as much.\n\n3/ I set my tool to send only 35 requests every day at the same time. But real people can send 20 today at 10:00 AM, 40 tomorrow at 16:30 and 0 on Friday. So now I use randomization for everything. I vary daily limits between 20-30 and different timing.\n\n4/ I was only sending connection requests and sending messages, but I also needed to like posts, write comments etc. Real people browse, read content and reply in comments.\n\nWhat other triggers have you seen that cause restrictions (especially the non-obvious ones)?\n\n",

It’s just a UI on top of an OpenAI API key.\n\nLook, I get it. It’s easy. You can spin up a \"Chat with your PDF\" app in a weekend. But that’s not a business. That’s a feature. And honestly, it’s a feature that OpenAI is gonna kill in their next update anyway.\n\nI’ve been building software for a while now, and here’s what I tell clients who want to pay me to build this stuff: **If your \"moat\" is a prompt, you’re cooked.**\n\nReal value isn't in the LLM. It's in the boring stuff nobody wants to talk about.\n\nWhen I build actual, money-making MVPs for people, we spend maybe 10% of the time on the AI part. The other 90%?\n*   Handling the messy data imports.\n*   Figuring out what happens when the model hallucinates or times out.\n*   Building the logic that connects the AI to their actual internal tools.\n\nI built an agent system last month. The prompt took me 20 minutes to write. The error handling and state management took two weeks. That’s the work. That’s the moat.\n\nStop trying to be a prompt engineer and start being a software engineer again. Or at least hire one who knows that \"import openai\" isn't a business plan.\n\nIt’s 2026. The easy money is gone. If you aren't doing the heavy lifting in the backend, you don't have a product.\n\nAm I being too harsh here? Or are you guys seeing this \"slop\" everywhere too?\n\n",

It feels like you're prioritizing the how (engineering robustness) over the what (solving a problem).\n\nThe hardest part of building a product isn't handling data imports or state management—it's figuring out exactly what the user needs. A \"wrapper\" fails not because the code is simple, but because it usually doesn't solve a deep enough problem. Conversely, you can build the most robust, error-proof backend in the world, but if it doesn't address a burning user pain point, you’re just building \"high-quality slop.\" The moat isn't the software engineering; it's the solution to the customer's problem.",

I’ve seen on Reddit and forums that any automation or 3rd party tool guarantees ban, but in my experience it depends on the way the tool interacts with their platform (and ofc on how you use it)\n\nFrom what i know, there’re 3 main types and the detection risk is completely different:\n\n1. Extensions like Dux-Soup or Waalaxy inject JavaScript directly into the LinkedIn page. LinkedIn literally runs scripts that scan for extension IDs in your browser. easiest to detect because they leave obvious fingerprints\n2. **Cloud services l**ike Expandi, Dripify, Lemlist send API requests from remote servers. when you browse LinkedIn normally, your browser fires off tons of background requests - analytics, feed updates, etc. cloud tools only send the bare minimum they need to function. LinkedIn can spot this \"incomplete\" traffic pattern\n3. **Standalone browsers** (LinkedHelper, only one I know yet) work like a modified Chromium browser running on a PC. it mimics actual browsing - mouse movements, randomized timing, normal request patterns. harder to distinguish from real human. It doesn’t mean that you can’t be banned, because there are some strict rules and limits you must follow, but it’s still interesting that technical footprints are different. \n\nIf you’ve been banned or flagged, what was the reason? Do you think it was because of tool or because of your own behaviour like too many messages, etc trying to separate actual technical detection from just doing too much too fast\n\n",

Big ones, tiny ones, funded ones, scrappy ones\n\nHere’s the pattern nobody liked admitting:  \nMost startups launched into a void... yep, no community, no audience, no pull\n\nThis loop shows up almost every time  \n\\- Teams build in private for 12 to 24 months  \n\\- Launch to silence  \n\\- Blame marketing, or realize it's necessary  \n\\- Hire a junior social media person  \n\\- Post content nobody asked for  \n\\- Burn 6 more months  \n\\- Run out of runway\n\nBy the time most founders think about growth, it’s already too late to fix cheaply... \n\nThe few teams that avoid this mess do some very unsexy things early:  \n\\- Adopt founder-led-growth; one of the founders becomes the face of the product on socials and in events  \n\\- Treat early users like distribution, not feedback machines... Every early user is asked to introduce 2–3 other people. They design referrals, invites, or waitlists into the product from day one  \n\\- Obsess over narrative and story before features  \n\\- Build community before product-market fit, not after. Slack/Discord/Telegram with 30–100 early users, weekly calls, public roadmap, feedback in the open, no pretending everything is polished  \n\\- Control sentiment during launches instead of reacting to it... Teasers, early supporters lined up, coordinated posts, DMs to warm leads, pre-commitments for testimonials, and upvotes\n\nAll this is operationally annoying and unglamorous\n\nAnyway..... curious if other founders here have noticed the same pattern or if I’ve just had unusually bad luck with startups",

You can share posts in communities/subreddits that will attract the kind of people in the niche and connect with them.

We're really growing.\"\n\nI looked at his traffic stats. He has 400 daily active users.\n\nThat’s not scaling. That’s bleeding.\n\nI see this constantly. You hire a \"modern\" full-stack dev who wants to pad their resume, so instead of building you a business, they build a Rube Goldberg machine. They don't want to use a boring $20 server; they want to use Kubernetes, 40 microservices, and a serverless architecture that spins up a Lambda every time a user sneezes.\n\nHere is the truth about \"modern\" cloud stacks:\n\n* Resume Driven Development is killing your runway**:** Your lead dev isn't picking that complex stack because it's good for *your* product. They picked it because they want to get a job at Netflix next year, and they’re using your seed money to learn the tools.\n* Microservices are a trap for 99% of startups**:** Unless you are Uber, you don't need microservices. You need a monolith. Splitting a simple app into 12 different services just introduces network latency and makes debugging a nightmare. I’ve never seen a seed-stage startup die because their monolith was too big. I’ve seen plenty die because they couldn't maintain their distributed mess.\n* The \"Serverless\" premium**:** It sounds cheap until you actually get users. I just migrated a client off a fully serverless setup back to a boring, standard VPS.\n\nThe result?\n\nThe site is 3x faster because we aren't dealing with cold starts. The monthly bill went from $1,800 to $60.\n\nI literally paid for my own consulting fee for the next two years just by turning off the fancy toys and turning on a boring Linux server.\n\nFounders, stop being impressed by complex architecture diagrams. If your dev can’t run the app on a single machine, they don’t know what they’re doing.\n\nBoring stacks make money. Shiny stacks make debt.\n\nAm I the only one who misses when we just shipped code to a server and went to sleep?",

They are afraid to turn off services because they lack the technical acumen to work with infrastructure, so services lay idle and accrue costs or worse, they kill services haphazardly and suddenly things implode.\n\nI had a talk with an intern the other day, I’m a SWE. He had a project that he was working on and he said he wanted to use Amazon CloudWatch and asked my opinion about it. I asked him what he would use it for, what his budget was, and what he thought their actual monthly bill would be. \n\nI wasn’t surprised that he didn’t have an answer but you could ask this question to a senior developer and they’d give the same blank stare. Most devs are going to suck at answering the question because the money isn’t coming out of their pocket. It’s not their problem, so they don’t care.\n\nAs founders, we care about the numbers, or at least you should IMO. Numbers always come to my mind in my day job. How much will this cost? Is this work what we should be doing now or is there other work that will make a greater impact?",

Traffic doesn’t.  \n  \nOutreach #1 tip:  \n  \nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.  \n  \nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.  \n  \nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.  \n  \nJust start a convo like a human.  \n  \nAds #1 tip:  \n  \nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.  \n  \nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.  \n  \nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.  \n  \nSocial #1 tip:  \n  \nHooks are everything.  \n  \nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.  \n  \nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.   \n  \nPartnerships #1 tip:  \n  \nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.  \n  \nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.  \n  \nContent #1 tip:  \n  \nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.  \n  \nNot like a SaaS landing page.  \n  \nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.  \n  \nThat’s basically it.  \n  \nMost founders don’t need more tactics.  \n  \nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E  \n  \nWe're building [Rebelgrowth](https://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit) around this idea (owned distribution through SEO + leveraged citations), $26k MRR so far, still grinding.  \n\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?  \n\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria",

Reddit, niche Slack/Discords, industry forums, whatever. Think “be the helpful regular,” not “drop my link everywhere.”\n\nTwo practical tweaks:\n\n1) Build a tiny “signal system”: F5bot or Mention for brand/keyword alerts, plus something like SparkToro to find where your buyers hang out, plus Pulse in the background surfacing high-intent Reddit threads so you’re not guessing where to jump in.\n\n2) Tie every channel to one clear ask that leads to a quick win (template, calculator, teardown). If that doesn’t convert, fix the offer, not the channel.\n\nSo yeah: early game is all about engineered serendipity, not generic “marketing.",

I genuinely enjoy reviewing products, and I always learn something in the process too.\n\nDrop your links below!\n\n**EDIT:** With all the comments, I will not be able to review everyone unfortunately, I will do my best but here major issues I find in almost all sites:\n\n1. Add trust in your hero, like how many businesses or people use your tool.\n2. Add a video of your product right after hero.\n3. Add good testimonials.\n4. Add a great about page, many visitors will check this page to know who's behind the business.\n5.

              "text": "This is cleaner than most resume tools I've seen. \"The cleanest resume scanner\" is a specific claim and the page backs it up. No sidebar ads, no upsell popups mid-flow, no LinkedIn audit nonsense distracting from the core job.\n\nThe before/after comparison (48 -> 94) does real work. Showing weak bullet points transformed into quantified achievements makes the value immediately obvious. That's proof, not just promises.\n\nYour competitor comparison table is bold. Most tools avoid naming competitors directly. You're saying \"here's how we're different from Jobscan, Enhancv, and MyPerfectResume\" and backing it with specifics. That confidence signals you've actually thought about positioning.\n\nTestimonials are solid too. Real names, photos, verified badges, and specific outcomes (\"Score: 45 -> 92\", \"3 interviews in 1 week\"). That's how social proof should work.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nThe hero buries the outcome slightly. \"Optimize Your ATS Score\" is the mechanism. \"Land More Interviews\" is the outcome. I'd flip the emphasis. Nobody wakes up wanting a higher ATS score. They want callbacks.\n\n\"The cleanest\" is a strong claim but subjective. You might test something more concrete like \"No ads. No noise. Just your resume, optimized.\" You already have that as subhead copy. It's more defensible.\n\nThe page is long. That's fine for SEO and thoroughness, but the path from landing to \"Upload Your Resume\" could be shorter. Consider whether everything above the fold earns its position.\n\nVisually it's the same dark mode with teal accent that half of SaaS uses right now. Not a problem, just not distinctive. The product is strong enough that the design doesn't need to do heavy lifting, but it's worth noting.\n\nOverall this is well-executed. You understand your user's problem (\"75% of resumes never reach a human recruiter\") and you've built clear proof throughout the page. Most resume tools feel like they're trying to extract money. This one feels like it's trying to solve a problem. That comes through.",

Just small details that could help you look more trustworthy. When i opened your landing page the cta was actually cropped out from view. There was a lot of text I didnt even try to read since it became quite an overload, try to guide the user where to look and what to read because right now there is a bit too much going on at once and it's very hard to get a precise idea of what its about. Also I'd strongly suggest changing or dimming down these glow effects (green/blue/purple neons) also they could look cool they are strongly associating your saas to poorly generated AI software we see everywhere. It's not a simple task but if I were you I would try and look closely and understand the more premium designs of other software to obtain a more mature look. Hopefully this helps!",

It tells me what shelf you're on, not why I should pick you up. \"Get discovered without cold outreach\" is an actual promise. Lead with that.\n\nRight now the page explains the mechanism before establishing why I should care. Flip it. Outcome first, system second.\n\nOne other thing: \"FOR FOUNDERS. BY FOUNDERS.\" doesn't do much without a story behind it. Who built this? What did you fail at before building it? That context builds trust more than the badge.\n\nVisually it's clean but the dark mode with teal accent is everywhere right now. Nothing breaks through as distinctly GrowBase.

On my desktop your main hero section has a big blank section in the middle, it seems very scattered towards the sides of the view. When your users land on your landing page you want the primary focus to be on the center of the screen, it's where users most often expect to find their information. Having your heading and animation be seperated like that feels quite off. Also i would strongly suggest using ease in/ease out for your animations, to help smooth out the animations, they feel quite harsh right now. And as you scroll downwards it feels a bit too much free and might be hard for the user to understand whats going. I think there is a need for things to be sectionned off more precisely so that your user slowly reads the info one by one. Let me know if this helps!",

First, privacy is becoming a huge deal. Asking a company to upload thousands of sensitive IBANs or VAT numbers to a random server just to check a checksum is a massive security risk. I wanted to see if I could solve that by keeping 100% of the logic inside the browser.\n\nSecond, I've seen how messy data can be in most companies. Often, they don't bother cleaning up their databases because specialized APIs are just too expensive for a \"first pass\" validation. My tool lets them do that big initial scrub without the high costs or the risk of a data leak.\n\nRight now, I'm targeting SMEs, accountants, and other devs who deal with bulk financial records. If you have a messy CSV and need to make sure the data is mathematically sound before hitting \"pay\" or importing it into an ERP, this is for you.\n\nAs for the money, I literally launched yesterday, so I’m sitting at exactly $0 MRR right now ! This is my first project as a side-indie dev, so I’m mostly focused on proving the concept and getting feedback. I also open-sourced the core engine as a NuGet package because I genuinely think this kind of basic validation should be accessible to any .NET dev out there.",

I think this glow blue/purple effect starts to be seen in a lot of places and is starting to look like 'AI slop' or quickly generated website. I would suggest avoiding this aesthetic. Furthermore, your type needs a bit more refining, the kerning is too narrow on the header and too wide on the buttons/navbar feels quite off. And the use of uppercase and lowercase feels inconsistent. Also your CTA is a bit unclear, I get that you want to make the user try a feature but make it as simplest as possible in the landing page so that the user is easily guided to try it out. Just a few details that really wont hurt to adjust for creating trust.",

Marketing compounds over time in ways code doesnt. That blog post from 6 months ago might suddenly start ranking and driving leads.\n\nBut yeah building is definitely the comfort zone lol.

There’s still a lot to improve, but the foundation is solid.\n- The user actually found the product via ChatGPT, not ads or social media.\n- I’ve been heavily focused on SEO, with a fully automated blog publishing ~5 niche-relevant articles per day, translated into multiple languages without manual work.\n\nThis single paying customer already covers my entire \nmonthly stack.\n\nI’m not making money ye, but I’m not losing any either. I’ve reached break-even at the infrastructure level. The only real cost now is time.\n\nI’m not posting this to promote my SaaS (I won’t share the name here), but just to share something encouraging:\n\nWhen you focus on clarity, distribution, and actually solving a problem, even quietly, results eventually come.  Sometimes from places you didn’t expect.\n\nHappy to answer questions if it can help\n\nBack to building 💪🏻",

The products that rank high usually have a strong network pushing votes. You do get a page for your product, which is nice, but I wouldn’t expect real traction from it.\n\nAfter that, it was mostly SEO grind. I also spent time making the website extremely simple to understand, clear value, no noise.\nI didn’t do anything extraordinary, except automating the blog completely. \n\nFor roughly ~$20/month, it replaces what would normally be a small SEO team (2 people easily).

Each automated demo or integration becomes a unique indexed page.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*ChatGPT/LLM discovery optimization\\*\\* – You mentioned users found you through ChatGPT. This is increasingly important. Make sure your docs/content are structured for LLM retrieval (clear schema markup, FAQ format, API examples). We're seeing 20-30% of SaaS discovery shift to LLM interfaces.\n\n\n\nThe fact that users upgrade without hand-holding tells me your product positioning and UX are dialed in. That's the hardest part.

It means:\n\n✓ Your value proposition is crystal clear\n\n✓ The onboarding flow actually works\n\n✓ The product delivers immediate value\n\n\n\nMost founders overthink this. If users can figure it out themselves, you've already won half the battle.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The ChatGPT Discovery Channel\\*\\*\n\nThis is fascinating and honestly underrated. While everyone's chasing social media algorithms and paid ads, ChatGPT is becoming a real discovery channel. We've seen similar patterns in our user analytics.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip\\*\\*: Make sure you're optimizing for AI discovery:\n\n\\- Clear problem/solution statements on your landing page\n\n\\- Structured data that LLMs can parse\n\n\\- Documentation that answers \"how does X solve Y\" questions\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Break-Even Achievement\\*\\*\n\nReaching infrastructure break-even at 1 customer is RARE. Most SaaS founders struggle with this for months. You clearly:\n\n\\- Kept costs lean\n\n\\- Priced appropriately from day one\n\n\\- Built efficient automation\n\n\n\nThis gives you the runway to focus on growth without burning cash.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Your SEO Strategy\\*\\*\n\n5 articles per day, automated, multilingual - that's ambitious. One caution from experience: quality > quantity when it comes to SEO longevity. Google's getting smarter about AI content. Make sure you're adding genuine value and not just chasing keywords.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What's Next?\\*\\*\n\nSince you're at this milestone, here's what worked for us:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Talk to this customer\\*\\* - Even if they didn't need hand-holding, understanding their use case will unlock product insights\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Double down on what worked\\*\\* - ChatGPT discovery is working? Optimize for it. SEO is driving traffic? Keep refining.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Set up proper analytics\\*\\* - Track activation metrics, feature usage, churn indicators NOW while it's simple\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Build the testimonial relationship\\*\\* - This customer will be gold for future social proof\n\n\n\nThe journey from 0→1 customer is often harder than 1→100. You've proven product-market fit exists.\n\n\n\nWhat's your SaaS in? (No pressure to share if you want to keep it private). Curious what space is seeing this kind of immediate conversion.",

At 2k MAU you probably don't need the full analytics suite or advanced segmentation. That stuff matters later.\n\nWe went with Intercom's Product Tours (cheaper tier) since we already used them for support. Not perfect, but got us 80% there for way less money. UserGuiding is another option that early-stage teams like. Self-serve pricing, no sales calls.\n\nReal talk though: are you trying to improve activation or just guide people through features? If it's activation, a good email sequence + custom in-app prompts often works better than any tour tool. Pendo sells the dream but retention comes from your product, not tooltips.",

A living doc with canonical answers mapped to themes like access control, logging, SDLC, data retention, vendor risk, and incident response. Then each new questionnaire is just a translation layer, not a rewrite.\n\nThe other trick is evidence. If you can attach the same 2 to 3 screenshots or artifacts repeatedly, customers stop re-asking in different formats because they trust it more.\n\nDo you have a standard security packet yet, or are you starting from scratch each time?",

More important you're hoping they would actually become the customer that pays and you're hoping that if there are any investors they see the vision earlier than after the fact. \n\nI have major respect for small teams and solo devs that are bootstrapping and when you build anything meaningful that isn't few prompt vibe coded system you realize the headaches the time the sleepless nights why one stupid function doesn't want to work. Let's not even get into the operational things these teams go through like registration, domains, dns configs,  gateways etc. They essentially put multiple hats on, developer, architect, code reviewer, analyst, marketing, admin in operations and whatever else that comes. \n\nThe grind is something not many can get through...at least without a sane mind when you're on the other side lol. Give my love to your friend and tell him to keep up the hard work it will all pay off one day, if it was easy everyone would be doing it and everyone would be rich over night.",

Pretty good but when I started, I had no idea that the sales cycle for enterprise SaaS would be as long as they are.\n\nIn other words, those 2 years were an absolute struggle because we had no money coming in and towards the end - the pressure was crazy! \n\nMy days consisted of bullshit hellish dramas. I was either dealing with shitty investor personalities or being woken up at 3am because the entire site / app were down during a sales call because of some update we pushed through too quickly.\n\nIt was all chaos.\n\nBut we eventually found PMF and the storm calmed. We found our footing and now we're making good money.\n\nYay.\n\nBut just as my blood pressure has began reaching a normal human level - we found product market fit in a completely untapped area in a multi trillion dollar industry. \n\nTo make matters worst, we have already started selling our MVP and customers love it. \n\nThere's one small problem though - I'm burnt out (and I feel guilty about it).\n\nThe irony is that this opportunity is the greatest fiscal opportunity in my life! \n\nI would have given ANYTHING 4 years ago to have an opportunity like this fall on my desk but no matter how hard I try - I can't feel any excitement about it. \n\nNot one little bit.\n\nThe only joy that I get professionally recently is running a small group for founders (I'm not promoting! I wont link it).\n\nGenuinely helping people swerve mistakes that could have cost them years really gives me a sense of purpose. But the idea of making a new product and going through it all again makes me sick - even though I know that the outcome will be profitable.\n\nAnyone else been through this?",

                  "text": "If you want to stay organic and avoid ads, simplify and go deep instead of trying everything at once:\n\n\\- Start by focusing on 1–2 platforms only, for example LinkedIn plus YouTube Shorts. Commit to them consistently and go deeper instead of spreading thin across many channels.  \n\\- Share interview-related content rather than promoting the product directly. Th\\`\\`is can include common interview mistakes, sample questions, before-and-after answers, or short feedback clips. The goal is to be genuinely helpful and let people associate you with interview expertise.  \n\\- Engage where people are already asking for interview help. LinkedIn works especially well for this. Be careful with DMing. Add value first by engaging on their posts and contributing to the conversation, don't pitch.\n\nIn each post, point people to a simple lead magnet such as interview tips, a checklist, or sample questions, case studies (this is solid). This will help you build an email list, which is extremely valuable. Why:\n\n\\- Email lets you nurture people over time with interview tips and value. Do not sell in your first email sequence. Build trust first.  \n\\- When they are warm/ready, you can introduce your product naturally.  \n\\- Your email list is an asset you own. If a social platform gets limited or suspended, you still have direct access to your audience.\n\nRemember: people buy from those they know and trust. Nurturing is key here.\n\nOnce this organic B2C motion is in place, you may also want to explore B2B alongside B2C.\n\nIn B2B, you would target career coaches, bootcamps, or recruitment firms. This is often easier to grow without ads because they already have trust and direct access to people who need mock interviews.\n\nInstead of convincing individuals one by one, you sell once to someone who brings many users at once. For ex:\n\n\\- A coach includes your tool in their program  \n\\- A bootcamp bundles it for all students  \n\\- A recruitment firm uses it with candidates\n\nThis usually means fewer sales conversations, higher willingness to pay, and more predictable revenue. It can lead to earlier income compared to pure B2C because you bypass heavy ad spend and tap into existing audiences.\n\nFor B2B, cold outreach works well, whether through cold email or cold calling. You can also use an allbound approach by combining inbound and outbound. Publish valuable content on LinkedIn to build credibility and authority. Then support it with cold outreach (impt: do not sell yet. Your goal is to invite them into a conversation or sales meeting). Many B2B prospects will do a quick background check by looking you up on LinkedIn or Google before responding.\n\nIf you have a landing page, feel free to share it. Happy to give quick feedback.",

For a mock interview platform, I'd go straight to career services directors at universities, bootcamp founders, or recruitment agency owners. Find 20-30 people who'd genuinely benefit, research them properly, and reach out with something personalised. Email or LinkedIn DMs work if you're not being salesy.  \n  \nAlso, content is solid but it needs distribution. Instead of just posting shorts, comment genuinely on career advice threads, then occasionally mention \"we built a tool for this exact problem\" when it's relevant. You're already doing this a bit, but lean into it more.  \n  \nPartnerships could be huge for you too. Career coaches, bootcamps, and university programmes might promote you to their audience if there's value in it for them.  \n  \nWhat's your conversion rate like from the people who do find your product organically?",

I started with making a budget in Excel using AI as a helper that spiraled into now I’m building a program to help people that aren’t so financially smart/responsible budget themselves. It will check your bills debt, etc. give you a game plan per paycheck. I also built two API‘s that will in the future when the program is done support the program one of them is an invoicing API which I will use for the business version and then I have a ledger normalization API. No me no hands no pressure or subscribe to anything monthly. To me I feel like it’s a need for people.\n\nReally my point is do I have something that could possibly make money or am I wasting my time?",

We have some rules though only complex domains in their niches that require in-depth knowledge. And only customers\nThat pay a decent amount for onboarding (we start at 2.5k) and monthly fees that are long term commitments no free demos no free accounts. If we cannot find customers at those conditions it’s not worth our time.  What we’ve found is that in this way customers churn is low we lose only 1% tot 3% of customers,  growth is also slower only 25% a year. But it’s steady and predictable. We won’t win any prices for fastest growth or be hip . We are making money though. \n\nAnd I know of lots of other companies that follow similar paths.  However companies likes ours do not lend them to the social media exposure or quick wins that are mostly discussed in this sub.",
