If I was you, I would hire a tech consultant and walk them through the current pain points and from there onwards, figure out what’s needed the most. If you are in your current position long enough, then just list the top 10 pain points ( factor in things that could save time and money in the long run), as well check with your teammates and get their consensus as well. Once that’s done, look for tech that solves those exact problems. For example, I have been building a email CRM tool after speaking to 100 of email marketing specialists and I know once the platform is ready to go, it will help get more clients and generate higher client engagement. Also, Focus on a building a buying strategy first and then work on that. This way at least next year you would know what to look for and how to get it.",

Important moments/ dates, deal signatures, company founding day, employee birthdays, or internal milestones. These get turned into personalized digital artifacts based on the real lunar state of that exact moment. \n\nConsulting firms can use it to mark client anniversaries. HR teams can use it for employee recognition or milestone gifts. Founders can use it to preserve meaningful company moments. It sits outside daily operations, but strengthens the human layer around them.\n\nSince it is digital and not tied to subscriptions, it can be structured as prepaid credits that you use gradually over time whenever meaningful dates come up. No onboarding overhead and no operational dependency.\n\nIf useful, I would be happy to allocate credits for you so they can be used properly over time instead of being tied to software you may never open.\n\nIt may or may not be relevant, but it is at least a different way to convert budget into something lasting rather than shelfware\n\nYou can see it here\n\n [Personalised Moon Artwork](https://creatorcpm.com)",

The $147 buys:\n\n1. **\"Static analysis verification\"** \\- likely a tool or spreadsheet that checks your rule set for conflicts, missing sequencing, cooldown gaps, priority collisions. The free page describes rules; the paid version supposedly proves they're correct.\n2. **\"Full implementation specs\"** \\- the free rules say *what* triggers and *when*, but not *how*. The paid version presumably includes: data schema, event payloads, query logic, integration patterns, and edge case handling.\n3. **\"Memrail implementation\"** \\- Memrail appears to be **the author's own product**. The $147 credit is a purchase incentive that converts to a platform subscription discount, meaning the real play is getting you into their SaaS, not selling a $147 document.\n\nIn short: you paid for the \"what\", they're selling the \"how\" - and the \"how\" is a sales funnel into their platform.",

The free page is the “what/why” (conceptual protocols). The paid $147 thing is an implementation pack with full trigger definitions, edge cases, tests, example event schemas, rollout/shadow-mode checklist, etc. It’s meant for people who want to implement quickly instead of translating concepts into specs themselves.\n\n2) The $147 credit isn’t required to use the protocols. It’s just a credit if someone later tries the platform. You can implement these with your own stack - nothing about the list depends on the platform.\n\nTo add something useful here: one example protocol in “spec form” (not just concept) is:\n\n\\- Trial expiry nudge: trigger = user is trialing, trial ends within 72h, hasn’t received nudge in last 7d; action = send email + in-app banner; cooldown = 24h; exceptions = active support ticket or already upgraded.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more \"spec-level\" examples in the comments if that’s helpful.",

They wanted to acquire us, keep me on for a year to transition, then I'd be free. $2M for a product doing $15K MRR. That's roughly an 11x multiple on annual revenue which is solid by any measure.\n\nI thought about it for three weeks. Built spreadsheets. Talked to my wife about it. Lost sleep over it.\n\nSaid no. And I still think about whether that was the right call.\n\nThe financial argument for taking it was strong. $2M is life-changing money. The product could plateau or decline. Competition could intensify. I could burn out. The bird in hand argument is hard to argue with.\n\nThe argument for keeping it was partly financial and partly emotional. $15K MRR with room to grow means the long-term value could exceed $2M if things go well. I'm building equity, not just income. And honestly I wasn't ready to work for someone else again. The year-long transition period sounded like a slow kind of prison.\n\nWhat I keep going back to is that you can't know if you made the right call until much later. If the product hits $50K MRR in two years, I'll look like a genius. If it stalls at $15K and I burn out, I'll look like an idiot who turned down $2M.\n\nMost founders who've been through this tell me the same thing: the decision isn't really about the math. It's about whether you still have energy and conviction for what you're building. If yes, keep going. If the offer feels like a relief, take it.\n\nIt didn't feel like a relief. It felt like giving up something I wasn't done with yet. That's the only reason I said no.\n\n",

From a purely financial perspective, you did not get lowballed.\n\nBut this decision was never just financial.\n\nThe key line in your post is that it did not feel like relief. That matters more than spreadsheets. When founders are truly ready to sell, the offer feels like oxygen, not conflict.\n\nThere are three lenses to evaluate this through:\n\nFirst, risk adjusted upside. To justify saying no, you are implicitly betting that the probability weighted outcome of holding exceeds 2M. That does not require hitting 50K MRR. Even modest growth with time arbitrage could surpass the offer.\n\nSecond, personal energy. If you still wake up wanting to improve the product, that has compounding value. Burnout destroys optionality. Conviction expands it.\n\nThird, identity. You were not ready to become an employee again. That is not ego. That is self awareness.\n\nYou are right that the answer will only be clear in hindsight. But regret rarely comes from taking risk when you still believe. It usually comes from quitting something you were not finished building.\n\nIf you want clarity, model two structured paths side by side: hold and scale vs. sell and reinvest. Lay out realistic growth curves, downside scenarios, and lifestyle impact. I often recommend founders map these forks visually in something like Runable because it forces emotional assumptions into explicit tradeoffs.\n\nYou did not reject 2M. You chose continued leverage and autonomy.\n\nTime will judge the ROI. But the reasoning you described is not irrational. It is founder math, not just spreadsheet math.",

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

Just sharing what I was building and what I was learning. Several people DMd me asking about the product and became paying customers. The compounding effect is real even when your posts get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email but targeting the right people first**\n\nMy first sequences flopped because I had the ratio wrong. The fix: spend 80% of your time finding the RIGHT people, 20% on copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly — much higher leverage per email sent.\n\n**4. SEO (still the most underrated SaaS channel)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks pages started ranking and the traffic came from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. Perplexity, ChatGPT, and other AI tools are pulling from web content. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of potential customers. One of my users hit 450+ organic clicks a day from this alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend only after organic worked**\n\n$200 each on Google and Meta. I only ran ads after I had organic conversions already happening. Ads amplify what's working — they don't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't convert gave me their email, and that list paid off later.\n\n**6. Treating early customers like whales**\n\nMy first 10 customers got same-day bug fixes, direct calls, constant feedback loops. Result: they became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies — all came from that obsessive early attention.\n\n**7. A simple affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. One click to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = a recurring customer stream, not a single sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nListed on \"There's an AI for That\" and got a solid traffic spike. Fair warning: I lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug during that spike. Test your critical flows before any launch. Painful lesson.\n\n\n\n**The honest take:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. None of this is sexy. Nothing went viral. But these tactics stack. While everyone's hunting for the next growth hack, you can quietly compound Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders right now, it's SEO. Not because it's fast, but because every article keeps working for you months or years later. With AI search expanding the discovery surface, the upside is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR.

Since you're running an SEO tool, you probably know that Google isn't the only way to stay visible anymore. Have you considered adding a social distribution layer to your growth? Brands like Polymarket use FindClout to automate their reach across US Instagram meme networks. It would actually complement your SEO efforts by building massive brand authority while you focus on the organic side. Worth a 15-min look if you want to scale to $100k without doubling your manual hustle",

In-app browsers from social platforms are DESTROYING checkout rates.\n\nWhen people click ads on Instagram or Facebook, they land in these janky app browsers that block autofills, Apple Pay, and run super slow. My conversion dropped to 1.2% in those browsers compared to 4% in Safari.\n\nI fixed it by automatically routing people to their native browser before checkout. Saw a 15% revenue bump from the same ad spend. Wild, right?\n\nCheck your analytics by browser type. If Instagram/Facebook traffic converts way lower, that's your hidden leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles this redirect automatically if you want a quick fix.\n\nCongrats on hitting $50k ARR.

CTA Analysis\nPrimary CTA: \"Sign in with Google\" - Premature ask\n- Problem: No value demonstration before registration request\n- Friction: Users don't know what they're signing up for\n- Missing: Benefits, features, or sample results\n\nSecondary CTA: \"Add yourself\" - Unclear purpose\n- Problem: No explanation of why someone would add themselves\n- Context: Missing information about profile benefits\n\n3. Target Audience\nLikely Targets (needs validation):\n- Sales professionals seeking SF decision-makers\n- Recruiters hunting for Bay Area talent\n- Startup founders looking for investors/advisors\n- Journalists needing local sources\n- Event organizers targeting tech professionals\n\nCurrent Messaging: Too generic - doesn't speak to any specific use case\n\n4. GTM Insights\nImmediate Issues:\n- No differentiation from LinkedIn/Salesforce\n- Unclear AI advantage over existing tools\n- Missing trust signals (data sources, privacy compliance)\n- No social proof or user testimonials\n\nOpportunity: Position as \"AI-powered SF tech insider database\" with specific vertical focus\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nPhase 1: Smart Search Assistant\n- Deploy AiAssist chat widget to help users craft better searches\n- Knowledge base: SF tech scene, company hierarchies, investor portfolios\n- Example: \"Find me fintech CTOs who just raised Series B\"\n\nPhase 2: AI Relationship Navigator\n- AI assistant that analyzes search results and suggests:\n  - Mutual connections for warm introductions\n  - Conversation starters based on recent news/interests\n  - Optimal contact timing and channels\n\nPhase 3: AI Outreach Platform\n- Generate personalized outreach messages\n- Track engagement and suggest follow-ups\n- A/B test messaging approaches\n\nSpecific AiAssist Implementation:\n\n1.

              "text": "I reviewed this ai service with my ai agent Malachi and I’m impressed !!!\n\nHere’s what he had to say\n\nhttps://malachi.aiassist.net\n\nProduct/Service Overview\n\nComputer Agents is a cloud-based AI agent platform that positions itself as \"your AI coworker\" rather than a simple chatbot. The platform provides persistent, autonomous AI agents that run in isolated cloud environments with their own workspaces, memory, and scheduled task capabilities. Key differentiators include persistent memory across sessions, scheduled execution, multi-device access, and an open-source SDK approach.\n\nCore Value Props:\n- Persistent cloud workspaces that survive sessions\n- Scheduled autonomous task execution\n- Multi-agent orchestration with specialized skills\n- Cross-platform accessibility (iOS, Mac, Web, API)\n- Open-source SDKs with BYOK flexibility\n\nCTA Analysis\n\nPrimary CTAs:\n- \"Start for Free\" (prominent, above fold)\n- \"Download for macOS\" (secondary)\n\nCTA Performance Insights:\n- ✅ Clear free tier entry point with 150 compute tokens\n- ✅ Risk-free trial reduces friction\n- ✅ Pricing anchor ($19/month) immediately after free offer\n- ❌ Multiple competing CTAs could create decision paralysis\n- ❌ No immediate social proof near CTAs\n\nConversion Optimization Opportunities:\n- Add urgency/scarcity elements to free tier\n- Include customer count or usage metrics near CTAs\n- Consider exit-intent popup with extended trial\n\nTarget Audience\n\nPrimary Segments:\n1. Developers/Technical Teams - API-first approach, SDKs, open-source\n2. Business Professionals - \"AI employee\" messaging, productivity focus\n3. Researchers - Deep research capabilities with citations\n4. Agencies/Consultants - Multi-agent orchestration for client work\n\nSecondary Segments:\n- Enterprise operations teams needing 24/7 automation\n- Creative professionals (floor plan example)\n- Customer support teams (FireChatbot case study)\n\nGTM Insights\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear competitive positioning vs. chatbots\n- Strong technical differentiation (persistence, scheduling)\n- Impressive case studies with specific metrics\n- Developer-friendly approach with SDKs\n\nGaps:\n- Limited enterprise sales motion\n- Unclear pricing for scale deployments\n- No obvious partner/channel strategy\n- Missing vertical-specific positioning\n\nRecommended GTM Motion:\n1. Land-and-expand via developer adoption\n2. Vertical specialization (architecture, research, support)\n3. Agency channel program for multi-client deployments\n4. Enterprise tier with security/compliance features\n\nAI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nBased on Computer Agents' architecture and use cases, here are specific integration recommendations:\n\n1. Customer Support Enhancement\nIntegration: Deploy AiAssist agents as the frontline for customer inquiries about agent deployment, pricing, and technical issues.\n- Use AiAssist's Shadow mode for complex technical questions\n- Create knowledge base entries from their documentation\n- Route escalation to human engineers via Takeover mode\n\n2. Agent Template Marketplace\nIntegration: Use AiAssist to power an interactive agent template recommendation engine.\n- \"What do you want your agent to do?\" → suggest pre-built configurations\n- Embed AiAssist chat on template pages for instant guidance\n- Use knowledge base to store community-contributed templates\n\n3. Research Report Generation\nIntegration: Their deep research feature competes with AiAssist's capabilities—consider partnership.\n- Offer AiAssist as an alternative for customers needing compliance/certification\n- Position Computer Agents for technical users, AiAssist for business users\n- Cross-refer based on use case complexity\n\n4. Onboarding Optimization\nIntegration: Replace their current support system with AiAssist for faster time-to-value.\n- Create workspace-specific assistants for each product area (iOS, Mac, API)\n- Use AiAssist's Oracle Playground to test onboarding flows\n- Implement progressive disclosure based on user expertise level\n\n5. Enterprise Sales Enablement\n\nIntegration: Deploy AiAssist as a sales development representative.\n- Qualify leads based on usage patterns and company size\n- Schedule demos and send personalized follow-ups\n- Create separate workspaces for different verticals (architecture, research, support)\n\nImmediate Action Items:\n1. Add AiAssist chat widget to pricing page for instant qualification\n2. Create knowledge base from their documentation for 24/7 support\n3. Deploy lead qualification agent using their API integration examples\n4. Set up competitor monitoring using research agents to track mentions\n\nThe Computer Agents platform has strong technical differentiation but could benefit from AiAssist's human-in-the-loop capabilities for customer-facing scenarios where accuracy and brand safety are critical.

When you set up Hivemind, it adds mandatory rules to your project config that Claude Code and Cursor read at session start. The agent knows from the first message to announce tasks, check locks before editing, and publish outcomes when done.\n\nBeyond that, we have hooks that enforce compliance at the edit level. If an agent tries to edit a file that's locked by another agent without acquiring the lock, the edit gets blocked with an error message telling it exactly what to do. So it's not purely relying on the agent to remember — there's enforcement.\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is that agents tend to adopt the tools voluntarily once they see the value. Being able to query \"what did we decide about auth?\" and get a real answer instead of scanning an entire repo makes the agent more effective, so the incentive aligns naturally. \n\nIt's not perfect — agents occasionally skip a publish or forget to release a lock. TTL-based expiry handles stale locks automatically, and the dashboard gives you real-time visibility so you can catch gaps. But in practice it works better than expected.",

It’s been a wild ride of 14-hour days and countless prompts, but I finally launched!\n\n**Product:** [app.lumileo.fr](http://app.lumileo.fr)   \n  \n**What it is:** An AI-powered EdTech app that generates personalized, unique stories where your child is the hero.\n\n**Why I built it:** As a dad, I was tired of reading the same books. I wanted something that features my kids' names, 50+ magical universes (Ghibli-style art), and actually helps with reading (Dyslexia mode & audio included).\n\n**Current Status:** 20 users, 0€ MRR. Aiming for 10k€ in 12 months. Just submitted to the Play Store!\n\nI’d love some feedback on the onboarding flow.

Product/Service Overview\n\nSandInvoice is a refreshingly simple time-tracking and invoicing tool designed specifically for solo contractors. Built by a fellow independent contractor who lived the pain of cobbling together tools, it strips away the bloat of enterprise solutions while maintaining essential functionality.\n\nCore Value Proposition:\n- One-click time tracking with automatic weekly/monthly breakdowns\n- Flexible invoicing (hourly, fixed-rate, or mixed)\n- Lifetime price lock at $6/month or $60/year\n- Encrypted vault for project credentials\n- Zero setup friction (Google/Microsoft/magic link signup)\n\nKey Differentiators:\n- Built by a solo contractor, for solo contractors\n- Lifetime price guarantee (no surprise increases)\n- Tax-inclusive checkout for international users\n- Workspace-isolated encrypted credential storage\n- No feature creep - maintains laser focus on core needs\n\n2. CTA Analysis\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear value-first approach: \"14 days free\" prominently featured\n- Price anchoring works well ($6/mo vs $60/yr shows $12 savings)\n- Risk reversal with \"No card required until day 15\"\n- Multiple touchpoints throughout the page\n\nOpportunities:\n- Consider adding urgency/scarcity (e.g., \"First 100 users get lifetime discount\")\n- Could benefit from social proof (testimonials, user count)\n- Mobile-specific CTA placement might improve conversions\n\n3. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Solo independent contractors (software developers, designers, writers, consultants)\nSecondary: Very small agencies (2-5 people)\nTertiary: Freelancers transitioning from part-time to full-time\n\nPsychographics:\n- Values simplicity over features\n- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for reliability\n- Prefers tools built by people who understand their pain\n- Wants to appear professional to clients\n- Time-conscious (hence the one-click tracking)\n\n4. GTM Insights\n\nWhat's Working:\n- Authentic founder story resonates with target audience\n- Lifetime pricing creates urgency and loyalty\n- Free trial without credit card reduces friction\n- SEO opportunity around \"simple invoicing for contractors\"\n\nGrowth Opportunities:\n- Partner with co-working spaces and freelancer communities\n- Content marketing: \"How to invoice as a solo contractor\"\n- Integration partnerships (accounting software, payment processors)\n- Referral program leveraging the founder's network\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nHere are specific, actionable ways to integrate AiAssist's capabilities:\n\nA. Smart Time Categorization\nImplementation: Use AiAssist's knowledge base to train an AI that automatically categorizes time entries based on project descriptions and past patterns.\n\n# Example API integration\nPOST /v1/chat/completions\n{\n  \"model\": \"llama-3.1-8b\",\n  \"messages\": [{\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"Categorize this time entry based on description and project context\"\n  }, {\n    \"role\": \"user\", \n    \"content\": \"Fixed responsive layout bug on client's homepage\"\n  }]\n}\n\n\nB. Invoice Description Generation\nImplementation: AI generates professional line item descriptions from brief notes, learning from user's past invoices.\n\nC. Payment Reminder Sequences\nImplementation: AI drafts personalized follow-up emails for unpaid invoices, adjusting tone based on invoice age and client relationship.\n\nD. Expense Categorization & Tax Prep\nImplementation: Train AI on tax categories to automatically categorize expenses and generate tax-ready reports.\n\nE. Project Health Monitoring\nImplementation: AI analyzes time tracking patterns to flag projects going over budget or timeline.\n\nF. Smart Invoice Scheduling\nImplementation: AI suggests optimal invoice timing based on client payment history and project milestones.\n\nG. Client Communication Assistant",

              "text": "I love it. Had Malachi do an analysis https://malachi.aiassist.net \n\nProduct Review: CreatrAI\n\n1. Product/Service Overview\nCreatrAI is a prompt-to-website generator that turns text descriptions into production-ready HTML/CSS/JS in seconds. Core workflow: describe → generate → edit → export. It sits between Wix-style drag-and-drop and raw code, letting users refine either with an AI co-pilot or direct code edits. All sites are responsive and come with hosting-ready zip exports.\n\n2. CTA Analysis\n- Hero: \"Generate My Website\" (primary, above the fold) + micro-copy \"Start Your Free Website\" → clear, low-friction, no card.\n- Mid-page: \"Get Started Free\" (repeated 3×) anchors every pricing card; color contrast is good.\n- Footer: \"Get Started with CreatrAI Today\" – pushes urgency but is identical to earlier CTA; no secondary CTA (e.g., \"See a 60-sec demo\").\n- Friction points: No preview without sign-up, no live chat for objections, no social proof counters (# of sites built, testimonials).\n\nOpportunity: Add a \"See it first\" secondary CTA that opens an embedded playground or GIF walkthrough; capture emails even if users bail.\n\n3. Target Audience\nPrimary\n- Non-technical founders validating MVPs\n- Freelance marketers/designers who sell quick sites to SMBs\n- Indie hackers & side-project builders\n\nSecondary\n- Agencies that white-label fast landing pages\n- STEM/Robotics clubs, event organizers needing one-off pages\n\nTertiary\n- Junior devs learning front-end by inspecting exported code\n\n4. Basic GTM Insights\n- Positioning: \"AI web builder for non-coders\" is crowded; differentiation is speed + code export. Emphasize \"own your code, host anywhere.\"\n- Channel fit: Product-led growth via shareable showcase gallery; SEO long-tail (\"AI generator for band website\"); lifetime deal on AppSumo to seed backlinks; TikTok/Reels showing prompt-to-site in 15 s.\n- Pricing: Token + credit dual currency is confusing. Simplify to one metric (pages or sites) and add usage-based overage, else expect churn when credits run out mid-project.\n- Partnerships: Integrate with Netlify/Vercel one-click deploy; become template supplier in their marketplaces.\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities Using AiAssist\nEmbed an \"AI Concierge\" layer across the CreatrAI funnel to raise activation, conversion, and retention.\n\na. Pre-Sign-Up\n- Pop-up widget (AiAssist workspace) trained on CreatrAI docs answers \"Will it work with my CMS?\", \"What are credits?\", slashes support tickets → higher trial start rate.\n\nb. Onboarding\n- After registration, an AI setup assistant (Shadow mode) interviews the user (\"What's the site goal?\", \"Preferred color vibe?\") and auto-pre-fills the first prompt → faster \"aha\" moment.\n\nc. In-App Help\n- Contextual AI helper inside the editor: highlight any element → \"Explain this code\" or \"Make this mobile-friendly\". Knowledge base = CSS best-practices + Tailwind cheatsheet. Keeps novices from dropping off.\n\nd. Post-Export Upsell\n- Once user exports, AI emails a personalized checklist (\"Add Google Analytics here\", \"Host on Vercel like this\") with affiliate links → drives Dev-plan upgrades.\n\ne. Agency Tier\n- Reseller workspace (AiAssist Team plan) where agencies host white-label chatbots on client sites for revision requests (\"Ask the AI to change the hero image\"). Generates recurring seat revenue.\n\nImplementation Snippets\n- Endpoint: AiAssist OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions\n- Knowledge categories: \"CreatrAI Pricing\", \"Export Guide\", \"CSS Snippets\", \"Refund Policy\"\n- Directive example: \"You are CreatrAI-Helper, friendly and concise. Only answer about CreatrAI features. If off-topic, politely redirect.\"\n\nQuick Wins (≤ 2 dev days)\n1. Add \"Chat with an AI expert\" bubble on landing page via a single <script> tag pointing to AiAssist widget.\n2. Gate the first 3 messages per visitor; prompt sign-up when limit hit → immediate lead gen lift.\n\nBy layering AiAssist's human-in-the-loop chat, CreatrAI can turn static FAQ into interactive consultative selling, cut support load, and open a differentiated agency channel.\n\nCheck us out https://aiassistsecure.com",

Context: Gemini gives you generic advice based on its training. Our app builds your strategy specifically around your real-time business goals, buyer needs, and audience data. That’s why everyone who tried it mentioned how relevant the output was. \n2. Execution: Gemini gives you a plan, then leaves you to figure out the work. Our app turns that plan into a daily to-do list so you actually know what to do at 8:00 AM on a Wednesday morning. \n3. Adaptability: When your engagement drops or trends shift, Gemini doesn't know. Our app stays by your side, adapting the strategy and generating content ideas that actually align with your campaign progress.\n\nWe’re designing this to be a social media manager anyone can access. I hope this helps.",

      "text": "*After* [*my last post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1qxtava/how_8_apps_cloned_the_same_idea_and_each_makes/) *about the plant identifier app space got positive feedback, I went looking for the next market where a bunch of apps do the same thing and all make money. I found LinkedIn tools, which features a lot of copycats and operates in a gray area with regards to LinkedIn's Terms of Service.*\n\nI was able to find 20+ tools, most of which do one of two things: write your LinkedIn posts with AI, or automate your outreach. Interestingly, a huge chunk of them violate LinkedIn's TOS and some are straight up clones of each other. I chose a mixture of examples - from €7M ARR down to a solo dev pulling in $6K/month off a Chrome extension.\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nLinkedIn's native experience is genuinely terrible if you're trying to use it as a business tool. No scheduling, no carousel creator, no way to filter your feed, no real outreach tools. For the most important platform in B2B, the product is shockingly bare-bones.\n\nSo an entire gray market popped up to fill the gaps. Half these tools operate in a weird space - LinkedIn's TOS says no automation, yet the biggest automation tool just hit €7M ARR and is bootstrapped. LinkedIn either can't stop them or (more likely) quietly benefits from the extra activity they drive on the platform. They have an API, but it is apparently quite hard to get access to.\n\n# THE BREAKDOWN\n\n# 1. Waalaxy: €7M ARR, 150K+ users\n\nMost people have never heard of Waalaxy, and it's doing more revenue than probably all its competitors combined. French founder, no funding, €7M ARR in 3 years.\n\nIt automates LinkedIn connection requests, DMs, and follow-up sequences — all stuff LinkedIn explicitly prohibits. They added email outreach so you're not just dependent on LinkedIn's platform. Starting at €19/month when competitors charge $99-197.\n\n**Takeaway**: You can build a massive business violating a platform's TOS if the platform quietly benefits from what you're doing.\n\n# 2. PROSP: $126K/month\n\nPROSP's pitch is simple: send 4,000 LinkedIn DMs per month from one account. LinkedIn's actual limit is way lower. They get around it with residential proxies and account rotation.\n\n80% profit margins, 1,100 subscribers, AI-generated voice notes so your automated messages don't sound automated/AI.\n\nIt is currently for sale at $1M - that's 0.9x revenue for a business doing $126K/month at 80% margins.\n\n**Takeaway:** 80% margins and $126K/month sounds great, except when your entire business depends on not getting your customers banned. This undoubtedly hurts your valuation when trying to sell.\n\n# 3. Taplio: Acquired for $2M + $6M earn-out\n\nTaplio was the first serious LinkedIn-specific content tool - AI writes your posts, schedules them, gives you analytics. It sits in a price range of $65-199/month.\n\nBuilt by Tibo Louis-Lucas, who literally ran the same playbook on Twitter first (TweetHunter, which hit $1M ARR in 12 months) and then copied the concept to LinkedIn - same founder, same product, different platform. Got acquired by lempire for $2M upfront + $6M in earn-outs.\n\n**Takeaway:** Tibo had a playbook that worked and copied it over from Twitter to LinkedIn and got an $8mm exit. Cloning a product for a different platform/strategy can be a valid approach... Sometimes business really is just that simple.\n\n# 4. Supergrow: $63.5K/month\n\nNearly identical to Taplio, but at a much lower price point. It has the same features - AI post generation, scheduling, analytics, etc., but at $19-49/month instead of $65-199. It also hit #1 Product of the Week on ProductHunt.\n\nThe one real differentiator is a built-in carousel maker (carousel posts get 3x the engagement on LinkedIn, but are annoying to create manually). Other than that, it's Taplio at a third of the price. Clearly the market is big enough to tolerate two of the same.\n\n**Takeaway:** \"Same thing but cheaper\" is an underrated, but effective strategy, especially when the incumbent gets greedy and charges $65+ for something that isn't hard to replicate. People have different price thresholds and sensitivities. \n\n# 5. Kleo: $62K/month\n\nSame thing as Taplio and Supergrow - AI writes LinkedIn posts. Kleo's differentiator is it learns your voice from your post history so the output doesn't scream ChatGPT.\n\nPeople are getting really good at spotting AI-written LinkedIn posts, so \"sounds like you and not a robot\" is enough to get people to pay. \n\n**Takeaway:** One positioning difference (\"sounds like you, not ChatGPT\") is enough if it's the right one. \n\n*Side Note: This reminds me in the early days of ChatGPT when things like RizzGPT were making bank. Solving for stupid deficiencies in AI is still a valid market opportunity.* \n\n# 6. RedactAI: $6.5K/month\n\nThis is purely for writing LinkedIn posts. It doesn't do any of the scheduling, analytics, or carousel maker that the others do (yet at least). It is bare bones - pick a template (storytelling, listicle, hot take) and get a post out. The price point is extremely low too at just $11.90/month for their base offering.\n\nIt's a stripped-down version of tools 3, 4, and 5 - basically a ChatGPT wrapper with LinkedIn post templates. And it works - $78K/year from something you could build in a weekend.\n\n**Takeaway:** This is meaningful side income you can live off in many parts of the world and it probably only took a few days to build. Don't overcomplicate!\n\n# 7. Myfeedin: $6K/month\n\nEvery other tool on this list helps you create more stuff on LinkedIn, but Myfeedin helps you see less.\n\nIt's a browser extension that filters engagement bait out of your LinkedIn feed. Keyword blocking, content type filtering, whitelist mode. As we have all seen, LinkedIn's algo is optimized for engagement, but can be a cesspool of cringy content that you'd rather not see.\n\n**Takeaway:** Solve a simple problem with a simple solution and find customers. Also, its another example of using underutilized mediums like browser extensions to make meaningful income.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**Most of these tools are clones of each other.** Taplio, Supergrow, Kleo, RedactAI - 4 tools that all do \"AI writes your LinkedIn post\" with slightly different angles. On the automation side, Waalaxy and PROSP both send automated DMs at scale. I didn't mention these in this post, but Dripify, Expandi, Zopto, PhantomBuster, and a probably a dozen others are doing essentially the same thing.\n\n**Half the ecosystem violates LinkedIn's TOS.** LinkedIn explicitly bans automation, but obviously the \"automation tools\" are automation. For some reason, they don't seem to care or enforce it. LinkedIn probably benefits from the extra activity and looks the other way. They do however seem to enforce rules on specific accounts as its believed \\~23% of Dripify users get restricted within 90 days.\n\n**LinkedIn's terrible UX is the entire business model.** Every one of these tools exists because LinkedIn chose not to build it. No native scheduling, no carousel tool, no feed filtering, no outreach features.\n\n**Even last place pays.** $6K/month from a Chrome extension and $6.5K/month from a glorified ChatGPT wrapper. Solving simple problems simply (even in niches) can earn you meaningful income.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you liked this post and want to find your own cloneable products with real revenue, positioning angles, and competitor breakdowns.

          "text": "This article seems to be self-promoting and promoting some of the applications mentioned. However, I agree on one major point: the gray areas within a social network or specific application generate surprisingly large sums of money.\n\nOne example is a script or similar software for auto-playing popular Roblox games like Bloxfruit. Before Roblox targeted that market, almost every child or auto-farmer would search for free scripts or pay for a virus-free script/auto-playing program with advanced upgrades to play the game, instead of spending months grinding. I won't go into more detail about that script, but there are people who throw free scripts into adware and put them where children can find them, and when they see them, they're willing to spend time browsing those ad links to get the free scripts. A guy I know showed me a peak month where he earned over ten thousand dollars a month. It was amazing for a golden age, but I'm not sure if that was his actual earnings or just a bragging scam.\n\nAnyway, after Roblox switched to a client server, this niche is practically dead now. But the story I told above is a concrete example of making money in the gray area.",

Some are just buzzword generators, spraying \"synergy\" and \"disruptive\" all over the place, while others are surprisingly good at structuring your thoughts in a professional way.\n\nOne thing I've learned is to *always* heavily edit anything these AIs spit out. They can give you a good starting point, but you really need to inject your own voice and personality so it doesn't sound like a robot wrote it.

UX gaps are the real opportunity**  \nLinkedIn not building:\n\n* Native scheduling\n* Carousel builder\n* Feed filtering\n* Proper CRM-level outreach\n\nThat vacuum *is* the market.\n\nIf someone wanted to play this smarter long-term, I’d avoid the blatant TOS violations and instead focus on:\n\n* Workflow optimization around content ops\n* Analytics layering\n* Team collaboration for B2B creators\n* Safer “assistive” tools instead of automation tools\n\nAlso, low-key underrated angle: internal content systems. A lot of founders struggle not with writing posts, but with organizing ideas, repurposing, and structuring narratives across formats. Tools that streamline that pipeline (instead of blasting DMs) probably have better longevity. I’ve seen people use structured content workflow builders like Runable to manage ideation → drafting → repurposing without relying on sketchy automation, which feels way more durable long-term.\n\nBiggest takeaway though:\n\nLinkedIn’s bad UX isn’t a bug. It’s a moat for builders.\n\nCurious, if LinkedIn suddenly added native scheduling + carousels tomorrow, which of these tools survive?",

But every month we were losing customers at a rate that made growth feel like running on a treadmill.\nSo I did something that took a lot of time but ended up being one of the most valuable things I've done. I personally reached out to every customer who cancelled in Q3. Not a survey. Actual conversations. Some on calls, some over email, but real back-and-forth.\nI expected to hear that we were missing features. Or that a competitor was better. Or that pricing was too high. Those did come up occasionally. Maybe 20% of the time combined.\nThe overwhelming majority said some version of the same thing: \"We just stopped using it.\" Not because anything was wrong. They got busy. The person who set it up left the company. Priorities shifted. The product sat there unused for a couple months and then someone noticed the charge and cancelled.\nThe second most common reason was closely related. They never really got fully set up. Signed up with good intentions. Poked around. Got pulled in another direction. Never reached the point where it was embedded in their workflow.\nThis completely changed how I thought about churn. It wasn't a product problem. It wasn't a competition problem. It was an activation and engagement problem. Customers who were actively using us almost never left. Customers who drifted into inactivity were guaranteed to leave eventually.\nWe restructured our whole approach around this. Onboarding focused on getting people to one meaningful outcome in the first week. Automated checks to flag accounts going quiet before they disappear entirely.\nChurn improved meaningfully. And it came from actually understanding why people leave rather than guessing.\n",

The activation piece is huge too. There's this window right after signup where someone either builds the habit or they don't, and once that window closes it's almost impossible to pull them back. Most teams obsess over acquisition and treat onboarding as a checklist when it's really the single highest leverage moment in the entire customer lifecycle.

No big complaint. No angry email. Just… gone.

Activation and ongoing engagement matter more than almost anything else.  If a customer is embedded into their workflow, they rarely leave. If they’re “kind of using it,” they eventually will.

A targeted list of quality conversations will outperform hundreds of badge scans from curious passersby, and it makes the whole event measurable.",

      "text": "Today, I’m going to share exactly what my brother and I did to grow our [SaaS](https://taap.it/1J7ilyW) and reach 10K MRR. And what we would do if we were starting from scratch.\n\nJust one method we’ve been applying every day for months.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Step 1: Build in public on TikTok & Instagram**\n\nFor over a year, we've been documenting everything. We switch up the type of content by transparently showing the entire evolution of the product, even before its launch; we share our doubts, the features in progress, the struggles, the little victories, everything. And that’s what creates a real connection with our audience. We’re not selling in the videos; we’re just building a relationship. And today, TikTok and Instagram have become our main acquisition channels. It’s simple: people follow us, they see our dedication, they understand our product. And the day we invite them to try it, they’re already convinced. Here, I showed you the theory, but here’s how to really do a Build In Public, and it’s very simple. The first thing to do is define your message; it has to be punchy. Generally, the best messages that have worked for us were “quitting everything to crush Fiverr and Upwork” and also “we're going live until we hit $200,000 in revenue.” So your message needs to sound really crazy; that’s what will really determine whether it works or not. Step two: film how to shoot a video; it’s very simple. You’re going to take shots that have nothing to do with what you’re saying: shots of you working, shots of you on calls, shots at the gym, whatever. The goal is to illustrate your words to create a dynamic result, and the last part is editing. I use Capcut; there are many editing software options, but for beginners, it’s pretty good. You’ll add your voiceover that you recorded beforehand, add subtitles of what you’re saying, then include clips and music, and now you have a simple post that works and builds trust with your consumers.\n\n**Step 2: LinkedIn outbound + content**\n\nEvery morning, I contact 50 to 60 people on LinkedIn. Very targeted profiles. No randomness. I check who liked or commented on a post related to our topic, and I start a real conversation. Nothing aggressive; I just offer to connect with the person, show interest in them, try to understand that LinkedIn is a social network filled with hypocrisy and ego, so you absolutely have to work on people long-term to build a relationship and convert them later. Then, I post on my profile once a day. It could be educational content, stories, or a lead magnet. The posts that are working best for us right now are niche lead magnets with a real resource. What works the most are mini tools or automations that you give away for free; people will comment so you can send it to them in a private message. To give you an example and help you understand the whole process, two days ago, I made a post giving away a tool that allowed people to track their SEO; I got over 900 comments and 500 likes on LinkedIn. So what I do is send them the resource, and once they have it, you have two options: either follow up two days later to help them and build a relationship for conversion later on, but in the long run, or cold call everyone who commented, because if they commented, they’re obviously interested in what you do. So, you can call them directly to offer a demo in a 30-minute call with them. Personally, I prefer cold calling; I did a week of cold calls and managed to get over 30 qualified meetings because these are people who have already shown interest.\n\n**Step 3: Cold Email**\n\nWe send about 500 emails a day using Instantly. But before that, we make sure our domain is warmed up, that the text is solid, and that the targeting is good. This means there’s real groundwork to do ahead of time on your ICP to get a much higher response and open rate. We don’t just go everywhere. We only target people who have shown intent. For example: if we offer an analysis tool, we’ll target SaaS founders who have recently hired in marketing or posted a job offer for an SEO consultant. It changes everything. Because the message is tailored, and the response rate explodes. What matters is the substance of your emails, not the form. Try to have volume in your emails but ultra-personalized according to the different audience groups. And a little tip on emails: if you’re doing email marketing, you need to understand some fundamental things. Generally, for the profile picture, I really recommend putting a personal profile picture for your emails and not your company logo. If you’re doing cold email, it should be firstname.lastname@yourcompany; the goal is really to appear human even if you’re automating. There’s also a maximum character rule: 80 characters; the person should be able to read the email on their phone without scrolling, and you’ll have a higher response rate.\n\n**Step 4: X (formerly Twitter)**\n\nX works totally differently from other platforms: here, interaction is the game. So every day, I publish 3 tweets spaced throughout the day. And I comment on at least 50 posts. But I don't just comment for the sake of commenting. I bring a real perspective; I open up a conversation. The goal is to really engage because your responses to comments can bring you a lot of traction. And little by little, this attracts followers, visibility, and conversations that can turn into customers. What’s crazy is that there’s a strong SaaS community on X, with super valuable connections.\n\n**Step 5: Reddit**\n\nReddit is underrated. But when you start to understand how it works, it's an amazing channel. We got over 200K views in 7 days with a well-written post. But be careful; Reddit is strict. You must first interact with the community, be “accepted,” and then you can start posting. You really need to do this work during the first month of interacting with others, trying to understand the codes. When I post on Reddit, I always try to give all the value I have to avoid delivering empty content; I always provide concrete things, then I share stories, share a lesson or a struggle. And if people react, I respond in the comments or gently redirect. It’s a powerful channel, but you have to approach it carefully to promote your tool; it’s quite subtle. There are also very strong comments; typically, you type the problem you’re solving into the search bar, then find posts talking about your issue, so you can comment and say, “Hello, I had the same problem as you, and now I’m using (your product) and honestly, it helped me a lot.” It’s quite subtle, and it works well because you’re helping one or more people.\n\n**Step 6: Patience and consistency**\n\nAll these channels take time. But you have to do them every day. Not for 2 weeks. Not for a month. We’re talking about months for the cumulative effect to kick in. And it’s exactly because most people give up too soon that those who persist end up winning big. What we apply is a simple discipline; every channel has its routine, we set clear goals, and we constantly iterate.",

The biggest shift for me was treating content and outreach as part of the product, not an afterthought. Even simple things like sharing lessons, documenting progress, and using tools like Runable to quickly create clear docs or resources made conversations easier. Consistency across channels compounds faster than people expect. Most founders underestimate how much showing up daily matters.",

Gave people time to actually see my name pop up a few times rather than immediately pitching after one interaction.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add to your cold email section is using video in follow-ups. Our text-only sequences were getting maybe 3-4% response rates, but when we added a quick personalised video in the second or third touchpoint, it jumped to around 18%. People are drowning in text emails, so anything that stands out helps.  \n  \nThe Reddit advice is spot on though. I've seen people get absolutely destroyed for being too promotional too quickly.  \n  \nWhat's your typical timeline from first LinkedIn interaction to actually pitching your product?",

We've been focusing a lot on AI optimization lately because so many founders are now using ChatGPT or Perplexity to find tools instead of just Googling. We've been using the LLM Relevance Directory to find specific playbooks for this. It helps make sure your SaaS actually shows up when people ask AI for recommendations, which is a massive shortcut for that step 5 Reddit strategy. \n\nAre you seeing much organic traffic from AI search yet, or is it still mostly direct from your social clips?",

Real work, the actual kind of thing they'd be doing daily, about five hours worth. I pay them regardless of whether I hire them. The results are stark. People who sounded average in conversation produce excellent work while polished interviewers turn in mediocre output. My second hire came from that process and she's been with me two years running half the operation. Never going back to traditional interviews.\n",

I also found that platforms giving pre-vetted developers takes a lot of the load off your shoulders - both legally, compliance, and time-restraint wise.

When someone can’t execute, decisions slowly roll back up to the founder. You start reviewing more, deciding more, fixing more. Suddenly you’re paying a salary just to inherit extra work and cognitive load.. that’s why I agree with your takeaway on acting fast. Once you know, dragging it out is the most expensive option. Firing early isn’t ruthless, it’s respectful to the business, the team, and honestly even to the person who isn’t a fit.. paid trial projects are the cleanest filter I’ve seen too. Real work, real constraints, real feedback loops. It exposes execution, ownership, and how someone thinks under ambiguity in a way interviews never will..\n\nFreeing up time and cash quickly so you can hire someone who actually compounds the business is one of the highest ROI decisions a founder can make.",

WhatsApp had 55 engineers serving 450 million users when Facebook bought them. Instagram had 13 employees at acquisition. The trajectory has been moving this direction for a while, AI just compresses it further. The real question isn't whether one person can build something that generates massive value, it's whether one person can handle the decision making surface area that comes with it. Sales and support and ops can absolutely be automated or outsourced to a huge degree now. But judgment calls, strategic direction, legal exposure, partnership negotiations, those still need a human brain and there are only so many hours in a day. I think what actually happens isn't one person doing everything but one person orchestrating an army of AI agents and contractors without ever hiring a traditional team. That's functionally solo but not really solo in the way people imagine. The ceiling for what a single sharp operator can build has genuinely exploded though. A few years ago you needed a team just to ship a decent MVP. Now one person with the right tools can build, launch, and scale something that would have taken 15 people in 2019.",

What’s realistic is a solo founder hitting $1M to $10M ARR by orchestrating AI + contractors and then getting acquired at a spicy multiple. That’s a path we’re already seeing.

I built a billion-dollar company with 13 people.\" He was referring to Instagram, which Facebook acquired for $1 billion in 2012. Krieger noted the main reason Instagram needed to scale its team was content moderation, which AI could now handle.\n\n# Where He Thinks It Could Happen\n\nAmodei said it would likely be \"in an area where you don't need a lot of human-institution-centric stuff to make money.\" His top picks were proprietary trading, developer tools with deep AI integration, and businesses that can automate customer service without needing large sales teams.\n\n# The Realistic Take\n\n**Why it's plausible (narrowly):** A solo founder running a prop trading fund or a viral SaaS tool that hits a $1B valuation on paper — sure, that's technically possible. Valuation ≠ revenue. A single person could build something that investors value at $1B based on growth trajectory, especially in AI-native categories.\n\n**Why the skepticism is valid:**\n\nTom Coshow, senior director analyst at Gartner, warns: \"We have to give \\[AI agents\\] very simple decisions to get reliable answers. We are nowhere near the point where we can just throw a lot of data at an AI agent and trust its decision.\" He adds that complex agents like an \"automatic VP of sales\" don't exist yet.\n\nThe real bottleneck isn't whether AI can write code or draft emails. It's the **human-trust layer** — legal liability, regulatory compliance, enterprise sales cycles, partnerships, and crisis management. These require human judgment and human relationships. A $1B company almost certainly interacts with other companies, governments, or consumers at scale, and those interactions still require trust that comes from human accountability.\n\n**The most likely scenario** is not \"one person does everything with AI\" but rather \"one person + AI + a constellation of contractors/agencies for the 5% of tasks that require human presence.\" Which is impressive, but it's a different claim.\n\n# The Uncomfortable Meta-Point\n\nAmodei is the CEO of an AI company. His prediction that AI will make one person capable of running a billion-dollar company is also a sales pitch for his own product. That doesn't make it wrong, but it's worth noting the incentive structure. The prediction serves Anthropic's narrative that AI is a transformative force multiplier — which it is, but the timeline and magnitude are doing a lot of heavy lifting in that claim.\n\nFor solo founders, the practical takeaway is: AI dramatically reduces the team size needed to build and scale a business. Whether that minimum is 1 person or 5 matters less than the directional shift. Build lean, automate aggressively, and focus on the parts that genuinely require your human judgment.",

      "text": "I'm a developer. I can build anything. Frontend, backend, APIs, databases. Give me a problem and I'll ship a solution in a week.\n\n\n\nBut marketing? I had no idea where to start.\n\n\n\nFor 6 months I just built features. Made the product better and better. Beautiful UI, clean code, great architecture. Zero users. Zero revenue. Classic developer trap.\n\n\n\nThen I forced myself to stop coding and start talking to people. Here's what actually happened:\n\n\n\nWeek 1-2: Joined 8 Discord servers and 5 Slack communities where SaaS founders hang out. Didn't promote anything. Just answered questions about growth, marketing, AI visibility. Spent 30-40 min per day being genuinely helpful.\n\n\n\nWeek 3: People started recognizing my name. Got my first DMs asking \"what are you building?\" I didn't have to pitch. They asked me.\n\n\n\nWhat I tried that failed:\n\n\\- Generic cold email (\"hey check out my tool\"). Sent 100. Got 2 replies. Both said no thanks.\n\n\\- Posted my link directly in a subreddit. Removed in 20 minutes.\n\n\\- Wrote 3 blog posts. Total views after a month: 31. Not 31K. Thirty one.\n\n\\- Asked friends to share on social media. Got 4 pity clicks.\n\n\n\nWhat actually worked:\n\n\\- Being helpful in communities first, mentioning product only when directly relevant\n\n\\- Finding specific Reddit threads where people described the exact problem I solve\n\n\\- Cold email but completely different: instead of pitching, I'd send people 2-3 specific places where their potential customers were actively looking for their type of product. No ask. Just value. Response rate jumped from 2% to about 15%.\n\n\\- Building in public on X. Sharing real numbers, real struggles, real lessons. Not the polished \"we hit $10K MRR\" posts. The messy \"I got 2 upvotes on my Reddit post and zero signups today\" posts.\n\n\n\nWhat surprised me:\n\n\\- AI recommendations (ChatGPT, Perplexity) are becoming a real discovery channel. I scanned about 50 SaaS products and 80% are completely invisible in AI recommendations. The ones that show up all have one thing in common: real community discussions about them.\n\n\\- Discord and Slack communities convert better than any other channel for early stage. People trust recommendations from community members.\n\n\\- Reddit is unpredictable but powerful. One post can do nothing. The next one on the same topic blows up. The only strategy is consistency.\n\n\\- The channels that work at 0 users are completely different from what works at 1000. At 0, it's all conversations. At 1000, content and SEO start mattering. Most founders fail because they use 1000-user tactics at the 0-user stage.\n\n\n\nCurrent status: still early. Building in public, sharing everything. The product helps SaaS founders get found by AI systems and get their first customers through communities and outreach.\n\n\n\nBiggest lesson: the hardest part of building a SaaS isn't the code. It's getting yourself to close the IDE and open Discord.\n\n\n\nWhat's been working for you guys? Especially interested in hearing from other solo founders.",

People develop internal pattern recognition through years of observing edge cases and experiencing failures. AI possesses pattern recognition abilities but lacks the fundamental human experience that drives our decision-making processes. AI systems do not have this particular ability because they cannot experience real-world consequences.\n\nYour observation about creating new sessions for research purposes is important to me. I use a similar method to test different ways of presenting my ideas to others. The same prompt leads to different results when tested in different situations. The process involves using intuition to eliminate the tendency of people to base their judgments on initial information.\n\nThe division between the two fields becomes clear to me through this statement. The use of artificial intelligence serves to create new knowledge which helps organizations assess various choices while testing their logical frameworks. Humans should decide between different options which require them to consider both time-related factors and human relationships.\n\nThe moment a decision has asymmetric downside, I don’t outsource it. The responsibilities remain in the hands of the founder.",

At a zero user base, trust holds greater value than user traffic.\n\nThe stage-mismatch problem receives my full agreement. The early stage requires operators to perform manual tasks through processes that they cannot expand; however, this creates an awkward experience. The situation requires you to take action because you have reached the point where your work appears too perfect.\n\nThe primary ability gap between development founders and others exists in their ability to stop working in the IDE and start building relationships. The actual obstacle to progress comes from the lack of available connections rather than programming limitations.",

      "text": "If you are burning cash on ads and praying for a return, or sending 100 cold emails a day just to hear crickets, stop what you are doing.\n\nI just hit $27k MRR with [my tool](https://tryrebelgrowth.com/)\n\nAnd I didn't do it by following the standard startup advice.\n\nHere is the thing.\n\nMost founders try to be everywhere, doing everything, with mediocre results.\n\nI focused on 5 channels. And for each one, I ruthlessly cut the noise and focused on the single tactic that actually moved the needle.\n\nHere is the exact playbook.\n\n**1. Meta Ads: Your Creative IS Your Targeting**\n\nStop wasting hours building complex audiences.\n\nFacebook's AI is smarter than you. Go broad (US + Europe) and let your video find your buyers.\n\nThe real secret is the offer.\n\nI don't do boring 14-day free trials. I use a \"tripwire\": 3 Days Free + First Month for $9.\n\nIt stops the scroll, gets them to pull out their wallet, and liquidates my ad spend immediately so I can acquire customers for essentially $0.\n\nAlternatively, you don't need a discount, you can have outstanding bonuses, a bundle or features\n\n**2. Google Ads: The Competitor Hijack**\n\nGoogle suggests a million headline variations. Ignore them.\n\nThe single best thing you can do is bid on your closest competitors' keywords.\n\nKeep it simple. Do not use their name in your ad text (you risk trademark violations), but pin your superior offer right in the first headline.\n\n\"Automate SEO | 3 Days Free + $9 First Month\"\n\nWhen someone is searching for your competitor, they are already educated. You just have to present a better deal.\n\n**3. Influencers: YouTube Longform Or Nothing**\n\nI have hired over 1,000 influencers and spent millions in my career.\n\nIgnore the gurus telling you to hire a hundred micro-influencers on TikTok.\n\nNothing beats the attention span of a YouTube longform video and a direct CTA link in the description.\n\nFind channels with high audience affinity, negotiate aggressively (aim for sub $50 CPM on flat rates), and make sure they put your 60-second integration in the first 5 minutes of the video.\n\n**4. SEO: The Programmatic \"Variables\" Matrix**\n\nWaiting 6 months for a single blog post to rank is a massive bottleneck.\n\nToday, my #1 tactic is programmatic SEO. I build a \"variables spreadsheet\" for high-intent clusters.\n\nThink: \"Best \\[tool\\] for \\[industry\\] in \\[location\\]\".\n\nI map out the topics, generate the core structure, and spin up 50 hyper-targeted pages at once.\n\nBut you have to hold Google by the hand. Build a dedicated directory hub linking to every single page so crawlers don't get lost in a flat architecture.\n\n**5. Outreach: The Fortune Is In The Follow-Up**\n\nIf you are sending one email and giving up, you are leaving money on the table.\n\nThe money is always in the follow-ups. Schedule 4 to 7 emails.\n\nKeep the subject line dead simple: \"Paid sponsorship?\" or \"Quick question?\". Let them know you mean business immediately.\n\nAnd stop using burned-out Apollo lists.\n\nEvery single one of these tactics comes down to one thing: removing friction and striking while the iron is hot.\n\nHave you tried a tripwire offer instead of a freemium model? Or are you still waiting for your free users to magically convert?\n\nAlways testing, always improving.\n\nCheers",

          "text": "$27k MRR is solid, but what stands out isn’t the channels, it’s the **clarity of offer**.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n• The tripwire is doing heavy lifting. You’re filtering for buyers immediately instead of “free tool tourists.” That alone changes CAC math.\n\n• Competitor bidding works… until they notice. It’s great for early traction but not a long-term moat.\n\n• Programmatic SEO can print traffic, but quality control is everything. Thin pages kill you fast now.\n\nBiggest thing I’d ask:  \nWhich of these channels would still work if your offer wasn’t aggressively priced?\n\nBecause channels amplify,  they don’t fix weak positioning.\n\nAlso curious, are you running all this through a centralized funnel system or stitched tools? Once you scale paid + SEO + influencer at the same time, orchestration gets messy fast. I’ve seen people use workflow tools like Runable to keep landing page variants, offers, and funnel experiments structured instead of scattered across ad managers and random docs.\n\nAt $27k MRR the game shifts from “growth hack” to “repeatable system.” Which of the 5 is actually the most defensible long-term?",

Once someone pays even $9, the mindset shift vs “free forever” leads is huge, and the quality of support/product signals you get is way better too.\n\nThe part I think most folks will miss in your playbook is how aligned all 5 channels are around people who already show intent: competitor search, already-watching-a-video, “best X for Y” pages, and follow-ups on warm-ish outreach. It’s not random volume, it’s stacking warm contexts.\n\nOne thing I’d add: you can mirror this same intent mindset on Reddit and niche forums. Track a few pain keywords, answer surgically with proof and examples, and send people to either the tripwire or a short loom demo. I’ve messed around with SparkToro and Apollo for the research piece, and Pulse for Reddit has been solid for actually catching those threads in time to jump in.\n\nMain takeaway: tight, intent-heavy channels plus a low-friction paid offer will beat a wide freemium spray every time.",

It’s not huge or anything, but it’s completely organic, no ads, no real marketing. And to me it feels crazy that people I don’t even know are actually paying for something I built.\n\nI just wanted to share a few things I’ve learned so far, in case someone here is at day 0 like I was.\n\n**1. Validation > perfection**  \nI wasted way too much time in the beginning trying to make things perfect. Nobody cares about perfect. What actually helped was just shipping and seeing if anyone even wanted it.\n\n**2. Users will surprise you**  \nSome features I thought were super important… nobody used them 😅 But small things people asked for made a big difference.\n\n**3. Getting users is WAY harder than building**  \nCoding felt easy compared to getting people to notice the product. Distribution is a whole different game.\n\n**4. First dollars hit different**  \nI still remember the first payment notification. It sounds small but it completely changes how you see your project. Suddenly it feels real.\n\n**5. Motivation comes and goes**  \nThere were many days I didn’t feel like working at all. Showing up anyway is what slowly moves things forward.\n\nI’m still very early and honestly still figuring things out as I go. But this journey has already taught me more than I expected.\n\nIf you’re building something and feel like nothing is happening yet — just keep going. Progress feels invisible until one day it isn’t.\n\nHappy to share anything if it helps someone 🙌\n\nPS: I used AI to help fix some of my grammar while writing this .writing isn’t really my strongest skill, but the journey is real.",

Go deep with examples, screenshots, and step-by-step workflows. LLMs love concrete, structured content.\n\n2) Make it stupidly easy for models to parse: clear headings, FAQs, comparisons, and real user language. Your own support emails and chats are gold for phrasing.\n\n3) Seed that content in real conversations: Reddit, niche forums, and small communities. Those links and discussions are what models (and Bing) pick up as “this is what people actually use.”\n\nI’ve used things like Ahrefs and AlsoAsked for topics, Amplitude inside the product to see what flows people actually use, and Pulse for Reddit to get pinged when folks rant about problems I solve so I can reply with useful, non-salesy answers.\n\nThe point is: think “answer engine optimization,” not just SEO in the old Google-only sense.",

One confusing step in onboarding and people just disappear silently.vAI tools like Cursor and Runable made iteration faster, but the real bottleneck was understanding friction points, not coding speed.",

What I learned very quickly is that onboarding is the most ciritical part in early stages. During development stage, I was constantly adding features and improving them just to learn very quickly that these are all nice to have but don't help you when your onboarding is not 100% optimized. For my product (Klypse.app) a typical early launch day looked like this (80-120 sign ups, actual users 40-45%). I was wondering why people go through the effort of signing up but then don't use the service I am providing. After I shrinked down the onboarding to an absolute bare minimum just for the key features activation rate jumped to an average of 75% now. \n\nAlso very important is to analyze your traffic with GA4 or whatever you are using (I could use Vercel analytics as well since I am hosting on there). This showed me, that most of my traffic comes from mobile, so optimizing everything consequently mobile first also had a positive inpact on activation rate. \n\nSo to summarize:  \n  \n\\- Prioritize onboarding and key features  \n\\- Optimize for traffic source\n\nAnother point which for me was very unexpected was that a pretty huge part of users came from India and Pakistan followed by the US and Brazil. India and Pakistan to this day did not convert ONCE! So I am still working on a solution for that, cause upfront cost is not to ignore in my field.\n\nHope this helps somehow. Good luck",

There will be a transition period where all kinds of shit gets spewed out until people start to realize that shit software is still shit software, regardless. \n\n I've built a vibe coded tool to try and fix a problem I've solved, or tried to solve, manually over my 20 year career. It's not SaaS - just a \"make this piece easier\" to support my consulting business. My customers are B2B SaaS businesses. The whole market is very much in flux. I'm pretty sure this is just the beginning too. \n\nIt's been nice as the vibe coder to be able to spin up a workable product from my own brain as a user who's intimately familiar with the problem I'm solving. I don't have to try and translate my requirements to an engineer. \n\nWith that said, it's not a \"I did this all in an afternoon\" situation. I spend tons of time fighting against the AI and catching places where it starts doing shit I didn't tell it to do. \n\nOn the one hand, this crazy new world is exciting and fun. On the other hand, it's absolutely terrifying to think of the pain and trouble ahead as we try to sort out good from bad. \n\nIf I'm in your shoes I would definitely be \"all in\" on AI - don't turn your nose up because only dumbasses are doing it. That will change.\n\nI say that as someone who thought the iPhone was a fad. I missed the entire way the market shifted. \n\nAnyways, just my thoughts at random.

So I thought, hey how can I just add a new web app, fetch sign data and images and prices from the DB, and then have a print button that sends it to the printer directly. No fussing with drivers, no config changes from people who don't understand print drivers etc.\n\nSo literally yesterday I got an Angular app running to make the sign. Then I got the printer's web SDK from Epson and tried a test print. Worked.\n\nToday I built a print server backend to receive the job from the Angular frontend and deployed it to an idle machine. Set up a CF tunnel so they can talk to each other,  then finished integrating the frontend.\n\nAfter a little debugging (some cups lib didn't get installed) and now it's running and it works. I just tested the complete flow and it works. \n\nI got that done in less than two days. I probably could have found some saas that does this, emailed back and forth for days and days, implemented their integration, debugged, and maybe in a week or two it would be working.\n\nInstead I just did it myself and I never had to talk to a sales person or contact Epson support or any kind of nonsense.",

A $300/month field service SaaS — they only needed dispatch scheduling, service reminders, and post-job follow-ups. Built all three with n8n + Notion in a weekend. Total cost went from $477/month to $43/month.\n\nThe time cost question is real, but it's one-time setup (8-12 hours) vs. ongoing monthly cost + the opportunity cost of paying for features you never touch. For a sub-$1M business, $400/month savings = $4,800/year = meaningful.\n\nThat said: there are categories where the $100-300/month is genuinely worth it. Complex billing, anything with deep integrations you'd have to build from scratch, or if the tool is core to your delivery and reliability matters. The analysis has to be done per use case.",
