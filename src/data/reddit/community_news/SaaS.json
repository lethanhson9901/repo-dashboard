Overall **1 Billions page view** in last 6 years.\n\n# What actually worked\n\n**1. Boring keywords beat trendy ideas**  \nInstead of ideas, I looked for problems people repeatedly Google.\n\n**2. Multi-language pages**  \nTranslating tools worked far better than writing blog posts.\n\n**3. Speed matters more than design**  \nFast pages massively improved retention.\n\n**4. Many small tools > one big product**  \nEach tool brings its own traffic source.\n\n# What didn’t work\n\n* Posting on social media for traffic\n* Product Hunt launch\n* Paid ads\n* Trying to build “a startup idea”\n\nRecently a few companies even asked about sponsoring placement on the site, which I never expected when I started.\n\nHappy to answer anything about SEO, structure, or scaling simple tools.",

Most builders completely ignore non-English SEO even though the competition is a fraction of what it is in English.\n\nYour approach of building what you personally needed is what makes it work long term. You're your own user, so you naturally understand what \"good\" looks like. Compare that to someone who builds a utilities site purely for traffic arbitrage. They'll cut corners on UX because they don't actually use the tools.\n\nOne billion page views over six years with no marketing spend is a masterclass in compounding. The takeaway for anyone reading this: boring, consistent execution beats a viral launch almost every time. Most people quit after month three when their trendy idea gets no traction. Six years of steady building creates something that's genuinely hard to compete with.",

      "text": "Quick background: I left my PM role at a Series B about 11 months ago to build a SaaS that automates compliance reminders for dental offices. Small TAM — around 4,200 practices in the US. 6,800 if you count veterinary, which I've started doing in my projections.\n\nReal pain though. I watched our office manager spend 40 minutes a week on this. Built the MVP in 3 weeks (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel). Whole thing costs me $8.11/month to run. I know the exact number because I check Vercel billing every morning.\n\nLaunch was rough. Posted on HN, got 3 upvotes and one comment: \"Is this AI?\" It's not. It's cron jobs and Twilio. But I did start putting \"AI-powered\" in my meta tags for SEO, because the cron job evaluates a condition before sending each reminder, and at some level that's what inference is.\n\nSo I started grinding outreach. Scraped every dental practice within 200 miles off Google Maps, found the office managers on LinkedIn, and sent 1,847 personalized messages over 6 weeks. Personalized meaning I swapped the practice name in the first line. One office manager replied \"Hi \\[PRACTICE\\_NAME\\]\" so I know at least one person read the whole thing.\n\n11 replies. 2 asked me to stop. 1 was a lawyer — not about the product, his practice genuinely needed compliance reminders, he just also wanted me to know I was violating CAN-SPAM. The other 8 booked demos or asked for more info, 6 converted, those 6 referred 14 more, and cold email plus Reddit brought another \\~30.\n\nCurrent numbers: 53 paying customers, $4,150 MRR, \\~12% MoM growth. Churn is 4.7%, but most of that is practices closing or merging. If I exclude involuntary churn, seasonal adjustments, one guy who I'm pretty sure signed up by accident, and a practice that emailed me \"please stop texting our patients\" — which I'm classifying as a feature request — it's closer to 1.8%.\n\nThe problem: I got a letter last week from a practice's legal team calling my outreach \"unsolicited commercial messaging.\" Which — yes. My plan was to hire a VA to scale to 500 messages/day across LinkedIn, email, and Facebook groups. I've already created a second LinkedIn profile for this. The question is whether a third is overkill or just good redundancy. Has anyone dealt with this?\n\nThe other problem: I haven't paid myself in 11 months. My girlfriend keeps asking about this. I keep explaining that $4K MRR is essentially $48K ARR which is essentially a salary, the business just needs it right now. She asked when the business won't need it and I said probably around $15K MRR. She Googled how long that would take at my growth rate, showed me her phone, and didn't say anything. We had a quiet dinner. I've started referring to her as my \"co-founder\" in conversations because it feels more accurate than \"person who pays rent.\"\n\nThinking about raising prices from $49 to $79. Some customers already say $49 is a lot for automated text reminders, but I think they're undervaluing peace of mind. You can't put a price on peace of mind. Well, you can. It's $49. But it should be $79. I ran a Van Westendorp analysis on this but only surveyed myself.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Not linking the product because last time someone called it \"just Calendly with extra steps\" and I'm still processing that emotionally.\n\nEDIT: Sorry if i don't respond to your comment/dm, never got so many before so i'm adjusting.",

          "text": "Alright, so you've built a real business solving a real problem. $4K MRR in 11 months from a standing start is solid, especially in a niche this small. Most people talking on here never get past $0 MRR, so you're already ahead.\n\nBut let's address the actual problems:\n\n**The legal letter thing:**\n\nStop the scaled outreach plan immediately. You already know it's legally sketchy because someone literally sent you a letter about it. Hiring a VA to blast 500 messages a day with your second (and planned third) LinkedIn account isn't \"good redundancy,\" it's speedrunning an account ban and possibly a lawsuit.\n\nHere's what actually works at your scale without getting sued: double down on referrals. You said 6 customers referred 14 more. That's a 2.3x referral multiplier, which is insane for B2B SaaS. Most companies would kill for that. Build a referral program. Give existing customers $20 off per month for every practice they refer that converts. Or give them a free month after 3 referrals. Make it stupid easy and actually reward them.\n\nAlso, your churn is low because the product solves a genuine pain point. That means your customers probably know other office managers dealing with the same problem. Ask them directly: \"Who else do you know struggling with compliance reminders?\" Then ask for a warm intro, not their contact info to cold blast.\n\nYou'll get way more than 11 replies from 1,847 messages, and you won't need a legal defense fund.\n\n**The pricing thing:**\n\nYou're undercharging, but don't jump to $79 for existing customers. That's a 61% increase and you'll spike churn. Here's the play: grandfather existing customers at $49 forever (builds loyalty and referrals), charge new customers $79 starting now.\n\nRun it for 90 days. Track conversion rate on trials at the new price. If it tanks, you know $79 is too high for cold acquisition. If it holds, you just increased revenue by 61% on all new customers without touching churn.\n\nThe \"peace of mind\" positioning is fine, but the real value prop is \"your office manager gets 40 minutes back every week.\" That's 35 hours a year. If their hourly rate is $25, you're saving them $875/year for $588/year at $49/month. At $79/month it's $948/year, still ROI positive. Lead with that, not vibes about peace of mind.\n\n**The TAM concern:**\n\n4,200 practices (or 6,800 with vet) is small, but you're at 53 customers. That's 1.2% market penetration if we're being generous with the vet inclusion. You've got room to grow before TAM becomes the limiting factor. The bigger issue is that this market caps you around $340K ARR at 100% penetration and $49/month, which is... not a venture outcome, but is a reasonable lifestyle business if you can get to 20-30% penetration.\n\nIf you want to grow beyond that, you'll need to expand TAM (other healthcare verticals, international, add features that let you charge more) or accept this is a nice $100-200K/year business and optimize for profitability and your sanity.",

What I didn't understand is, did it take you 11 months to get to the current MRR? Or less? Try finding a good estimate, and keep that as a guideline. In general, you should increase the price, grandfather the current people, and see if you are able to at least hit that guideline in the following months.\n\nI'd also give you a wild idea and try a bigger number, something like $99. It might seem counterintuitive, but many see a more expensive product as something premium. Just be sure never to try and back down and say \"Oh yeah, we just recently raised the price\" or try to give a discount cause you feel bad. Do it as an experiment and see if it works.\n\nI'd also advise adding a yearly plan as well, something where you pay 9 months for the full year. It gives a good chunk on income early on, which you can use\n\n2. Now the important part, your girlfriend. She is totally in the right. You spent almost an entire year only to practically build a business with 0% margin. She is right to be worried and you should be at least a bit as well. This is not guaranteed to work even now and if it fails in the end it might be rough.\n\nPay yourself at least so you can cover half the rent or help somehow, get her to a nice dinner for once. You called her your co-founder, if you have a good enough accountant you can put those costs as business expenses.  \nBut I can't imagine your month to month costs for the business actually add up to the entire revenue. And if they are, you have to fix something. If you need 4k to keep a 4k business going, you're going to need 15k when it reaches 15k as well.\n\nYou are not a VC backed company, you are not here to do anything to grow revenue. You are a dude who is trying to make a living with a small product he built - that is your goal. If you are not able to take out a profit, it doesn't matter how much the product is making, the goal still failed.",

If they balk at $79 for something that saves 40 min/week, that's a qualification signal, not a pricing problem.

They were terrible \"product managers\" in the traditional sense.\n\nHere is what the successful founders did that the failed ones didn't:\n\n1. They launched incomplete.\nThe winners forced me to ship half-baked features. They didn't care if the \"Settings\" page was empty. They didn't care if the password reset flow was \"email me and I'll do it manually.\" They just wanted the core value prop live. The failures? They delayed for 3 weeks because the mobile menu animation wasn't smooth.\n\n2. They treated me like a partner, not a printer.\nThe failed founders sent me a 20-page PDF and said \"build this.\" The successful ones got on a call and said \"here is the problem, how can we solve this cheaply?\" They let me cut scope. They let me tell them that their idea was expensive and stupid. They wanted friction.\n\n3. They focused on one feature.\nI had a client who built a massive project management tool. It failed. Too many buttons. Another client built a tool that just did *one specific type of invoice reconciliation* for dentists. He's rich now. The winners don't build platforms. They build tools that solve a bleeding neck problem.\n\n4. They ignored the tech stack.\nThe failures asked me \"Are we using Next.js 14? Is it serverless?\" The winners asked \"Can we add Stripe by Friday?\" They didn't care if I built it in PHP or Python. They cared about the cash register ringing.\n\nIf you are a non-technical founder, stop trying to play CTO. Stop obsessing over the architecture.\n\nFocus on the problem. Be willing to ship something ugly. And find a developer who will tell you \"no\" when you ask for stupid features.\n\nThat's the pattern. It's not magic. It's just brutal prioritization.\n\nAnyone else notice this split in their clients?\n\n",

DAU, conversion rate, churn. Numbers on a dashboard replace actual conversations.\n\n  \nThe founders who kept winning were the ones who maintained that feedback loop after launch. Still reading support conversations, still jumping on calls, still asking \"why did you cancel\" instead of just looking at churn numbers. The ones who failed treated customer research as a phase instead of a permanent operating mode.\n\n  \nProduct sense isn't magic. It's just continued exposure to real customer problems.

If they immediately ask \"what's the fastest path to getting this in front of users,\" that project usually works out.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: the successful founders almost always had a distribution plan before they had a product. They knew exactly which 50 people were going to use it first. The ones who failed would say \"we'll figure out marketing after launch.\" There is no after launch if nobody knows you exist.",

Si ton message ne convertit pas en organique, le payer ne le rendra pas meilleur, ça rendra juste l'échec plus cher.\n\nPar contre je nuancerais le point 7. \"Garder son job jusqu'à 1-2 ans de trésorerie\" c'est le conseil safe, et c'est le bon pour la plupart des gens. Mais j'ai étudié pas mal de lancements récemment et le pattern que je vois le plus chez ceux qui réussissent c'est un truc intermédiaire : ils gardent une source de revenus flexible (freelance, consulting, missions ponctuelles) plutôt qu'un CDI. Ça leur donne le cash pour survivre + le temps pour construire, sans le piège du 9-5 qui bouffe toute l'énergie créative.\n\nUn fondateur que je connais a fait exactement ça pendant 3 ans. Missions freelance quand il avait besoin de cash, SaaS le reste du temps. Le problème c'est qu'il n'avait pas de revenus réguliers, et chaque trou de trésorerie augmentait la pression sur ses décisions produit. Avec le recul il dit que son erreur c'était pas de se lancer — c'était de ne pas garder un filet minimum.\n\nEt le point 19 rejoint quelque chose que j'observe souvent : les fondateurs qui ont les meilleurs premiers mois sont ceux qui ont donné du temps en 1-1 gratuitement pendant des semaines/mois avant de lancer. Coaching, conseils, aider des gens en DM sans rien demander. Le jour du lancement, ces personnes achètent les yeux fermés parce que la confiance est déjà là.\n\nFélicitations pour les 12k/mois d'ailleurs. T'as mis combien de temps avant les premiers 1k ?",

I then quickly went back to replit and redesigned a landing page all in replit, then I added a paywall ( integrated with stripe ) and relaunched it as a full service micro saas. I am not close to 600 customers and paying customers as well and it's been a week. a true case study of it not needing to be beautiful or perfect. it just has to do one thing and do it well. ",

I started with free but couldn't afford paying for everyone's accounts, so I removed the free plan from the signup page (for now). I had a few bots at first until I implemented phone number verification, but now both bot signups and user signups have dropped to zero. I even took a whole week to test my signup process and validate that it was working with test accounts.\n\nThe problem is if you don't have the capital to pay for someone else's account, you either need to get paying customers up front or find another way to support free accounts, like ads. I personally hate ads, but if they will support free accounts that convert eventually, then in time I can remove the ads when income becomes more sustainable.",

A lot of people build something useful, but never figure out exactly who it’s for and where those people hang out, so they think the idea is bad when it’s really a distribution problem.\n\nWhat worked for me was picking one narrow persona, one painful use case, and one place they already spend time. Then doing 20–30 1:1 conversations, pitching a simple landing page + Stripe link before adding features. HubSpot or Close can be overkill early, but even a spreadsheet plus Stripe is enough to track if your story lands.\n\nOn the daily posting point, I’ve found tools like Hypefury and manual Reddit searches useful, and lately Pulse alongside those to catch super specific Reddit threads right when people are asking about my niche.\n\nMain point: don’t just validate the SaaS, validate how you’ll repeatedly get in front of the same kind of buyer.",

In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from Rebelgrowth\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

When the price jumps from $9 to $97, you need the product experience in that first month to be really strong. I've seen founders do this successfully by having an automated \"win\" moment within the first 48 hours — something that makes the user feel like they've already gotten value.\n\n\n\nAlso curious about your churn numbers on the $97 plan specifically. Are most people who make it past month 2 sticking around, or is there another drop-off point?",

      "text": "I have a SaaS,[ rebelgrowth](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit), doing around $321k ARR. On paper, things are great. In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

          "text": "First off, doing $321k ARR solo is no joke. You’ve clearly built something real. But I also get what you’re trying to say. Revenue doesn’t automatically relieve pressure; sometimes it amplifies it because there’s now more to maintain and more at stake.\n\nI haven’t been at your exact number solo, but I’ve hit that “I am the system” phase before. The biggest shift for me wasn’t finding a co-founder immediately, but it was buying back my time in very unsexy ways. First support contractor. Then someone part-time for ops. Even 10–15 hours a week off your plate changes your mental state. You don’t need a visionary partner first. You might need oxygen.\n\nOn the YC point, I don’t think it’s crazy, but I’d be careful about using YC primarily as a co-founder matching service. A partner found under pressure can solve burnout short-term but create misalignment long-term. If you do look for one, optimize for values, working style, and stress compatibility, not just skill gap.\n\nAnd on burnout… momentum isn’t just about pushing harder. Sometimes it’s about redesigning the machine so it doesn’t require you to be the engine. You’ve proven the product works. Now the real work is building a structure where it works without you carrying it every day.",

If the main need is mental load sharing, a high-agency ops hire + clear ownership can get you 70% of the benefit with way less risk.\n\nCurious: what’s actually crushing you right now — support volume, incidents, sales calls, or just context switching?",

Hire a primary engineer if you're not a high level engineer, hire a sales person if you don't do well in sales, hire a support team if you're struggling there. Having a backup in case something happens to you is the biggest thing the financial people are looking for wine they say you need a co-founder. The good thing is that you probably have a lot of margin to work with at that ARR so you can make a mistake and it won't hurt too bad.  \n\nYou may also want to look into some VC funding and accelerate growth at that point. Then you can get their expertise too. Find other SaaS providers in your industry too and get their advice.

Hire for your specific bottleneck, not a general role** - At this ARR you can't hire a team, but you can hire ONE person who removes your top constraint. If it's support volume, hire for that specifically. If it's sales follow-up, hire for that. Don't hire a \"general VA\" - hire to eliminate your #1 time drain.\n\nThe burnout often isn't the volume of work - it's doing too many context switches between wildly different types of work.

There is no harm in getting a co founder so late but depending on type of work, fit and personality you may want to look for a contract employee or additional tools and services to help. Really depends on your product, fit and the types of tasks that bleed you emotionally and financially. \n\nMy point: automate as much as you can and improve workflows as much as you can before going this direction. You built it yourself and no one will care about it more than yourself.\n\nThis is the founders curse and thousands will love to have this problem of who to hire/add and how to grow beyond the 500k-1m mark.

That's genuinely impressive, and the fact that you recognize the burnout pattern before it breaks you is a good sign.\n\nI run a dev company and I've seen this exact inflection point with a few founders we work with. The common mistake is jumping straight to \"I need a cofounder\" when the real problem is \"I need to stop doing three jobs poorly instead of one job well.\"\n\nWhat worked for the ones who got through it:\n\n1. Audit your week honestly. Track where your hours actually go for 7 days. Most solo founders discover they're spending 40-60% of their time on support and ops, not building.\n\n2. Hire for the role you hate most, not the one you think sounds strategic. If support is eating you alive, a senior support person who can also do light QA will give you back 20+ hours a week overnight.\n\n3. Skip the cofounder search at this stage. At k ARR you have leverage. You can hire a strong operator or a fractional COO/CTO without giving up equity. A cofounder made sense at zero revenue. At k, what you need is a great first hire.\n\n4. YC is great, but using it primarily to find a cofounder when you already have product-market fit and real revenue feels like using a sledgehammer for a nail. Their value is in network and scaling advice, not matchmaking.\n\nThe burnout you're feeling isn't from lack of a partner. It's from lack of leverage. One great hire changes everything.",

Burnout at this stage is normal, not a failure.  \nWhen you’re doing support, dev, sales, roadmap, and firefighting alone, you’re not running a SaaS anymore… you’re carrying one.  \nThat pressure compounds fast.\n\n2. Finding a co‑founder after traction is absolutely possible.  \nPeople love to say “you need a co‑founder from day one,” but the truth is:  \nRevenue is the strongest filter for aligned partners.  \nPlenty of operators, technical leads, and ex‑founders would join a proven product over a pre‑idea gamble.\n\n3. YC isn’t crazy, but it’s not the only path.  \nYC gives you a network, accountability, and potential co‑founders, but you’d be giving up equity for something you may be able to solve with:  \n- a senior engineer  \n- a fractional CTO  \n- a support lead  \n- or a true operations partner  \n\n4. The real question is: what kind of help do you actually need?  \nA co‑founder solves emotional load and strategic load.  \nA hire solves operational load.  \nBurnout usually comes from the second one.\n\n5.

A co-founder found under pressure rarely works out the same as one built through shared conviction. What worked better for me was finding senior contractors who could eventually transition into equity partners once we'd proven we work well together.\n\nAnd on burnout specifically — at $321k ARR you can absolutely afford to buy back 10-15 hours a week.

The burnout at this stage is real though and it's a specific kind of burnout that people without SaaS experience don't understand.\n\n  \nIt's not \"I'm working too many hours\" burnout. It's \"every customer conversation is potentially the most important thing I should be paying attention to but I don't have the bandwidth to actually process it\" burnout. You're answering support tickets but half your brain is thinking about the feature you should be building. You're building the feature but you keep getting interrupted by support. Neither gets your full attention.\n\n  \nThe thing that helped me was separating \"answering the customer\" from \"learning from the customer.\" Answering is reactive and urgent. Learning is where the real product insights come from - the patterns across conversations, the things multiple people are struggling with. Most solo founders at your stage are doing the first part fine and completely ignoring the second because who has time.\n\n  \nDon't bring in a co-founder just to share the load. That creates a whole new set of problems. Hire for the most repetitive stuff first and protect your time for the parts that actually require your brain.",

For what it's worth, I think hiring senior people makes more sense than hunting for a cofounder at this stage.\n\nYou've already de-risked the business significantly, so you can actually attract good operators now. A cofounder split at this point gets messy with valuation and equity expectations. Better to bring on a strong VP of Ops or Product Manager who can take entire functions off your plate.\n\nOn the burnout side, one thing that helped people I know is getting clarity on the financial side first so you can make confident hiring decisions without second-guessing every dollar. I came across AsteroCFO. Ai (https://asterocfo .ai) recently and their Hybrid CFO plan seems built for this exact situation. You get AI-powered insights daily plus a monthly call with an actual CFO for like $597, which is way less than a fractional CFO.\n\nHaving someone help you model out hires and runway might take some of teh pressure off before you pull the trigger on bringing people on.",

Not Product Hunt specifically, but a big splash launch that brought a flood of signups we weren't ready for. The thing nobody talks about is the opportunity cost - while you're firefighting infrastructure and support, you're not iterating on the product. So the users who might have stuck around get a frozen, buggy experience and leave anyway.\n\nThe pattern I've seen work better is what some people call a \"slow launch\" - intentionally throttle signups, onboard in cohorts, and use each batch to find and fix the retention leaks before opening the gates wider. Less exciting, zero champagne emojis, but you actually learn what makes people stay.\n\nAlso the competitive research signups thing is so real. After our launch about 40% of our \"users\" had competitor company emails. They inflated every metric and made it impossible to read our actual data for weeks.",

The answer-first formatting is something I've been testing heavily over the last few months and the results are real.\n\nWe track where our traffic comes from for a few service business clients, and what jumped out is that about 30% of their organic visibility now comes from AI-generated answers and featured snippets rather than traditional blue links. That number was closer to 12% a year ago.\n\nThe topic cluster approach you mentioned is huge. We rebuilt one client's entire blog from individual keyword-targeted posts into proper pillar structures - maybe 40 articles consolidated into 8 clusters. Organic traffic dipped for about 3 weeks then came back 2.2x stronger. The key was aggressive internal linking and making sure each cluster had a genuinely comprehensive pillar page, not just a thin overview.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: structured data markup is becoming way more important for AI scraping. FAQ schema, HowTo schema, even just clean heading hierarchies. We saw a noticeable uptick in AI Overview citations after implementing proper schema across a client's service pages.\n\nThe E-E-A-T piece is the one most people underestimate though. We started putting real author bios with verifiable credentials on every piece of content and it made a measurable difference in rankings within about 6 weeks. Google is clearly getting better at distinguishing between generic AI-generated content and stuff written by someone who actually knows the space.",

On any given Product Hunt launch in the SaaS space, I'd estimate at least 30-40% of signups are other founders or investors just poking around. They'll never convert and they skew every metric you try to learn from.\n\nThe lesson I took from a similar experience: treat your launch as the beginning of a funnel experiment, not a revenue event. The only number that matters from a launch is how many of those users are still active 30 days later. Everything else is noise that feels good.",

Got about 600 signups from a single Reddit post that blew up. Team was pumped. Two weeks later our DAU was actually lower than before because the infrastructure costs ate into our runway and we'd shifted focus from building for existing users to onboarding new ones.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about launch spikes is the support load. Those 2000 signups probably generated what, 300-400 support tickets in the first week? And most of them are from tire-kickers who will never convert, but you can't tell which ones are which so you have to respond to all of them. Meanwhile your actual power users who were there before the spike are getting slower response times and worse experience.\n\nI think the real lesson here is that launch readiness has nothing to do with the product being ready. It's about having the retention infrastructure ready. Do you have an onboarding sequence that works without hand-holding? Do you have a clear activation metric that you know correlates with retention? Do you have automated support for the top 10 questions?\n\nIf the answer to any of those is no, a big launch will actively hurt you because you're creating first impressions at scale and those first impressions are bad ones.\n\nThe Tuesday at 3pm test is perfect honestly. That should be the standard before anyone even considers a big launch push.",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

Which is kind of insane when you think about it. You're basically betting months of work on a hunch.\n\nBut the really successful people I've been following? They flip it completely. They market first. They validate demand when it costs them literally nothing. Then they build.\n\nDropbox did this with a demo video and got 75k signups overnight.   \nRobinhood had a referral waitlist that hit a million users before they even had a real product. Buffer validated their entire business model with just a pricing page in 48 hours.\n\nThe pattern is wild once you see it.\n\nWhen you market before building, you're not just wasting time. You're actually testing if people give a shit. You're building an audience while you're in the development phase. You're validating demand with zero code written.\n\nThat last part is probably the biggest thing. If you can't get people excited about the problem you're solving before you build the solution, honestly... you probably shouldn't build it at all.\n\nThe best validation isn't code. It's attention.\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around how differently this changes everything.

I have seen plenty of big waitlists turn into ghost towns after launch.\n\nMarketing first is great for de-risking demand, but it does not replace learning from real usage. Some problems only reveal themselves once people touch the product and get frustrated. The real trick is knowing what question you are validating at each step, attention, retention, or willingness to pay.",

I've seen landing pages convert at 30% for \"free early access\" and then 0.5% when you ask for a credit card.

Just me pressing “submit” and hoping at least a few people would care.\n\nI posted it on Product Hunt mostly to force myself to launch publicly. It’s not blowing up or anything. No crazy upvotes. No front page domination. Just a handful of people engaging and a few thoughtful comments.\n\nBut here’s the part that caught me off guard:\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the App Store charts… and right now it’s sitting at **#142 in its category in Germany**.\n\nThree hours in.\n\nI genuinely didn’t expect to see a ranking at all. I always assumed those charts were reserved for companies with marketing budgets and coordinated launches. Seeing my tiny, self-funded app show up there — even at #142 — feels surreal.\n\nWhat’s wild is realizing how small the early momentum actually is. It doesn’t take thousands of downloads to start moving the needle when you’re starting from zero. A bit of visibility, a few shares, some organic installs… and suddenly you’re “on the chart.”\n\nThe launch is still happening. I’m still refreshing everything way too often. I have no idea where it’ll end up by tonight — it might climb, it might disappear.\n\nBut right now, three hours after launching, something I built is ranking in the App Store. And that feels pretty incredible.\n\nIf you’re building something and waiting for the “perfect” moment — this is your sign to just ship it.\n\nIf anyone’s curious, here’s the launch:\n\nProduct Hunt:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/sparkle-kids-stories-for-storytime/](https://www.producthunt.com/products/sparkle-kids-stories-for-storytime/)\n\nApp Store:  \n[https://apps.apple.com/de/app/sparkle-kids-stories/id6757500167?l=en-GB](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/sparkle-kids-stories/id6757500167?l=en-GB)\n\nHappy to answer questions while I sit here refreshing stats 😅",

Turned out most of my drop off was from in-app browsers.\n\nWhen people click ads on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok they land in those app browsers and those things are terrible for checkout. No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook is way lower than Safari that's your leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

Desktop traffic was “fine,” but Android on certain carriers was converting like trash. Turned out my checkout script was timing out on slower connections, so the form looked “broken” even though analytics just showed it as a normal bounce. I fixed the script, cut some heavy stuff, and suddenly the same traffic started printing money.\n\nTools like tryhoox are huge for this type of problem, same way I use PostHog for funnel breakdowns and then Pulse for Reddit to spot real-world complaints that hint at odd friction points I’d never think to track. Your post is a good reminder: don’t just stare at top-line CR, slice it until the pattern jumps out.",

A small, concentrated spike in a specific geo like Germany can push you up faster than a broad campaign.\n\nHonestly, this is a better signal than Product Hunt. PH is just other builders giving you a thumbs up. The App Store is actual users trying to solve a problem.\n\nDid you actually localize the metadata/screenshots for Germany, or is this totally random organic spillover?",

That initial push helped us gain traction pretty quickly.\n\nThe tricky part was that the app was built as a university project, so technically the university owned the code. Even though we wrote everything ourselves, they later sold the rights to a third-party company to take it forward. In the end, we were offered jobs by that company to continue building “our” app. My friend took the offer. ",

That takes guts.\n\nThe #142 thing is a great insight that most people miss. App Store charts in smaller categories aren't the impossible mountain everyone imagines. A handful of installs in a short window can move you up fast because most apps in any given category are basically dead. You're not competing against thousands of active competitors, you're competing against a graveyard of abandoned projects. That's good news for you.\n\nOne thing I'd think about now while you still have fresh launch energy: screenshot everything. Your Product Hunt comments, your chart position, your first few reviews. Six months from now when you're grinding through a slow week, those screenshots are rocket fuel. You'll forget how today felt. Don't let yourself.\n\nAlso since you mentioned no email list and no ads, the next 48 hours matter more than you think. Product Hunt traffic has a very short half-life. If there's any way to capture emails from people who land on your page but don't download yet (a simple landing page, a waitlist for upcoming features, anything), do it today. That traffic won't come back on its own.\n\nChecked out the App Store link. Kids stories with AI is a space that's heating up fast so your timing is solid. Curious what made you pick that niche. Do you have kids yourself or did you spot a gap from the outside?\n\nEither way, stop refreshing and go enjoy the fact that you shipped something real. The stats will still be there tomorrow.",

I’ve been so focused on shipping that I haven’t fully optimized for capturing traffic yet — definitely something I’ll act on now.\n\nAs for the niche: one of my co-founder’s moms works in a kindergarten and originally came up with the idea. She sees how stressed parents are and how powerful stories can be for teaching values. We also loved the idea of kids drawing their own characters and seeing them come alive in stories — that emotional connection is huge.\n\nAnd yes… I’ll try to stop refreshing now 😅",

The next 48 hours matter more than launch day: watch what keywords drove installs, what screenshots got the most engagement, where people drop off in onboarding.\n\n\n\nIf you're self-funded with no list, the real game is turning those first few users into your distribution engine. Every parent who finds it useful is a potential word-of-mouth channel in their local groups. That scales better than paid ads at this stage.",

Your app looks really polished too - the UI is clean and the concept is solid for parents looking for story content.\n\n  \nJust went and upvoted you in Product Hunt.

Our main focus is making stories something kids want to come back to, not just try once. That’s why we’re leaning heavily into personalization — letting kids create their own characters and see them evolve across stories.\n\nWe’re also planning themed story packs, small learning arcs (values, emotions, etc.), and giving parents reasons to return with new content regularly. The launch is exciting, but long-term this only works if kids ask for it again the next night.\n\nOpen to any retention tips you’ve seen work well in kids apps — always learning.",

The pattern we noticed is that LLMs heavily favor pages with clear structured data (schema markup, FAQ sections, comparison tables) over generic blog posts, even if the generic posts rank higher on traditional Google.\n\nThe reason is that LLMs are essentially doing extractive summarization. They need clean, structured information they can confidently attribute. A well-organized comparison page with clear data points gets cited way more than a 3,000-word thought leadership piece that meanders.\n\nThe other thing people miss: Reddit threads genuinely influence AI citations more than most realize. ChatGPT and Claude both pull heavily from Reddit because it represents \"real user consensus\" in their training data. So being genuinely helpful in relevant threads (not spamming) actually compounds over time.\n\nBut yeah, the core point stands. There's no shortcut. It's 12+ months of consistent, high-quality presence across multiple surfaces. Anyone selling a \"rank in ChatGPT\" course is selling snake oil.",

      "text": "I've been doing B2B outreach for 3 years and this is hands down the most effective prospecting hack I've ever found.\n\nMost people are out here buying garbage lead lists or cold emailing random companies.\n\nMeanwhile I'm literally taking my competitors' best prospects and reaching out to them FIRST.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n\n\nThe \"Company Switch\" Hack\n\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator lets you filter by \"Company\" and \"Past Company.\"\n\nHere's what most people don't realize:\n\nIf you work at a marketing agency and want to find prospects who are actively looking for marketing help...\n\nJust look at who's following or engaging with your competitors.\n\nThese people are ALREADY interested in what you sell. They're not cold. They're warm.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Go to your top 3 competitors' LinkedIn company pages\n2. Look at their followers (or people engaging with their posts)\n3. Filter by your ideal job title (CMO, VP Marketing, Head of Growth, etc.)\n4. These people are actively researching solutions like yours\n\nBut here's the real hack...\n\nThe \"Influencer Scrape\" Method\n\nThis one's even better.\n\nFind 5-10 influencers in your niche who post about topics related to your product.\n\nExample: If you sell sales software, find people posting about cold email, outbound, SDR tips, etc.\n\nNow look at WHO'S ENGAGING with their content.\n\nThe people commenting \"Great post!\" or \"This is gold\" on sales content are:\n\n\\- Actively thinking about sales\n\n\\- Engaged and online\n\n\\- Self-identifying as interested in your space\n\nThese aren't cold leads. These are people who literally raised their hand and said \"I care about this topic.\"\n\nI've gotten 40-50% reply rates reaching out to these people because my message is: \"Saw you commenting on \\[influencer\\]'s post about \\[topic\\]. Thought you might find this relevant...\"\n\nIt's not cold outreach. It's warm outreach disguised as cold.\n\nThe tools:\n\nYou can use Trigify to scrape LinkedIn engagers and export them. Works well if you just need the data.\n\nBut honestly I use my own tool  Linkedify because:\n\n\\- It scrapes AND reaches out in one workflow\n\n\\- No more exporting CSVs, importing to another tool, deduping, etc.\n\n\\- You can set up automations that find new engagers daily and reach out automatically\n\nThe difference is like 2 hours of manual work vs. 10 minutes of setup.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\\- Week 1: 47 connection requests sent → 31 accepted → 12 conversations → 5 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 2: 52 sent → 38 accepted → 14 conversations → 7 calls booked\n\n\\- Week 3: You get the idea\n\nThe quality of these leads is insane because they're ALREADY warm. They follow competitors. They engage with niche content. They're in-market.\n\nStop buying lead lists. Start hunting where your buyers already are.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nInstead of cold outreach to random people, scrape your competitors' followers and influencers' engagers. These people are already interested in your space. Use Trigify for data export or Linkedify if you want scraping + outreach in one tool. My reply rates went from 3% to 40%+ using this method.\n\nHappy hunting. 🎯",

Where this usually goes wrong is when people confuse warm context with permission and then blast generic pitches at scale.\n\nAlso worth saying: the moment you automate scraping + outreach aggressively, LinkedIn tolerance, brand trust, and reply quality tend to fall off fast. High reply rates early often don’t survive volume.\n\nGood targeting idea, but the real differentiator is still the message and restraint, not the tool stack.",

Or they're just scrolling and double-tapping everything. I wasted probably 2 weeks reaching out to people who were interested in the topic but had zero budget or authority.  \n  \nWhat helped was adding one more filter: looking at recent job changes or promotions. If someone just became Head of Sales and they're engaging with sales content, that's a much stronger signal than just engagement alone.  \n  \nThe other thing I'd add is that video messages work ridiculously well with this warm audience. When you can reference the specific post they commented on and show your face, it feels less like automation (even if parts of your process are automated). I've seen response rates jump quite a bit just by swapping text for a quick 30-second video.  \n  \nHow are you handling the actual outreach message?

This includes startups, SaaS directories, niche forums, free submission platforms, and local citations.\n\nThat effort has now resulted in a comprehensive list of over 820 hand-vetted places to list your startup. I've used this list myself and with more than 20 clients, and it consistently:\n\n- Provides early backlinks\n- Drives discovery traffic\n- Improves brand visibility\n- Gets you featured on roundup blogs and “best tools” lists\n\nMost of these listings are free. Some require manual entry, while others allow for API or submission tools.\n\nI’ve also added filters to help you navigate the list:\n\n- SaaS only\n- Local (USA/Canada)\n- AI Tools\n- Chrome Extensions\n- App Store/Alt Store listings\n- Funding-focused sites\n- Backlinks categorized by Domain Rating (DR) and indexing speed\n\nI created [this tool to automate directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) (so you don’t spend 8 hours filling out the same form). Founders are using it to secure 20–40 live links in just a week!\n\nFinally, I’m sharing the exact SEO checklist I used for my consulting clients, something I charged $1,500+ for, which I’m now giving away for free. No email gate, just good karma.\n\nIf you're interested, comment “send,” and I’ll share the full Notion document with you.",

I've been in a similar boat, trying to boost visibility for my side project.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is to not just blindly submit *everywhere*. Focus on quality over quantity. A link from a relevant, reputable site is way more valuable than 10 from sketchy directories. Also, make sure your listings are consistent across all platforms - name, description, etc. Google really seems to appreciate that consistency. Good luck, hope it helps!",

Start by tagging every directory with UTM params and a simple “intent” label (founders, devs, buyers, general traffic). Then watch which sites actually send signups or trials, not just clicks or DR. After 2–3 weeks, prune the ones that send junk and rewrite your listing copy for the 5–10 that are converting.\n\n\n\nI’ve had better results when I tailor the landing page by category (AI tools page for AI directories, comparison page for “best X” sites, feature page for niche forums) instead of dumping everything on the homepage. Also worth pairing this with Reddit/communities: use things like SparkToro, Ahrefs alerts, and Pulse for Reddit-style monitoring to catch threads where people ask for tools in your niche and drop your best-performing angle there.\n\n\n\nMain point: the gold isn’t the 820 links alone, it’s iterating on which 10 actually move revenue.",

That point of view is mind-blowing to me!\n\nOut of curiosity, when you think about “visible friction” or “active moments,” what signals do you personally look for first when evaluating whether it’s the right time to reach out?",

What helped me was tracking those moments explicitly (hiring, public complaints, tool switches) instead of building generic lead lists. Tools like Followerli are useful here because they surface people already engaging with competitor content or talking about the problem in public which usually means the decision process has already started",

You are reaching out to people who are in a \"static\" state, so you have to work 10x harder to persuade them.\n\nThe Solution: Target Moments, Not People.\n\nInstead of scraping broad lists, look for Trigger Events that make your service an immediate priority:\n\n1. Recent Hires: A new Head of Marketing or Product usually has a budget and a mandate to change tools/processes.\n2. Visible Friction: If you find a bug on their site, a slow checkout, or a missing feature their users are complaining about on Twitter - that is your \"in.\"\n3. Recent Launches: Companes are most vulnerable and attentive right after a new release.\n\nThe \"Qualified Founder\" Workflow:\n\n* Step 1: Stop asking \"Who is my buyer?\" and start asking \"What problem are they desperately trying to solve this specific month?\"\n* Step 2: Find 10 companies experiencing that \"moment\" right now.\n* Step 3: Reach out with zero fluff. Don't be \"clever\" or \"persuasive.\" Just show up as the solution to the thing already on their mind.\n\nWhen you hit a buyer during an active moment of pain, you don't sound like a \"spammy salesman\" -you sound like a lucky coincidience.\n\nSlow down the volume, increase the context, and stop selling to \"abstract\" users.

What makes a lead “good”\n3 signals:\n\t•\tThey’re already trying to solve the problem (job posts, tools, hiring SDRs)\n\t•\tThey have revenue (or funding)\n\t•\tYou can clearly see the pain on their site\n\nIf I couldn’t explain why they’d care in 10 seconds, I didn’t contact them.\n\n4. First outreach that worked\nShort. No pitch deck. No paragraph walls.\n\nStructure:\n\t•\t1 personalized line\n\t•\t1 clear pain observation\n\t•\t1 simple question\n\nExample:\n“Noticed you’re hiring SDRs, are you scaling outbound manually right now?”\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNo features.\nNo “we help companies scale…”\nJust curiosity + relevance.\n\n5. If I started over today (first 30 days)\n\nDays 1–7:\n\t•\tDefine ultra-specific ICP\n\t•\tBuild 200 hyper-relevant leads\n\nDays 8–21:\n\t•\tSend 20–40 emails per day\n\t•\tTrack replies\n\t•\tAdjust targeting before adjusting copy\n\nDays 22–30:\n\t•\tDouble down on the segment replying most\n\t•\tIgnore everyone else\n\nThe biggest mistake I made early:\nTrying to “improve messaging” when the real problem was bad targeting.\n\nOnce targeting was tight, even average copy worked.\n\nIf you want, I can break down the exact workflow I use for qualifying leads so you don’t waste time on random businesses.",

Instagram DMs and LinkedIn messages have brutal character limits and low response rates compared to a well written cold email. With our clients who started from scratch, the ones who got traction fastest all did the same thing. They picked one specific type of business to target, built a list of 200 to 300 contacts, and sent short personalized emails that led with a specific problem they solve rather than introducing themselves. Nobody cares who you are, they care what you can fix for them.\n\nThe \"sounding spammy\" fear is what keeps most people from ever sending enough volume to see results. You need to send at least 500 to 1000 emails before you have enough data to judge what's working. That's not spam, that's testing. Keep your emails under 80 words, ask one simple question, and don't pitch your whole service in the first message. Your only goal with email one is to start a conversation, not close a deal.\n\nNiche down before you send a single email. \"I help businesses\" is invisible, \"I help dental practices get more patients through X\" gets responses.

Often it's just consistency in one channel that you have to master first, not trying to balance a bunch. ",

When the product went on sale, all the factories where ready to roar but no one was buying! So the key question is: What is the fastest way to test my market idea and validate the market need for the minimum amount of money? Then, you take what you learn, pivot and MVP again, until you either run out of $ or your product / service starts making $.  \n[Paitar Book Browser](https://paitar.com/?bookid=theleansta-b468c3394f53)",

Specific Discord servers, Reddit threads, niche forums. I didn't pitch anything for weeks. I'd just help people with genuine answers and share stuff I'd learned from building.\n\nAfter maybe three weeks a few of those people DMed me asking what I was working on. My first five paying users all came from those organic conversations, not from any launch post or email campaign.\n\nThe biggest lesson was that finding clients isn't really a separate step from building.

Every day I’d answer 2–3 posts with something concrete: a loom video, a mini checklist, or a quick script/snippet. No pitch, just “here’s how I’d fix it.” When someone replied with follow-up questions, that’s when I’d say “I’m actually building a small tool for this, want to see a rough version?”\n\n\n\nTo keep it sane, I rotated between LinkedIn search, SparkToro, and Pulse for Reddit alongside basic Reddit keyword alerts so I only jumped into threads where my exact problem showed up.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, show up where people already hurt, be useful repeatedly, and let them ask you what you’re building.",

LinkedIn outbound is underrated. Not the spammy connection + pitch kind. Find 50 people who fit your ICP, actually look at what they post, and send a genuine message about a specific problem you noticed. Response rates are 10-20x higher than generic cold email.\n\n  \n2. Go where your target customers already complain. Reddit threads, Twitter, niche Slack/Discord communities. When someone describes the exact problem you solve, thats your warmest lead. Reply with genuine help first, mention your product second.\n\n  \n3. Your first 10 customers should come from conversations, not funnels. Get on calls. Ask them what they need.

          "text": "Since you mentioned you're selling product visuals to small ecommerce brands, I want to give you something specific to your situation, because you actually have an unfair advantage that most service sellers don't: **the problem you solve is visible on the prospect's storefront.**\n\nBad product photos are not hidden behind a login or buried in internal metrics. They're right there on the product page. That means your prospecting workflow can be way more targeted than \"scrape a list and blast emails.\"\n\nHere's what I'd actually do in your shoes:\n\n**1. Build your list from Shopify/ecommerce directories, not Google.**\n\nTools like Store Leads, BuiltWith, or even the Shopify app store reviews let you filter by niche, platform, and size. You want stores doing roughly $10K-$100K/month (big enough to care about conversion, small enough to not have an in-house photographer). The subjtochange comment in this thread about purchasing GDPR-compliant store lists is a real option too.\n\n**2. Audit before you outreach.**\n\nVisit their product pages. You're looking for specific visual problems: inconsistent backgrounds, bad lighting, phone-quality images mixed with studio shots, missing lifestyle/context photos, products photographed on a kitchen table. Screenshot the ones that are obvious. This takes 2-3 minutes per store, but it's the entire foundation of your outreach.\n\n**3. Your email writes itself once you've done step 2.**\n\nSomething like: \"Noticed your \\[specific product\\] listings are using mixed photo styles, some studio, some more casual. That inconsistency usually hurts conversion on product pages. I put together a quick before/after mock-up for one of your SKUs, would it be useful to see it?\"\n\nThat's not a pitch. It's a demonstrated observation with proof of work. The response rate on this kind of message vs. \"Hi, I offer product photography services\" is night and day.\n\n**4. The \"moment\" everyone keeps mentioning? For ecommerce, it's seasonal.**\n\nYour warmest prospects are stores about to enter a selling season (Q4 holiday, back-to-school, summer launch). Reach out 6-8 weeks before, when they're actively prepping their catalog. A store updating their listings in October is already too late. The ones doing it in September are your buyers.\n\n**5. One channel, 30 days, no switching.**\n\nCold email for this niche, specifically because you can attach or link visual examples. DMs work too (especially Instagram if the brand is active there), but email lets you embed the before/after or link a quick Loom showing their product page vs. what it could look like. Start with 15-20 personalized emails per day. Not templates with a {first\\_name} merge tag: actual emails referencing actual product pages.\n\nThe reason most outreach from zero feels impossible is that people are trying to sell to strangers who have no reason to care. When you show someone a screenshot of their own product page next to a better version, you skip the \"why should I care\" step entirely. That's your edge. Use it.",

The scraping/research part eats up so much time and you're right that most lists end up being garbage. One thing that worked for early SaaS founders I know: they focused on places where their ideal customers were already asking questions.\n\nReddit threads, niche Slack communities, industry forums. Not pushing offers, just answering questions helpfully with a light mention of what they're building. The conversion rate is way lower than email but the quality is 10x better because people are already in problem-solving mode.\n\nFor the email side, the biggest difference maker seems to be starting super narrow. Like not \"e-commerce companies\" but \"Shopify stores selling pet supplies doing $50-100k/month\". Makes the research harder but your message can actually speak to their specific situation.\n\nIf Reddit is part of your strategy, there are done-for-you services that handle the posting and engagement for you so you don't have to monitor threads all day or risk looking spammy. I came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions.com) recently and it seems like a good fit for B2B companies that want the organic reach without the time sink or ban risk. They handle finding the right convos and posting, which honestly sounds way better than trying to do it yourself while also building product.\n\nThe 30-day thing: I'd pick one channel, set a realistic daily number (like 10 personalized emails), and track reply rate obsessively. Most peopel give up after like 50 emails but you need way more data than that to know if your messaging works.",

We’ve been working on a lightweight hybrid model that basically runs on the same compute power needed for simple facial recognition.\n\nThe result:\n\n\\- Latency is near real-time (feels like a Zoom call).\n\n\\- Costs are finally down to standard text-chat levels (think Intercom pricing, not AWS GPU pricing).\n\n\\- It runs on mobile without killing the battery.\n\nWe're calling it Ieasysell.\n\nTechnically, the stack works.

      "text": "UPDATE: They offered me $90K and 10%. The CEO wanted to compromise. Her dad said no.\n\nThe dad who does the books for their group of companies is secretly the behind the scenes influence.\n\nSo I finally had the meeting. A lot of you told me to get a number out of them before agreeing to anything. I did.\n\nTheir offer: $90,000 over 18 months. Plus 10% equity.\n\nFuck that.\n\nLet that sit for a second. I came up with the idea. I wrote the grant application that got us $300K in government funding. I’m the only developer. And their offer is $5,000 a month and a 10% slice of something that doesn’t exist without me.\n\nWhen I heard the number I didn’t react because of all the Chris’s Voss stuff I read over the years. . I just asked “how am I supposed to make that work?” And got the same “think bigger picture” line from the dad. The dad, by the way, is not a founder. Not an owner. He’s the CEO’s father and the company accountant.\n\nHere’s the part that really got me. The CEO - who actually owns 50% of the company - said “what if we met in the middle?” Which honestly? Reasonable.\n\nHer dad said no.\n\nThe person who actually has decision-making authority in this company tried to compromise, and a non-owner shut it down. In front of everyone.\n\nSo after the meeting I went through their full proposed investment agreement line by line. And I found some things:\n\n∙\tThe dad wants 20k for doing financial work pertaining to the project but the grant agreement explicitly prohibits payments to related persons.\n\n∙\tThe hourly rates the dad proposed for the two cofounders was 50k each. Doing maybe 5-10 hours of work per month. They’d be making 5-7x my rate per hour. For non-technical work. On a technology project. While I’m the one delivering every single milestone.\n\nAnd the grant clause states that paid labour must be aligned with reasonable market rates and can only be paid if the work is for the milestones.\n\nI left the meeting so I can chat with my lawyer (hired someone on retainer) and get the facts before going into another meeting.\n\nI really went into everything in good faith because the CEO is a good friend. The dad is fucking everything up.\n\nAnyways. I booked another negotiation meeting next week.\n\nMy strategy is to present the grant compliance issues first for leverage because related persons can’t get paid.\n\nAnd the founders can’t get paid 50k each for maybe 5-10 hours a month. That would put their hourly rate at 250-over 500 dollars per hour.\n\nThat’s would be above reasonable rates and directly conflict and would cause a red flag on how paying them 500 dollars per hour would contribute to the milestones.\n\nThat’s not ok.\n\nI am decently connected in the tech space in my local area. I can easily shop this around and get funding elsewhere cause I’ve already proved this is a validated product.\n\nI ain’t no bitch so I’m gonna try to work things out one more time.\n\nIf they come back reasonable, great. I want this to work. But if the dad shuts it down again, I’m out. I control the code. I have other opportunities. And a validated product.\n\nEven if they found someone after me to build it. They won’t be fast enough and the other person would demand market pay for to do it right.\n\nI’m here just ranting cause I obviously feel alone and fighting a battle by myself.   Appreciate any further insight y’all have.",

If that work is going to be split evenly then the ownership should as well.\n\nPersonally I would take the 90k and leave.

I understand your position and I weighed the options. Considering I don’t own anything and not getting the fair rate for my work which is building the product and getting the grant AND that grant will fail because we are not complying their rules by paying relatives and also from over the market rates… this business will fail and I don’t want to be part of it. As I came up with the idea and built the product all by myself and I did the work for the grant, I can do the same thing alone with complete ownership or at least help a business which can comply with the grant requirements and pay me what I deserve. I followed your dad’s advice and “the bigger picture” lead me to this conclusion. I didn’t wanted this meeting to negotiate but to illustrate how things look right now. Choice is yours to comply with grant requirements and to pay me what I deserve by creating this company from scratch, or I’m out.”\n\nYou have to stop thinking this as being “a bitch”, what they’ve been doing all along is treat you as one. And because you didn’t ask for what you are owed, they are trying to run you down more. This won’t be selling your friend out or leaving them out in the open, if anything this will be the most eye opening experience for them to save this business whether you stay or leave. CEO is not your friend, even if he is you are not a priority; otherwise he would dealt with this situation more gracefully. They don’t value your work and they will find a way to get rid of you even if they offer you more now. His dad will create a hell of a situation for everyone if they “cave in”. He doesn’t want you, or at least he doesn’t want you to get paid fairly for your efforts. And everyone else thinks this is acceptable.\n\nAnd just look for a new job, I guarantee that there is no future there for you (or anybody for that matter, maybe except for the dad for the time being when he is sucking all the grant budget for himself).",

Have your lawyer draft the document to keep it above board. \n\nIt's possible you can also prohibit them from using the idea and any of your contributions to the original grant - if not based on your non-participation, then for intentional grant fraud and grantee malfeasance (i.e. the father trying to get money when the grant prohibits it,  non-payment of market rates, non-milestone based payment, etc). \n\nNow that I've typed that out, there is a whole bunch of problems here, including:\n\n- Misuse of funds\n- Deliberate misconduct \n- Noncompliance and willfull neglect \n\nGrants with the government are serious business.

Yes, it's pesky, and social media is flooded with it, but it works.\n\nGet people to comment to trigger engagement signal to the algo then send them a guide in the comments.\n\nThe guide gives value + teaches how to automate the thing I'm teaching [with my SaaS](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)\n\nWe automatically write the guide targeting high buying intent keywords using rebelgrowth which also creates the linkedin post based on the automatically generated guide\n\nThe post itself follows a simple formula: Hook + Problem Agitation + Hint Solution + CTA (comment to get guide)\n\nUse a scroll stopping image for the post, something weird that makes people go \"wtf?\"\n\nTo anyone who comments, reply directly with the guide (this part is the boring time consuming part)...more comments, more engagement, more reach\n\nThen everyday I connect with 20 high intent leads, I look for people engaging with my competitors or with overlapping brands or that have recently raised money or changed job position for decision making roles or that have typed my high-intent keywords\n\nI also send DMs to people who have accepted my connection request the day prior, the DM is simple and non salesy, I just want to build rapport with people so when they see my posts, they engage. I send more salesy DMs to people who comment or like my posts.\n\nThat's it. Takes a couple hours per day but it converts very well.\n\nHave you tried something like this?",

          "text": "LinkedIn intent signals are incredibly high-value when you know what to look for. A few tactical patterns that work:\n\n**Job change signals** - New VP Eng at target company = budget reset + tool evaluation window. Set up alerts for role changes in your ICP companies (Sales Nav or scrapers). Outreach window is weeks 2-8 (past onboarding chaos, before locked into inherited stack).\n\n**Hiring velocity** - Company goes from 2 to 8 backend engineer openings = scaling pain incoming. They need your infra/dev tools in 30-60 days. Job posting data is public gold.\n\n**Problem confession posts** - Engineers complaining about CI times, flaky tests, deploy anxiety. If your product solves it, reply with tactical advice first (free value), then \"we built X because we had this exact problem\" as closer. Zero pitch in the advice part.\n\n**Event attendance** - Speaking at/attending conferences signals active evaluation mode. People research solutions right after seeing talks about problems. Track conference hashtags + attendee lists.\n\nThe key is *timing + specificity*. Generic \"we help companies scale\" gets ignored. \"Saw you just joined as Head of Platform—congrats! Curious how you're thinking about observability as you inherit the stack\" opens doors.\n\nWhat intent signals are you tracking?",

          "text": "This is a trap a lot of technical founders fall into. And it’s an easy one.\n\nAI really does make you faster at building things. You ship code quicker, spin up an MVP in days, crank out SEO pages, even draft outreach emails without breaking a sweat. Execution gets cheap. Almost too cheap.\n\nBut here’s the catch: none of that creates demand by itself.\n\nMarketing isn’t about how fast you can build. It’s about distribution. About being where your users already hang out, understanding the problem they actually feel (not the one you wish they felt), and showing up there again and again. Quietly, consistently.\n\nMost SaaS products don’t die because the tech is bad. They die because marketing starts after the product is “done”, instead of growing alongside it from day one.\n\nAI is a force multiplier, sure. But if there’s no real marketing process underneath, it just multiplies zero.",

We started answering questions in Reddit, Discord servers, forums where our target users hang out. Not selling, just genuinely helping. Like someone asks \"how do I handle support for my Discord community\" and we share what we learned. After a few months people started DMing us asking what we use. That's when we mention our product.\n\n\\- Content that shows the actual problem being solved works way better than feature lists. Nobody cares that you have \"advanced AI algorithms\" but they do care if you show \"here's how to reduce support tickets by 60% without hiring.\" Specific, outcome-focused, showing not telling.\n\n\\- Also get comfortable being visible even though it's awkward. I still hate it but posting about what we're building, sharing learnings from customer conversations, talking about the space we're in - it all compounds over time.
