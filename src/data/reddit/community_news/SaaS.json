No validation. Just spotted a problem (sales teams wasting money on dead Apollo leads), built it, then marketed aggressively.\n\nSix months later: $50k MRR. Proof here - [https://imgur.com/a/yM6Ux2R](https://imgur.com/a/yM6Ux2R) (We scaled fast using intent signalling with [this tool](https://predictent.ai) to hit our prospects at their warmest, rather than stone-cold outreach)\n\nI kept reading al these posts on this subreddit talking about 'Build a business plan' / 'Validate your idea first' - sorry but we didn't do any of that at all, its a total load of rubbish.\n\nBUILD your product and launch it as fast as possible, and sell a real working product, not a stupid idea that nobody cares about or will engage with because its imaginary.\n\nNobody commits to made up dreams. They commit to working products solving real pain.\n\nWe hit 50k MRR by building fast → Shiping it → Marketing to prospects → Iterating based on usage or feedback\n\nThe validation obsession is just odd. Also, business plans are a joke too.",

That’s the real signal.\n\nI’ve used things like Apollo, Clay, and Pulse for Reddit to find and watch the exact people complaining about a problem, then shipped something small and pointed it at them.

That’s similar to how we structure delivery pipelines , small changes, fast feedback, observable outcomes.\n* Relying solely on pre-build guesses can mislead if you don’t define what success actually means in measurable terms.\n\nThe SaaS founders I’ve worked with who move fastest aren’t those who “validated perfectly” before writing a line of code , they’re the ones who build minimal but observable paths to value and iterate quickly based on real signals from users.\n\nTo me, it’s less about “validate or don’t” and more about integrating validation into your delivery cycle so every deploy tells you something meaningful about actual user behavior.",

If referrals + direct outreach are already working for you, I’d lean into that and treat paid ads as “secondary” until messaging/conversion is proven. One channel that’s often overlooked for construction SaaS is Reddit (not as ads-first, more community-first): find the niche subs where PMs/foremen/owners hang out, watch what problems they complain about, then post value (templates, lessons learned, “how we fixed X workflow”), and only mention the tool if people ask. It’s slower than Google, but the intent can be way higher and the feedback is brutal in a good way. If you want, I can point you to a few angles that typically work for this niche.",

          "text": "I don’t think you’re overreacting at all. This is exactly the right time to step back and question it.\n\nIf you break the situation down without emotion, the numbers already tell most of the story.\n\nYou spent $40k and got 12 customers, which puts your CAC at roughly $3.3k per customer. With an average deal size of $450 per month, that’s about 7+ months just to earn back the acquisition cost, and that’s in a perfect scenario where churn is zero and you stop spending on ads entirely. In reality, neither of those things is true, especially in construction where buying cycles are long and usage maturity takes time.\n\nFor a bootstrapped B2B SaaS, that’s a pretty uncomfortable place to be. Most healthy setups at your price point try to keep CAC closer to 3 to 6 times monthly ARPU, which would put you somewhere around $1.3k to $2.7k. You’re meaningfully above that, so it’s reasonable to feel like something’s off.\n\nThe other big signal here is where your best customers actually came from. Referrals and direct outreach working better than Google Ads isn’t a coincidence. Construction PM buyers tend to be trust-driven and referral-heavy. They usually don’t wake up thinking, “Let me search for a new PM tool today,” unless the pain is already extreme. That makes Google Ads much harder unless your positioning and targeting are extremely dialed in.\n\nIn my experience, early-stage paid ads are more about learning than scaling. If ads are going to work, you normally start seeing improving conversion rates, clearer ICP signals, or decreasing CAC within the first month or two. When the main argument becomes “we just need more time and optimization,” it often means the channel itself isn’t a great fit yet.\n\nI wouldn’t say you screwed this up. Think of it as expensive validation. But doubling down on paid ads right now, while outbound and referrals are clearly outperforming, would probably be the bigger mistake.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I’d do the following:\n\nDouble down on outbound and referrals  \nProductize whatever made those customers convert  \nRevisit paid ads later once LTV, messaging, and ICP are airtight\n\nYour gut reaction is pointing you in the right direction.",

That’s how you end up paying for a ton of junk traffic, especially in B2B SaaS. If they were charging you a % of ad spend, that’s a big red flag too, it explains why spend ramped so fast.\n\nI would pause ads and find someone else before burning more money. Ask them for an specific plan/strategy and research a bit before hiring someone.",

I'm running a small SaaS, and my dev team is 3 Belarusian guys living in different cities in Poland. I was using Wise to pay them - worked perfectly fine for 2 years. Then in late November, two of them got their Wise cards blocked. Wise sent them notices saying they need to prove EU residency by January 30 or lose access completely, something about new EU sanctions compliance. They're all in Poland on work visas but don't have permanent residency yet, so can't provide what Wise is asking for.\n\nThey went almost a month without getting paid while I was scrambling to find another way. Imagine trying to tell someone who's counting on you that \"sorry, still figuring it out\" for the third week in a row. PayPal doesn't work for receiving payments if you're Belarusian (they only allow sending, not receiving). Tried crypto but my team wasn't comfortable with it because it's hard to withdraw legally. My lead dev finally told me he's looking for other work. Can't blame him - dude has rent to pay, and here I am becoming the unreliable client even though I have his money sitting in my account.\n\nPosted in a few startup discords asking for help and someone mentioned The Stape, so I tried it, it was 3 months ago. Decided to leave an honest review here in case someone's struggling like I was.\n\nI set up all contractors once and then just send payments in one click. I schedule all 3 payments for the month at once and forget about it, contractors get money in their account same day and withdraw it however they want. Support is good, they responded quite fast when I had questions during setup, which was a nice surprise compared to Wise taking days. This is actually my first experience with payroll platforms, but I compared some other platforms with %-based fees, and turned out that their fixed fees per transaction are way cheaper. But not cheaper than crypto, tbh. If you're comfortable paying in crypto and your team is okay with it, I probably wouldn't switch. But for me crypto stopped being okay, so now I'm paying $50 per transaction. The upside is contractors don't pay anything on their end.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share in case someone's having the same issues. Do you guys have backup payment methods set up or am I just paranoid now? What's your contingency plan if your main payment provider suddenly stops working?",

I'm a pretty good developer, I'm using Claude Code and Windsurf, I have a very solid and modular architecture and very clean and maintainable code in my product.\n\nAdding features, updating and removing them - I can do it extremely fast with Claude.\n\nAnd yet.... it takes me MONTHS of work to make it really good. \n\nNot only coding, but also planning out, learning, going through trial and errors, developing and re-developing features to finally GET THEM RIGHT. \n\nAnyone who says can they do it in a day, or a week, or even a month - I just don't believe them. Either they are just lying, or simply not competent enough to see the flaws of their product comparing to competitors.\n\nSure, you can create something that \\*seems\\* to replicate a mature and very thought-out tool. It will look and feel the same, and someone will even pay for it. But realistically, even if AI speeds up your work X10, it doesn't change the fact that you have to iterate, learn, build and re-build stuff over and over. And it takes TIME.\n\nFar more time than 8 hours of work. Far more than months of work. That is, if you're building something real.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one who thinks that way and who feels annoyed at all this crap that devalues the actual work people put into their projects.",

              "text": "I dont know why people selling Vibecoding tools do this false marketing. I work for a startup in the same space and we have multiple people building SaaS products on our platform (nonbios.ai) - and even the simplest ones takes a month to build something barely usable. The more ambitious ones have been at it for 3+ months - and they are building pretty much 10 hours a day. \n\nOne of our users built marketcity.org - a classified marketplace for Europe - with some interesting features - like bidding on listings - pay to market on whatsapp - but otherwise mostly a standard classifieds product. And this took upwards of 2 months with him working pretty much full time. And this is just getting started - I think it will be months before this can be ready to launch at scale. \n\nOne thing vibe coding has definitely done - is to make tech accessible. Some of our biggest users would never have build their SaaS if it wasnt for vibecoding. But it still takes real commitment and hours to get something moving. And most importantly you have to be ready to 'learn' a little bit of software engineering. You cant just fly blind and expect AI to do all the work. Our most successfull users are actually the ones who have used our platform to learn more about how software is built and used that knowledge to build their SaaS. If you account for marketing - and getting your first buyers, I think people should provision for atleast an year for any real traction.\n\nBut this is the other aspect of making tech accessible - semi-tech users and users who are willing to 'learn' can now start building themselves instead of finding someone on free lancer and expect to have a more predictable path to building out their SaaS. This in itself is a huge upgrade from what was possible a couple of years ago and I wish the vibecoding platforms would be more upfront and honest about it.",

Some of my colleagues would take a few days to get started because they aren’t used to standing things up outside our work patterns, but I do this stuff all the time.\n\nI can setup a full stack app with auth and deploy a wireframe in a new domain in 45 minutes. I’ve done it several times. Then, I have 7 more hours to add features.\n\nIt’s all about the idea now. I repeat the same patterns so I don’t fuss with the api or db or auth anymore, it’s just repeatable shit.\n\nTHIS PATTERN DOESNT FIT EVERYTHING, but the quickest workstream I have is AWS Amplify with a graphql api against dynamodb with cognito auth. I write the schema and it generates all my types and resolvers, all queries and mutations with subscriptions etc. Cognito stands up user accounts with 2 factor auth in minutes, adding groups for security is mad fast and easy. You can use federated very simply too with amplify.\n\nAgain, it’s not for everything, but it’s absolutely enough to standup a lot of saas ideas. It’s just one stack example that’s wild easy and fast to standup, full stack with auth. I usually use nextjs for frontend because of its built in routing/api and ssr.\n\nWith 8 hours and codex I can do what used to take me idk a week or something",

You still need to iterate, but you can do it in 8 days instead of 8 months. Still not 8 hours like you said, but significantly faster. Secondly, if you already own the distribution, you can build something very fast. Like someone who already has a community of customers is building a tool to help their existing members do something. Previously this was not conceivable. But with AI this is possible and significantly shortens the time and barrier to doing it.",

Yea I believe it may be possible to recreate my complex SAAS, from scratch, in about a day's work.\n\nThat's a lot of IFs and that requires a ton of planning and a pretty high level of expertise with the subject matter and with architecting complex apps.

          "text": "I get your frustration but the conversation’s more nuanced than that. “8 hours” is just a number. Selling vibe coding tools? It’s not really a lie; it depends entirely on what you’re building.\n\nDefine “something real”, right?\n\nCan you spin up a functional messaging app in 8? Sure, maybe.\n\nCan you reverse-engineer Stripe and claim you’ve reinvented payments (in 8)? LOL\n\nI’m far from a top-tier dev, but I did build the foundation for my current product in a weekend.   \n  \nWait, let me give you context: It wasn't witchcraft. This was my **third** **project**. The first two took me months of trial and error, rebuilding things I thought I understood, and they still aren’t ready. You’re not seeing those, by the way, lol. They were my learning process.\n\nThe third time. I realized the patterns and decisions from my earlier builds weren’t wasted. They overlapped in ways I could reuse. Like most surely do with form components, sign-in flows, etc. \n\nSo, I set up multiple AI agents with a “Manager Agent” that could direct tasks intelligently. Then, I put both of my previous projects in and basically said: “Read these. Understand my architecture. Use that knowledge to build this new one.”\n\nThe core build was done in a 48-hour, non-stop weekend sprint. Was it perfect? No. I spent another week debugging the slop I wasn't apt enough to catch in the rush. But that's what you do, you test. \n\nBack to that phrase “something real.” There’s a dogma around this, imo. The idea that a product only counts if you bled for it. That its legitimacy depends on how many nights you sacrificed rather than what it actually does. I think is harmful for our wellbeing. We shouldn’t romanticize the struggle, sure.\n\nThe point isn’t that you can build something complex from scratch in eight hours. It’s that, once you’ve put in the time (months or years), you can now build on that foundation in a way that just wasn’t possible before. If I can tell an LLM inside my IDE, “You’ve seen my last two projects. You know my architecture and priorities. Build this one the same way but for this idea, but tighten security and scalability, etc”m, then the whole timeline changes.\n\nSo yeah, “8 hours” isn’t about the first attempt. It’s about the third, the fourth, the ones built on your own evolution. The ones where AI finally stands on the shoulders of your past work. Not someone else’s hype.\n\nAnd I mean, I'm sure a lot of people do this. Fetch here and there from repos for things they think are good, spin those up and create solid builds in hours. If I can do it in a weekend, a monster dev can probably automate their setup to do it in 8? then review? I don't know, I'm not at that level, yet. \n\nTesting and debugging is another story. God damn, slop... LOL   \n  \nnote: I'm just playing devil's advocate, not polarizing :) idk, just 2 cents..",

      "text": "Most SaaS founders think building the product is 70% of the work.\n\nI thought the same until I shipped my MVP and realized... it's actually the opposite. Building is maybe 30%. The other 70%? Getting people to actually use it.\n\nI'm a technical founder. I'd rather write code than cold DMs. But here's what I learned getting my[ SEO tool](https://blogseo.io) to $50k ARR ([proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/iROCSdxX)):\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nI messaged everyone I knew – ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, random people I'd met at events. But instead of pitching directly, I asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo things happen: If they're interested, they say \"yeah, me actually.\" If not, they might intro you to someone. You win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell.\n\n**2. Posting consistently (even with a small audience)**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing fancy. Just sharing what I was building and learning. Multiple people DM'd me asking about the product who became paying customers. The compounding effect is real, even if your posts only get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email (but targeting the right people)**\n\nThis didn't work great at first because my sequence sucked. But here's what I learned: spend 80% of your time on targeting the RIGHT people (nail your ICP), 20% on the copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly – much higher leverage.\n\n**4. SEO (the most underrated channel for SaaS)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks, pages started ranking and I got traffic from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most SaaS founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pulling from web content too. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of your potential customers.\n\nOne of my users reached 450+ clicks a day from organic search alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend ($200 each on Google + Meta)**\n\nOnly did this AFTER I had organic conversions. Ads amplify what's already working – they won't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't buy gave me their email. That list became valuable later.\n\n**6. Obsessing over first customers**\n\nTreated my first 10 customers like they were paying me $10k/month. Jumped on calls. Fixed bugs same-day. Asked for feedback constantly. Result? They became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies.\n\n**7. Affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. Made it dead simple to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = ongoing customer stream, not just one sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nLaunched on \"There's an AI for That\" – got a nice traffic spike. Lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug though (painful lesson: test your critical flows obsessively).\n\n**The honest truth about SaaS growth:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. These tactics aren't sexy. None of them went viral. But they compound.\n\nWhile everyone's chasing the next viral strategy, you can quietly stack Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders, it's SEO. Not because it's fast – it's not. But because it compounds. Every article you publish keeps working for you months (even years) later. And now with AI search pulling from web content, the surface area for discovery is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR.

I was \"pre-PMF\" for some time and I still got to 1.5k and helped me continue improve the product until I realized my onboarding could be slightly tweaked and a core feature was missing and suddenly everything unlocked. \n\nBut at the end of the day, no one knows you exist unless you tell the world you're out there, that's why I'm sharing these tactics and I think that founders should take the habit early.   \nNot just \"launch\" on PH and then stop their project.",

I think a lot of founders treat PMF like a light switch, when in reality it’s more like a dimmer. Early traction, even if imperfect, gives you real users, real feedback, and runway to iterate toward clarity.\n\nAlso +1 on not stopping at a single launch. I’ve seen so many solid products die because the founder assumed “if it’s good, people will find it.” Distribution is a skill, not a one-time event, and starting that habit early compounds just like product improvements do.\n\nCurious in hindsight: which channel gave you the fastest signal that something about onboarding or the core feature was off?",

      "text": "When I open Reddit I see like 100 people pitching their startup idea, and a lot of them are basically the same: payment trackers, AI for hiring, generic productivity tools, etc. It feels like we’re about to see more software than ever before.\n\nI’m trying to find a good analogy, and the closest thing I can think of is what Shopify did for e-commerce. Lowering the barrier of entry unlocked a lot of creativity, but it also led to a massive wave of low-effort businesses. I think SaaS is heading toward a similar sloppification, possibly on a much larger scale.\n\nWe’re probably going to see more low-quality SaaS than ever, and I don’t think that’s just because of AI tools (even though they clearly accelerate this). The bigger shift is that the barrier used to be capital and deep technical skill. Now it’s much lower, which invites more non-technical founders, opportunists, and people trying to extract value quickly. This feels similar to how VC and PE incentives often lead to enshittification subscriptions everywhere, ads in cars, etc.\n\nThe effects already seem obvious: companies getting flooded with cold emails, distribution channels becoming completely saturated, and SaaS starting to resemble dropshipping more than product building. LinkedIn “build in public” and hustle culture just adds more noise on top of it.\n\nTech people can grift too, but more often there’s at least curiosity and a real attempt to understand the problem. My concern is that making a real living from SaaS will become much harder when every distribution channel is filled with low-effort, look-alike products.\n\nHow do you think this plays out over the next few years? Does the market self-correct, or does SaaS just become increasingly noisy with fewer real winners?",

It's already happening.\n\nOn your actual question—I think it self-corrects, but slowly and painfully. The slop dies because the founders quit after a few months of zero traction, not because users get smarter. What survives is either distribution (you own a channel that's hard to copy) or taste (you actually know what to leave out). The Shopify comparison is spot on—dropshipping stores died but real brands survived. Same thing will happen here. The noise is annoying but it's also the filter.",

As someone somewhat new to the space I’ve been tempted myself but you quickly realize that unless you’re 1 in a million level lucky it’s most likely not gonna work out. The real talent is gonna differentiate itself with grit, doing the hard work and innovating where others don’t.

Extensions like Dux-Soup or Waalaxy inject JavaScript directly into the LinkedIn page. LinkedIn literally runs scripts that scan for extension IDs in your browser. easiest to detect because they leave obvious fingerprints\n2. **Cloud services l**ike Expandi, Dripify, Lemlist send API requests from remote servers. when you browse LinkedIn normally, your browser fires off tons of background requests - analytics, feed updates, etc. cloud tools only send the bare minimum they need to function. LinkedIn can spot this \"incomplete\" traffic pattern\n3. **Standalone browsers** (LinkedHelper, only one I know yet) work like a modified Chromium browser running on a PC. it mimics actual browsing - mouse movements, randomized timing, normal request patterns. harder to distinguish from real human. It doesn’t mean that you can’t be banned, because there are some strict rules and limits you must follow, but it’s still interesting that technical footprints are different. \n\nIf you’ve been banned or flagged, what was the reason? Do you think it was because of tool or because of your own behaviour like too many messages, etc trying to separate actual technical detection from just doing too much too fast\n\n",

And honestly, it’s a feature that OpenAI is gonna kill in their next update anyway.\n\nI’ve been building software for a while now, and here’s what I tell clients who want to pay me to build this stuff: **If your \"moat\" is a prompt, you’re cooked.**\n\nReal value isn't in the LLM. It's in the boring stuff nobody wants to talk about.\n\nWhen I build actual, money-making MVPs for people, we spend maybe 10% of the time on the AI part. The other 90%?\n*   Handling the messy data imports.\n*   Figuring out what happens when the model hallucinates or times out.\n*   Building the logic that connects the AI to their actual internal tools.\n\nI built an agent system last month. The prompt took me 20 minutes to write. The error handling and state management took two weeks. That’s the work. That’s the moat.\n\nStop trying to be a prompt engineer and start being a software engineer again. Or at least hire one who knows that \"import openai\" isn't a business plan.\n\nIt’s 2026. The easy money is gone. If you aren't doing the heavy lifting in the backend, you don't have a product.\n\nAm I being too harsh here? Or are you guys seeing this \"slop\" everywhere too?\n\n",

It feels like you're prioritizing the how (engineering robustness) over the what (solving a problem).\n\nThe hardest part of building a product isn't handling data imports or state management—it's figuring out exactly what the user needs. A \"wrapper\" fails not because the code is simple, but because it usually doesn't solve a deep enough problem. Conversely, you can build the most robust, error-proof backend in the world, but if it doesn't address a burning user pain point, you’re just building \"high-quality slop.\" The moat isn't the software engineering; it's the solution to the customer's problem.",

Here's what worked for us after testing every imaginable method of making sales.\n\n**What didn't work:**\n\nWe tried SEO with blog posts - extremely slow, generates impressions but zero sales or signups. X (Twitter) posting produced no measurable results. LinkedIn organic posting gets good engagement but conversions are painfully slow. We needed faster traction.\n\n**What is currently working:**\n\nWe run three cold-email campaigns across our founder emails:\n\n1. Founder 1\n2. Founder 2\n3. Competitor campaign (rotates through both founder emails) - targeting users of competitor or similar products (think Apollo / ZoomInfo etc..)\n\n**Campaign Results:**\n\n* Founder 1: [https://i.imgur.com/2Wer6mU.png](https://i.imgur.com/2Wer6mU.png)\n* Founder 2: [https://i.imgur.com/3P39xDM.png](https://i.imgur.com/3P39xDM.png)\n* Competitor: [https://i.imgur.com/eJ4y272.png](https://i.imgur.com/eJ4y272.png)\n\nThe competitor campaign underperformed significantly - zero deals, mostly rejections. Founder campaigns directly to our ICP convertred EXTREMELY well. \n\n**Our trick to getting responses:**\n\nWe flipped the usual cold email playbook. Instead of **Email first → LinkedIn follow-up**, we do **LinkedIn first → Email after**.\n\nThe strategy is simple: engage with prospects before ever hitting their inbox. We use our own product to first scrape LinkedIn posts matching our ICP, comment/engage genuinely, then follow up via email 24-48 hours later.\n\nOur LinkedIn messaging is short and direct - we have shared templates we tested [here](https://www.predictent.ai/templates/linkedin), and adapted them to fit our ICP. For connection requests, we send blank requests (no message). They consistently outperform requests with messages attached as people find it spammy / too salesy - on LI genuine interactions always work better.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWhen we email someone after engaging on LinkedIn, we're not a random cold email anymore. We're someone who actually paid attention to their content. Reply rates reflect that - we're seeing 4%+ consistently, with the pre-warmed prospects converting at noticeably higher rates.\n\nThe deals closed in early January came almost entirely from this approach - prospects we'd engaged with on LinkedIn in late December who were ready to move fast once back from holiday.",

The problem is youre stuck between speed and customization which is why most teams either pick one or suck at both.\n\nInteractive demos are basically simulations or recordings where people can click around and explore the product on their own time. No scheduling no sales rep needed. People can just hop in and see if it fits their use case. Some bounce sure but way less than with broken free trials.\n\nIf youre serious about fixing this you need automation. Like actual automation not just better calendar tools. Consensus and walnut both do this and theres a few others. Basically you preload product flows and let buyers pick their own path. Saves your team from doing 50 custom demos a week and prospects dont wait 3 days for a zoom link.\n\nYour free trial probably sucks because theres no guidance. People log in see 100 buttons and leave. Interactive demos solve that by walking them through exactly what matters to them. Way higher conversion than dumping someone into a raw product.",

In production teams, we aim to reduce friction and reveal value fast, demos should follow the same principle.\n\nA couple of things that help:\n\n* Run a quick discovery upfront: clarify prospect pain points before the demo so you can focus only on what matters to them. That makes the actual demo shorter and more relevant.\n* Show the “aha moment” first: start with the part of the product that delivers clear value right away, not a long tour of every feature. That helps prospects see usefulness before drilling into details.\n* Automate personalization: pre-demo surveys or trial usage data tied to the demo can tailor the experience so you’re not building context from scratch each time.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, this is just like improving a delivery pipeline ,reduce unnecessary steps, optimize for the fastest path to value, and measure where prospects drop off.

The interactive demo suggestion above is spot on—tools like Walnut or Reprise let prospects self-navigate tailored paths without rep involvement, boosting close rates 2-3x while freeing your team.\n\nTo speed it up without ruining quality:\n\n1. **Pre-Qualify with AI-Driven Intake:** Use simple forms or chatbots (e.g., Typeform + Zapier integrations) to gather prospect needs upfront. Feed that into an AI tool like Claude or Gemini to auto-generate a customized demo script or video snippet—cuts prep from days to hours, keeps it human-reviewed for accuracy.\n2. **Hybrid Model:** Start with async video demos (Loom or Vidyard) for low-touch leads, reserving live ones for high-value. Track metrics like view completion (aim >70%) and follow-up engagement to iterate.\n3. **Scale with Templates:** Build modular demo templates based on common personas—e.g., 80% reusable, 20% customized. For bootstraps without big budgets, this avoids over-investing in fancy platforms.\n\nIn one product I led, this approach dropped demo time 60% while lifting conversions 25%.",

Storylane and Navattic are solid for this; Pulse for Reddit sits more at the “find who’s actually complaining about this problem and what language they use” stage so your demo copy isn’t guessing.\n\nAlso, lock down “good enough” templates per level so reps aren’t reinventing decks. One master deck sliced into fixed views for L0–L3 plus one live demo script stops scope creep fast.

It’s a B2B tool for collecting user feedback, managing a roadmap, and publishing updates — aiming to help small teams turn feedback into something actionable and visible.\n\nSo far, I’ve had zero users.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried:\n\n    •\tPosting a few times on X\n    \n    •\tPosting on Reddit\n    \n    •\tBasic SEO work: sitemap, meta tags, a few blog posts\n\nThe result has been almost no traffic and no signups.\n\nLately, I’ve been doing some self-reflection and I’m starting to question my original assumptions.\n\nThis is an existing and fairly mature space, and my initial thinking was simple: if I make the product easy enough to use and well-designed, users would eventually come. I come from a technical background, and coding is very much my comfort zone. Building and refining the product felt like the most logical and controllable thing to do.\n\nMarketing, on the other hand, feels very much outside my comfort zone — and I’m realizing that may have led me to spend most of my time building, instead of validating whether I was solving a problem people feel strongly enough about to switch tools for.\n\nAt this point, I’m trying to be realistic and more intentional with how I spend my limited time each week. I’m stuck on this question:\n\nHow should a solo founder allocate time between SEO and social/community efforts in the very early stage?\n\nMore specifically:\n\n    •\tIs SEO worth continuing this early, knowing it may take months to pay off?\n    \n    •\tOr should I focus more on social platforms, communities, and direct 1-on-1 conversations?\n    \n    •\tFor those who’ve been through the zero-to-first-user phase: what actually helped you get unstuck?\n\nI’m not looking for growth hacks or shortcuts — just honest advice from people who’ve learned this the hard way.\n\nThanks in advance.

      "text": "If you’ve launched a SaaS anytime in the last ten years, you’ve probably had the same advice shouted at you from every corner of the internet: Just use Stripe\n\nFor a long time, that was the gold standard. Stripe’s API was a work of art. They took the nightmare of legacy payment gateways and turned it into a developer’s playground. But lately, if you're building in Europe, the vibe has shifted\n\nThe reason isn’t that Stripe has become less capable… FAR FROM T... Rather, the very nature of what’s required to sell software in the european union has fundamentally changed.\n\n*The European Tax Dragon got hungrier.*\n\n**1/ VAT quietly became the real problem**\n\nStripe did not get worse. The environment did. When you use Stripe directly, you are the seller of record.\n\nThat means you are responsible for knowing where every customer lives, registering for OSS, filing quarterly VAT returns and dealing with multiple EU tax authorities..\n\nWhat feels like a simple payment decision slowly turns into ongoing legal and admin work\n\n**2/ Merchant of Record changes the equation**\n\nPlatforms like Paddle, Polar and Lemon Squeezy take a different approach. They act as the Merchant of Record and become the legal seller of your product.\n\nThey calculate and collect VAT, handle remittance, and manage compliance. You get paid out, minus their fee, without worrying about tax filings or cross-border rules.\n\n**3/ Payments are no longer enough**\n\nModern SaaS is much more than simply charging a card. The purchase often needs to unlock a dashboard, grant Discord access, invite someone to a GitHub repo, issue a license, or upgrade an account..\n\nWith Stripe, you assemble all of this yourself using webhooks and custom logic. Newer platforms treat entitlements as a core feature.. often making these flows configuration instead of code\n\n**4/ The Economics of Time Versus Money**\n\nMerchant of Record platforms usually charge higher fees than Stripe. But that comparison misses the hidden costs. Time spent on VAT, maintaining integrations, and managing compliance risk adds up quickly..\n\nFor many founders, paying a bit more per transaction is worth avoiding those distractions\n\n**5/ Why this matters more in Europe**\n\nStripe’s still great if you’re keeping things simple or selling in one place. But if you’re a small team trying to grow across europe, you’ve gotta ask yourself: what actually lets you focus on your product.. instead of drowning in tax forms and weird edge cases?\n\nFor more and more founders in EU, that answer is turning out to be a Merchant of Record",

But be careful trading one master (Stripe) for another (MoRs like Paddle/Lemon Squeezy).\n\nThe hidden cost of MoRs isn't just the 5% fee, it's \"Risk Policy Lock-in.\"\n\nWhen you use an MoR, you are subject to *their* risk appetite. I work with a founder who exited for $9M in the subscription space, and we saw this constantly: if the MoR decides your new AI feature or vertical is suddenly \"high risk,\" they shut you down. Because they are the legal seller, you have zero recourse. You don't just lose payment processing; you lose the ability to sell entirely.\n\nThe alternative path (which we built our infrastructure around) is Payment Orchestration. You keep direct relationships with multiple gateways (like Mollie + Stripe + Adyen) so you control your own routing and risk, and you just layer a tax automation tool on top. We ended up building our own infrastructure ([Resub.io](http://Resub.io)) to solve this because the existing options were too clunky for e-com, but the principle applies regardless: stop using aggregators and get your own direct MID.\n\nIt’s slightly more setup than a \"one-click\" MoR, but you actually own your revenue stream instead of renting it",

A few strategies that tend to work well:\n\nTry posting in niche communities where your target users hang out - Reddit, Discord servers, Slack communities, etc. Be transparent that you're looking for testers and explain what value they'll get. Also consider reaching out directly to people who've commented on related problems in those communities.\n\nFor early tester recruitment, offering extended free access or lifetime deals can work wonders. People love being part of something early, especially if there's a tangible benefit. Just make sure you're getting quality feedback in return, not just sign-ups.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to discuss specific tester recruitment tactics or share what's working for you!",

The biggest hurdle is often just getting past the gatekeepers and noise to reach the person who actually cares about your solution.\n\nA few things that can help: 1) Focus on very narrow ICP initially - the more specific you are, the easier it is to find and reach the right people. 2) Leverage any existing networks or warm intros you can get, even tangentially. 3) Consider bottom-up adoption strategies where individual contributors can start using your tool and become internal champions.\n\nThe LinkedIn/cold email spray-and-pray approach rarely works anymore. Building genuine relationships and creating content that demonstrates deep understanding of their specific problems tends to be more effective, though slower.\n\nHappy to compare notes - feel free to DM me!",

Has Pre-approved communication flows (get signoff from compliance, legal, executive leadership, external comms, etc) prior to sending to avoid decision dependencies + back and forth of the \"perfect language\" for the target audience all while battling downtime.\n\nReally cleans up incident communication handling, creates audit trails on who sent what in the past, gets rid of copy & paste communications during the chaos of Org incidents and allows engineers to jump in, run incident in 30 seconds instead of spending their first 30 minutes of an incident telling all the relevant parties they are having downtime instead of fixing it.

It’s for freelance designers and small agencies who keep getting asked for “AI stuff” by clients but don’t want to learn embeddings, RAG pipelines, or spend hours wiring things together. Bloort pulls the site content, matches the branding automatically, and gives you one embed so you can ship fast and keep the site clean. It takes only 5-10 minutes and is easier than using canva (speed and removing friction for designers is our main and true purpose) \n\nWe’re past our zero to one and have seen good data from our beta. We may still be early, but the cool part is designers are actually using it on real client websites, which has been a big confidence boost. The main feedback so far is around setup speed and how client-ready it feels. Definitely still growing and iterating, but it’s been nice to see the target audience actually trust it enough to ship it live.",

          "text": "Turning Reddit into a serious acquisition channel for B2B/SaaS is the main thing I’m focused on this year. Most teams either ignore Reddit or treat it like another broadcast platform, then wonder why nothing converts.\n\nI’m building a tool that tracks niche keywords, surfaces the 1–2 threads per day actually worth jumping into, and drafts comments that don’t read like ads. Think closer to how people use Sprout or Hootsuite for social planning plus tools like Apollo for prospecting, but tuned just for Reddit workflows. Pulse sits on top of that so founders and marketers can spend 15–20 minutes a day and still get those “one good comment = several leads” moments instead of doomscrolling.\n\nSo yeah, the main thing I’m building is a way to make Reddit predictable, not random, for SaaS growth",

The app is live, stories are generating, kids are actually asking to read (wild, I know), and now I’m figuring out what works and what needs work.\n\nThe whole concept is making kids the hero of their own illustrated stories so reading feels like playtime instead of homework.

      "text": "I’m still trying to process what happened today and I honestly need an outside perspective.\n\nI stepped away for about 30 minutes and set my Slack status to OOO. During that time, my CEO tried to contact me. I didn’t see the message or call because I was offline.\n\nAfter that, he tried calling my phone — but he used my old number, which I changed a month ago and had already updated in Slack. Since that number no longer belongs to me, I obviously didn’t get the call.\n\nA coworker eventually reached me and told me the CEO was trying to get in touch, so I immediately called him back.\n\nThe moment I got on the call, he was furious. He said things like:\n\n* “Are you part of this company?”\n* “Do you even want to keep this job?”\n* “I don’t f\\*\\*\\*ing care about your excuses.”\n\nI tried to explain that I was marked OOO and that he called my old number, but he cut me off and said he doesn’t want to ever have to deal with “unresponded calls or messages” if I want to keep my job. Then he switched topics and ended the call.\n\nWhat’s bothering me most isn’t just the yelling — it’s the implication that I’m somehow not committed because I wasn’t instantly reachable for a short time, even after clearly marking my status and keeping my contact info updated.\n\nI’ve always done my work and responded when I’m online. But this made me feel like I’m expected to be on-call 24/7 with zero room for being human.\n\nAm I crazy for feeling like this crossed a line? Or is this just “normal” startup culture that I need to accept?",

Get wasted spend, search term leaks, negative keyword gaps, bid strategy issues. Full diagnostic in 3 minutes.\n\n**2. Meta ads audit** \\- Paste account data or export. Get campaign structure issues, audience overlap, creative fatigue signals, scaling opportunities. Where to focus first.\n\n**3. Ad spend allocator** \\- Paste multi-channel spend + results. Get reallocation recommendations, diminishing returns flags, budget shift priorities.\n\n**4. A/B test analyzer** \\- Feed it test results. Get stat sig check, segment breakdowns, \"why it worked\" hypotheses, next test ideas.\n\n**5. Competitor teardown** \\- Paste a landing page URL. Get positioning analysis, messaging hierarchy, objection handling, CTA strategy. 2 hours of work in 3 minutes.\n\n**6. Landing page audit** \\- Upload screenshot or URL. Get headline clarity, CTA placement issues, trust signal gaps, mobile friction. Prioritized by impact.\n\n**7. UTM & tracking generator** \\- Describe campaign structure. Get consistent UTM taxonomy, GA4 event naming, conversion tracking specs. No more naming chaos.\n\n**8. Email sequence writer** \\- Give it ICP + offer + objections. Get full nurture sequence with subject lines, preview text, body copy. Maintains voice throughout.\n\n**9. Content repurposer** \\- Give it one long-form piece. Get LinkedIn posts, tweet threads, email snippets, ad hooks. Keeps your voice.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO builder** \\- Give it niche + data source. Get page templates, title patterns, internal linking logic, schema markup. Scale without looking scaled.\n\n**Quick thoughts:**\n\n* Skills are markdown files. Upload in Claude settings → Features → Skills.\n* Build your own: document a workflow you repeat, add examples, save as .md\n* Community ones on GitHub, quality varies\n\nI use Ad spend allocator and A/B test analyzer weekly for client reporting. Competitor teardown whenever we're pitching or repositioning.\n\nLink if you want to try: [https://github.com/irinabuht12-oss/claude-marketing-skills](https://github.com/irinabuht12-oss/claude-marketing-skills)",

The work I was doing wasn’t urgent. It was just what I did. Weekends had become weekdays without boundaries.\n\nClosed the laptop. Went to play with her. Didn’t touch work again until Monday morning.\n\nThe business didn’t collapse. No clients left because I took a weekend off. No opportunities disappeared because I wasn’t monitoring email for 48 hours. The emergency I’d been manufacturing in my head to justify constant work didn’t actually exist.\n\nStarted enforcing real boundaries. Laptop closed at 6pm during the week. Weekends completely off unless something is genuinely on fire. Nothing has been on fire yet.\n\nRevenue that year was higher than the year before. The constraint forced prioritization. The energy I recovered from rest made the work hours more productive.\n\nMy daughter doesn’t ask that question anymore. She doesn’t have to. I’m present now. The business that was supposed to give me freedom was stealing my time until a six-year-old made me see it.\n\nIf someone you love has stopped asking for your attention, consider that they might have given up asking.

Support tickets, content marketing, emails, and bug tracking.\n\nI refuse to hire a VA until I hit $10k MRR, so I’ve built a stack of tools to automate and speed up the \"non-code\" work.\n\nThe \"Admin\" Stack:\n\nNotion: My central brain. If it’s not in Notion, it doesn't exist.\n\nWillow Voice: I use this to dictate email replies instead of typing them. It cleans up the messy speech and helps me clear my inbox in about 15 minutes.\n\nCrisp: I use this for customer support chat. It has a nice mobile app so I can reply to users while I’m at the gym.\n\nPaddle: I switched from Stripe to Paddle to handle the global tax compliance stuff automatically. Saves me a massive headache.\n\nPostHog: For analytics. I use it to track where users are dropping off in the onboarding flow.\n\nCanva: I am terrible at design, so I use their templates for all my LinkedIn/Twitter social assets.\n\nBuffer: To schedule the social posts I make in Canva.\n\nThe Lesson: The biggest unlock for me was realizing that my time is the bottleneck. Any tool that saves me 30 minutes a day is worth paying for.\n\nWhat are you guys using to handle the \"support\" load as a solo founder?",

Once you see that, paying for tools that save even small chunks of time becomes an easy decision.\n\nOne thing I’ve found helpful as a solo founder is automating *decision friction*, not just tasks. Fewer places to check, fewer manual handoffs, fewer context switches. That alone reduces mental fatigue a lot.\n\nCurious if you’ve found support volume grows linearly with users, or if it spikes around onboarding issues more than anything else?",
