      "text": "Got an email a few months ago. The CEO of my biggest competitor wanted to chat. Assumed it was a trick or a scouting mission. Took the call anyway out of curiosity. They wanted to buy me. Real offer. Real number. Not life-changing money but meaningful. I didn't take it. But the process of considering it taught me a ton. They asked questions I'd never asked myself. What percentage of customers actually use the core feature? What's the real competitive moat? How replaceable am I personally to the business? What would break if I disappeared? What assets transfer versus what's just me? Had to actually find the answers. Some were uncomfortable. The moat I thought existed basically didn't. Turns out competitors could rebuild my product in 3-4 months. The thing I thought was defensible was just a head start. My personal involvement was more central than I'd admitted. Relationships I had with key customers, knowledge in my head, reputation I'd built. The business without me was worth a lot less than I assumed. But I also discovered strengths I'd undersold. Customer retention was higher than I realized. A segment I thought was small was actually growing fast. The word of mouth in a specific niche was stronger than any marketing I'd done. The acquisition didn't happen but the clarity was worth more than the offer. Highly recommend pretending someone wants to buy you and asking yourself the hard questions. You'll learn a lot. What would you discover if someone tried to acquire you?",

Selling to competitors is very risky because you don't know when is a real offer and when not. NDAs are useless here and giving vague information they can argue is not enough to make the decision... they can also retreat at any time during the DD process and get away with tons of info. The guardrails put during DD are useless as well\n\nBTW: i've been recently through an acquisition, so I'm not talking my ass. Some say you don't divulge trade secrets during DD, but this is BS. There are 100-150 points to answer and provide data/documentation, you don't have to give customer list and partners to get to know all about the business and how to tackle them in the next 3 years if you're smart.",

Then a conditional agreement is signed, and a more thorough round of due diligence takes place where you see the guts.  If the acquirer backs out without a good reason like major misrepresentation, then there's a penalty.\n\n  After the more thorough due diligence you adjust the price mainly for things mentioned in the first conditional agreement e.g. cash in the bank or accounts receivable/payable, change in earnings, etc. Then you sign an execution agreement on that price where ownership actually changes hands.\n\n At least that's how I remember it was done for bigger companies like >$50M in value.",

Once I mapped “what breaks if I disappear,” it was brutal how much lived in my head: pricing logic, key intros, even random Zapier hacks. The fix for me was: document one process a week, move relationship ownership to roles instead of people, and track usage/retention by segment instead of in one big lump.\n\nYour note about the fake moat hits hard. Moats usually end up being distribution, switching costs, and tight feedback loops with a specific niche, not the feature set.\n\nI’ve used Gong and Mixpanel to spot which features actually drive retention, and lately Pulse sits alongside them to surface niche Reddit conversations where those users hang out, which is handy once you know exactly who you’re really building for.\n\nSo yeah: run a “pretend acquisition” checklist yearly and see how much value survives without you-that’s the real business.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, this post is going to trigger a lot of folks.\n\nI joined reddit 4 years back started following these different saas startups threads hoping to get some value. \n\nI started following all the constant advice - Build in public, Post about your startup on reddit, cold messaging. Everyone is lying here and they know it.\n\nI wasted 3 FUCKING YEARS of my life building businesses out of taking these suggestions and made $740 in 3 years. Then last year I met a founder backed by a16z who is running a 7M ARR company today. His advice changed everything for me.\n\nAnd I am going to share it because IT IS NO DAMN SECRET! Everyone outside of reddit who has ever built a real business knows these things!!!!\n\n1. Don't fucking re-invent the wheel. Just fucking copy what already is selling in market.\n\n2. Your product features mean shit if no one has ever looked at your product \n\n3. Don't waste your time doing product hunt launches and all the other retarded sites to launch your product. Its a trophy that no one gives a shit about.\n\n\nNow coming to the real deal\n\n1. Homepage matters much more than your actual website. Clear CTAs creating urgency and solving one and only one problem no confusion should be there. Best AI to make home page - \"Figma Make\" dont waste your time finding anything else. I have tested all of them for months. \n\nExample of homepage title \"Get 10x leads from X\"\n\n2. Never do cold emailing, IT NEVER works. Do linkedin outreach much much higher chances of working. Best and cheapest tool - \"linkedHelper\"\n\n3. Stop trying to build your audience and go VIRAL on linkedin twitter X or whatever fucking platform. If you want to build a company 20 years later then sure go ahead\n\n4. Just fucking run Ads, whatever 5k USD you were going to waste in the next 6 months fucking around with ZERO results put all that money and run FUCKING Ads.\n\n5. Unless really irrelevant, for most businesses ONLY run META ads. If your saas is complex and mostly for enterprises etc then run google search ads.\n\n6. META has fucked the platform and now static ads dont work you need only UGC. And please dont ever try AI UGC all those tools out there will generate you ZERO clicks from AI video ads.\n\n7. Get atleast 50-60 UGC pieces from real ugc creators. cheapest website to get UGC - bulba.app\n\n8. Take the UGC and run ads on those. dont EVER try to run ada yourself. Just hire some freelancer from india/philippines from upwork but with really good rating and past work. Don't fall into any agency trap. Always independent. They will do it even for $500.\n\n9. If you product is in $20-50/month range your flow should be signup -> 1 week free trial (with card) -> conversion.\nIf its $100+ then signup -> book demo -> 1 conversion. Only offer free trial for people who ask for that on the call. \n\n10. Then track conversion and drop rates in each stage and try to optimise to finally get a better ROAS.\n\n\nTHATS IT! and people who have done it know that this is how you build a business. And they are mostly not on reddit!\n\nBYE!",

It should be good video ads, carousel ads + writing the right hook scenario for the right audience for each ads type as within 3-5 seconds you should convince the audience to watch your ads till the end and then click the CTA button. So it means that even if you know how to setup ads account and run them, you will still need an experienced graphic/video AD designer with from freelance sites and a good one will cost you at least 40-50 usd/per creative. Do not fall into creating AI video trap as imaginary ads may not perform well, unless it will include the real footage of your product with a good scenario (Scenario part may be handled by any random AI platform like Chatgpt or Gemini)\n\nSo for those who don't have enough funds to run Ads, the best part is to reach the early adopters in your MVP phase(Reddit, LinkedIn, X, Facebook groups(which I don't like anymore), and let them use your saas for free until it will be perfect enough and then let them be your first customers with special discounts + advocates for the product (reference point). \n\nIn my opinion X is still a good platform to find the early customers after your early adopters, as you will have a data and reference point to show to masses. And even the ads will work pretty better with already achieved data. And for each earned penny you should reinvest in ads + content creation + hiring some part-time freelance dev to take care of the Saas product while you will be dealing with marketing + sales and/or sleeping in your timezone.",

          "text": "Claude analysis on this\n\"My Take: He's Half Right, Half Ranting\nWhat He Gets RIGHT\nAds work. Period. The \"organic growth\" fetish on Reddit IS mostly cope. Meta ads + good landing page = fastest path to revenue validation. His point about UGC is spot-on—AI-generated ads look fake, real people testimonials convert 3-5x better. Spending $5k on ads in month 1 beats spending 6 months posting on Twitter to 47 followers. And yes, hiring a solid freelancer ($500-1k/month) beats expensive agencies charging $3k+ for the same work.\nLinkedIn outreach > cold email in 2024. Email is a graveyard—2% open rates, spam filters eating everything. LinkedIn messages actually get read, especially if you personalize the first line. His point about Product Hunt being a vanity metric? Accurate. 400 upvotes ≠ 400 customers. It's a dopamine hit that dies in 48 hours.\nWhat He Gets WRONG (Or Oversimplifies)\n\"Just copy what's selling\" is survivorship bias bullshit. Yeah, it works—if you can out-execute AND out-market the original. Copying Notion's features means competing with a $10B company. You need a wedge—a niche they ignore, a channel they don't dominate, a price point they abandoned. \"Copy + better marketing\" only works if you have serious capital or a distribution advantage he's not mentioning.\n\"Building an audience is useless\" contradicts his own story. He hit 1M ARR—how? Did ads alone get him there, or did he build relationships, get referrals, create content that built trust? Paid ads get you TO the door; trust gets you THROUGH it. For B2B SaaS especially, cold traffic converts at 1-3%. Warm traffic (from content, referrals, audience) converts at 10-30%. His advice works for low-ticket products ($20-50/month), but try selling a $500/month enterprise tool with ONLY ads—you'll bleed cash.\nThe tone is toxic, but the frustration is real. Reddit IS full of \"build in public\" circle-jerking where founders celebrate launches over revenue. But his anger makes him sound like he discovered fire. Every successful founder knows ads work—they just don't scream about it because it's not sexy. His post will help people stuck in analysis paralysis, but it'll hurt people who blindly throw $5k at ads without testing messaging, nailing their ICP, or having a product that actually retains users.\nTL;DR: He's right that ads + good copy + UGC beats organic Twitter posting. He's wrong that copying competitors and ignoring audience-building is universal advice. Use ads to validate fast, but pair it with positioning and retention—or you'll just be burning cash on a leaky bucket.\"",

Different buyers respond to different channels. Enterprise IT folks? LinkedIn. Mid-market ops leaders? Email.\n\nIf you really want to stand out from the noise, then send videos via LinkedIn. We use [Stack BD](https://stackbd.com/) for this - makes it super quick and gets great booking rates.\n\nAnd honestly, the \"just run ads\" advice only works if you have enough margin and volume to make the math work. If your product is under $50/month, Meta ads can burn through cash fast before you figure out messaging. I'd say test cheaper channels first unless you've got 20k to learn with.",

      "text": "I’ve built MVPs for over 30 founders. And the number one reason I see startups run out of money isn't bad marketing.\n\nIt’s **\"Resume Driven Development.\"**\n\nThat’s when a developer convinces you to use the newest, hottest, most complex technology stack because *they* want to learn it to pad their resume, not because your business needs it.\n\nI see pre-revenue startups running on Kubernetes clusters, microservices, and experimental graph databases. They are spending $1,000/month on cloud bills for 5 users.\n\nWhen I come in to build an MVP, I have a strict rule: **We use Boring Technology.**\n\nHere is why \"Boring\" is the best investment you can make:\n\n**1. Boring doesn't break at 2 AM.**\nI use stacks that have been around for 10+ years (like a standard SQL database and a monolith backend). Why? Because every edge case has been solved. When your first customer tries to pay you, you don't want an \"experimental\" library handling the credit card. You want the thing that has processed billions of dollars already.\n\n**2. Boring is cheap to hire for.**\nIf I build your MVP using some obscure, trendy framework that came out last month, you are stuck with me forever. Nobody else knows how to fix it.\nI build using standard, popular tools. That means when you grow, you can hire a junior developer to take over my work easily. I literally engineer myself out of a job, because that’s what is best for *your* business.\n\n**3. Boring is fast.**\nI don’t waste weeks configuring complex cloud infrastructure. I spin up a boring server in 10 minutes. That means I spend the rest of the month building the features your customers actually pay for.\n\n**The \"Commercial Grade\" MVP**\nThere is a difference between a \"prototype\" and a \"product.\"\nA prototype is held together by duct tape.\nA product is simple, but solid.\n\nI don’t build prototypes. I build simple products on solid foundations.\n- I *do* cut scope (we don't need AI-powered avatars yet).\n- I *don't* cut stability (your database will be backed up, and your auth will be secure).\n\nFounders: Check your tech stack. If you can’t pronounce half the tools your dev is using, you might be funding their education, not your product.\n\nFellow devs: Stop over-engineering. The most impressive code is the code that makes money, not the code that uses the most buzzwords.",

It forced engineers to really focus on performance and efficiency because you couldn’t just allocate more resources to solve your performance issues. \n\nIt’s hard from a founder perspective though, because part of being a good leader is understanding what teams need and unblocking their ability to deliver, so if you have engineers saying we need to have AWS clusters and NoSQL data stores and all these other tools in order to deliver value then you either have to have the technical knowledge and conviction to call bullshit and risk losing your team or hand over the cheque book so that they can get what they [perceive to] need to be able to deliver. \n\nBut as founders (especially bootstrapped ones), it’s also important to think about getting stuff done with the bare minimum resources and making sure that message is shared down the line to everyone in the business.

Sometimes the newer languages/frameworks/techniques are in fact faster in two ways - for dev speed for example I remember when Ruby/Sinatra came out and all the Java Spring/Boot guys with their 1000 lines of boilerplate would look with scorn at the 3 lines of code now being sufficient to spin up a webserver.\n\nIt is faster - but the cost of that speed in the example was:\n\n(1) You will come across bugs no one else in the world has ever faced. You don't want to waste time being an open source maintainer alongside your primary mission\n\n(2) Lack of type safety is cool and all - move fast break things etc - but when some fucking moron stores \"true\" as a string in a DB you're going to have a bad time\n\n(3) Monkeypatching random objects to change their behavior is a pandoras box and will give PTSD to devs for decades and all but guarantee your codebase will become unmaintainable in <1 year\n\n  \nThe fast (performance) example is Rust -- I wrote a feature flag framework once in Rust that was around 7 microseconds to evaluate a flag (complex rules), had it hooked up to the Python business logic via PyO3. LaunchDarkly's client was taking 20, Statsig was taking around 60 microseconds. But there was perhaps 1 other dev that would have been able to maintain that code (as beautiful as it seemed to me) and so was not in the best interest of the founders, the company or our customers.",

Advantage of using modern tooling is you’d get access to performance benefits.  \n\nIn terms of architecture, you can go with microservices if it makes sense.

      "text": "Met this guy at a conference. Successful founder. Exited twice. Now angel investing. Offered to mentor me. I was flattered and grateful.\nFor 18 months I had monthly calls with him. Shared everything. My metrics, my struggles, my roadmap, my customer insights, my competitive analysis. He gave advice. Seemed helpful. I thought I was lucky to have access to someone with his experience.\nThen I noticed something. Every few months he'd ask if I knew other founders in my space. Said he wanted to \"help them too.\" I'd make introductions feeling good about connecting people.\nA founder I'd introduced him to reached out one day. Asked why I hadn't mentioned my mentor was an investor in their competitor. I had no idea what she was talking about.\nDid some digging. Over those 18 months he'd invested in three companies in my space. All introduced to him by me or discovered through our conversations. He had a complete map of my market, my weaknesses, where I was headed, what I was worried about. And he'd used it to inform his investments in my competitors.\nI felt sick. Every conversation replayed in my head. Every time I'd been open about a struggle, I was probably giving him information that helped him evaluate companies that would compete with me.\nWhen I confronted him he didn't even deny it. Just said \"that's how the game works\" and seemed confused why I was upset.\nMaybe I'm naive. Maybe this is normal. But I trusted someone who was extracting value while pretending to give it.\nNow I'm much more careful about mentors who are also investors. The incentives aren't always aligned.\nAnyone else been burned by a mentor?\n",

No acquisition cost. Just show up and collect.\n\nAbout 230 of them migrated over. Revenue jumped overnight. I was celebrating.\n\nThen the support tickets started.\n\nThese customers had been using a different product with different workflows. They didn't want to learn our way. They wanted us to work like the old thing worked. Every ticket was basically \"this isn't how I used to do it.\"\n\nFeature requests flooded in. Things the competitor had that we didn't. Things I'd never build because they didn't fit our vision. But these customers expected them. They'd paid for them before.\n\nThe churn started at month three. About 40% of them left within six months. They'd tried to make us work, couldn't adjust, and gave up.\n\nThe ones who stayed are actually good customers now. But the math wasn't what I thought.\n\nExpected: 230 new customers at $89/month = $20,470/month added\n\nReality: about 85 stayed long-term = $7,565/month added\n\nSupport cost during migration: probably ate half of that in the first year.\n\nStill a net positive. But not the windfall I expected. Inherited customers come with inherited expectations. And those expectations are expensive to disappoint or expensive to meet.\n\nFree customers aren't actually free.\n\nHas anyone else inherited customers from a dying competitor?",

The burnout was slow, and then all at once. \n\nI'm officially stepping back as of the new year, with my chairperson taking over in my seat. They've had experience scaling and exiting businesses bigger than mine, and knows our story and team well enough to do it justice. \n\nThe next few months will be telling, though, as we put this change into practice.

At 800k ARR, assuming a ceo costs 200-300k/yr (low end) you are likely at a ~2m valuation so would either be giving almost all of your margin to the new CEO in form of salary, or giving them ~10% of your equity every 12 months.

AI lets me do just that and skip knowing the syntax, searching for documentation, going on Stack Overflow, etc...\n\n> Is anyone else finding that “vibing” actually requires more discipline than traditional coding?\n\nTo **successfully** use AI to code complex applications, you definitely still need to know how to code and architect systems. If you can do these two things then AI can handle the rest and 10x your productivity.\n\n*edit to clarify what I meant",

This requires knowledge of the code you wrote. I found that you dont remember much of the code the agent actually wrote. I had one case where an unbounded for loop caused the webapp to not render in time. I knew exactly where the spot was and why it was caused after using the profiler. \n\nby writing code yourself for the problems you solve you also directly have a map in your mind to debug without having to read through the code. Its exactly the same effect with learning things from book. Read a book and after each chapter, write down what you have learned from that chapter. This makes it stick in your mind for ever. Yes problem solving is the main task we do as engineers, but you have to be efficient in using your tools and maintaining your skillsets. \n\nMaybe its also my niche opinion since im specialized on deep complex backends far away from the career entrypoint I once was at...",

Your users should be able to 'intuit' next steps in your user flow and when/how to use features. If you're not focusing on that above all else, fix it. \n\nstep 2.) is realizing no matter how well you do step 1..... users are still dumb as hell. So have flags to point them in the right direction when needed and only do it once. \n\nexample:  \n\\- user signs up for my app (idk lets go with an expense tracker for example) \n\n\\- they see a dashboard with a bunch of options (start a budget, add income, upload account, etc)   \n\\- ideally your UX makes it so they start uploading the right data in the right order (lets say 'accounts => income => expenses => budget builder)   \n\\- have a pop up/tooltip/whatever say \"most users start here\" then add a flag (bool value) to your user profile database table that once they click it, change the bool value so it doesn't show up again (to avoid annoying them)\n\n\\- then when they do the first step and have an account set up have the next pop up/thing go \"great job, the next step is to set up expenses\" and navigate them there with one click. \n\n\\- repeat this flow for everything. \n\nwhenever a user 'starts' a feature flow, make sure you have tool tips/pop ups that show them how to finish it, shows them options they have (only when its time to make choices on the options, not before), etc.   \n  \nKeep it simple, don't overwhelm them with everything upfront cause they'll do what all of us do \"skip, skip, skip, skip, jesus christ stop asking me stuff and let me use the damn app, skip, skip, finally\" \n\n  \nthats the best experience i've had for my users and while its a harder to do, its worth it.",

You know what Google Cloud SQL charges for the same thing? $5. FIVE DOLLARS.\n\nVercel's pricing made me laugh out loud. They charge $20/month base + $2 per million requests. Meanwhile GCP gives you the first 2 million requests FREE, then 30 cents per million after that. That's not a typo. Thirty cents.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - everyone acts like setting up GCP or AWS is some dark art that requires a PhD. It's not. With modern CI/CD, it's stupidly simple. I spent literally 30 minutes following a Medium guide and had everything deployed. Now with Claude and Cursor, you can basically vibe your way through cloud configurations.\n\nI'm not saying these tools provide zero value. But the value they DO provide is basically... a nicer dashboard? Some abstractions that save you maybe an hour of setup time? And for that, we're paying 4-5x more every single month?\n\nI switched everything to GCP. My monthly bill is basically $7. Same performance. Same uptime.",

      "text": "Yo.\n\nJust to get things straight right away: this post isn't BS.\n\nSEO is in a terrible state these days. Experts share contradictory advice, agencies try to make SEO very complex so they can charge more. And AI search makes it even more blurry as people claim GEO is completely different from SEO when in reality there's like a 80% overlap between SEO & whatever you call the new \"AI SEO\".\n\nSo this is a **curated** list. What doesn't work isn't listed here.\n\nIf you do just the first 2 and you weren’t doing it before, I guarantee you'll get +6-10 positions for the associated pages on Google depending on your niche.\n\nI know this works because I ran experiments on 4 different websites I own and I helped about 30 different websites implement these strategies.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**1. Refresh old content (easiest win)**\n\nGo to Google Search Console. Find posts ranking positions 8-20. These are *so close* to getting traffic but invisible on page 2.\n\nUpdate them: add a new section, fix outdated stats, improve the intro. Then update the published date.\n\nI've seen posts jump 10+ positions within weeks. Lowest hanging fruit in SEO.\n\n**2. Add authors to your blog posts**\n\nGoogle's E-E-A-T framework cares about *who* wrote your content. Add a visible author with a short bio, and **a link to LinkedIn/X**.\n\nEvery time I apply this to a site that wasn't doing it, posts climb 4-8 positions within 2 weeks. Stupid easy.\n\n**3. Integration marketplaces = free high-authority backlinks**\n\nYou're building a SaaS? Then it's very likely you'll want to build an integration with another platform at some point. Get listed on their marketplace: it's free DA 90+ backlink.\n\nHubSpot App Marketplace, Zapier, WordPress plugin directory, Chrome Extensions web store. These listings also drive actual users, not just SEO juice.\n\n**4. Exact domain match still works**\n\nIf you haven't started your venture, you can get a huge SEO boost on a specific keyword if your domain & brand matches it exactly.\n\nGoogle nerfed this years ago, but it still helps when combined with quality content. If you haven't bought your domain yet, spend an extra hour finding one with your primary keyword in it.\n\n**5. Build a free tool**\n\nCalculator, checker, generator - doesn't matter. People love linking to useful resources. One weekend project can earn you backlinks for years.\n\nI built a simple [Domain Rating checker](https://blogseo.io/tools/dr-checker). It takes seconds to use, costs me almost nothing to run, and it gets linked a lot on social media.\n\n**6. Fresh, regular content**\n\nGoogle rewards sites that publish consistently. It signals your site is active and worth crawling frequently. Each article = new entry point from search.\n\n**7. Find keyword gaps**\n\nEveryone tells you to copy competitors. But the real opportunity is what they're *not* doing.\n\nFind terms competitors aren't targeting well. One overlooked keyword with decent volume can become your traffic goldmine while everyone else fights over high-competition terms.\n\nI've seen single well-chosen keywords bring 80% of total traffic on niche sites.\n\n**8. NAP consistency**\n\nYour brand name, URL, and social links should be identical everywhere: Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, X, directories.\n\nWhen Google sees the same info repeated across trusted sources, it builds confidence you're legitimate. Inconsistencies create doubt.\n\n**9. Curated directories only**\n\nIf it's free and anyone can post, don't expect much. Generic directories are worthless.\n\nWhat works for SaaS: Product Hunt, G2, Capterra, \"There's an AI for That\", places that actually vet submissions or require payment.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO**\n\nOne template + structured data = thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords.\n\nClassic example: Zapier's integration pages. But you need a decent backlink profile first, or these pages won't rank.\n\n**11. FAQ sections**\n\nFAQs let you target long-tail keywords and qualify for rich snippets. More SERP real estate = higher CTR.\n\nEven more important now with AI search. When AI fans out your query into sub-queries, FAQ content formatted as Q&A is exactly what they're looking for.\n\n**12. Backlinks outreach**\n\nCold outreach still works:\n\n- Guest posting (you provide content, they get a backlink)\n- Broken link replacement (find broken links on relevant sites, suggest your content)\n- Unlinked mentions (find articles mentioning you without linking, ask for the link)\n\nIt's time consuming. But it works. The only downside to traditional link exchanges is that when scaled, reciprocal links can look suspicious to Google. Site A links to B, B links back to A. Google knows it's a trade.\n\nIf you want to automate link building, I built an ABC backlink exchange into [BlogSEO](https://blogseo.io/). Users get matched with sites in similar niches and the system inserts contextual backlinks using a triangle structure (A→B→C→A) so there's no direct reciprocation. No cold outreach & no reciprocal penalty.\n\n**13. Comparison pages**\n\n\"[Competitor] alternatives\" and \"[Competitor] vs [Your brand]\" searches are bottom-of-funnel gold. These people have already decided to buy - they're just picking which option.\n\nBe honest in these. If you're worse at something, say it. Builds trust and filters out bad-fit customers.\n\n**14. Schema markup that matters**\n\nMost sites skip this or add useless generic markup. Three that actually help:\n\n- `Person`/`Author` - links content to a real human\n- `FAQPage` - qualifies for rich snippets\n- `SameAs` - tells Google all places your brand exists\n\nIf you do this, and are patient enough, I can guarantee you'll get more organic traffic within 3 months.\n\nResults of some websites I've helped with the aforementioned tactics:\n\n- SaaS 1: https://imgur.com/a/OXcw9Ob\n- SaaS 2: https://imgur.com/a/PTozQLx\n- Gaming Directory website: https://imgur.com/a/aU4KK71\n\nHappy to answer questions if needed!",

Refreshing posts sitting just off page one has been the most reliable win, especially when the intent is still solid. Integration pages and free tools also pull double duty, they attract links and actual users, which feels underrated. Author bios helped a bit for us, but only once the content was already decent, it wasn’t a magic switch. Programmatic pages worked only after we had some baseline authority, otherwise they just sat there.

Thought we were building something together. Asked if they'd do an honest exit interview since there was nothing to lose at that point. They agreed and didn't hold back. Everything they said was about me not them.\nI gave contradictory instructions and got frustrated when they didn't know which to follow. I said I wanted autonomy but then micromanaged every decision they made. I communicated goals without context so they never understood why things mattered. I was so busy I never made time to actually train them properly. Three weeks in and they felt confused and untrusted and set up to fail. So they left before it got worse. The hard part was that everything they said was true. I'd been so focused on getting help that I didn't prepare to actually provide leadership. I expected them to read my mind. I treated training as interruption rather than investment.\nTook six months before I hired again. Spent that time building processes. Writing things down. Creating actual onboarding. Thinking about what it would feel like to start fresh with no context. Next hire stayed two years. Same basic role. Different outcome because I'd fixed myself not just filled a seat. The first hire failing was entirely my fault. Their exit interview was a gift I didn't deserve but desperately needed.\n\n",

The idea**\n\nGood SaaS ideas almost never come out of nowhere.  \n  \nThey usually come from:\n\n\n\n* a problem you personally experience\n* active research (Twitter, Reddit, forums, comments)\n* recurring frustrations you notice in others\n\n  \nIf the problem affects you directly, that’s a huge advantage.\n\n\n\n**2. Building (without over-engineering)**\n\n  \nOnce you have the idea:  \n\n\n* keep the architecture simple\n* move fast, not perfect\n* build to learn, not to impress\n\n\n\nA SaaS that never launches learns nothing.\n\n\n\n**3. Build in public (as early as possible)**  \n\n\nThis is the step most people delay.  \nAnd yet, it’s often the strongest long-term lever.\n\n  \nShare:\n\n\n\n* what you’re building\n* your doubts, wins, and struggles\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram.\n\n\n\nNot to sell.  \nTo build trust\n\n\n\n**4. Launch (simple and focused)**  \n\n\nYour only goal:\n\n→ find your first 50 users.\n\n\n\n* closed beta\n* clear offer\n* limited access\n* direct feedback\n\n\n\nNo need to scale.\n\nYou need to understand.\n\n\n\n**5. Repeat. Again. For a long time.**  \n\n\nA SaaS isn’t a straight line.\n\n  \nIt’s a loop:\n\n\n\nBuild → share → sell → learn → improve.\n\n\n\nOver and over.\n\n\n\nMost people quit too early.  \nNot because the idea is bad.\n\n\n\nBut because they didn’t last long enough.  \nAnd that’s usually where everything is decided.\n\nI'm curious, what stage are you at?",

Same with building in public — it’s uncomfortable early, but it forces clarity fast.\n\nThe loop you describe at the end is the part most people underestimate. It’s not the idea or even the execution - it’s the willingness to repeat that cycle long enough without immediate validation.\n\nSolid post.

      "text": "I’m usually pretty skeptical of “X inside ChatGPT” tools because most of them feel like thin wrappers or demos.  \nTried the Clay app mostly out of curiosity and didn’t expect it to be useful beyond quick questions. What surprised me is how natural it felt to reason through enrichment logic, signals, and workflows without touching a giant table right away.  \n  \nIt’s not doing the work for you, but it does help you avoid building dumb workflows that burn budget or data. Almost like a scratchpad for GTM systems instead of a replacement for them.  \nFor anyone running RevOps or growth, have you found ChatGPT-based tools actually helpful yet, or do they still feel like toys compared to full platforms?",

Like I'd describe what I wanted to do and it'd catch stuff like \"wait, if you filter for companies with 50-500 employees but then exclude anyone without a VP of Sales title, you're gonna miss a ton of startups that call them Head of Revenue instead.\" Saved me from burning through a bunch of credits on bad logic.  \n  \nWhere it falls short is anything requiring nuance or judgment calls. I tried using it to help score leads based on intent signals and it was way too binary. Real platforms let you weight things and adjust on the fly. I think the sweet spot is using it as a sounding board during the planning phase, then moving to proper tools for execution.  \n  \nAre you finding it helps more with strategy/planning or actual execution? What other tools are you using in your flow?",

You can't simply scale if your product isn't working.\n\nWhen you don't have a traffic - it's an issue. When you don't have a good engineering resource - it's an issue.\n\nThose things are very coupled. In my comment above I mentioned that I rejected the sales sometimes. It was simply because product wasn't scalable in terms of tech. To scale it - I had to build the rocket.\n\nSo, I wouldn't lower the priority of the technical things.\n\nThe company where I have worked for some time - they're rebuilding the same product 3rd time after few unsuccessful tries. Simply because they been hiring the 'average' engineers.\n\nAverage products would get an average users. Which means no virility, no word of mouth.\n\nNot even talking about that some day the product could be mentioned in media and than with the 'let it slide' approach new user base and old - they both would be struggling, churning and leave bad reviews. Besides simply spamming the support.\n\nI would make a phrase conclusion - If you can't do the sales - don't underestimate the tech. It was my case for a long time, but not anymore since I faced some real technical challenges and consequences of my wrong tech decisions.",

It’s a project, not a product or business until there’s sales.  Customers don’t care what it’s coded in (except if customers are devs) only if you make things easier for them or save them time and money or make them money.\n\nMost scaling issues in the start can just turn the resource knob up, which can be paid for because you have demand that’s paying and profitable.  I would not overbuild the first steps to find the actual problems to some and then double down on architecture. Cutting corners is wrong too.  One of my favourite patterns I’m stating with right now is using Postgres for as much of it as possible jsut to have fewer techs on the backend and then spin out the improvements.  Supabase and a few things can go a long long long way.\n\nIt’s too easy to hide behind the keyboard doing one’s strength (building) instead of building the muscle that’s needed (selling).\n\nOne trick is to spend one week building and one week outside of the building meeting customers to learn their problems that they want solved badly enough to give you money. A grouping of these problems leads to bigger opportunities and trust almost always.\n\nAim for 80% profit margins, don’t undersell or underprice or it will never grow to get help and support in place.",

Half of them ghosted after week 2 but the other half actually used it and told us what sucked.\n\nConverted 2 of those 4 into paying customers once we fixed the obvious broken stuff. Not sexy but it worked.\n\nThe validation thing is real though. We wasted like 3 months building features nobody asked for because we didn't talk to users enough first. Should've done way more customer interviews before building anything.\n\nOne thing that didn't work at all: posting on Reddit, Product Hunt, HN. Got some traffic but zero conversions. People who find you that way are mostly just curious, not actually looking to buy.\n\nReal tactic that worked: find where your target users already hang out (for us it was industry Slack groups and newsletters) and just be helpful there without pitching. Eventually people DM you asking what you're working on.",

I get a referral (which is stronger and better for conversion), and at the same time i'm also able to let my network know about this, they don't feel pressured to buy it, but they will definitely check it out because they are a critical bunch who wants to know what you're up to - and who know, some of them might end up converting. - so a win win",

You must know how to reach these customers, must know who are these customers and these customers must be actively seeking for the solutions. \n\nSo ensure it meets these checklist before working on it.\n\nAnother perspective of startups are when you try to go build somethin NEW where the niche doesnt exist or the customer themselves dont know they need it. This is the hardest niche . Do not build for these markets. Your goal is to make $.  Not innovate.",

That's how it's sold online and that's what I believed when I started. The reality is different.\n\nSupport tickets don't stop. Even with documentation and even with automation, people have questions. They get stuck. They find edge cases. They need help. That's about 8 hours a week just responding to things. The product needs maintenance too. Dependencies update. Security patches happen. Third party APIs change without warning. Things break for no apparent reason. Another 5 hours a week just keeping the lights on. Marketing can't actually stop either. The moment I pause content or outreach, growth stalls. Competitors keep moving. SEO needs constant feeding. That's another 4 hours minimum if I want to keep growing. Then there's the random stuff like billing issues and refund requests and feature requests that need responses even if I'm not building them and legal compliance updates. Another 3 hours of miscellaneous work that just appears.\n\nAdd it up and my \"passive\" income requires about 20 hours a week of active work. That's half a full time job. Better than a full time job for sure but nowhere near the fantasy of true passive income. I'm not complaining because the business is good and the flexibility is real. But I wish someone had told me earlier that SaaS passive income is more like SaaS reduced-active income. The work doesn't disappear. It just gets more efficient. Maybe at a much larger scale with a real team it becomes truly passive for the founder. I'm not there yet and might never be. I've accepted that the 20 hours is just part of the deal.",

From what I have seen, sometimes people aren't actually caring about the product, they're just in 'shopping' mode. \n\nIn the end it would be about replicating that paying users like 100-10000 times and be profitable taking into account the traffic, infrastructure, and your/team salaries. For the most cases. And competitors are going to hire people. If you don't - you loose.\n\nPeople who're on the bottom of the funnel, for them - it's about hiring the right people to do the job.\n\nTry to estimate how long it would be until you reach this point. And don't forget that even if you product has someone who needs it - doesn't mean they see enough value in that to make you profitable.\n\nDon't want to sound negative. It's a good job.\n\nI wish you luck and attention to details. In the end, if you have someone to compete with - it would be something really important to survive.",

Nothing is visible if a user doesn’t have credentials. All secured areas live inside VPC endpoints. \n\nI built everything in the AWS ecosystem. For me, if no one ever sees my system, it’ll be worth it to me because it saves me at least 20 hours that was previously spent on manual tasks.

I started a few and about to launch one of them. \n\nMy question is how do you manage those costs. Once you add vpcs and databases even in development the costs get real. \n\nMy simple sass app is running about $65-$75/mo for aws. Then add a Claude subscription at $100/mo. Even the most basic apps start at $200/mo. \n\nMaybe it’s a mistake on my part but I like to work on several projects at once and I can see my monthly development costs getting too expensive. \n\nWhat would you recommend?  How early do you launch your mvp?  The last thing I want is something fragile for first experience. Just curious if anyone has a good pattern here.",

That seemed like a win.\n\nFast forward to today and we're sitting at **5.5K users, 120+ organizations, and 2.5 million API requests** routed through the system. **Anthropic** is our top provider by token volume, which makes sense given how good their models are, but still. **14 billion** tokens routed.\n\nThe wildest part is **No launch on Product Hunt**, no cold outreach. Just built the thing, threw up some docs, and people... found it? Apparently there are a lot of developers out there who are as tired as I was of managing five different API keys and learning five different request formats just to compare models or build fallback logic & also tired with Current Solutions as well.\n\nThe growth curve has been kind of ridiculous we went from \"cool, someone signed up\" to \"wait, we need to optimize this endpoint because we're hitting rate limits\".\n\nIf you're building with LLMs and you're tired of the provider gymnastics, Anannas is running 20% off on all models for 10 days. Applies to every API provider on the platform. Go Build with the Community.\n\nps: the community doesnt allow image. so here are the full [stats](https://x.com/anannas_ai/status/2006016244915343670)",

Fireworks/together AI they usually don't 're sell' models that official providers already host.\n\n2 - How in the world would you deal with rate limits from said providers, at scale.

And TPM/RPM and their per seconds or per day counterparts.\n\n\nI wrote \"How [...] would you deal with rate limits from said providers, at scale.\"\n\n\nThe 'at scale' matters here. When going through open router's keys it is well known that users get rate limited, and get 429s very often. \n\n\nThat is why its better to connect to openrouters routed models for which they dont use their own key, or directly to said providers BYOK way. \n\n\nThey handle 25T token traffic (only a tiny fraction of that goes through their keys). \n\n\nOP's service is new, and has everyone go through their keys, it is a recipe for disaster, unless they get custom rate limits. If the providers even allow them to resell their tokens for such poor added value. \n\n\nIt is forbidden by their ToS.\n\nHence OPs silence. ",

It's not like i'm lazy, it's just i work a very hard labor job, so I don't have a lot of time and I fear to fail if I choose the wrong idea.\n\n\n\nI would be very glad if you guys can help me with suggestions",

I somehow ground it out to $10k MRR over four years, but it cost me my sanity.

A SaaS with paying customers who depend on you for their business is an entirely different beast.\n\nTake my Point of Sale (POS) startup. When I started, I thought I just needed a database and some forms. But once we scaled, reality hit. For example, when a client's internet flickered, the system would accidentally generate duplicate invoices. Because I didn't have senior-level experience with distributed systems or queue patterns, I spent years manually fixing data and fighting fires. If I had known how to build for 'Scale' and 'Reliability' from day one, I would have saved 3 years of stress and a lot of lost customers.\n\nRegarding the industry: if you don’t know the domain (like Accounting or Logistics), you’ll end up 'feature-guessing.' You'll build a 'cool' dashboard that nobody uses, while missing a boring, 'must-have' regulatory report that is the only reason a customer would actually pay for.",

Build a simple integration that connects two tools your target market already uses daily\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Leverage existing communities\\*\\* - Next.js? Build something for the dev community itself. Real estate niche? Build for agents. The $50/mo target is achievable when you're selling to people who already trust you\n\n\n\nThe constraint (limited time + limited budget) is actually your advantage.

You could potentially hit that $50/month faster while you figure out what problems people actually want to pay to solve.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to go the SaaS route I'd echo what others said - don't look for \"ideas,\" look for specific problems you've personally experienced or seen others struggle with.

Given limited time, a thin SaaS that replaces a spreadsheet, script, or recurring manual task for a niche audience is more realistic than a full platform. Another pattern is starting as a paid service or script and only turning it into SaaS once you see repeat demand.

They explore the surface, but nothing clearly answers why they should invest more time right now. Early stage teams often overestimate how much context users bring with them and underestimate how confusing a flexible product can feel at first.\n\nWhat helped for us was obsessing over one very specific first outcome and designing everything around getting the user there fast. Not a tour, not documentation, but a single action that makes the product feel useful in under five minutes. We removed features from the initial view and hid them until after that first win happened.\n\nAnother thing to look at is intent mismatch. If acquisition is pulling in users who are not strongly motivated to solve the problem today, they will always churn quietly. Talking directly to a few of these users and asking what they expected to accomplish in their first session can be uncomfortable but very revealing.\n\nOnboarding matters, but clarity matters more.

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://temporal.io/) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing).\n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://mention.click/)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

What we got wrong is the fact that after this, LinkedIn has changed its TOS, and put previously public data behind the login screen, which has made public data not public anymore.\n\nReddit, on the other hand, does not require you to log in to see posts and comments.\n\nThis is a controversial topic and selective law application, in my opinion.\n\nSince Google, Perplexity, etc, scrape the entirety of the internet to power their products. \n\nYou could argue that they are pushing progress and evolving the tech (that's somewhat true), but in the end of the day, they are businesses whose main goal is to earn money. \n\nI think that scraping people's data or UGC, eventually making them lose money (like scraping Medium posts protected by the paywall), is piracy; LinkedIn is a different thing. At least in my opinion.\n\nFor us, we decided to stop playing this game of scrapping, even though the internet wouldn't be the place we know right now without it.",

I think from all the failed projects, I learned a lot. At least what not to do the next time.\n\n\n\nI remember building my first \"REAL STARTUP\", oh god, that was a mistake. We invested 1.5 years, probably around 10k USD, in really stupid things like getting a legal entity, paying an accountant to file our taxes, paying for the designs, servers, etc.  What did I get from that project? nothing, except the experience. \n\nI learned lots of cool things about PostgreSQL (we were doing PostgreSQL replication, kind of FiveTran), and met cool people. I met a guy, and we have been making all the projects mentioned in this post together since then. We got along only because of that first failed project I had. I think I even landed a good 9-5 job because of that project.\n\nI remember I sucked at the interview (live coding), so in the end, I just acknowledged that and said something like \"I know I sucked, but here is my GitHub, there is a project I worked on. All the code is mine there,\" and I think that could have played a role in their decision.\n\nSo, think about whether you should stop making it, and see if you can sell it. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is stop at the right time and work on damage limitation.\n\nHope that helps at least somehow.",

I started with:\n- AWS RDS (could use something like Neon instead)\n- AWS S3 (practically free)\n- CloudFront (could use cloudflare)\n- Auth0 (could build your own/use a self hosted one)\n- EC2 (could use any VPS provider)\n- Elastic for OpenTelementry.\n\nAgain don’t worry about half of this for MVP. Get the compute on EC2 or ECS, get a DB on any platform (or self host and backup), and go. I think metrics are incredibly important though so I’d recommend setting that up, AWS CloudWatch is awfully expensive though.\n\nDepends on your tech stack a little bit, and if you can adopt serverless. But everything in the cloud has pros and cons. There’s no one way to do it. You have many sliders of priorities and you can’t optimise all. Do you want cost savings, speed of dev, performance, uptime, etc. each will give you a slightly different setup",

Simple VMs, a Go or Node.js backend, containerized, with Kubernetes for infrastructure.\n\nIn most cases you can keep total infra costs under about $1k per month, and when load grows it’s relatively easy to scale by adding more compute rather than fighting serverless pricing or vendor lock-in.\n\nIn my experience, optimizing infrastructure too early rarely pays off.

AWS will offer all of what you’re asking for, and do so extremely cheaply — the caveat being if you are running something warm or hot, without tearing it down, you can rack up money. Examples of these are ec2 or RDS. But again, with CDK during development, you can destroy your deployed app with a simple command. More advanced methods exist to manage start/stop time per environment, but since you asked for simplicity, CDK can do that. Once you get used to it and you have some boilerplate laying around, you can build apps surprisingly fast.",

The goal is to document everything: wins, losses, learnings, progress. This helps build trust in the eyes of people watching and also allows you to build an engaged and targeted audience aligned with your product\n\n\\-> LinkedIn outbound: 10–30 messages per day. Don’t do direct sales outreach, ask for feedback instead “I saw that you do X, do you face problem Y? We’re building Z”\n\n\\-> Cold email: send 20 to 100 emails per day. Of course, the money is in the follow-ups. You’ll start getting replies from the 3rd–4th follow-up, so put a strong focus on follow-ups and expect nothing from the first email\n\n\\-> Comments on X and Reddit: you need to do at least 10 comments on each platform. You can comment under posts like “I’m looking for an alternative to (your competitor)” and subtly mention your tool. You really need to focus on substance in everything you comment—the value in your comment should be your top priority\n\n\\-> Last thing to implement is to stick to this strategy for several months, minimum 6 months. If you only do it for 1 or 2 months, you won’t have time to see the compounding effects. This is one of the most important things: consistency and perseverance\n\nYou’ll see that the first days will be tough, but little by little it will start to pay off. Really trust this strategy and the compounding effects!\n\nFeel free to tell me what you would add on your side!",

Felt amazing\r\nwatching the numbers climb. Finally getting traction after six months of building in\r\nsilence.\n\r\nThen reality hit. Three weeks later I have 8 paid customers. Less than 1% conversion\r\nfrom all those signups. Most people tried it once and never came back. The Product\r\nHunt spike is completely gone and I'm back to getting maybe 2 signups per day.\n\r\nWhat I learned is Product Hunt gives you visibility but not necessarily customers. The\r\npeople browsing Product Hunt are mostly other founders, makers, and people who love\r\ntrying new tools. They're not necessarily your target customer and they're definitely not\r\nin buying mode when they're just browsing cool new products.\n\r\nThe 8 customers I did get didn't come from Product Hunt. They came from a tiny post I\r\nmade in a niche subreddit two days after the launch where I just showed what the\r\nproduct actually does instead of hyping it up. Made a quick walkthrough with Trupeer\r\nshowing a real use case and shared it there. Those people signed up already knowing if\r\nthey needed it or not.\n\r\nI'm not saying Product Hunt is useless. The brand awareness probably helps long term.\r\nGetting featured looks good. But if you're counting on it to be your big launch moment\r\nthat floods you with customers, adjust expectations. It's more like getting a bunch of\r\npeople to look at your thing for 30 seconds and then most of them moving on with their\r\nlives.",

Those conversations often convert better than “building in public,” and they don’t require pretending to be a content creator. Social media is optional; talking to real users isn’t.",

Many businesses suffer because they don't understand supply and demand tension. AKA, your product has no HOT BURNING OFFER!!! that grabs your Ideal client by the throat and forces them to pay attention because you have done the one thing that all great businesses have done.\n\nSolve a real pressing, hair on fire problem for your prospect or created the type of transformation people desire.\n\nIf your product doesn't have demand attached to it and it's just another nice to have product then you've already failed and if you truly desire to get ahead, and make all your effort worth it, you're going to need a \n\ncult level belief in your product and a deep understanding of what it does and how it helps users. \n\nI'm not talking about the features of your product or how cool it is, but the core benefits it offers.\n\nIf you can't list in great detail, the exact pressing issue your clients face, how they feel, what's their fear, worry, aspirations and desire then you won't be able to create a proper product that fit those needs and drive attention in the marketplace.\n\nMany start-ups I have consulted created nice to have products and commoditized services and they try to go-to-market but the product is dead!!. \n\nNo one Desires it. Demand is low, churn is high, retention keeps dropping and you're left helpless and crying on social about your wasted time and effort.\n\nI would love to share more on this but I am short on time and I am a caught up with building a high level ICP system for B2b clients. \n\nPS. Take marketing for what it is. A distribution and creational source that allows you to connect with folks for different reasons. to build in public only means that you're connecting with user/clients who love your offer because you communicated how it helped people and why they stay.",

This is a lesson learned for you. \n\nPosting every day isn't fake. Building in public isn't fake, but know this, it really only works if your public cares about how it is being built. They will only care if how it is being built affects how they build around it. Basically, only products for developers are good \"build in public\" types of things. \n\nI have one SaaS that makes money. I didn't \"build in public\" so much as I \"built with my customers\". I found my customers, setup an email invite, and when I got to 100 emails, I created the authentication for the app and installed a forum (Discourse) that used SSO from the authentication. The users then started chatting with me about what they wanted to see in the application. \n\nMy only regret is that it is a B2C, but I found the customers for it first so, that's what got built. I had an e-commerce store which was making money until my primary vendor decided to start selling on Amazon and locked me out. The marketing for that e-commerce store was here on Reddit, which is why I went with a forum for the B2C SaaS. I have yet to try the forum trick with a B2B, but I think it will work the same.\n\nFind the customers first. Then have real conversations with them before you start building. Sometimes the conversations will be awkward because they will \"want a faster horse\" because they \"know how to use a horse\". It is a lot of \"I promise, I've done the research, this will be better.\" They will grumble but you will get them on your side by saving them time and money.",

It can be as simple as writing thoughtful posts about problems you have already solved, or leaving supportive, insightful comments on other people’s posts where your experience is relevant.\n\nPick one or two channels and get good at them instead of spreading yourself thin. LinkedIn works well if you like long form thinking. Substack works if you prefer writing quietly and letting people find you over time. Consistency matters more than volume.\n\nMost early traction comes from trust, not reach. When people see you helping and thinking clearly, they get curious on their own.",

Short links with custom slugs and custom domains, link in bio, deeper analytics (by hour, country, referrers, UTMs), plus APIs and webhooks if you want to automate.\n\nAnd you’re right that I need to make that obvious in seconds. I’m going to add a simple 1 to 1 comparison on the landing page, include a live demo link, and lead with the top reasons someone would actually switch instead of vague messaging.\n\nThanks again for the push.

Cause a genuine market analysis exposes potential customers who are desperate for a solution. If there are no people in distress about the pain point your product is solving, then you should not launch it.\n2. **Free Trial**: It is important to have users (any kind of) to get feedback on atleast general usability. Please please please give out free trials. Also keep a discord page for people to have an accessible medium to rant in. Use reddit, twitter etc to reach people for free trials.\n3. **Content Marketing:** Write blogs, make youtube tutorials, write articles, engage with communities in twitter, reddit, discord of other products, basically share your knowledge. Knowledge shared is knowledge and users gained.  One of the most effective ways is latch on to a product that is being widely used, is trendy and is not flooded with tutorials to use as your helper. Eg if your product is a SaaS which interacts with LLMs, you can make a high quality project tutorial using LangChain and insert your product as one of the prerequisites for the project to work. This works exceptionally well, because your videos get traction, your product gets traction because users following your video will need to use your product to proceed, creates tutorial resources for your product and gives you user insights and feedback. If everything goes well, you may also be able to hook people to your product because everybody is using your tutorial to learn the other trendy one.\n4. **Dont be users obsessed, be product obsessed:** For the love of god dont think user popularity means better product or success. Actual users are the ones who are desperate for your product because their own jobs or commitments depend on yours. They will rant, be brutal, downgrade you because they are desperate for your solution to work. And they dont care how many users you have, they are more concerned about the quality of the product. If you optimize for user traction, there is a high probability you will fail them. These important users will drive long term consumer growth. The SaaS world is a graveyard of products that had huge traction due to to maybe being featured in Product Hunt etc, and then they die out as quickly as they gained traction, because real customers are not in vibrant and savvy parts of the internet. They are in boring old blogs and articles.\n\n\n\nPS: This post has not been written using AI. Protect our community against the dead internet.",

If launching to zero users, it usually means this step was skipped. Not judging, just real.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Launch to the right place\\*\\* - Most founders launch to generic channels. The magic is niche communities (like this one, ProductHunt for tech, Slack communities, etc). Your first 100 users won't come from Twitter randos.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*The GTM pivoting\\*\\* - Once launched, talk to the people who DO sign up obsessively. Don't change the product yet. Change your messaging/positioning first. Most products aren't the problem - the pitch is.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Content + Social proof\\*\\* - Share the journey. People love supporting underdogs. Weekly updates on what you're learning, not just what you're building.\n\n\n\nBiggest mistake I see: waiting for perfect product before talking to users. Ship early, iterate based on REAL feedback, not your assumptions.\n\n\n\nWhat's your product? Happy to give more specific thoughts.",

You need to actively seek out your target audience where they naturally congregate and directly engage with their stated problems. For instance, tools like LeadsRover can be quite effective by scanning platforms like Reddit 24/7 to identify high-intent leads and even draft authentic responses mentioning your product.\n\n\n\nBeyond automated identification, direct engagement in relevant forums and communities is crucial. Offer to solve specific problems for early users in exchange for honest feedback, which provides invaluable insights that cannot be gained through internal testing alone. This iterative feedback loop is essential for refining both your product and its messaging to resonate with real needs.",

I had to learn where my users actually hang out and show up there consistently.\n* **I put the product where early adopters already look for tools** I listed it on places like Product Hunt, Pitchwall, and similar platforms—not for scale, but to get blunt early feedback and spot messaging gaps fast.\n* **I treated zero users as feedback, not failure** No usage meant no value.

      "text": "Customer was about to churn. Important one. Called to save them. Pulled out what I thought was the big gun. Fifty percent off for the next year.\nSilence on the phone. Then: \"That's actually kind of insulting.\"\nI was confused. How is saving money insulting?\nThey explained. The problem wasn't price. They could afford it. The problem was they weren't getting enough value from the product. Offering a discount was essentially me saying \"I know it's not worth what you're paying, here's less money for the same not-enough value.\"\nThe discount didn't solve their problem. It just made their problem cheaper.\nWhat they actually wanted was help. They wanted me to understand why they weren't getting value and fix it. Show them what they were missing. Help them implement properly. Make the product work for them specifically.\nSpent the next hour on the phone actually solving their problem. Walked through their workflow. Found where things weren't connected. Helped them set up features they didn't know existed.\nThey stayed. At full price. Actually upgraded six months later.\nThe lesson stuck with me. When customers leave, the instinct is to offer money. But money only helps if price is actually the problem. Usually it's not. Usually they just don't see enough value.\nDiscounts treat symptoms. Understanding treats causes.\nNow when someone wants to cancel, my first question is \"help me understand what's not working.\" The answer tells me whether discount or assistance is the right move.\nWhat's your save strategy when customers want to leave?\n",

Building in public to get initial traction: I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. Reaching out to influencers with organic traffic and sponsoring them: I knew good content leads to people trying my app but I didn't have time to write content all the time so the next natural step was to pay people to post content for me. I just doubled down on what already worked.\n3. Word of mouth: I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. Removing all formatting from my emails: I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\nWhat didn't work:\n\n1. Writing articles and trying to rank on Google: Turns out my product isn't something people are searching for on Google.\n2. Affiliate system: I've had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it's extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n3. Instagram: I tried instagram marketing for a short while, managed to get some views, absolutely no conversions.\n4. Building features no one wants (obviously): I've wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I'm not going to try any new marketing channels until I'm doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can't stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won't talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

          "text": "Getting those first users is pure \"zero-to-one\" grit, but most founders fail here because they're too busy polishing pixels instead of actually hunting. The real play to avoid burnout is strategically delegating the low-leverage \"noise\" the cold outreach, manual directory submissions, and lead scraping to specialized support so you can stay focused on the high-leverage work of refining your pitch and closing deals. Outsourcing the initial operational friction ensures you don't blow your mental battery on \"grunt work\" before you even hit product-market fit. If you want to know how to outsource that early-stage grind or want to compare growth workflows, I can definitely point you in the right direction!",

But the conversion to paid is… painfully low.\n\nI’m starting to wonder if I’ve accidentally built something that’s too complete for free.\n\nRight now, free users can experience most of the core value. The paid plan mainly adds convenience, higher limits, and access to more advanced features. In theory, that should be enough but clearly it isn’t creating urgency.\n\nI’m trying to figure out where the real problem is:\n\nIs my free plan too generous?\n\nAm I failing to clearly communicate the paid value?\n\nOr are users solving their “one-time problem” and leaving?\n\nMy starting plan is for 5dollar which is 1/5th of the industry level I am in. It's one of the most affordable plans. \n\nhttps://www.zolly.dev no code tool where you can edit like canva, have multiple AI models and one click publish. Everything for free. \n\nFor those of you who’ve successfully converted free users:\n\nWhat was the single biggest change that moved the needle?\n\nDid you reduce free features, add paywalls, or change onboarding/messaging?\n\nAt what point did you realize the free plan was hurting more than helping?\n\nI’m not looking for generic growth hacks genuinely trying to learn from real experiences. Any blunt or uncomfortable feedback is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance. ",

Easy entry point for people with no objections because they don’t need to add their card. \n\nSecond to this, your entry point is too cheap.

Maybe look for a niche use case the power users really need that your competitor doesn’t do well or doesn’t exist at all. Then base your income on that.

I recently left the corporate world to push it again full-time, and wow… marketing channels have changed. Google Ads in particular feels like a completely different beast compared to just 5, 6 years ago.  Facebook & Reddit Ads is much easier to setup and get quick click activity but if your SaaS product is not setup with todays modern theme and you have not done yet what others have recommended here then those clicks might be waisted money.\n\n1. **Keep your signup page** ***only*** **about signing up.**\n2. Mixing a “free trial” CTA with forms, pricing options, or long explanations increases bounce immediately. There’s a strong psychological effect when people think *“I’m here to start… why am I now comparing plans?”*\n3. The more friction you add before the “I’m in” moment, the fewer people complete it.\n4. **Treat pricing and onboarding as** ***separate steps*** Let people create their account with minimal info first. Once they’re inside and have said “yes,” they’re far more open to additional setup, choosing plans, and entering payment details.\n\nThese were the 2 biggest killers for me.  My app was based on site development from 15 years ago, well that don't work anymore for SaaS products.  I've spent the last several months revamping my site to match todays marketing playground in hopes that marketing will be a bit easier.\n\nHappy to share more if useful — I’m still actively adjusting as I go.\n\nBest of luck",

Here's what I learned the hard way:\n\n**Start talking to people NOW, not after launch.** I spent months perfecting features nobody asked for. Build your waitlist while you build the product. Even 10-20 people who actually want what you're making is gold.\n\n**Pick ONE or TWO channels and go deep.** I spread myself too thin at first. For me, Reddit + niche communities worked best because I could have real conversations. Twitter felt like shouting into the void initially. \n\nI also tested a Facebook group to \"ask for help\" about the problem I am solving with my SaaS to understand how people solve this issue. They replied by saying \"Ugh, what a nightmare, I would do this and that....\"\n\n**The thing I started too late:** Content that actually helps people, not just \"here's my product\" posts. Write about the problem you're solving. Share your journey. People buy from founders they trust.\n\n**One thing that's been genuinely helpful for me** \\- I built a system to automate a lot of the repetitive marketing stuff (scheduling, content repurposing, etc.) because I was drowning in it. Turns out other solo founders had the same problem, so now I'm turning it into a product itself (SoloFounderMarketing).\n\nHappy to share more specific tactics if helpful.",

Posting widely felt productive, but it mostly generated noise, not signal.\n\nChannels that gave the best early signal for me were conversations, not broadcasts. Commenting on relevant threads, answering questions honestly, and letting people ask follow-ups told me much more than traffic ever did.\n\nThe thing I wish I started earlier: documenting what confused people. Every time someone asked “wait, so who is this for?” or “when would I actually use this?”, that was a marketing insight, not a sales objection.\n\nMarketing early felt less like promotion and more like clarification.

I'd jump into niche subs, drop actual helpful comments on pain point threads without linking anything at first, then only share the tool if someone followed up asking for solutions - ended up with my first 10 paying users that way and zero ad spend. The key is patience because it feels slow at the start but compounds once people see you're not just shilling.",

Following up converts curious folks and surfaces issues you can actually fix.

Spent 6 months testing boring compounding tactic versus trendy growth hacks. The compounding approach delivered 4.3x better customer acquisition at 89% lower cost.\n\nThe growth hacking experiment compared two acquisition approaches. Channel A used directory SEO foundation plus consistent content (the boring compound approach). Channel B used Product Hunt launches, viral social tactics, cold outreach campaigns (the exciting growth hacks). Tracked CAC, customer LTV, time investment, and sustainability.\n\nMonth one results showed growth hacks winning. Channel B delivered 24 customers from Product Hunt launch and Reddit posting. Channel A delivered 2 customers from early organic search. Growth hackers would declare Channel B the winner and scale it. We kept tracking.\n\nMonth two showed Channel B declining. Previous viral tactics stopped working requiring new campaigns. Delivered 16 customers from fresh tactics. Channel A grew to 8 customers as earlier content started ranking. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) establishing DA 0→17 providing foundation for content to rank.\n\nMonth three revealed inflection point. Channel B delivered 14 customers requiring increasing effort for diminishing returns. Channel A reached 18 customers as compound effects kicked in. Content published in month one still generating customers in month three with zero additional effort.\n\nMonth four demonstrated compound advantage. Channel B plateaued at 12 customers as viral tactics exhausted. Channel A grew to 32 customers. Earlier content continued performing while new content added to growth. The gap between channels widened significantly.\n\nMonth five and six showed exponential divergence. Channel B averaged 10-11 customers monthly requiring 25+ hours weekly effort finding new tactics. Channel A delivered 48 then 61 customers with effort dropping to 15 hours weekly as content library performed.\n\nSix month totals showed dramatic difference. Channel A: 169 total customers, $14.12 average CAC, 15.2 month average LTV, minimal ongoing effort. Channel B: 87 total customers, $128 average CAC, 11.8 month average LTV, high ongoing effort required. Compounding approach delivered 94% more customers at 89% lower cost.\n\nThe time investment analysis revealed sustainability gap. Channel A required heavy effort months 1-2 (45 hours weekly) establishing foundation, then dropped to 15 hours weekly as compound effects kicked in. Channel B required consistent 25-30 hours weekly every month maintaining results through constant new tactics.\n\nCustomer quality differed significantly. Channel A customers had 15.2 month average LTV suggesting better product fit. Channel B customers averaged 11.8 months with higher churn. Organic search customers who found solutions to problems had better retention than customers acquired through viral tricks.\n\nWhat made compounding approach work was directory submissions establishing DA foundation (0→26 over 6 months), consistent publishing 2-3x weekly never skipping, targeting problem-aware keywords not vanity traffic, optimizing conversion as traffic grew, and patience through months 1-2 when growth seemed slow compared to viral tactics.\n\nFor growth hackers the lesson is distinguish between tactics that require ongoing effort versus tactics that compound. Viral growth hacks feel exciting but stop working when effort stops. Boring compounding tactics feel slow initially but accelerate over time while effort decreases.\n\nThe strategic framework is use growth hacks for initial traction months 1-3 getting first customers, simultaneously build compounding channels that take 3-6 months to show results, by month 6 transition to compounding channels as primary growth engine, and use growth hacks tactically for product launches not ongoing acquisition.\n\nThe mistake most growth hackers make is optimizing for month one results not month twelve sustainability. They chase tactics that feel productive because they generate immediate results, never building compounding systems that would eventually outperform with less effort.",

Built this elaborate project management tool with kanban boards, time tracking, team collaboration, the works. Launched it expecting people to just get it. Got maybe 20 signups total, 3 people used it twice, zero revenue. Couldn't understand why nobody cared.\n\nStarted my second attempt the same way, already 3 months into building another productivity tool, when a friend basically forced me to actually talk to potential users. Like just have conversations, no script, no pitch. I was terrified honestly, felt like I'd be wasting their time. But I posted in a few communities asking if anyone struggled with the problem I thought I was solving, and surprisingly 15 people agreed to quick calls.\n\nThose conversations completely changed my perspective. Turns out the problem I was solving wasn't actually their biggest pain point, they had a different but related frustration I hadn't even considered. Three people mentioned almost the exact same issue with tracking client feedback during projects. I asked what they currently used and they all said \"honestly just email and hoping I remember things, it's a mess.\" When I asked if they'd pay for something that solved it, two said probably not, but four said they'd definitely try it if it was simple and under $30/month.\n\nI made myself do 10 more of these conversations over the next week. Same pattern kept showing up, people wanted something way simpler than what I was building. So I did something that hurt, I scrapped my 3 months of work and built the simplest possible version of what they described in about 10 days using a starter template. Just one core feature, ugly interface, barely any settings. Posted it back to those communities and got 8 people to try it that first week. That was 7 months ago. Made my first dollar in week 3 when someone upgraded to a paid plan at $25/month without me even asking. Now at $4.2K MRR with about 180 paying users. Growth has been slower than those overnight success stories, but it's real and sustainable. The conversations taught me that what I think users need and what they'll actually pay for are completely different things. I found that insight studying real founder stories in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful people talked about validation not as some weekend framework but as ongoing conversations that shaped their entire product direction. Wish I'd done that before spending 6 months on attempt number one.",

Building first, talking to users later is backwards but feels safer because coding is more comfortable than conversations.\n\nThe \"scrapping 3 months of work\" thing sucks but honestly you got off easy. I've worked with founders who spent 2 years building before talking to anyone. At least you caught it at 3 months.\n\nOne thing though - 10 conversations isn't really enough to validate a market. You got lucky that the pattern showed up fast, but I'd recommend talking to like 25-30 people minimum before building anything. Especially for B2B stuff where recruiting the right people is hard.\n\nFor finding people to talk to, I've used multiple recruiting platforms over the years - UserInterviews, Respondent, a few others. Honestly liked CleverX the most for getting quality participants quickly, especially when you need specific user types. Better than just hoping the right people respond to community posts.\n\nBut yeah the core insight is right - what users say they want and what they'll actually pay for are totally different. That's why you have to watch how they currently solve the problem, not just ask hypothetical questions about features.\n\nCongrats on the MRR though. Slow and real beats fake hockey stick growth.",

Cash Cows (boring but stabilizing)**  \nThese are things that:\n\n* Already make money\n* Don’t excite you\n* Don’t scale massively BUT can reliably pay bills\n\nYour profitable venture likely sits here.  \nThe mistake most founders make is abandoning these too early instead of **intentionally milking them** to buy freedom.\n\nAction:  \nDon’t pour love into it — pour *process*. Automate, standardize, cap your time, extract cash.\n\n**2. Question Marks (high upside, unclear path)**  \nYour AI experiments likely live here.  \nInteresting. Potentially scalable. But not yet proven as products.\n\nAction:  \nPick **one** and productize it narrowly (not “AI for businesses,” but “AI for X doing Y”).  \nTime-box validation. If it doesn’t move, kill it.\n\n**3. Dogs (energy leaks)**  \nThis is consulting for other people’s businesses.  \nPays short-term. Drains long-term confidence.\n\nAction:  \nKeep only if absolutely necessary — but treat it as **temporary fuel**, not identity.  \nNo emotional attachment.\n\n**4. Stars (what you’re actually searching for)**  \nYou don’t have one yet — and that’s okay.  \nStars emerge *after* Question Marks survive contact with reality.\n\nThe key shift here is this:  \nYou don’t need one perfect venture right now.  \nYou need a **deliberate portfolio**, where each thing has a job.\n\nThis reframing alone usually restores confidence, because you stop feeling “lost” and start seeing trade-offs clearly.\n\nI ran into the same trap and started collecting tools like this into a small reference I use (and later shared) called *BizTools* — mainly so I didn’t make emotional decisions under pressure. Not magic, but it helped me think straighter when life was noisy.\n\nYou’re not behind.  \nYou’re just at the stage where **structure matters more than hustle**.",

Pure consulting drains you. Bouncing between them slowly kills confidence.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot is treating “product” as a big, all-or-nothing bet. It doesn’t have to be. And consulting does not have to mean selling your time forever.\n\nThe practical middle ground is this: take something people already pay you for and box it into a repeatable outcome. Same problem, same solution, same scope. Not a platform. Not custom work. Something narrow and opinionated. Charge for the result, not hours. Automate pieces only after the demand is proven.\n\nAI helps here, but not by inventing ideas. It helps by removing labor from things people already value. If clients paid you for outbound or ops work, that’s signal even if you hated doing it. The product version is not a flashy SaaS. It’s one clear outcome for one clear customer delivered consistently.\n\nYou don’t need to find a passion project right now. You need one thing that does not reset to zero every few months. Once you have stable cash from something boring and reliable, the higher-upside bets stop feeling reckless.\n\nYou haven’t lost confidence. You’ve just outgrown the stage where blind risk made sense.

Everything you do for them, you turn into a reusable asset: a script, a playbook, a tiny internal tool.\n\n2) From those assets, pick the patterns. If three clients pay you to fix outbound or reception, that’s your first product. Start by productizing the service (fixed-price package, fixed outcome) before full SaaS.\n\n3) Use tiny bets. Ship micro-products: a Notion system, a Zapier/Make template, a small AI-powered widget. Price them, get small wins, stack confidence.\n\n4) Build once, sell many: publish on places like Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, maybe niche directories. Use tools like Ahrefs, SparkToro, and Pulse alongside Reddit’s own search to see what problems people keep ranting about.\n\nThe main thing: every hour should either pay today or build an asset that can earn without you later.",

      "text": "SaaS CAC comparison: $487 paid ads vs $14 organic after building backlink foundation (18-month data)\n\nB2B SaaS founder tracking customer acquisition economics across channels for 18 months. Started with standard paid acquisition playbook but CAC didn't work at our $95/month pricing. Built organic foundation alongside paid and now have 34x better unit economics. Sharing complete financial breakdown with month-by-month progression.​\n\nBusiness context is project management SaaS at $95/month serving small teams. Launched using typical playbook of Google and LinkedIn ads for immediate traction. After 5 months realized $487 CAC was unsustainable math with 11-month average customer lifetime. Started investing in organic to fix economics while continuing paid for revenue.​\n\nMonths 1-5 was paid-only acquisition spending $24,300 acquiring 50 customers. Blended CAC was $486 per customer. At $95/month pricing that's 5.1-month payback period. With 11-month average LTV generating $1045 lifetime value we were making $559 profit per customer. Workable but not scalable since 53% of revenue went to acquisition costs.​\n\nMonth 6 started organic foundation while maintaining paid spend. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to establish domain authority through 200+ directory placements. Published 2 blog posts weekly targeting buyer-intent keywords like \"project management for X\" and \"tool A vs tool B\" comparisons. Created integration guides and use case content. Domain authority jumped from 0 to 14 first month giving foundation for content to rank.​\n\nMonths 6-12 showed organic momentum building. Domain authority reached 26 by month 12. Started ranking for 44 keywords with 18 in top 20 positions. Getting 940 monthly organic visitors by month 12. First organic trial signups appeared month 8. By month 12 organic delivered 12 customers monthly while paid continued at 8-10 monthly.​\n\nMonths 13-18 showed organic scaling past paid channel. Traffic reached 1880 monthly visitors. Ranking for 73 keywords with 31 in top 10 positions. Delivering 28-32 organic customers monthly versus 8-10 from paid ads. These organic customers showed better retention with 14-month average LTV versus 11-month for paid suggesting stronger product-market fit from organic channel.​\n\nThe CAC comparison after 18 months tells complete story. Paid channel: $68,400 spent acquiring 140 customers equals $488 CAC. Organic channel: $2,340 invested in directories, tools, hosting acquiring 168 customers equals $13.93 CAC. Organic is 35x more efficient than paid advertising. This efficiency gap is what makes SaaS businesses sustainable long-term.​\n\nThe unit economics comparison shows dramatic difference. Paid customers: $488 CAC, 11-month LTV, $1045 lifetime value equals $557 profit per customer with 47% profit margin. Organic customers: $14 CAC, 14-month LTV, $1330 lifetime value equals $1316 profit per customer with 99% profit margin. Organic delivers 2.4x more profit per customer with nearly perfect margins.​\n\nWhat worked for SaaS economics was targeting buyer-intent keywords not vanity traffic focusing on \"how to\" and comparison content, optimizing conversion aggressively since organic visitors were qualified prospects, building email nurture sequences for prospects not ready to buy immediately, asking customers how they found us to understand attribution, tracking cohort retention showing organic customers stay 27% longer, and being patient through months 6-10 when organic investment wasn't yet paying off.​\n\nInvestment breakdown over 18 months was GetMoreBacklinks directory service $127 one-time, Ahrefs $99/month for 5 months then switched to free tools, hosting $18/month, email tool $24/month, content tools $35/month. Total $2,340 versus $68,400 on paid ads. The 29x cost difference creates completely different business economics enabling faster growth without external funding.​ \n\nFor other SaaS companies the strategic lesson is start organic alongside paid from day one not sequentially. Use paid for immediate revenue and learning while organic builds. By month 10-12 organic should become primary acquisition engine with paid as supplementary channel for specific campaigns. The economics simply make more sense for sustainable growth without burning cash.​\n\nThe mistake we made was waiting until month 6 to start organic. If started day one we'd have reached current performance by month 11 instead of month 18. That 7-month delay cost us approximately 85 customers we could've acquired organically at vastly better economics. Start building your backlink foundation today even if product isn't perfect yet.\n",

      "text": "I wanted to share a product I’ve been building over the past few months and get feedback from people who’ve worked on or launched SaaS products.\n\nI built a mobile app called TasteBot for iOS & Android. It started as a problem I personally had, but one I felt likely applied to a broader audience. I like to cook and meal prep, but I have a lot of constraints based on fitness goals (high protein, low calorie), food sensitivities (gluten), and lifestyle (limited time). Because of that, most recipes I came across were effectively unusable.\n\nI’ve also followed several diets in the past (low FODMAP, paleo, vegan) while dealing with health issues, and ran into the exact same problem each time.\n\nSo I built a product that:\n\n* Generates recipes based on a user’s preferences (diet, allergies, cooking style, fitness goals)\n* Lets users iterate on a recipe instead of starting from scratch (“same thing but lower calorie”, “swap dairy”, etc.)\n* Shows nutritional info and automatically adjusts it based on user-entered servings (useful for people tracking calories and macros)\n* Includes a photo-to-recipe feature that generates recipes from food photos while still respecting preferences\n* Creates shareable recipe links, which can also be used to import recipes into meal-tracking apps  \n\n**Tech stack (for anyone interested):**\n\n* React Native + Expo\n* Supabase (auth, data)\n* OpenAI (recipe generation + image analysis)\n* FLUX.1 \\[schnell\\] fp8 (image generation)\n* RevenueCat (subscriptions)\n* AdMob (free tier)  \n\nAt this stage, my main goal is getting more real users so I can better understand usage patterns, retention, and where the product actually delivers the most value.\n\nA few questions for people here:\n\n* From a SaaS perspective, what would you focus on next: deeper feature development or marketing?\n* Are there any features you’d prioritize or cut based on what I described?\n* For those who’ve launched consumer SaaS, what channels worked best for acquiring the first few hundred users?  \n\nIf it sounds interesting, the app is called TasteBot on iOS & Android.  \nI’d genuinely appreciate any feedback, especially critical/product-focused feedback.\n\n",

Maybe some basic analytics on which constraint combinations people use most?
