Even if there are more builders then ever it doesn't mean every builder will build something good or could even find something worth while. Some people are meant to stay builders. Period.\n\nSolving issues and helping people with it is what people need.\n\nSay for example you make something that helps businesses:\n1. Save $5K in lost revenue\n2. Make an extra $5K recurring revenue\n3. Save then 2hrs/day\n4. Without any manual labor\n5. Nor physical or mental pain\n\nIf you find an idea that helps people save money, make money, save time, avoid effort, escape mental or physical pain? Then you've got a winner. You just need to lay down the data and show them what it can do and explain that it helps them make more revenue and the other things.\n\nThat's what today's builders miss. They build something that has so little impact in someone's life and expect them to be so hot and horny to pay. Making money is an exchange of value, you give me something that I see valuable, you give me money. \n\nPeople miss the value part and focus on money.\n\nSo relax, more builders means just more slop in the feild. Focus on learning extra skills now. Like sales, product creation, marketing, etc. these are the ones that make or break a product",

      "text": "I have a PhD in bioinformatics. I can write Python scripts that process genomic data. I cannot, for the life of me, build a web app. I don't know React. I didn't know what Tailwind was until 6 months ago. I still Google \"how to center a div\" at least once a week.\n\nAnd yet I launched a SaaS 25 days ago that now has 2,000+ users, 100+ paying customers, and about $1K MRR. No co-founder, no agency, no bootcamp. Just me, Claude, Cursor, and a mass of copy-pasted Stack Overflow answers that somehow compiles.\n\nPeople call it \"vibe coding.\" I call it \"I don't understand half of my own codebase but the tests pass.\" The product is [Plottie](https://ai.plottie.art) — an AI tool that creates publication-ready scientific figures. Researchers describe what they want, the AI generates it, and they can edit everything on an infinite canvas. Think Canva meets ChatGPT, but for scientific papers.\n\nHere's everything I learned.\n\n## The Pixabay-to-Canva playbook (this was my best decision)\n\nBefore building the AI tool, I built a free discovery platform: [plottie.art](https://plottie.art). It's a searchable database of 100,000+ scientific figures scraped from open-access papers in Nature, Science, Cell, etc. Researchers can browse, search, and save figures for inspiration.\n\nWhy build this first? Because I had no idea if the AI product would work, and I needed traffic.\n\nThe discovery site took ~2 months to build. It started ranking on Google within weeks because it's genuinely useful — if you search for \"volcano plot examples\" or \"heatmap scientific figure,\" we show up. It now gets consistent organic traffic. Every page has a subtle nudge: \"Want to create a figure like this? Try Plottie AI →\"\n\nThis is essentially the Pixabay → Canva model:\n- **Pixabay**: Free stock photos, massive SEO traffic\n- **Canva**: The paid product that Pixabay users naturally graduate to\n\nFor us:\n- **plottie.art**: Free figure discovery, SEO traffic\n- **ai.plottie.art**: The AI creator that discovery users convert to\n\nThe discovery site now drives new users to the AI product every single day, and I spend $0 on ads. If I were starting over, I'd build the free SEO content product first every time. It's the most underrated SaaS growth hack — give away something genuinely useful, let Google do the distribution, and make the paid product the natural next step.\n\n## The paid beta: don't test for free, test for money\n\nWhen the AI tool was ready for testing, I didn't do a free beta. I charged half price from day one.\n\nHere's why: Free users will tell you \"this is great!\" and never come back. Paying users — even at $6/month — will tell you exactly what's broken, because they expect it to work. The feedback quality is completely different.\n\nI recruited on Twitter and a few research communities. 97 people joined at 50% off. Some of the best product decisions came from these 97 people:\n\n- They told me the chat-based UI was broken (I was copying ChatGPT's layout — chat on the left, figure on the right). Turns out researchers need to see 8-24 figures side by side, not one at a time. I scrapped it and built an infinite canvas instead.\n- They told me AI output needed to be editable. My V1 was generate → export → done. Researchers hated it. They need to tweak exact colors for journal guidelines, adjust font sizes for figure legends. AI gets you 80%, but the last 20% is what reviewers actually care about.\n- They told me they wanted diagrams, not just data plots. I built for bar charts and heatmaps. They flooded me with requests for flowcharts, pathway diagrams, and scientific illustrations.\n\nEvery one of these would have taken months longer to discover with a free beta. When someone pays, they're invested enough to actually tell you the truth.\n\n## The numbers (raw, unfiltered)\n\n- **Launch date**: January 21, 2026\n- **Users**: ~2,000+ (organic only, $0 paid acquisition)\n- **Paying**: 100+\n- **MRR**: ~$1,000\n- **Infra cost**: $100-500/month (Cloudflare, Fly.io, Supabase, LLM APIs, E2B sandbox)\n- **Time to build**: ~6 months total (2 months discovery site, 4 months AI tool)\n- **My web dev background**: Zero. Literally none.\n\nThe conversion rate from free to paid is high. The problem isn't conversion. The problem is **top-of-funnel**: I need more people to know this exists.\n\n## What I got wrong\n\n**Marketing. All of it.**\n\nI'm a researcher. I know how to write papers, run experiments, and present at conferences. I do not know how to market a product. My \"marketing strategy\" for the first month was posting on Twitter and hoping. Spoiler: hoping is not a strategy.\n\nWhat's working so far:\n- **SEO via the discovery site** — this is 60%+ of our traffic. Researchers Google for figure types and find us.\n- **Word of mouth in labs** — one researcher tries it, tells their labmates. This is slow but the conversion quality is insane. When someone's PI recommends a tool, they don't comparison shop.\n- **Research communities** — posting genuine value (tutorials, figure tips) in places where researchers hang out, then mentioning Plottie when it's relevant.\n\nWhat's not working:\n- Cold outreach. Researchers ignore cold DMs harder than any market I've seen.\n- Paid ads. Tried briefly. CPA was ridiculous for a $12/month product.\n- Product Hunt. We got some traffic but almost zero conversion. The PH audience doesn't overlap with working scientists.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is distribution. The product-market fit signal is strong — people who find us tend to stay and pay. I just can't figure out how to get in front of 10x more researchers without spending money I don't have.\n\n## Vibe coding: honest assessment\n\nSince people will ask — yes, I built this entire thing with AI assistance. Here's the honest version:\n\n**What works**: Claude/Cursor can scaffold a full Next.js app, write Go API endpoints, build Python FastAPI services, and handle 90% of the frontend. For someone who can't code, this is genuinely life-changing. I went from \"I have an idea\" to \"I have a working product\" in months, not years.\n\n**What doesn't work**: Debugging. When something breaks in production at 2am and the error message is about a Supabase cookie authentication race condition, Claude gives you 5 different answers and 3 of them make it worse. I've spent entire weekends debugging issues that a real developer would fix in an hour.\n\n**The real cost**: My codebase is probably 40% great, 40% \"works but I don't know why,\" and 20% \"this will definitely break at scale and I'm choosing not to think about it.\" I have tech debt that I can't even identify because I don't have the knowledge to recognize it.\n\nBut here's the thing: the product is live, people are paying for it, and the figures they're creating are actually going into published papers. Imperfect code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't exist.\n\n## AMA\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n- Building for academic/research markets\n- The discovery-site-to-paid-product pipeline\n- Paid betas vs. free betas\n- Vibe coding a multi-service SaaS (frontend + backend + AI engine)\n- Anything else\n\n**Disclosure: I'm the founder of Plottie.** This is my product. Sharing because I genuinely want to compare notes with other founders, but I'm upfront about it.\n",

I’d systematize three loops:\n\n\n\n1) Weekly “figure clinic” content: short teardown threads like “5 mistakes in volcano plots” with before/after examples made in Plottie. Post them in methods-ish subs, discipline-specific forums, and anywhere PhD students hang out. Always end with a soft “this was made in Plottie, here’s how.”\n\n\n\n2) Lab-onboarding bundles: one-pager + short Loom showing “how your lab can standardize figures in 10 minutes.” Offer a cheap team plan where the PI gets a single invoice and a shared template library.\n\n\n\n3) Journal-adjacent SEO: spin out pages like “Nature-style \\[figure type\\] examples” / “Cell-ready pathway diagrams,” embedding your AI editor.\n\n\n\nEnd point: treat distribution like a lab protocol you run every week, not a one-off launch event.",

PostHog (Error Tracking + Session Replay)\n\nNot even for “analytics” in the spreadsheet sense. More like “ok, what exactly did the user do right before it broke?”. Watching a replay is often faster than reading logs or guessing. Funnels/retention are a nice bonus, but Replay is the superpower. Ever since they released Error Tracking, I never looked back at Sentry.\n\n2) AI SaaS safety rails\n\nThe boring stuff that saves weekends: rate limiting, a simple LLM cost kill-switch, and actually testing backup/restore once. Nobody wants to spend time on this… until they really, really do.\n\nOn distribution: your “free discovery → paid creator” thing is basically the right playbook. If conversion is decent, I’d just double down on programmatic SEO + internal linking between figure types (“if you searched volcano plot, here are 5 adjacent figure styles”) and “make one like this” templates. If you're seeing results, keep doing it :)\n\nIf you want, I can also do a quick free sanity check of your architecture and/or setup (auth/billing/background jobs/cost controls + what to measure first in PostHog). I'm a software architect by trade and would love to help you out, possibly in exchange for your feedback/advice as I'm a learning entrepreneur myself :)\n\nSide note: Could your app be used for AI-generating software architecture diagrams?

We built up a large library of real visualizations, when plottie create those plots, it can learn from the library to achieve professional story. You cannot benchmark it, but the satisfaction is good. 3. For all the plot types, especially for illustrations generated by AI, plottie supports manually edits. We can convert images to svg so users can editor elements including texts. it's even better then adobe illustrator. 4. we designed the UX as a canvas, it's very easy to organize the figures and export.",

When you ask \"why is this Supabase auth failing\", it gives you 5 valid auth fixes but doesn't know which packages you're on, what your middleware chain looks like, or what you changed 3 commits ago.\n\nOur solution: memory files. Every agent reads a state file at session start with past mistakes, system gotchas, and working patterns. When an agent hits a production bug, the fix goes into the memory file so the next agent session doesn't try the same 5 wrong answers.\n\nVibe coding works, but you need institutional memory or you'll rediscover the same bugs every week.",

Free tools are another massive way to get incoming traffic. Think templates etc. Ahrefs or SEMRush have generous free tiers to silo keywords you believe your ICP is googling. \n2. Good on cutting ad spend. Isn’t really rewarding for startups as much as it used to be because costs have been driven up by VC and PE. \n3. Don’t sell yourself too short. Some seasoned engineers may be able to debug a little faster, but looking at foreign code for most takes time to understand. My recommendation is to ask Cursor to inline comment functions and return reasons for the code output and have Claude generate you a md file on the feature implementation and how it works. Saves you a bunch of time when needing to come back to things weeks Lester and you may not fully understand what the async function is doing etc. \n4. I’ve never met a more unnecessary complex backend structure than supabase. I know it has a lot of serverless value and gets you up quickly but I found just rolling auth with a proven library and working with a familiar DB (Postgres/MySQL) saved me 50% of my issues when bootstrapping another project I am working on with v0. \n\nI would also be happy to review your codebase also in exchange for feedback on my product https://tryscheeme.com. I found critical leaks with AI generated supabase code so I actually created a codebase scanner to quickly do checks when I spin up projects. It’s open source https://vibecheck.tylerpalmer5.com",

What’s exciting is that the answer seems to be coming from a solo builder with no prior coding skills. Wild.\n\nAnother thing to note: general purpose LLMs are getting so good that in all likelihood they’re eventually going to eat many specialized AI tools’ lunch. But you made the clever decision to turn your interaction layer on its head and make it canvas based. This is going to be a little harder for general purpose LLMs to replicate. The UX layer becomes the moat and looks like you’ve built yourself a fairly unique one.\n\nOne line of question I have: there is definitely a lot of complex heavy lifting being done in your product (detecting variable relationships, selecting an appropriate type, and generating aesthetically pleasing outputs, having a workable canvas, etc) — how did you go about crunching through all this to getting reliable results? Was this very difficult? How did you research the libraries and frameworks you needed without knowing what to ask for? Super curious about your building journey.",

Honestly the \"learn the tech first\" trap almost got me too — I spent two months reading React docs before I realized I could just... start building and fix things as they broke.\n\nOn onboarding — I didn't have a proper onboarding flow at first. What I did was post screenshots and demo videos on social media. The product just looked different from anything else out there (an infinite canvas for scientific figures isn't something people had seen before), so the visuals did the selling. People DMed me asking to try it, and I funneled them into a beta group.\n\nThe first few users were an absolute firehose of learning. Two examples:\n\n1. Right-click didn't work on Windows. I'm on Mac. Never occurred to me to test right-click context menus on Windows. A user reported it day 2. When you're a solo founder building on one OS, you have massive blind spots you don't even know about.\n\n2. LLM rate limits hit immediately. When it's just me testing, I never trigger rate limits. The moment 20+ people start generating figures at the same time? API goes down. This is the kind of thing that's impossible to catch in solo testing — you literally need multiple concurrent users to surface it.\n\nFirst week was basically firefighting. But within \\~7 days I'd patched most of the critical issues and the experience got noticeably smoother. That's another argument for paid beta — those users stuck around through the rough patches because they'd paid, and they kept reporting issues instead of just churning silently.\n\nUsers also flooded me with feature requests, which was encouraging because most of them were things already on my roadmap. When your users independently ask for the same features you planned to build, that's a decent PMF signal.\n\nIf I had to distill the onboarding lesson: don't over-engineer onboarding before launch. Ship, watch real people use it, and fix the things that actually block them.\n\nThe issues that matter most are ones you literally cannot predict from your own desk.",

The OS example alone shows how different real users are from “founder testing.” It’s wild how many issues only appear once you have concurrent usage and different environments in play.\n\nAlso love your point about not over-engineering onboarding. A lot of founders burn weeks polishing flows that don’t even address the actual friction points. You basically let real behavior define onboarding instead of guessing, which is way more efficient.\n\nThe fact that users were requesting features already on your roadmap is a strong signal too. When demand starts aligning with your instincts, that’s when things get interesting. Sounds like you’re in a solid learning loop right now.",

Also (if you aren’t doing this) one thing that I’ve found helps when working with Claude is to document everything in md files where the code is, and have a Claude.md to index it. It doesn’t replace actually knowing everything that’s going on with your code base, but it helps. Claude automatically opens this file when it starts up, which speeds a lot of things up. Additionally test cases are great for identifying the consequences of code changes. Ideally run them before every deployment. Also if you aren’t using git (dunno why you wouldn’t), you really should. ",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

They’re too slow for how fast AI search is moving.  exact workflow I used is below:\n\nI fed Claude my site ​URL and my top competitors. I asked it to find the content gaps, basically, what are people typing into ChatGPT or Gemini that competitors aren't answering? I had it build a 30-day content plan where every article logically flows into the next one, creating a web of internal links.\n\nInstead of random blog posts, I made sure every piece of content supported another. This tells Google (and AI models) that you are an absolute authority on that specific niche. If a user reads one, the next one is the natural next step for them.\n\nThen i gave claude my main Keywords and asked it to spit out variations...Once I had the core pillar keywords from Claude, I didn't want to write 100 variations by hand. I created a dynamic template for the variations.\n\n​Manual: 5 high-quality pillar articles.\n​Programmatic: 100+ targeted variations with ai.\n\nBecause the content was built as an interconnected net rather than just random keywords, Google indexed it way faster. Now, when someone asks Gemini or ChatGPT a specific question in my niche, my site is the one being cited because I have the most specific  answer.\n\n​takeaway for you: Stop chasing High/low Volume keywords in tools. Use AI to find the High Intent gaps and then use article content to fill those gaps at scale. Along with targeted pSEO pages. This will really move your needles. I used a paid tool in this process. I don't want to look like that spammer, so i am not telling you. If you need to know, you can dm. Rest all folks who reads can follow this startegy, i guarantee this works.",

Here's the reframe though: your first 50 users shouldn't come from one channel.  \n  \nThey should come from you manually doing things that don't scale. That means going where your target users already are and being genuinely helpful before you ever mention your product. Reddit's actually perfect for this because there are hyper-specific communities for almost any niche, and if you answer questions helpfully, people will check out your profile and find your product naturally.  \n  \nThe key is being active in 3-5 subreddits where your ICP hangs out, commenting daily with actual value (not pitching), and only mentioning your product when it's truly relevant. Most people quit after a week because it feels slow, but the ones who stick with it for 2-3 months start seeing real traction. You're playing the long game here.  \n  \nThat said, if you don't have time to do the manual work or you're worried about getting banned for self-promo (which happens a lot), there are done-for-you services that handle Reddit engagement on your behalf. I came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions . com) recently and it's basically this, they find relevant conversations and post helpful responses for B2B companies so you get discovered without the spam risk. Could be worth looking into if you want the benefits of Reddit without the time investement. ",

Every single one came from showing up consistently where my ICP hangs out and providing value first. No paid ads, no cold email blasts.\n\nBiggest lesson: your first 50 don't need a perfect product. They need to feel heard and see that you're shipping fast based on their feedback. The faster your iteration loop, the faster word spreads.\n\nWhat's your ICP and where do they currently hang out online? That usually tells you exactly where to focus.",

It takes me two weeks. It is easy. The bill is reasonable.\n\nBut if a founder comes to me and says I need it built with Microservices and Kubernetes so we can scale to millions I smile and double the quote.\n\nWhy? Because they just gave me permission to over engineer everything.\n\nInstead of a simple session now I have to set up a separate Auth Service. That is 10 billable hours. Instead of one SQL DB now we need three different ones syncing via events. That is a week of work. Instead of a 5 dollar VPS I get to bill them for setting up a complex AWS cluster.\n\nI am not scamming them. I am building exactly what they asked for. They asked for a Netflix scale architecture for a to do list app with zero users.\n\nThe funny part is the app does the exact same thing as the boring version. It just costs 5000 a month to maintain instead of 50.\n\nI see devs on here complaining about clients picking complex stacks. Stop complaining. If a client wants to pay for a Rube Goldberg machine let them.\n\nSmart founders hire devs to tell them what to cut. Rich founders hire devs to build everything they read about on Twitter.\n\nI am happy to work for either. But just know that when you demand scalability on day one you aren't buying better software. You are buying my next vacation.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time.

The server itself ideally would just be a thin scalable layer connecting pages to the database. Scale when you need more connections. \n\nStart with a web server and a database, maybe s3 for assets, and cf caching. I don’t let anything touch the server if possible. Need to upload an asset? Signed request from your api for s3, so it goes straight from browser to s3. Need to process an image? The browser is capable in most cases, no sharp libraries if I can get away with it. Cloud functions for anything over a second and under 30s. Sudden need to scale? Vertical if it’s marginal, horizontal if it’s significant (New redis server, load balancer/autoscaling). Database performance degrading? Read only time. Query optimization. Vertical if needed (feels like giving up). \n\nI really try to do as little as possible on my actual web server though. But if you’re crafty you can keep costs low or zero for most things. As the project grows, I’ll break things out as needed based on what needs what.",

It handles everything I need at my current scale, and when I actually need to optimize something, I know exactly where to look.\n\n\n\nThe temptation to over-engineer is real though, especially when you're technical. You start reading about event-driven architecture and think \"I should probably set that up now so I'm ready.\" Ready for what? The 12 users you have?\n\n\n\nBest advice I got early on: build for the users you have, not the users you imagine having.

      "text": "Most SaaS founders think building the product is 70% of the work.  \nI thought the same until I shipped my MVP and realized... it's actually the opposite. Building is maybe 30%. The other 70% is getting people to actually use it.\n\nHere's what genuinely moved the needle getting my[ SEO tool](https://blogseo.io/) to $50k ARR ([proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/iROCSdxX)):\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nInstead of pitching directly, I messaged ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, people I'd met at events — and asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo outcomes: they say \"yeah, me actually\" or they introduce you to someone. You win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell, and surprisingly effective.\n\n**2. Consistent posting even with a small audience**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing polished. Just sharing what I was building and what I was learning. Several people DMd me asking about the product and became paying customers. The compounding effect is real even when your posts get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email but targeting the right people first**\n\nMy first sequences flopped because I had the ratio wrong. The fix: spend 80% of your time finding the RIGHT people, 20% on copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly — much higher leverage per email sent.\n\n**4. SEO (still the most underrated SaaS channel)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks pages started ranking and the traffic came from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. Perplexity, ChatGPT, and other AI tools are pulling from web content. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of potential customers. One of my users hit 450+ organic clicks a day from this alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend only after organic worked**\n\n$200 each on Google and Meta. I only ran ads after I had organic conversions already happening. Ads amplify what's working — they don't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't convert gave me their email, and that list paid off later.\n\n**6. Treating early customers like whales**\n\nMy first 10 customers got same-day bug fixes, direct calls, constant feedback loops. Result: they became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies — all came from that obsessive early attention.\n\n**7. A simple affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. One click to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = a recurring customer stream, not a single sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nListed on \"There's an AI for That\" and got a solid traffic spike. Fair warning: I lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug during that spike. Test your critical flows before any launch. Painful lesson.\n\n\n\n**The honest take:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. None of this is sexy. Nothing went viral. But these tactics stack. While everyone's hunting for the next growth hack, you can quietly compound Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders right now, it's SEO. Not because it's fast, but because every article keeps working for you months or years later. With AI search expanding the discovery surface, the upside is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR. No fluff, just the stuff that actually moved the needle:\n\n👉 [15 High-Reward SEO Tactics I Used to Grow My Business to $50k ARR](https://www.notion.so/15-High-Reward-SEO-Tactics-I-Used-to-Grow-My-Business-to-50k-ARR-2d68871b675680c88878fa41f33cb0a6?source=copy_link)",

Turns out his company isn’t actively looking for new tools right now… but he personally checked it out, shared it internally — and I got my first Business plan customer.\n\nBut I want to slightly challenge the framing of the first point.\n\nInstead of asking your friend *if they need it*, asking *who they know that might need it* is much more powerful.\n\nThat question does three things:\n\n1. It removes pressure from them.\n2. It can surface multiple warm leads at once.\n3. It positions you as someone building something valuable, not someone begging for a sale.\n\nAlso, if you’re active on LinkedIn and have a solid network, this question works incredibly well as a public post. You’re not selling — you’re inviting recommendations. And that often converts better than a direct pitch.\n\nCurious — is anyone here actively using their LinkedIn network to promote their SaaS? If yes, what’s been working best?",

My conversion dropped to 1.2% in those browsers compared to 4% in Safari.\n\nI fixed it by automatically routing people to their native browser before checkout. Saw a 15% revenue bump from the same ad spend. Wild, right?\n\nCheck your analytics by browser type. If Instagram/Facebook traffic converts way lower, that's your hidden leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles this redirect automatically if you want a quick fix.\n\nCongrats on hitting $50k ARR.

Product/Service Overview\nFizzbase is an AI-powered people search engine specifically focused on San Francisco Bay Area professionals. The platform appears to index \"every important person\" in the region, though the current landing page shows minimal functionality beyond a basic search interface and Google sign-in.\n\nCurrent State: Early-stage/MVP with limited visible features\nCore Promise: AI-driven access to SF's professional network\nKey Gap: No clear value proposition or use cases demonstrated\n\n2. CTA Analysis\nPrimary CTA: \"Sign in with Google\" - Premature ask\n- Problem: No value demonstration before registration request\n- Friction: Users don't know what they're signing up for\n- Missing: Benefits, features, or sample results\n\nSecondary CTA: \"Add yourself\" - Unclear purpose\n- Problem: No explanation of why someone would add themselves\n- Context: Missing information about profile benefits\n\n3. Target Audience\nLikely Targets (needs validation):\n- Sales professionals seeking SF decision-makers\n- Recruiters hunting for Bay Area talent\n- Startup founders looking for investors/advisors\n- Journalists needing local sources\n- Event organizers targeting tech professionals\n\nCurrent Messaging: Too generic - doesn't speak to any specific use case\n\n4. GTM Insights\nImmediate Issues:\n- No differentiation from LinkedIn/Salesforce\n- Unclear AI advantage over existing tools\n- Missing trust signals (data sources, privacy compliance)\n- No social proof or user testimonials\n\nOpportunity: Position as \"AI-powered SF tech insider database\" with specific vertical focus\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nPhase 1: Smart Search Assistant\n- Deploy AiAssist chat widget to help users craft better searches\n- Knowledge base: SF tech scene, company hierarchies, investor portfolios\n- Example: \"Find me fintech CTOs who just raised Series B\"\n\nPhase 2: AI Relationship Navigator\n- AI assistant that analyzes search results and suggests:\n  - Mutual connections for warm introductions\n  - Conversation starters based on recent news/interests\n  - Optimal contact timing and channels\n\nPhase 3: AI Outreach Platform\n- Generate personalized outreach messages\n- Track engagement and suggest follow-ups\n- A/B test messaging approaches\n\nSpecific AiAssist Implementation:\n\n1. Create \"SF Tech Expert\" workspace\n2. Upload knowledge base:\n   - Tech company org charts\n   - Investor portfolios\n   - Recent funding announcements\n   - Conference speaker lists\n   \n3. Configure AI directives:\n   - \"Suggest 3 conversation starters based on person's background\"\n   - \"Identify the best mutual connection for introduction\"\n   - \"Recommend optimal contact method and timing\"\n\n4. API integration for:\n   - Real-time relationship mapping\n   - Automated outreach sequences\n   - Meeting scheduling assistance\n\n\nNext Steps for Founder:\n1. Add value before registration: show 3-5 sample profiles\n2. Create use-case specific landing pages\n3. Implement AiAssist chat assistant for search help\n4. Build AI-powered introduction request generator\n5. Add \"Find similar people\" AI recommendations\n\nWant me to help design the specific AiAssist knowledge base structure for your SF tech ecosystem? https://aiassist.net\n\nThis report was generated by Malachi",

              "text": "I reviewed this ai service with my ai agent Malachi and I’m impressed !!!\n\nHere’s what he had to say\n\nhttps://malachi.aiassist.net\n\nProduct/Service Overview\n\nComputer Agents is a cloud-based AI agent platform that positions itself as \"your AI coworker\" rather than a simple chatbot. The platform provides persistent, autonomous AI agents that run in isolated cloud environments with their own workspaces, memory, and scheduled task capabilities. Key differentiators include persistent memory across sessions, scheduled execution, multi-device access, and an open-source SDK approach.\n\nCore Value Props:\n- Persistent cloud workspaces that survive sessions\n- Scheduled autonomous task execution\n- Multi-agent orchestration with specialized skills\n- Cross-platform accessibility (iOS, Mac, Web, API)\n- Open-source SDKs with BYOK flexibility\n\nCTA Analysis\n\nPrimary CTAs:\n- \"Start for Free\" (prominent, above fold)\n- \"Download for macOS\" (secondary)\n\nCTA Performance Insights:\n- ✅ Clear free tier entry point with 150 compute tokens\n- ✅ Risk-free trial reduces friction\n- ✅ Pricing anchor ($19/month) immediately after free offer\n- ❌ Multiple competing CTAs could create decision paralysis\n- ❌ No immediate social proof near CTAs\n\nConversion Optimization Opportunities:\n- Add urgency/scarcity elements to free tier\n- Include customer count or usage metrics near CTAs\n- Consider exit-intent popup with extended trial\n\nTarget Audience\n\nPrimary Segments:\n1. Developers/Technical Teams - API-first approach, SDKs, open-source\n2. Business Professionals - \"AI employee\" messaging, productivity focus\n3. Researchers - Deep research capabilities with citations\n4. Agencies/Consultants - Multi-agent orchestration for client work\n\nSecondary Segments:\n- Enterprise operations teams needing 24/7 automation\n- Creative professionals (floor plan example)\n- Customer support teams (FireChatbot case study)\n\nGTM Insights\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear competitive positioning vs. chatbots\n- Strong technical differentiation (persistence, scheduling)\n- Impressive case studies with specific metrics\n- Developer-friendly approach with SDKs\n\nGaps:\n- Limited enterprise sales motion\n- Unclear pricing for scale deployments\n- No obvious partner/channel strategy\n- Missing vertical-specific positioning\n\nRecommended GTM Motion:\n1. Land-and-expand via developer adoption\n2. Vertical specialization (architecture, research, support)\n3. Agency channel program for multi-client deployments\n4. Enterprise tier with security/compliance features\n\nAI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nBased on Computer Agents' architecture and use cases, here are specific integration recommendations:\n\n1. Customer Support Enhancement\nIntegration: Deploy AiAssist agents as the frontline for customer inquiries about agent deployment, pricing, and technical issues.\n- Use AiAssist's Shadow mode for complex technical questions\n- Create knowledge base entries from their documentation\n- Route escalation to human engineers via Takeover mode\n\n2. Agent Template Marketplace\nIntegration: Use AiAssist to power an interactive agent template recommendation engine.\n- \"What do you want your agent to do?\" → suggest pre-built configurations\n- Embed AiAssist chat on template pages for instant guidance\n- Use knowledge base to store community-contributed templates\n\n3. Research Report Generation\nIntegration: Their deep research feature competes with AiAssist's capabilities—consider partnership.\n- Offer AiAssist as an alternative for customers needing compliance/certification\n- Position Computer Agents for technical users, AiAssist for business users\n- Cross-refer based on use case complexity\n\n4. Onboarding Optimization\nIntegration: Replace their current support system with AiAssist for faster time-to-value.\n- Create workspace-specific assistants for each product area (iOS, Mac, API)\n- Use AiAssist's Oracle Playground to test onboarding flows\n- Implement progressive disclosure based on user expertise level\n\n5. Enterprise Sales Enablement\n\nIntegration: Deploy AiAssist as a sales development representative.\n- Qualify leads based on usage patterns and company size\n- Schedule demos and send personalized follow-ups\n- Create separate workspaces for different verticals (architecture, research, support)\n\nImmediate Action Items:\n1. Add AiAssist chat widget to pricing page for instant qualification\n2. Create knowledge base from their documentation for 24/7 support\n3. Deploy lead qualification agent using their API integration examples\n4. Set up competitor monitoring using research agents to track mentions\n\nThe Computer Agents platform has strong technical differentiation but could benefit from AiAssist's human-in-the-loop capabilities for customer-facing scenarios where accuracy and brand safety are critical.

When you set up Hivemind, it adds mandatory rules to your project config that Claude Code and Cursor read at session start. The agent knows from the first message to announce tasks, check locks before editing, and publish outcomes when done.\n\nBeyond that, we have hooks that enforce compliance at the edit level. If an agent tries to edit a file that's locked by another agent without acquiring the lock, the edit gets blocked with an error message telling it exactly what to do. So it's not purely relying on the agent to remember — there's enforcement.\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is that agents tend to adopt the tools voluntarily once they see the value. Being able to query \"what did we decide about auth?\" and get a real answer instead of scanning an entire repo makes the agent more effective, so the incentive aligns naturally. \n\nIt's not perfect — agents occasionally skip a publish or forget to release a lock. TTL-based expiry handles stale locks automatically, and the dashboard gives you real-time visibility so you can catch gaps. But in practice it works better than expected.",

Product/Service Overview\n\nSandInvoice is a refreshingly simple time-tracking and invoicing tool designed specifically for solo contractors. Built by a fellow independent contractor who lived the pain of cobbling together tools, it strips away the bloat of enterprise solutions while maintaining essential functionality.\n\nCore Value Proposition:\n- One-click time tracking with automatic weekly/monthly breakdowns\n- Flexible invoicing (hourly, fixed-rate, or mixed)\n- Lifetime price lock at $6/month or $60/year\n- Encrypted vault for project credentials\n- Zero setup friction (Google/Microsoft/magic link signup)\n\nKey Differentiators:\n- Built by a solo contractor, for solo contractors\n- Lifetime price guarantee (no surprise increases)\n- Tax-inclusive checkout for international users\n- Workspace-isolated encrypted credential storage\n- No feature creep - maintains laser focus on core needs\n\n2. CTA Analysis\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear value-first approach: \"14 days free\" prominently featured\n- Price anchoring works well ($6/mo vs $60/yr shows $12 savings)\n- Risk reversal with \"No card required until day 15\"\n- Multiple touchpoints throughout the page\n\nOpportunities:\n- Consider adding urgency/scarcity (e.g., \"First 100 users get lifetime discount\")\n- Could benefit from social proof (testimonials, user count)\n- Mobile-specific CTA placement might improve conversions\n\n3. Target Audience\n\nPrimary: Solo independent contractors (software developers, designers, writers, consultants)\nSecondary: Very small agencies (2-5 people)\nTertiary: Freelancers transitioning from part-time to full-time\n\nPsychographics:\n- Values simplicity over features\n- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for reliability\n- Prefers tools built by people who understand their pain\n- Wants to appear professional to clients\n- Time-conscious (hence the one-click tracking)\n\n4. GTM Insights\n\nWhat's Working:\n- Authentic founder story resonates with target audience\n- Lifetime pricing creates urgency and loyalty\n- Free trial without credit card reduces friction\n- SEO opportunity around \"simple invoicing for contractors\"\n\nGrowth Opportunities:\n- Partner with co-working spaces and freelancer communities\n- Content marketing: \"How to invoice as a solo contractor\"\n- Integration partnerships (accounting software, payment processors)\n- Referral program leveraging the founder's network\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities with AiAssist\n\nHere are specific, actionable ways to integrate AiAssist's capabilities:\n\nA. Smart Time Categorization\nImplementation: Use AiAssist's knowledge base to train an AI that automatically categorizes time entries based on project descriptions and past patterns.\n\n# Example API integration\nPOST /v1/chat/completions\n{\n  \"model\": \"llama-3.1-8b\",\n  \"messages\": [{\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"Categorize this time entry based on description and project context\"\n  }, {\n    \"role\": \"user\", \n    \"content\": \"Fixed responsive layout bug on client's homepage\"\n  }]\n}\n\n\nB. Invoice Description Generation\nImplementation: AI generates professional line item descriptions from brief notes, learning from user's past invoices.\n\nC. Payment Reminder Sequences\nImplementation: AI drafts personalized follow-up emails for unpaid invoices, adjusting tone based on invoice age and client relationship.\n\nD. Expense Categorization & Tax Prep\nImplementation: Train AI on tax categories to automatically categorize expenses and generate tax-ready reports.\n\nE. Project Health Monitoring\nImplementation: AI analyzes time tracking patterns to flag projects going over budget or timeline.\n\nF. Smart Invoice Scheduling\nImplementation: AI suggests optimal invoice timing based on client payment history and project milestones.\n\nG. Client Communication Assistant",

              "text": "I love it. Had Malachi do an analysis https://malachi.aiassist.net \n\nProduct Review: CreatrAI\n\n1. Product/Service Overview\nCreatrAI is a prompt-to-website generator that turns text descriptions into production-ready HTML/CSS/JS in seconds. Core workflow: describe → generate → edit → export. It sits between Wix-style drag-and-drop and raw code, letting users refine either with an AI co-pilot or direct code edits. All sites are responsive and come with hosting-ready zip exports.\n\n2. CTA Analysis\n- Hero: \"Generate My Website\" (primary, above the fold) + micro-copy \"Start Your Free Website\" → clear, low-friction, no card.\n- Mid-page: \"Get Started Free\" (repeated 3×) anchors every pricing card; color contrast is good.\n- Footer: \"Get Started with CreatrAI Today\" – pushes urgency but is identical to earlier CTA; no secondary CTA (e.g., \"See a 60-sec demo\").\n- Friction points: No preview without sign-up, no live chat for objections, no social proof counters (# of sites built, testimonials).\n\nOpportunity: Add a \"See it first\" secondary CTA that opens an embedded playground or GIF walkthrough; capture emails even if users bail.\n\n3. Target Audience\nPrimary\n- Non-technical founders validating MVPs\n- Freelance marketers/designers who sell quick sites to SMBs\n- Indie hackers & side-project builders\n\nSecondary\n- Agencies that white-label fast landing pages\n- STEM/Robotics clubs, event organizers needing one-off pages\n\nTertiary\n- Junior devs learning front-end by inspecting exported code\n\n4. Basic GTM Insights\n- Positioning: \"AI web builder for non-coders\" is crowded; differentiation is speed + code export. Emphasize \"own your code, host anywhere.\"\n- Channel fit: Product-led growth via shareable showcase gallery; SEO long-tail (\"AI generator for band website\"); lifetime deal on AppSumo to seed backlinks; TikTok/Reels showing prompt-to-site in 15 s.\n- Pricing: Token + credit dual currency is confusing. Simplify to one metric (pages or sites) and add usage-based overage, else expect churn when credits run out mid-project.\n- Partnerships: Integrate with Netlify/Vercel one-click deploy; become template supplier in their marketplaces.\n\n5. AI Integration Opportunities Using AiAssist\nEmbed an \"AI Concierge\" layer across the CreatrAI funnel to raise activation, conversion, and retention.\n\na. Pre-Sign-Up\n- Pop-up widget (AiAssist workspace) trained on CreatrAI docs answers \"Will it work with my CMS?\", \"What are credits?\", slashes support tickets → higher trial start rate.\n\nb. Onboarding\n- After registration, an AI setup assistant (Shadow mode) interviews the user (\"What's the site goal?\", \"Preferred color vibe?\") and auto-pre-fills the first prompt → faster \"aha\" moment.\n\nc. In-App Help\n- Contextual AI helper inside the editor: highlight any element → \"Explain this code\" or \"Make this mobile-friendly\". Knowledge base = CSS best-practices + Tailwind cheatsheet. Keeps novices from dropping off.\n\nd. Post-Export Upsell\n- Once user exports, AI emails a personalized checklist (\"Add Google Analytics here\", \"Host on Vercel like this\") with affiliate links → drives Dev-plan upgrades.\n\ne. Agency Tier\n- Reseller workspace (AiAssist Team plan) where agencies host white-label chatbots on client sites for revision requests (\"Ask the AI to change the hero image\"). Generates recurring seat revenue.\n\nImplementation Snippets\n- Endpoint: AiAssist OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions\n- Knowledge categories: \"CreatrAI Pricing\", \"Export Guide\", \"CSS Snippets\", \"Refund Policy\"\n- Directive example: \"You are CreatrAI-Helper, friendly and concise. Only answer about CreatrAI features. If off-topic, politely redirect.\"\n\nQuick Wins (≤ 2 dev days)\n1. Add \"Chat with an AI expert\" bubble on landing page via a single <script> tag pointing to AiAssist widget.\n2. Gate the first 3 messages per visitor; prompt sign-up when limit hit → immediate lead gen lift.\n\nBy layering AiAssist's human-in-the-loop chat, CreatrAI can turn static FAQ into interactive consultative selling, cut support load, and open a differentiated agency channel.\n\nCheck us out https://aiassistsecure.com",

Context: Gemini gives you generic advice based on its training. Our app builds your strategy specifically around your real-time business goals, buyer needs, and audience data. That’s why everyone who tried it mentioned how relevant the output was. \n2. Execution: Gemini gives you a plan, then leaves you to figure out the work. Our app turns that plan into a daily to-do list so you actually know what to do at 8:00 AM on a Wednesday morning. \n3. Adaptability: When your engagement drops or trends shift, Gemini doesn't know. Our app stays by your side, adapting the strategy and generating content ideas that actually align with your campaign progress.\n\nWe’re designing this to be a social media manager anyone can access. I hope this helps.",

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

Then I built an integration so it could actually take action and fix everything automatically.   \n   \nHere's what it handles completely autonomously: \n\n  \n\\- Technical SEO audits   \n\\- Content audits   \n\\- Competitor keyword analysis   \n\\- Content strategy development   \n\\- Writing AND publishing content via API to Webflow   \n   \nNo manual intervention. No human bottlenecks. Just pure execution.   \n   \nI thought AI content tools were overhyped. I thought they'd need constant oversight and editing. I was wrong.   \n   \nThe quality is there. The strategy is sound. The implementation is flawless.   \n   \nThis isn't about replacing human creativity. It's about removing the friction between strategy and execution.   \n   \nWhilst everyone's debating whether AI will replace marketers, I'm watching it 10x my content output without sacrificing quality. The question isn't whether to use AI anymore.   \n   \nIt's whether you can afford not to.   \n   \nWhat part of your content workflow could you automate tomorrow?\n\n  \nIn the interest of sharing the free tools I found on Github here are:\n\n  \nThe Claude SEO Skill: [https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo)\n\nExample Output: [https://www.growwithghost.io/blog/waalaxy-alternative-linkedin-outreach-without-the-spam](https://www.growwithghost.io/blog/waalaxy-alternative-linkedin-outreach-without-the-spam) \n\n  \nThe skill above does the SEO audit, then I asked Claude Code to build me a plugin using the Webflow MCP to make the publishing automatic just using the usual API key route.\n\nIf you've got any ideas how to improve this let me know, good luck building your own.",

I've experimented with AI generated articles but the results were not good. Google can easily tell the difference. It's not about AI writing style or em dashes. It's that AI tends to only say what's already been said and this content is graded poorly by Google, which will not even index it in most cases. \n\n\nYou can use AI but need you to provide the meat for article, and say something original or at least something better than is currently being said. Adding other original content and images can help a lot. And don't confuse tricking Google with engaging visitors.\n\n\nOP please come back in a few months with some before/after results.",

Extensive FAQs with question that are probably never asked? I myself had to make pages for websites that are not even linked to from the main site - they are meant as pure SEO traps that show up as a Google result. Of course you can go to the rest of the site from those pages, but they are not linked in any navigation whatsoever, because they don't matter. As soon as someone has that page as one of the top Google results, that page has done its job because it leads a potential customer into you ecosystem.\n\nIt's all SEO optimization, and it always has been.

I was getting what looked like a ton of useful content. I even expanded the AI to pull in more specific county level data and it was looking grand.\n\nUntil users started to point out that everything being added was about 80 - 100% absolute bull shit. It was able to use the internet to get very specific data and still just made up completely bogus shit that looked and sounded great. It was so bad that even after trying a dozen or so other models we had to roll back all of the AI generated shit.\n\nAlso do not trust that spike in traffic. Right after we started pulling in this data we saw a 80% surge in traffic. We were ecstatic about that too but it was just 80% more bots. The number of new users never changed, just the amount of bandwidth and strain our servers were under went up.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that for a while that AI slop was on thousands of our pages that were getting hit hard by bots / AI crawlers. So they were basically slurping up their slop for a second time and will likely use it to be regurgitated again to someone else.\n\nGPT's are practically worthless if you need reliable factual data.",

It caught technical SEO issues I missed for months (broken canonical tags, missing alt text patterns, thin content pages)\n- The competitor keyword analysis saved me probably 4-5 hours of manual research\n- Publishing via Webflow API is slick once configured\n\nCons:\n- 'No manual intervention' is a stretch. I still review every piece before it goes live. The quality is good 80% of the time, but the other 20% has weird phrasing or makes claims I would not want published under my name\n- Content strategy is where it gets shaky. It tends to chase volume over intent. Generated a bunch of top-of-funnel listicles when what my site actually needed was bottom-funnel comparison pages\n- Cost adds up fast if you are running frequent audits on a large site. Claude API usage is not free\n\nMy verdict: great as an accelerator, not great as a fully autonomous system. I use it for the audit and keyword research, then heavily edit the actual content output. Treating it as a first draft machine rather than a publishing pipeline has worked way better for me.\n\nAnyone else finding the quality inconsistent on longer form content?",

One thing I learned the hard way is to keep a close eye on the generated content for a while, even if it *seems* perfect. I had an AI start hallucinating stats once, and almost published some... let's just say \"creative\" data points.\n\nSeriously though, the time savings alone must be massive. Just make sure you're regularly spot-checking things to ensure quality and accuracy. Automating is great, but a little human oversight can prevent some potentially embarrassing situations, ya know?

FAQ schema and HowTo schema make your content’s structure machine-readable in a way that aligns with how these systems chunk documents. Worth implementing, though it’s hard to isolate as a variable.\n\nOn tracking: Semrush’s AI overview feature gives partial Google signal. For ChatGPT/Perplexity specifically, you’re mostly flying blind right now. Best proxy metrics are branded direct traffic spikes that correlate with content publishing, and ‘dark traffic’ (sessions with no referrer attribution).

Turned out most of my drop off was from in-app browsers.\n\nWhen people click ads on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok they land in those app browsers and those things are terrible for checkout. No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook is way lower than Safari that's your leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

It helps you catch expansion opportunities early. Keep building!",

      "text": "Today, I’m going to share exactly what my brother and I did to grow our [SaaS](https://taap.it/1J7ilyW) and reach 10K MRR. And what we would do if we were starting from scratch.\n\nJust one method we’ve been applying every day for months.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Step 1: Build in public on TikTok & Instagram**\n\nFor over a year, we've been documenting everything. We switch up the type of content by transparently showing the entire evolution of the product, even before its launch; we share our doubts, the features in progress, the struggles, the little victories, everything. And that’s what creates a real connection with our audience. We’re not selling in the videos; we’re just building a relationship. And today, TikTok and Instagram have become our main acquisition channels. It’s simple: people follow us, they see our dedication, they understand our product. And the day we invite them to try it, they’re already convinced. Here, I showed you the theory, but here’s how to really do a Build In Public, and it’s very simple. The first thing to do is define your message; it has to be punchy. Generally, the best messages that have worked for us were “quitting everything to crush Fiverr and Upwork” and also “we're going live until we hit $200,000 in revenue.” So your message needs to sound really crazy; that’s what will really determine whether it works or not. Step two: film how to shoot a video; it’s very simple. You’re going to take shots that have nothing to do with what you’re saying: shots of you working, shots of you on calls, shots at the gym, whatever. The goal is to illustrate your words to create a dynamic result, and the last part is editing. I use Capcut; there are many editing software options, but for beginners, it’s pretty good. You’ll add your voiceover that you recorded beforehand, add subtitles of what you’re saying, then include clips and music, and now you have a simple post that works and builds trust with your consumers.\n\n**Step 2: LinkedIn outbound + content**\n\nEvery morning, I contact 50 to 60 people on LinkedIn. Very targeted profiles. No randomness. I check who liked or commented on a post related to our topic, and I start a real conversation. Nothing aggressive; I just offer to connect with the person, show interest in them, try to understand that LinkedIn is a social network filled with hypocrisy and ego, so you absolutely have to work on people long-term to build a relationship and convert them later. Then, I post on my profile once a day. It could be educational content, stories, or a lead magnet. The posts that are working best for us right now are niche lead magnets with a real resource. What works the most are mini tools or automations that you give away for free; people will comment so you can send it to them in a private message. To give you an example and help you understand the whole process, two days ago, I made a post giving away a tool that allowed people to track their SEO; I got over 900 comments and 500 likes on LinkedIn. So what I do is send them the resource, and once they have it, you have two options: either follow up two days later to help them and build a relationship for conversion later on, but in the long run, or cold call everyone who commented, because if they commented, they’re obviously interested in what you do. So, you can call them directly to offer a demo in a 30-minute call with them. Personally, I prefer cold calling; I did a week of cold calls and managed to get over 30 qualified meetings because these are people who have already shown interest.\n\n**Step 3: Cold Email**\n\nWe send about 500 emails a day using Instantly. But before that, we make sure our domain is warmed up, that the text is solid, and that the targeting is good. This means there’s real groundwork to do ahead of time on your ICP to get a much higher response and open rate. We don’t just go everywhere. We only target people who have shown intent. For example: if we offer an analysis tool, we’ll target SaaS founders who have recently hired in marketing or posted a job offer for an SEO consultant. It changes everything. Because the message is tailored, and the response rate explodes. What matters is the substance of your emails, not the form. Try to have volume in your emails but ultra-personalized according to the different audience groups. And a little tip on emails: if you’re doing email marketing, you need to understand some fundamental things. Generally, for the profile picture, I really recommend putting a personal profile picture for your emails and not your company logo. If you’re doing cold email, it should be firstname.lastname@yourcompany; the goal is really to appear human even if you’re automating. There’s also a maximum character rule: 80 characters; the person should be able to read the email on their phone without scrolling, and you’ll have a higher response rate.\n\n**Step 4: X (formerly Twitter)**\n\nX works totally differently from other platforms: here, interaction is the game. So every day, I publish 3 tweets spaced throughout the day. And I comment on at least 50 posts. But I don't just comment for the sake of commenting. I bring a real perspective; I open up a conversation. The goal is to really engage because your responses to comments can bring you a lot of traction. And little by little, this attracts followers, visibility, and conversations that can turn into customers. What’s crazy is that there’s a strong SaaS community on X, with super valuable connections.\n\n**Step 5: Reddit**\n\nReddit is underrated. But when you start to understand how it works, it's an amazing channel. We got over 200K views in 7 days with a well-written post. But be careful; Reddit is strict. You must first interact with the community, be “accepted,” and then you can start posting. You really need to do this work during the first month of interacting with others, trying to understand the codes. When I post on Reddit, I always try to give all the value I have to avoid delivering empty content; I always provide concrete things, then I share stories, share a lesson or a struggle. And if people react, I respond in the comments or gently redirect. It’s a powerful channel, but you have to approach it carefully to promote your tool; it’s quite subtle. There are also very strong comments; typically, you type the problem you’re solving into the search bar, then find posts talking about your issue, so you can comment and say, “Hello, I had the same problem as you, and now I’m using (your product) and honestly, it helped me a lot.” It’s quite subtle, and it works well because you’re helping one or more people.\n\n**Step 6: Patience and consistency**\n\nAll these channels take time. But you have to do them every day. Not for 2 weeks. Not for a month. We’re talking about months for the cumulative effect to kick in. And it’s exactly because most people give up too soon that those who persist end up winning big. What we apply is a simple discipline; every channel has its routine, we set clear goals, and we constantly iterate.",

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout.

Our text-only sequences were getting maybe 3-4% response rates, but when we added a quick personalised video in the second or third touchpoint, it jumped to around 18%. People are drowning in text emails, so anything that stands out helps.  \n  \nThe Reddit advice is spot on though. I've seen people get absolutely destroyed for being too promotional too quickly.  \n  \nWhat's your typical timeline from first LinkedIn interaction to actually pitching your product?",

Learn to code (or prompt), ship something in 2 weeks, post a revenue screenshot and repeat. But the market is super crowded and most of what is being built is just slightly different versions of the same 20 ideas.\n\nAI made building easier. But that just means more average stuff gets shipped faster. It doesnt magically create demand.\n\nIf you're going to build something, at least make it extreemly specific. Solve a real problem for real people you actually understand. Not 'founders.' Not 'creators.' Not 'everyone.'\n\nOr honestly… build something outside of SaaS. A service. A niche community. A physical product. A boring local business. There are still opportunities there because everyone is busy chasing MRR dashboards.\n\nIm not saying SaaS is dead. I'm saying defaulting to 'lets build another SaaS' without understanding demand and having a real edge is probably a waste of time.\n\nMaybe instead of asking 'what should I build?'  \nAsk 'who do I actually understand better than most people?'",

Those patterns usually mean pain plus urgency.\nOn tools, I’ve rotated through F5bot and Mention for broad listening, tried GummySearch for audience research, and now use Pulse for Reddit mainly to surface those exact-match buyer phrases in tiny subs and draft a quick first reply I can edit before posting.\nThe point is: narrow, intent-heavy alerts beat watching popular subs all day.",

      "text": "8 months since launching my problem validation platform and I just crossed 140 paying customers. Went through plenty of failed marketing strategies after listening to random posts on Reddit to figure out what actually drives growth versus what just makes you \"feel\" busy (warning, there are a lot of b.s. strats out there)\n\nWhat actually finally worked:\n\nDiscord and Slack communities (SUPER UNDERRATED). Joined 8-10 founder communities and became known for sharing validation insights. This is a super underrated method in my opinion that many sleep on. The heated conversations in the threads on the channels revealed exactly what entrepreneurs struggle with most. When someone posted about needing startup ideas, I'd DM directly offering to help (that's the best part of these communities). Much more personal than public posts and converted way better.\n\nTwitter build-in-public content (posted about my progress). Shared actual user problems I found, demos of new features, and lessons learned. Nothing fancy, just authentic updates about the journey. Built a following of 0 - 9.8k people who actually care about SaaS. Several customers found me through viral tweets about failed startup ideas. This one takes a bit of consistency for a few months to get movement but for long term this is a GREAT WAY to show off your projects and get free traction. If you're in a position where you're posting but getting very little views, keep going. I was at less than 100 views for 10 months straight until I finally started slowly getting more views.\n\nCold email campaigns. Sent around 200 emails daily to founders who'd posted about struggling with idea validation, found thru apollo. Instead of selling, I'd share 2-3 specific problems I found in their industry with evidence from real reviews (instant value provided). About 15% would respond asking to learn more. This approach booked 40+ calls that turned into 12 customers. The only hard part about this and why many skip over this is because you have to land in the inbox. I personally use Resend, it's really good for sending emails and landing in the inbox .\n\nWhat completely failed:\n\nCold DMs across all platforms were terrible. Tried LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, even TikTok messages. People hate unsolicited DMs and response rates were under 2%. Felt spammy and damaged my brand more than helped.\n\nContent marketing and SEO efforts went nowhere. Spent 3 months writing blog posts about validation techniques and startup advice. Got decent traffic but zero conversions. Turns out people don't google \"how to find startup problems\" they discuss it in communities where they already trust the members like Reddit or Twitter.\n\nAffiliate program was a complete disaster. Launched with 30% commission thinking other entrepreneurs would promote it. Got 50+ affiliate signups but generated less than 20 total clicks, actually not even. I think one person got one click and i'm pretty sure it was themselves. People get excited about earning commissions but never actually promote anything. Pure waste of development time and I wasted about $200 setting it up using Rewardful.\n\nBuilding features before validating demand. Wasted 4 weeks developing an AI feature because it seemed cool. Launched it and literally nobody used it, lmao. Now I validate every feature idea by asking 10 customers if they'd pay extra for it before writing any code.\n\nAds. no need to say anything more. target audience (for me) wasn't on facebook. google ads slightly worked but didn't add conversions.\n\nCurrent approach:\n\nDoubling down on what works. Still spending most time in communities helping people, now with more credibility from actual results. Expanding cold email to new founder segments since the process is proven. Zero time on new experiments until mastering current channels.\n\nThe biggest lesson: people buy solutions to painful problems, not cool features. Focus on finding real PAIN first that a specific niche has, everything else becomes easier.\n\nMost people think its impossible in this community. I'm telling you it's possible, you are just not promoting and marketing enough.\n\nMY BIGGEST TIP: Find the MOST CONSISTENT complaint you see in your industry through Reddit posts or Discord Threads that have low upvotes and high comments, they have the most controversial topics and usually have a lot of pain points users face. That's your next business opportunity.\n\nFor context, [my SaaS](http://bigideasdb.com/) helps entrepreneurs discover validated startup problems from real user complaints across many platforms including G2/Capterra, Upwork, App Stores and Reddit that can be turned into B2C/B2B products.\n\nCheers and keep MARKETING & building :)",

Most programs that fail weren’t bad ideas, they were either launched too early or treated as a set-it-and-forget-it channel.\n\nThe programs that work require active recruiting, onboarding, messaging guidance, checking in with partners, testing angles, sharing wins, optimizing payouts etc. If you just open signups and wait, almost nothing happens.\n\nAlso if conversions, positioning, and proof aren’t there yet, affiliates don’t have much to work with. 30% commission sounds exciting, but without a clear angle and assets, people won’t promote.\n\nJust a few questions to get more context, when you launched were you personally reaching out to specific partners or just accepting signups? Also did affiliates get any promo assets or any sort of guidance?\n\nNow that you have traction and authority, the outcome could look very different.\n\nIf you ever want a second look, we’re happy to offer a free 1-1 strategy call with our CEO to go deeper on your case and see whether affiliates make sense at your current stage.

I found the same thing with founder communities but took it one step further with the DM approach. Instead of just text, I started sending quick personalised video messages (30-45 seconds) when someone posted about a problem I could help with. The response rate jumped from around 15% with text to nearly 40% with video.  \n  \nSomething about seeing an actual face makes it feel less spammy and more like a genuine offer to help. People could tell I actually read their post and cared about their specific situation.  \n  \nThe other advantage is it's way harder to ignore a video thumbnail in your DMs compared to another wall of text. Most people are curious enough to at least click play.  \n  \nI'm curious about your cold email approach though. You mentioned providing instant value by sharing 2-3 specific problems you found in their industry. How long did it typically take you to research and customise each email to that level?",
