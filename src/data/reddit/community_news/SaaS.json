      "text": "Long-time customer. Never complained. Renewed twice. Assumed they were happy. Then out of nowhere this massive email arrives detailing every frustration they'd had over two years. Features that didn't work as expected. Workflows that were harder than they should be. UI decisions that confused them. Everything.\nFirst instinct was defensiveness. If it was so bad why did they keep paying. Why didn't they say something earlier. But I pushed past that and actually read it carefully.\nEvery point was valid. Not all of them were things I'd fix but every single one came from a real experience of friction. They'd just been living with it because switching would be worse. That's not loyalty. That's tolerance. And tolerance runs out eventually.\nSet up a call to dig deeper. They were surprised I wanted to talk. Expected to be ignored or get defensive pushback. Instead I spent an hour understanding their workflows and where we made things harder than necessary.\nFixed about 40% of what they mentioned over the next two months. Told them what we wouldn't fix and why. They went from tolerating us to actively recommending us. Became a case study. All because I treated their essay of complaints as a gift instead of an attack.\nMost customers won't tell you what's wrong. They'll just leave. When someone takes the time to write 1,400 words about your problems, that's someone who cares enough to try. Listen to them.",

A 1,400-word critique from a paying customer isn’t anger, it’s investment,they cared enough to explain their lived friction instead of quietly churning. the distinction you called out between loyalty and tolerance is especially sharp; most SaaS companies mistake silence for satisfaction when it’s often just switching cost. What really stands out is that you closed the loop: you listened without defensiveness, clarified what you would and wouldn’t fix, and followed through visibly. That combination builds trust fast. It’s also a good lesson for founders that the most important feedback often comes after renewal, not before,once customers feel safe enough to be honest. treating criticism as a gift instead of an attack is hard, but when you do, it can turn near-churn into advocacy.",

You get better every time.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody tells you: with age comes responsibility that eats your time.\n\nI have a family now. Two kids, one is 17 months old. For the past 24 months my schedule has been: start at 7:30am when family leaves, work, quick lunch, work, dinner, then build until 1am when kids are sleeping. Weekends too. Oh and we renovated our house and had a newborn in between.\n\nLately I notice my son understands more and more every day. He's watching. And I don't want to be the absent dad behind a laptop.\n\nI love what I'm building. But I'm also exhausted. When this product launches I'm taking a real break. My kids won't be young forever.\n\n**So why am I posting this?**\n\nFor the younger people here: the time is now. You have something I don't anymore: time without tradeoffs. No kids waiting for you. No mortgage. No partner wondering when you'll be done.\n\nLearn. Take chances. Build. Fail. Do it again. You can absorb the hits differently at 25 than at 40.\n\nMake some fun too obviously.

I can learn faster, and I don’t need to go to a school or pay big money for everything. I can study little by little, even in the evening or on weekends.\n\nAlso, I think in your 20s and 30s it is the perfect time to try something. You have more energy, and you can take more risky bets. Even if you fail, you still have time to start again. So if someone is young and thinking about a business or a new skill, I would say: start now, don’t wait too long.",

      "text": "Every time I see someone post about building a \"passive income SaaS\" I want to ask what exactly they think passive means. Because I've been running a product at $19K MRR for two years and there's nothing passive about it.\n\nMonday this week I spent 3 hours on support tickets. Tuesday was a bug that broke checkout for about 6 hours and cost us roughly $400 in lost sales plus my entire afternoon to fix. Wednesday I wrote a blog post for SEO that took 4 hours. Thursday was calls with two enterprise prospects and updating our roadmap. Friday I dealt with a customer who found a way to abuse our free tier and had to decide whether to grandfather them or cut them off.\n\nThat's a pretty normal week. Sometimes it's lighter. Sometimes it's worse. But the idea that you can build something and then just collect checks while sitting on a beach is a lie people tell to sell courses.\n\nThere's always support. There's always maintenance. There's always marketing that needs doing. There's always the random emergency that appears out of nowhere. The business doesn't run itself. It runs because I run it every single week.\n\nWhat I do have is flexibility. I can work from anywhere. I can structure my days how I want. I can take a week off if I really need to and things won't completely collapse. But that's not passive income. That's self-employment with good boundaries. The distinction matters because if you're getting into SaaS expecting to automate yourself out of a job you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe real pitch for SaaS isn't passive income. It's leverage. It's the ability to serve thousands of customers without thousands of hours. It's income that can grow without proportional increases in time. But it's still work. Always.",

The work doesn’t vanish, it just shifts from “doing the thing” to keeping the system healthy: support, infra, pricing, churn, roadmap, distribution. The fantasy breaks people because they think the hard part is launch, when the real game starts after product-market fit.\n\nThe only semi-passive part I’ve seen is when you build tight processes and guardrails: aggressive monitoring, solid incident runbooks, async support with clear SLAs, and documentation so you’re not the bottleneck. Tools like Intercom/HelpScout for support, Customer.io for lifecycle, and stuff like Pulse for Reddit or SparkToro to quietly sit on top of organic channels so distribution keeps running in the background.\n\nSaaS is work. The upside is that the same work can move a much bigger revenue number over time.",

SaaS isn’t passive income, it’s leveraged income you’re trading linear hours for systems that let the same work impact more customers over time, but the work never disappears. support, bugs, marketing, edge cases, and decision-making are permanent features, not temporary hurdles. the win isn’t doing nothing, it’s having control over when and how you work, and knowing that a bad week doesn’t zero out your income the way freelancing or consulting might. I think the damage of the passive-income myth is that it attracts people who hate ongoing responsibility, when SaaS actually rewards people who are willing to show up consistently, fix boring problems, and keep the machine healthy. what you’re describing isn’t failure of the model, it’s the model working exactly as it does at sustainable scale.",

No acquisition cost. Just show up and collect.\n\nAbout 230 of them migrated over. Revenue jumped overnight. I was celebrating.\n\nThen the support tickets started.\n\nThese customers had been using a different product with different workflows. They didn't want to learn our way. They wanted us to work like the old thing worked. Every ticket was basically \"this isn't how I used to do it.\"\n\nFeature requests flooded in. Things the competitor had that we didn't. Things I'd never build because they didn't fit our vision. But these customers expected them. They'd paid for them before.\n\nThe churn started at month three. About 40% of them left within six months. They'd tried to make us work, couldn't adjust, and gave up.\n\nThe ones who stayed are actually good customers now. But the math wasn't what I thought.\n\nExpected: 230 new customers at $89/month = $20,470/month added\n\nReality: about 85 stayed long-term = $7,565/month added\n\nSupport cost during migration: probably ate half of that in the first year.\n\nStill a net positive. But not the windfall I expected. Inherited customers come with inherited expectations. And those expectations are expensive to disappoint or expensive to meet.\n\nFree customers aren't actually free.\n\nHas anyone else inherited customers from a dying competitor?",

The burnout was slow, and then all at once. \n\nI'm officially stepping back as of the new year, with my chairperson taking over in my seat. They've had experience scaling and exiting businesses bigger than mine, and knows our story and team well enough to do it justice. \n\nThe next few months will be telling, though, as we put this change into practice.

          "text": "Can you give a rough financial breakdown of how at 800k ARR you are able to afford to pay a ceo and a ‘team’? Or did you just give a ton of equity to new ceo and not pay them? From some experience new ‘senior leadership’ has only been a discussion once small equity % (like 1%) means something. At 800k ARR, assuming a ceo costs 200-300k/yr (low end) you are likely at a ~2m valuation so would either be giving almost all of your margin to the new CEO in form of salary, or giving them ~10% of your equity every 12 months. Can you explain where my thinking is wrong?",

      "text": "Today I’m going to share with you exactly what my brother and I are doing to grow our [SaaS](https://taap.it/oyneU0f) and reach 10K MRR.\n\nJust a method we’ve been applying every single day for months.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Step 1 Build in public on TikTok & Instagram**\n\nFor over a year, we’ve been documenting everything. Every day.  \nWe share our doubts, the features in progress, the struggles, the small wins everything. And that’s what creates a real connection with our audience.  \nWe don’t sell in the videos, we just build a relationship.  \nAnd today, TikTok and Instagram have become our number one acquisition channel.  \nIt’s simple: people follow us, they see our dedication, they understand our product.  \nAnd the day we offer them to try it, they’re already convinced.\n\n**Step 2 LinkedIn: outbound + content**\n\nEvery morning, I reach out to 50 to 60 people on LinkedIn.  \nHighly targeted profiles. No randomness.  \nI check who liked or commented on a post related to our topic, and I start a real conversation.  \nNothing aggressive, I just suggest a chat.  \nThen I post on my profile, once a day.  \nEither educational content, storytelling, or a lead magnet.  \nThe posts that work best for us right now are niche lead magnets with a real promise.  \nYou get people to comment, create engagement, send them a DM and that’s how conversions happen.\n\n**Step 3 Cold Email**\n\nWe send about 500 emails a day with Instantly.  \nBut before that, we make sure our domain is warmed up, the copy is solid, and the targeting is right.  \nWe don’t go in all directions.  \nWe only target people who have shown intent.  \nFor example: if we’re offering an analytics tool, we’ll target SaaS founders who recently hired in marketing or posted a job for a SEO consultant.  \nThat changes everything.  \nBecause the message fits, and the reply rate skyrockets.  \nWhat matters is the substance of your emails not the style.\n\n**Step 4 X (formerly Twitter)**\n\nX works totally differently from other platforms: here, **interaction is the game**.  \nSo every day, I post 4 tweets spaced out during the day.  \nAnd I comment on at least 50 posts.  \nBut I don’t comment just to comment.  \nI bring a real perspective, I open a conversation.  \nAnd little by little, it brings followers, visibility, and conversations that can turn into customers.  \nWhat’s crazy is that there’s a strong SaaS community on X super valuable connections.\n\n**Step 5 Reddit**\n\nReddit is underrated in France.  \nBut when you start understanding how it works, it’s an incredible channel.  \nWe got over 200K views in 7 days with one well-written post.  \nBut be careful, Reddit is strict.  \nYou have to first interact with the community, get “accepted”, and then you can start posting.  \nWhen I post on Reddit, I never mention our tool directly.  \nI tell a story, share a lesson or a struggle.  \nAnd if people engage, I reply in the comments or redirect gently.  \nIt’s a powerful channel but you have to handle it with care.\n\n**Step 6 Patience and consistency**\n\nAll these channels take time.  \nBut you have to do it every day.  \nNot for 2 weeks. Not for a month.  \nWe’re talking **at least 6 months** for compound effect to kick in.  \nAnd it’s exactly because most people quit too early… that those who stick with it end up winning big.  \nWhat we apply is a simple discipline: each channel has its routine, we set clear goals, and we keep iterating.",

What tends to work better is anchoring onboarding to moments of intent, when the user is already trying to do something and is open to guidance.

          "text": "the trick i've used (and its a massive pain in the ass to code) is 'when necessary' onboarding. \n\nI learned the concept from a dude i worked with and just kept it for my own projects. \n\nstep 1.) understand the 'perfect' onboarding is above all else just really good and intuitive UX. Your users should be able to 'intuit' next steps in your user flow and when/how to use features. If you're not focusing on that above all else, fix it. \n\nstep 2.) is realizing no matter how well you do step 1..... users are still dumb as hell. So have flags to point them in the right direction when needed and only do it once. \n\nexample:  \n\\- user signs up for my app (idk lets go with an expense tracker for example) \n\n\\- they see a dashboard with a bunch of options (start a budget, add income, upload account, etc)   \n\\- ideally your UX makes it so they start uploading the right data in the right order (lets say 'accounts => income => expenses => budget builder)   \n\\- have a pop up/tooltip/whatever say \"most users start here\" then add a flag (bool value) to your user profile database table that once they click it, change the bool value so it doesn't show up again (to avoid annoying them)\n\n\\- then when they do the first step and have an account set up have the next pop up/thing go \"great job, the next step is to set up expenses\" and navigate them there with one click. \n\n\\- repeat this flow for everything. \n\nwhenever a user 'starts' a feature flow, make sure you have tool tips/pop ups that show them how to finish it, shows them options they have (only when its time to make choices on the options, not before), etc.   \n  \nKeep it simple, don't overwhelm them with everything upfront cause they'll do what all of us do \"skip, skip, skip, skip, jesus christ stop asking me stuff and let me use the damn app, skip, skip, finally\" \n\n  \nthats the best experience i've had for my users and while its a harder to do, its worth it.",

      "text": "Yo.\n\nJust to get things straight right away: this post isn't BS.\n\nSEO is in a terrible state these days. Experts share contradictory advice, agencies try to make SEO very complex so they can charge more. And AI search makes it even more blurry as people claim GEO is completely different from SEO when in reality there's like a 80% overlap between SEO & whatever you call the new \"AI SEO\".\n\nSo this is a **curated** list. What doesn't work isn't listed here.\n\nIf you do just the first 2 and you weren’t doing it before, I guarantee you'll get +6-10 positions for the associated pages on Google depending on your niche.\n\nI know this works because I ran experiments on 4 different websites I own and I helped about 30 different websites implement these strategies.\n\nHere you go:\n\n**1. Refresh old content (easiest win)**\n\nGo to Google Search Console. Find posts ranking positions 8-20. These are *so close* to getting traffic but invisible on page 2.\n\nUpdate them: add a new section, fix outdated stats, improve the intro. Then update the published date.\n\nI've seen posts jump 10+ positions within weeks. Lowest hanging fruit in SEO.\n\n**2. Add authors to your blog posts**\n\nGoogle's E-E-A-T framework cares about *who* wrote your content. Add a visible author with a short bio, and **a link to LinkedIn/X**.\n\nEvery time I apply this to a site that wasn't doing it, posts climb 4-8 positions within 2 weeks. Stupid easy.\n\n**3. Integration marketplaces = free high-authority backlinks**\n\nYou're building a SaaS? Then it's very likely you'll want to build an integration with another platform at some point. Get listed on their marketplace: it's free DA 90+ backlink.\n\nHubSpot App Marketplace, Zapier, WordPress plugin directory, Chrome Extensions web store. These listings also drive actual users, not just SEO juice.\n\n**4. Exact domain match still works**\n\nIf you haven't started your venture, you can get a huge SEO boost on a specific keyword if your domain & brand matches it exactly.\n\nGoogle nerfed this years ago, but it still helps when combined with quality content. If you haven't bought your domain yet, spend an extra hour finding one with your primary keyword in it.\n\n**5. Build a free tool**\n\nCalculator, checker, generator - doesn't matter. People love linking to useful resources. One weekend project can earn you backlinks for years.\n\nI built a simple [Domain Rating checker](https://blogseo.io/tools/dr-checker). It takes seconds to use, costs me almost nothing to run, and it gets linked a lot on social media.\n\n**6. Fresh, regular content**\n\nGoogle rewards sites that publish consistently. It signals your site is active and worth crawling frequently. Each article = new entry point from search.\n\n**7. Find keyword gaps**\n\nEveryone tells you to copy competitors. But the real opportunity is what they're *not* doing.\n\nFind terms competitors aren't targeting well. One overlooked keyword with decent volume can become your traffic goldmine while everyone else fights over high-competition terms.\n\nI've seen single well-chosen keywords bring 80% of total traffic on niche sites.\n\n**8. NAP consistency**\n\nYour brand name, URL, and social links should be identical everywhere: Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, X, directories.\n\nWhen Google sees the same info repeated across trusted sources, it builds confidence you're legitimate. Inconsistencies create doubt.\n\n**9. Curated directories only**\n\nIf it's free and anyone can post, don't expect much. Generic directories are worthless.\n\nWhat works for SaaS: Product Hunt, G2, Capterra, \"There's an AI for That\", places that actually vet submissions or require payment.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO**\n\nOne template + structured data = thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords.\n\nClassic example: Zapier's integration pages. But you need a decent backlink profile first, or these pages won't rank.\n\n**11. FAQ sections**\n\nFAQs let you target long-tail keywords and qualify for rich snippets. More SERP real estate = higher CTR.\n\nEven more important now with AI search. When AI fans out your query into sub-queries, FAQ content formatted as Q&A is exactly what they're looking for.\n\n**12. Backlinks outreach**\n\nCold outreach still works:\n\n- Guest posting (you provide content, they get a backlink)\n- Broken link replacement (find broken links on relevant sites, suggest your content)\n- Unlinked mentions (find articles mentioning you without linking, ask for the link)\n\nIt's time consuming. But it works. The only downside to traditional link exchanges is that when scaled, reciprocal links can look suspicious to Google. Site A links to B, B links back to A. Google knows it's a trade.\n\nIf you want to automate link building, I built an ABC backlink exchange into [BlogSEO](https://blogseo.io/). Users get matched with sites in similar niches and the system inserts contextual backlinks using a triangle structure (A→B→C→A) so there's no direct reciprocation. No cold outreach & no reciprocal penalty.\n\n**13. Comparison pages**\n\n\"[Competitor] alternatives\" and \"[Competitor] vs [Your brand]\" searches are bottom-of-funnel gold. These people have already decided to buy - they're just picking which option.\n\nBe honest in these. If you're worse at something, say it. Builds trust and filters out bad-fit customers.\n\n**14. Schema markup that matters**\n\nMost sites skip this or add useless generic markup. Three that actually help:\n\n- `Person`/`Author` - links content to a real human\n- `FAQPage` - qualifies for rich snippets\n- `SameAs` - tells Google all places your brand exists\n\nIf you do this, and are patient enough, I can guarantee you'll get more organic traffic within 3 months.\n\nResults of some websites I've helped with the aforementioned tactics:\n\n- SaaS 1: https://imgur.com/a/OXcw9Ob\n- SaaS 2: https://imgur.com/a/PTozQLx\n- Gaming Directory website: https://imgur.com/a/aU4KK71\n\nHappy to answer questions if needed!",

The tech worked fine but nobody could figure out how to make people comfortable with it. Fast forward to now and it's the same problem... the capability exists but the trust doesn't. I've watched companies try to package this as \"security enhancement\" or \"personalization\" but consumers aren't stupid - they know when they're being tracked. Even at Cloudastra Technologies where we aggregate content, we specifically avoid any facial data collection because the liability alone would kill us.

If you don't - you loose.\n\nPeople who're on the bottom of the funnel, for them - it's about hiring the right people to do the job.\n\nTry to estimate how long it would be until you reach this point. And don't forget that even if you product has someone who needs it - doesn't mean they see enough value in that to make you profitable.\n\nDon't want to sound negative. It's a good job.\n\nI wish you luck and attention to details. In the end, if you have someone to compete with - it would be something really important to survive.",

Once you add vpcs and databases even in development the costs get real. \n\nMy simple sass app is running about $65-$75/mo for aws. Then add a Claude subscription at $100/mo. Even the most basic apps start at $200/mo. \n\nMaybe it’s a mistake on my part but I like to work on several projects at once and I can see my monthly development costs getting too expensive. \n\nWhat would you recommend?  How early do you launch your mvp?  The last thing I want is something fragile for first experience. Just curious if anyone has a good pattern here.",

Thought we were building something together. Asked if they'd do an honest exit interview since there was nothing to lose at that point. They agreed and didn't hold back. Everything they said was about me not them.\nI gave contradictory instructions and got frustrated when they didn't know which to follow. I said I wanted autonomy but then micromanaged every decision they made. I communicated goals without context so they never understood why things mattered. I was so busy I never made time to actually train them properly. Three weeks in and they felt confused and untrusted and set up to fail. So they left before it got worse. The hard part was that everything they said was true. I'd been so focused on getting help that I didn't prepare to actually provide leadership. I expected them to read my mind. I treated training as interruption rather than investment.\nTook six months before I hired again. Spent that time building processes. Writing things down. Creating actual onboarding. Thinking about what it would feel like to start fresh with no context. Next hire stayed two years. Same basic role. Different outcome because I'd fixed myself not just filled a seat. The first hire failing was entirely my fault. Their exit interview was a gift I didn't deserve but desperately needed.\n\n",

That's how it's sold online and that's what I believed when I started. The reality is different.\n\nSupport tickets don't stop. Even with documentation and even with automation, people have questions. They get stuck. They find edge cases. They need help. That's about 8 hours a week just responding to things. The product needs maintenance too. Dependencies update. Security patches happen. Third party APIs change without warning. Things break for no apparent reason. Another 5 hours a week just keeping the lights on. Marketing can't actually stop either. The moment I pause content or outreach, growth stalls. Competitors keep moving. SEO needs constant feeding. That's another 4 hours minimum if I want to keep growing. Then there's the random stuff like billing issues and refund requests and feature requests that need responses even if I'm not building them and legal compliance updates. Another 3 hours of miscellaneous work that just appears.\n\nAdd it up and my \"passive\" income requires about 20 hours a week of active work. That's half a full time job. Better than a full time job for sure but nowhere near the fantasy of true passive income. I'm not complaining because the business is good and the flexibility is real. But I wish someone had told me earlier that SaaS passive income is more like SaaS reduced-active income. The work doesn't disappear. It just gets more efficient. Maybe at a much larger scale with a real team it becomes truly passive for the founder. I'm not there yet and might never be. I've accepted that the 20 hours is just part of the deal.",

When I launched my first app I did the same thing and got similar results makes you feel like youre bothering everyone. Thing is people are busy and if they arent already thinking about your product a random email isnt going to magically make them give feedback. What I found worked better was finding where people were ALREADY talking about the problem my app solved or related topics. For me it was mostly Reddit. By engaging in those conversations genuinely you can naturally bring up your product and get way more relevant feedback and even some early users. Plus its not as intrusive. I actually built a tool to help with this because the manual search was eating up all my time. It finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn based on the actual context of the discussion not just keywords. Its what brought me to your post. It started as an internal tool but turned into its own product. Might be something that could help you surface those organic conversations if you wanna check it out let me know happy to share",

The $50/mo target is achievable when you're selling to people who already trust you\n\n\n\nThe constraint (limited time + limited budget) is actually your advantage.

You could potentially hit that $50/month faster while you figure out what problems people actually want to pay to solve.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to go the SaaS route I'd echo what others said - don't look for \"ideas,\" look for specific problems you've personally experienced or seen others struggle with.

There really are no guaranteed SaaS ideas, even at $50, but there are reliable patterns. Very small, very specific problems where someone already pays manually tend to work better than broad products. Given limited time, a thin SaaS that replaces a spreadsheet, script, or recurring manual task for a niche audience is more realistic than a full platform. Another pattern is starting as a paid service or script and only turning it into SaaS once you see repeat demand.

Three months ago the team launched [Anannas ](https://Anannas.ai)as this **unified API thing for LLM models** basically one endpoint to hit 500+ models without dealing with different providers' quirks and I figured maybe a few hundred developers would find it useful. That seemed like a win.\n\nFast forward to today and we're sitting at **5.5K users, 120+ organizations, and 2.5 million API requests** routed through the system. **Anthropic** is our top provider by token volume, which makes sense given how good their models are, but still. **14 billion** tokens routed.\n\nThe wildest part is **No launch on Product Hunt**, no cold outreach. Just built the thing, threw up some docs, and people... found it? Apparently there are a lot of developers out there who are as tired as I was of managing five different API keys and learning five different request formats just to compare models or build fallback logic & also tired with Current Solutions as well.\n\nThe growth curve has been kind of ridiculous we went from \"cool, someone signed up\" to \"wait, we need to optimize this endpoint because we're hitting rate limits\".\n\nIf you're building with LLMs and you're tired of the provider gymnastics, Anannas is running 20% off on all models for 10 days. Applies to every API provider on the platform. Go Build with the Community.\n\nps: the community doesnt allow image. so here are the full [stats](https://x.com/anannas_ai/status/2006016244915343670)",

Fireworks/together AI they usually don't 're sell' models that official providers already host.\n\n2 - How in the world would you deal with rate limits from said providers, at scale. Without breaching ToS (having multiple organization accounts for example).

And TPM/RPM and their per seconds or per day counterparts.\n\n\nI wrote \"How [...] would you deal with rate limits from said providers, at scale.\"\n\n\nThe 'at scale' matters here. When going through open router's keys it is well known that users get rate limited, and get 429s very often. \n\n\nThat is why its better to connect to openrouters routed models for which they dont use their own key, or directly to said providers BYOK way. \n\n\nThey handle 25T token traffic (only a tiny fraction of that goes through their keys). \n\n\nOP's service is new, and has everyone go through their keys, it is a recipe for disaster, unless they get custom rate limits. If the providers even allow them to resell their tokens for such poor added value. \n\n\nIt is forbidden by their ToS.\n\nHence OPs silence. ",

Managing multiple LLM providers, different auth patterns, rate limits, and fallback logic becomes messy way faster than people expect, especially once things move from “experiment” to “production.”   \nAlso not surprised Anthropic is top by token volume a lot of teams I’ve seen default to it for serious workloads, but still want the flexibility to switch or compare without rewriting half their stack.\n\nwhat was the first thing that actually broke when usage spiked infra, rate limiting, billing logic, or observability? In my experience, that transition from “nice adoption” to “oh this is real traffic” exposes things you didn’t even think to monitor early on.\n\nEither way, this is a great example of demand pulling the product instead of the other way around.",

I’d be curious how you’re handling failover logic, provider pricing pass-through vs margin, and long-term differentiation once the big clouds inevitably push harder on “one API to rule them all.” still, clearly you’ve hit a real pain point, and that’s not easy to do in this space.",

The verbal agreement that we ultimately acted on was spec work to the SaaS that went to a ledger which would ultimately be his \"buy-in\" to the business, or a debt he'd be able to collect on at some point if we decided to not bring him in as a co-founder.  Exited that before it was got big, (around 1M ARR). When we started this one, I thought I knew everything, but I knew next to nothing, we just kept going until we figured it out, it was hard and time consuming. \n\nSecond time, started early 40's, first co-founder was a great friend, but his life blew up right after we got started, so he phased out and I spent months searching for a new co-founder. Found an experienced engineer with experience at multiple companies with names you'd recognize, had the option to be part time for less equity and full time for more, after a few months decided to focus on the project full time. In starting this business, I have a wealth of experience and knowledge I've gained over my career that's allowed us to shortcut so many things, it's been way, way easier this time around, but still a challenge.  The experience and knowledge I have was why I was able to attract a high quality co-founder. \n\nBuilding a successful startup that will last is \\_really\\_ hard, it takes privilege or incredible grit, and sometimes both.  You have to be a little crazy to found a Startup, because you need to accept that all the odds are stacked against you and the vast majority of people who go down this route fail,  but you're going to be the exception to the rule. \n\nTrying to \"own it all\" can work, but statistically one technical and one non-technical founder gives you the best chances of success.\n\nI've seen some commentary in the thread complaining about non-technical founders just having an \"idea\" and this is for sure a problem, there are many people who want to be the non-technical founder, but what that means to them is they have an idea and someone else does all the work...this is just the same thing as \"technical co-founder who can't get it done, either out of lack of time or experience\" but for the non-technical co-founder. Everyone needs to bring value or it's not going to work long term, founder conflict is what kills most startups before they reach their potential. \n\nThe honest truth is, while solid technical development really makes things so much easier, unless you are building the next Netflix , Facebook etc. (which only .00000001% of people are, and you will know that you are. If you aren't sure...you aren't), a working product is more important than a technically adept one. \n\nThe biggest myth I had when I started in this career many years ago was the belief that all these companies have built really really solid software products, but somehow I will be able to build a better one, the reality is there are many, many, MANY products that make millions and millions which are an absolute train wreck shit show under the hood. \n\nPresale revenue can be very hard depending on the space, but yes as a technical co-founder you need to have confidence that the non-technical co-founder is going to bring value, but honestly their most important jobs is going to be to sell the product, so if they can't sell you on it....\n\nAlso, make sure you get a proper vesting agreement in place before you really get going, it can save you a lot of heartache if someone decides to walk away after a few years but you want to keep going.",

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://temporal.io/) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing).\n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://mention.click/)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

What we got wrong is the fact that after this, LinkedIn has changed its TOS, and put previously public data behind the login screen, which has made public data not public anymore.\n\nReddit, on the other hand, does not require you to log in to see posts and comments.\n\nThis is a controversial topic and selective law application, in my opinion.\n\nSince Google, Perplexity, etc, scrape the entirety of the internet to power their products. \n\nYou could argue that they are pushing progress and evolving the tech (that's somewhat true), but in the end of the day, they are businesses whose main goal is to earn money. \n\nI think that scraping people's data or UGC, eventually making them lose money (like scraping Medium posts protected by the paywall), is piracy; LinkedIn is a different thing. At least in my opinion.\n\nFor us, we decided to stop playing this game of scrapping, even though the internet wouldn't be the place we know right now without it.",

We invested 1.5 years, probably around 10k USD, in really stupid things like getting a legal entity, paying an accountant to file our taxes, paying for the designs, servers, etc.  What did I get from that project? nothing, except the experience. \n\nI learned lots of cool things about PostgreSQL (we were doing PostgreSQL replication, kind of FiveTran), and met cool people. I met a guy, and we have been making all the projects mentioned in this post together since then. We got along only because of that first failed project I had. I think I even landed a good 9-5 job because of that project.\n\nI remember I sucked at the interview (live coding), so in the end, I just acknowledged that and said something like \"I know I sucked, but here is my GitHub, there is a project I worked on. All the code is mine there,\" and I think that could have played a role in their decision.\n\nSo, think about whether you should stop making it, and see if you can sell it. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is stop at the right time and work on damage limitation.\n\nHope that helps at least somehow.",

The goal is to document everything: wins, losses, learnings, progress. This helps build trust in the eyes of people watching and also allows you to build an engaged and targeted audience aligned with your product\n\n\\-> LinkedIn outbound: 10–30 messages per day. Don’t do direct sales outreach, ask for feedback instead “I saw that you do X, do you face problem Y? We’re building Z”\n\n\\-> Cold email: send 20 to 100 emails per day. Of course, the money is in the follow-ups. You’ll start getting replies from the 3rd–4th follow-up, so put a strong focus on follow-ups and expect nothing from the first email\n\n\\-> Comments on X and Reddit: you need to do at least 10 comments on each platform. You can comment under posts like “I’m looking for an alternative to (your competitor)” and subtly mention your tool. You really need to focus on substance in everything you comment—the value in your comment should be your top priority\n\n\\-> Last thing to implement is to stick to this strategy for several months, minimum 6 months. If you only do it for 1 or 2 months, you won’t have time to see the compounding effects. This is one of the most important things: consistency and perseverance\n\nYou’ll see that the first days will be tough, but little by little it will start to pay off. Really trust this strategy and the compounding effects!\n\nFeel free to tell me what you would add on your side!",

Try 1) talk to the market daily by messaging 20–30 ideal users to learn problems, not sell, which sharpens your ICP fast, and 2) build in public daily to compound trust and feedback. I built SignalScouter, a founder-led service that finds Reddit posts where people seek solutions and generates founder-style responses, solving the “where are they asking” problem; we got 89 waitlist signups in 2 days and 10k+ post views in a few days. Would love feedback or to connect if you try it, and ngl it can help nab those first 50 beta users — good luck.",

When someone says \"this is useless\" or ghosts you after a demo, that's actually more valuable content than success posts. People relate to struggle way more than highlight reels.\n\nThe 500 emails/day thing is aggressive but yeah, it works if your offer is dialed in. The key is making sure you're not doing that before you've talked to enough people. Cold email with a half-baked message just burns your domain reputation.\n\nAlso curious about the Reddit part. 3-4 posts per week feels like a lot depending on the sub. Some communities will flag you as spammy if you're posting that often, especially if it's all about your product. Are you spacing those across different subreddits or going deep in one?\n\nThe 6 month minimum is the real filter. Most people give up at month 2 when they hit the first plateau.",

          "text": "Yes. I use my product [somraslabs.com](http://somraslabs.com) a lot. It provides cloud based AI enhancement for videos and images at fraction of the cost as compared to existing products that ask for $20/monthly subscriptions.  Here are my detailed use-cases :  \n  \nI upscale my recorded gameplay to 4k at 60fps with youtube specific settings for my gaming channel to preserve maximum quality after upload and to create high quality crisp thumbnails too. Youtube only allows 720p thumbnail but all assets that go into it are upscaled by 4x before making thumb appear crisp and it helps me with conversion. Have seen conversion go from 4% to above 10% with just good quality thumbs and video as the niche is so competitive.\n\nEnhancing memes as most of them are pretty bad quality.\n\nOther than this I have used it while digitising my old albums. Clicked picks manually from the album and then removed grain or corrected blur as per need. Then as a final step increased their resolution by 4x to remove any left out noise and turn them crisp.\n\nIf there is an old movie or anime or a cartoon ( yeah for nostalgic purposes ) that I liked too much, I run it through my product to watch it in good quality. Sometimes I screen record youtube for this purpose.\n\n  \nMy brother is a photographer, so he uses it to quality correct some of his images. And boy he is a total fanatic about preserving the original details. The feedback comes in as really harsh but is useful. So I keep giving him free credits. ( which he will take from me anyways )\n\n\n\nI in-fact created this product for myself, used it for many months. So finally decided to make it public with a web interface and some polishing changes.\n\nDisclaimer : Yes I am sharing my product here for visibility. But the use-cases mentioned are 100% true. Please feel free to ask for any questions.",

Felt amazing\r\nwatching the numbers climb. Finally getting traction after six months of building in\r\nsilence.\n\r\nThen reality hit. Three weeks later I have 8 paid customers. Less than 1% conversion\r\nfrom all those signups. Most people tried it once and never came back. The Product\r\nHunt spike is completely gone and I'm back to getting maybe 2 signups per day.\n\r\nWhat I learned is Product Hunt gives you visibility but not necessarily customers. The\r\npeople browsing Product Hunt are mostly other founders, makers, and people who love\r\ntrying new tools. They're not necessarily your target customer and they're definitely not\r\nin buying mode when they're just browsing cool new products.\n\r\nThe 8 customers I did get didn't come from Product Hunt. They came from a tiny post I\r\nmade in a niche subreddit two days after the launch where I just showed what the\r\nproduct actually does instead of hyping it up. Made a quick walkthrough with Trupeer\r\nshowing a real use case and shared it there. Those people signed up already knowing if\r\nthey needed it or not.\n\r\nI'm not saying Product Hunt is useless. The brand awareness probably helps long term.\r\nGetting featured looks good. But if you're counting on it to be your big launch moment\r\nthat floods you with customers, adjust expectations. It's more like getting a bunch of\r\npeople to look at your thing for 30 seconds and then most of them moving on with their\r\nlives.",

(Reddit, Twitter/X, Facebook groups, SEO, cold outreach, Product Hunt, etc.)\n* Did you pivot, change messaging, or just keep shipping?\n\n**Feel free to share your product link** and briefly explain:\n\n* Where you launched\n* What actually worked\n* What you wish you had known earlier\n\nHopefully this thread can help anyone who’s currently stuck at “launched but no users” feel less alone and find a clearer path forward.\n\nLooking forward to your stories",

Cause a genuine market analysis exposes potential customers who are desperate for a solution. If there are no people in distress about the pain point your product is solving, then you should not launch it.\n2. **Free Trial**: It is important to have users (any kind of) to get feedback on atleast general usability. Please please please give out free trials. Also keep a discord page for people to have an accessible medium to rant in. Use reddit, twitter etc to reach people for free trials.\n3. **Content Marketing:** Write blogs, make youtube tutorials, write articles, engage with communities in twitter, reddit, discord of other products, basically share your knowledge. Knowledge shared is knowledge and users gained.  One of the most effective ways is latch on to a product that is being widely used, is trendy and is not flooded with tutorials to use as your helper. Eg if your product is a SaaS which interacts with LLMs, you can make a high quality project tutorial using LangChain and insert your product as one of the prerequisites for the project to work. This works exceptionally well, because your videos get traction, your product gets traction because users following your video will need to use your product to proceed, creates tutorial resources for your product and gives you user insights and feedback. If everything goes well, you may also be able to hook people to your product because everybody is using your tutorial to learn the other trendy one.\n4. **Dont be users obsessed, be product obsessed:** For the love of god dont think user popularity means better product or success. Actual users are the ones who are desperate for your product because their own jobs or commitments depend on yours. They will rant, be brutal, downgrade you because they are desperate for your solution to work. And they dont care how many users you have, they are more concerned about the quality of the product. If you optimize for user traction, there is a high probability you will fail them. These important users will drive long term consumer growth. The SaaS world is a graveyard of products that had huge traction due to to maybe being featured in Product Hunt etc, and then they die out as quickly as they gained traction, because real customers are not in vibrant and savvy parts of the internet. They are in boring old blogs and articles.\n\n\n\nPS: This post has not been written using AI. Protect our community against the dead internet.",

The magic is niche communities (like this one, ProductHunt for tech, Slack communities, etc). Your first 100 users won't come from Twitter randos.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*The GTM pivoting\\*\\* - Once launched, talk to the people who DO sign up obsessively. Don't change the product yet. Change your messaging/positioning first. Most products aren't the problem - the pitch is.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Content + Social proof\\*\\* - Share the journey. People love supporting underdogs. Weekly updates on what you're learning, not just what you're building.\n\n\n\nBiggest mistake I see: waiting for perfect product before talking to users.

You need to actively seek out your target audience where they naturally congregate and directly engage with their stated problems.

Offer to solve specific problems for early users in exchange for honest feedback, which provides invaluable insights that cannot be gained through internal testing alone.

      "text": "My SaaS was stuck at 40 users for 5 months straight. I kept building new features thinking that's what would make it take off. Added integrations, built a mobile app, created advanced analytics nobody asked for. Spent every evening coding, barely talked to the users I already had. Growth stayed completely flat. Everything shifted when I forced myself to stop coding completely for June and just scheduled calls with users. Reached out to all 40, got 23 to agree to 20-minute chats. Asked them why they signed up, what problem they were trying to solve, what was working and what wasn't. Those conversations were uncomfortable at first because I'm way more comfortable coding than talking, but they revealed something huge.\n\nTurns out the core feature I built was solving their problem fine, but my onboarding was confusing and they didn't understand half the features I'd added. Three people thought the product was broken because they couldn't figure out how to do something basic that was buried in settings. Five people were using it completely differently than I imagined, in ways that made way more sense for their workflow. I spent July fixing onboarding based on those conversations. Made the setup process way simpler, removed features nobody mentioned using, added one small thing that 8 people specifically asked for. Didn't build anything clever or complex, just listened and fixed the obvious problems they told me about. August I did 10 more user calls with new signups to understand their experience fresh.\n\nGrowth completely changed. Went from 40 users in May to 65 in August, 98 in September, 147 in November. Now at 203 users with 18% converting to paid versus 5% before. The difference wasn't building more, it was understanding what people actually needed versus what I assumed they wanted. I still do 4-5 user calls every week now, it's become the most valuable hours I spend. Found this pattern studying 300+ founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful founders talked to users constantly while struggling founders built in isolation. Made me realize my natural instinct to just code more was actually preventing growth.",

Even more for mission-critical systems or those where rolling out bugfixes is very costly (e.g. airplanes, banking, unpatchable embedded systems).\n\nSure, you can demand more testing from your developers, but you're:\n\n* Paying extra: Devs usually cost more than QA at the same level of experience\n* Doing a worse job: Devs know how to build stuff and think constructively. QA know how to look for holes and think destructively. Completely different mindset.\n* Slowing down development.\n\n3-4 days cycle times aren't necessarily a problem, you can accommodate that by changing your release strategy to once every two weeks or so. However, with your dev to QA ratio, you're likely building up more and more QA debt over time since they won't have the capacity to write and maintain test specifications, test data, and automated tests all while spending most of their time executing manual regression tests.\n\nFrom your post I'm assuming you're an engineering manager or product manager, is that right? If you're the CTO, you can push back on the CFO and make sure you get more QA before expanding dev further. Otherwise you can raise that concern with your CTO.  \nDo you have an experienced senior QA who knows how to define a suitable test strategy and coordinate QA work overall? If you don't that might be another important factor; QA without a strong leader is just playing catch-up rather than taking ownership of quality.\n\n  \nFeel free to DM if you want to discuss any of this in more detail; it's a bit tricky to diagnose like this without relying on guesswork.",

Many businesses suffer because they don't understand supply and demand tension. AKA, your product has no HOT BURNING OFFER!!! that grabs your Ideal client by the throat and forces them to pay attention because you have done the one thing that all great businesses have done.\n\nSolve a real pressing, hair on fire problem for your prospect or created the type of transformation people desire.\n\nIf your product doesn't have demand attached to it and it's just another nice to have product then you've already failed and if you truly desire to get ahead, and make all your effort worth it, you're going to need a \n\ncult level belief in your product and a deep understanding of what it does and how it helps users. \n\nI'm not talking about the features of your product or how cool it is, but the core benefits it offers.\n\nIf you can't list in great detail, the exact pressing issue your clients face, how they feel, what's their fear, worry, aspirations and desire then you won't be able to create a proper product that fit those needs and drive attention in the marketplace.\n\nMany start-ups I have consulted created nice to have products and commoditized services and they try to go-to-market but the product is dead!!. \n\nNo one Desires it. Demand is low, churn is high, retention keeps dropping and you're left helpless and crying on social about your wasted time and effort.\n\nI would love to share more on this but I am short on time and I am a caught up with building a high level ICP system for B2b clients. \n\nPS. Take marketing for what it is. A distribution and creational source that allows you to connect with folks for different reasons. to build in public only means that you're connecting with user/clients who love your offer because you communicated how it helped people and why they stay.",

This is a lesson learned for you. \n\nPosting every day isn't fake. Building in public isn't fake, but know this, it really only works if your public cares about how it is being built. They will only care if how it is being built affects how they build around it. Basically, only products for developers are good \"build in public\" types of things. \n\nI have one SaaS that makes money. I didn't \"build in public\" so much as I \"built with my customers\". I found my customers, setup an email invite, and when I got to 100 emails, I created the authentication for the app and installed a forum (Discourse) that used SSO from the authentication. The users then started chatting with me about what they wanted to see in the application. \n\nMy only regret is that it is a B2C, but I found the customers for it first so, that's what got built. I had an e-commerce store which was making money until my primary vendor decided to start selling on Amazon and locked me out. The marketing for that e-commerce store was here on Reddit, which is why I went with a forum for the B2C SaaS. I have yet to try the forum trick with a B2B, but I think it will work the same.\n\nFind the customers first. Then have real conversations with them before you start building. Sometimes the conversations will be awkward because they will \"want a faster horse\" because they \"know how to use a horse\". It is a lot of \"I promise, I've done the research, this will be better.\" They will grumble but you will get them on your side by saving them time and money.",

Thought leadership does not mean posting every day or building in public if that feels fake. It can be as simple as writing thoughtful posts about problems you have already solved, or leaving supportive, insightful comments on other people’s posts where your experience is relevant.\n\nPick one or two channels and get good at them instead of spreading yourself thin. LinkedIn works well if you like long form thinking. Substack works if you prefer writing quietly and letting people find you over time. Consistency matters more than volume.\n\nMost early traction comes from trust, not reach. When people see you helping and thinking clearly, they get curious on their own.",

We already get annual summaries for music, spending, and fitness, but a huge portion of modern life happens in chats and rarely gets surfaced in a meaningful way.\n\nBefore going further, I wanted to sanity-check the concept with other builders here:\n\n* Does this feel like a novelty feature, or something people would actually return to?\n* Where do you think the line is between “interesting insight” and “too invasive”?\n* If you were building this, would you focus more on personal reflection or shareable outputs?\n\nNot pitching, just genuinely curious how others here would evaluate this kind of product from a SaaS perspective especially around retention and trust.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or pushback to help make this even better.",

Maybe less \"look at my stats\" and more \"huh, I didn't realize I was messaging way less during Q3—was I burned out?\"\n\nThe invasiveness line is tricky too. I think people are fine with stats (message count, peak hours), but the moment it feels like it's \\*reading\\* their conversations (tone analysis, word clouds), it might cross into creepy territory even if it's technically their own data.\n\nCurious how you're thinking about the privacy/trust angle.

So as a SaaS, the biggest question for me is: who pays for it and *why*? If it’s for end users, I’m not convinced many would subscribe. If it’s for businesses (communities, apps, internal teams, creators, etc.), it starts to make more sense.\n\nWhere I think this works best is if “Chat Wrapped” is just the surface layer. Underneath, it could be real analytics: trends over time, engagement patterns, sentiment shifts, power users, onboarding drop-offs, etc. The wrapped becomes the shareable output of something that’s useful year-round.\n\nAlso worth thinking about data access and privacy. Pulling chat data from platforms is often the hardest part, and users are (rightfully) sensitive about summaries of private conversations—even anonymized ones.\n\nTL;DR: fun idea, but I’d validate hard whether it’s a feature vs. a product. If you can anchor it to a real, recurring analytics use case, the wrapped aspect becomes a nice bonus instead of the whole business.\n\nJust my 2 cents—curious what angle you’re leaning toward.",

Building in public to get initial traction: I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. Reaching out to influencers with organic traffic and sponsoring them: I knew good content leads to people trying my app but I didn't have time to write content all the time so the next natural step was to pay people to post content for me. I just doubled down on what already worked.\n3. Word of mouth: I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. Removing all formatting from my emails: I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\nWhat didn't work:\n\n1. Writing articles and trying to rank on Google: Turns out my product isn't something people are searching for on Google.\n2. Affiliate system: I've had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it's extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n3. Instagram: I tried instagram marketing for a short while, managed to get some views, absolutely no conversions.\n4. Building features no one wants (obviously): I've wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I'm not going to try any new marketing channels until I'm doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can't stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won't talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

Slow, steady growth, 100% organic, driven by:  \n\\- SEO  \n\\- GEO  \n\\- Communities like Discord (people started refering our tool)   \n  \n18 months later → $1,000 MRR. At that point, we decided to sell it and refocus on marketing automation tools.  \n  \nDecember 2025. Sold for $20,000 (roughly 2× ARR)  \n  \nNot huge. Not life-changing money. No Forbes article.  \n  \nBut I’m extremely proud of the team and the journey. We shipped a tool in a week, grew it organically, and exited it, everything very smoothly, end to end.  \n  \nNext for us?  \nScaling our LinkedIn automation tool to follow the same path… with a few more digits hopefully 😉🤞  \n  \nMy learnings: \n\n* Acquire is a great marketplace to sell micro SaaS\n* organic growth > \"fake\" paid MRR \n* independant stripe account is mandatory \n* 3 months minimum to sell it\n* Selling an asset isn't the same as selling a company \n* Until $100,00 ARR, it's NOT a x5 ARR valuation \n\nKeep it up, SaaS builders!

At this size buyers are paying for stability and clean numbers, not big future promises.\n\nInterested to see how the same approach plays out with the LinkedIn automation tool, especially now that distribution is more intentional from day one.\n\nThanks for sharing the details, this kind of transparency is actually useful.",

But the conversion to paid is… painfully low.\n\nI’m starting to wonder if I’ve accidentally built something that’s too complete for free.\n\nRight now, free users can experience most of the core value. The paid plan mainly adds convenience, higher limits, and access to more advanced features. In theory, that should be enough but clearly it isn’t creating urgency.\n\nI’m trying to figure out where the real problem is:\n\nIs my free plan too generous?\n\nAm I failing to clearly communicate the paid value?\n\nOr are users solving their “one-time problem” and leaving?\n\nMy starting plan is for 5dollar which is 1/5th of the industry level I am in. It's one of the most affordable plans. \n\nhttps://www.zolly.dev no code tool where you can edit like canva, have multiple AI models and one click publish. Everything for free. \n\nFor those of you who’ve successfully converted free users:\n\nWhat was the single biggest change that moved the needle?\n\nDid you reduce free features, add paywalls, or change onboarding/messaging?\n\nAt what point did you realize the free plan was hurting more than helping?\n\nI’m not looking for generic growth hacks genuinely trying to learn from real experiences. Any blunt or uncomfortable feedback is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance. ",

Try tightening free limits so upgrades feel necessary for real work, rewrite paid messaging to showcase saved time and outcomes, and add onboarding that drives repeat use so it's not a one-off fix. If scaling outreach is the blocker I built SignalScouter, it finds relevant Reddit threads and drafts founder-style replies you can post to nudge conversions; would love feedback or to connect if you try it out.

Friends and family help with testing, but they usually don’t give you real signal.\n\nWhat’s worked best is picking one very specific user type and hanging out where they already spend time online Reddit communities, niche Discords, Twitter replies, or even small forums. Talk about the problem openly, share what you’re building, and invite feedback instead of pushing the product. The first few users usually come from those conversations.\n\nI work closely with early-stage founders at Coldframe Growth Co, and the common pattern I see is that traction starts once founders stop trying to “launch” and start treating distribution as learning. The goal early on isn’t scale, it’s clarity on who actually cares and why.\n\nCurious what kind of B2C user you’re building for. The channel really depends on that.",

If you plan to use Reddit for getting your first users, I HIGHLY recommend you use a tool like Bazzly which will help you be consistent in getting your product out there.",

Friends and family are great for initial feedback but not really scalable for actual user acquisition. What really worked for me was getting involved in relevant communities especially on Reddit. Id search for discussions related to my apps niche and offer helpful advice subtly mentioning my app if it fit the conversation. It was time consuming af and I used a bot to scan for keywords but half of the results were noise. The good thing is the users you get are usually passionate and really engaged and if they like the app they tend to promote it themselves by mentioning it in other places in reddit. Since I hate wasting time I actually built a tool to automate finding these conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn it filters out all the irrelevant stuff and just shows you the discussions where you can actually make a difference its the reason I saw your post today. It started as an internal thing but it turned into my main project now I almost neglected my first app because of it lol If you think something like that could help you out Im happy to share it with you.",

For most B2C side projects, the first users come from places where you can have context and trust, not ads or broad social posts. the fastest path for early traction is almost always direct distribution to a very specific group. Start with people who already feel the problem sharply. if your product solves something you personally experience, you already know where those people hang out  specific subreddits, Discord servers, niche forums, Twitter replies, or even comment sections on YouTube videos about the problem. don’t “launch.” Show up, talk about the problem, and mention you built something to solve it. early users respond to relevance, not polish. friends and coworkers are useful, but mostly as testers, not real validation. They’ll be nice. What you want are users who don’t care about you and still choose to use the product. a good move is to DM people who are already complaining about the problem online and ask if they want early access. keep the message short, personal, and specific  no pitch deck energy. social media works only if you treat it as conversation, not promotion.",

A lot of teams use them way too early because it feels “grown up,” not because they’re getting real value. If you’re barely touching the features, that’s usually the signal.

Customers still needed support. Features still needed building. The business didn't feel different just because a number crossed a threshold.\n\nTook me a few days to realize that the flatness was actually the right feeling. The milestone wasn't the point. The point was building something sustainable. Something that works. Something I could keep doing.\n\nIf I'd felt euphoric at $100K I would have crashed when the next goal wasn't as satisfying. If reaching the milestone was the reward then what happens after. The flat feeling meant I was in it for the process not the checkpoints.\n\nNow I'm working toward other numbers but I hold them loosely. They're markers not destinations. The real satisfaction comes from the work itself. The customers helped. The problems solved. The small improvements compounding. The milestones are just evidence that the work is working. They're not the work itself.\n\nIf you're only happy when you hit goals you'll be unhappy most of the time. The journey is the whole thing. The numbers just tell you you're still on the path.\n\n",

Built the whole presentation in Gamma embedding it on the slides itself. Practiced until I could do it half asleep. Prepared answers for every question I could imagine. Still felt completely unprepared when the call started.\n\nFirst five minutes were rough. Voice was shaky. Talked too fast. Could see people multitasking on camera. Then I got to the live demo portion and something shifted. Showing real workflows in their context instead of abstract features made people lean in. Questions started coming. Engagement picked up. By the end people were asking when they could start using it.\n\nThey signed a company-wide contract two weeks later. $89K annual deal. The terrifying presentation was the unlock.

I practiced for days, got on the call with my manager, two people from the channel partner team, and the customer VP. I started the pitch and completely froze. I stumbled through the rest of it and vividly remember hearing myself speak in real time and knowing I sounded like an idiot.\n\nLuckily, the call was more a formality to get sign-off from the VP and do some minor price negotiation, but the weight of the moment froze me.\n\nAfterward, I had to debrief with the partner team. Jumped into the Teams meeting and caught them mid-conversation talking about how bad I did lol. Ended up closing the deal and several other big deals that year. All the others felt way easier after that call.\n\nA couple things I learned:\n\n1. Sometimes you just need to get the nerves out and do the new thing for the first time. There's no shortcut and the second time is always easier.\n2. The more public speaking I've done, the more I've leaned into this advice: never memorize flow, not a script. Practice off bullets and topics. Each delivery will be slightly different, but you'll remember the structure instead of straining to recall specific phrases. \n\nHopefully that helps someone!",

I think everyone underestimates how different it feels presenting to a crowd versus a small group. Your brain just processes it differently when you see that many faces.\n\nThe live demo saving it makes sense though. Features in a vacuum are boring. Features solving their actual problem in real time is what gets people to care.\n\nOne question: did you tailor the demo specifically to their workflows or did you keep it more general? I'm guessing you customized it since they'd already been using the product for 6 months, but curious how deep you went into their specific use cases versus showing broader capabilities.\n\nAlso, two weeks of prep for an 89K deal is absolutely worth it. Most people would wing it and wonder why they didn't close.",

Not because the idea is bad, but because I don’t want to lie to myself.\n\nWhat helped a bit was setting one honest checkpoint:\n“If this specific thing doesn’t happen by this date, I stop..and that’s okay.”\n\nThat alone brought some relief.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes the click is realizing it’s fine to walk away. Not as failure, just clarity.\n\nYou’re definitely not alone in this.",
