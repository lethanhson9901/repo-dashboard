Even if there are more builders then ever it doesn't mean every builder will build something good or could even find something worth while. Some people are meant to stay builders. Period.\n\nSolving issues and helping people with it is what people need.\n\nSay for example you make something that helps businesses:\n1. Save $5K in lost revenue\n2. Make an extra $5K recurring revenue\n3. Save then 2hrs/day\n4. Without any manual labor\n5. Nor physical or mental pain\n\nIf you find an idea that helps people save money, make money, save time, avoid effort, escape mental or physical pain? Then you've got a winner. You just need to lay down the data and show them what it can do and explain that it helps them make more revenue and the other things.\n\nThat's what today's builders miss. They build something that has so little impact in someone's life and expect them to be so hot and horny to pay. Making money is an exchange of value, you give me something that I see valuable, you give me money. \n\nPeople miss the value part and focus on money.\n\nSo relax, more builders means just more slop in the feild. Focus on learning extra skills now. Like sales, product creation, marketing, etc. these are the ones that make or break a product",

      "text": "Most SaaS founders think YouTube only works if your videos get thousands of views. \n\nThat's wrong. And it's costing them their best growth channel.\n\n1,400 paying subscribers. Zero ad spend. \n\nMy videos average 100-200 views. I recently broke this system down on \n\n[Starter Story](https://youtu.be/W48emwbUlUE?si=fWaV7ItogeOGGmWY)\n\nYouTube isn't a views game. It's a search engine. And if you treat it like one, even tiny view counts can drive serious revenue.\n\nI'm going to break down the exact system what I call the Content Flywheel Growth Engine   \nand fuel for this engine is Customer Pain\n\n# Why low-view videos outperform viral content for SaaS\n\nHere's the core insight:\n\n>100 views from people actively searching for a solution are worth more than 100,000 views from people passively scrolling.\n\nWhen someone searches \"how to create a full wrap mug mockup in Photoshop\" at 2 AM, they're not browsing. They have a problem right now. If your video solves it, they don't just watch, they buy.\n\nThis is the difference between content-for-audience and content-for-customers. Almost every YouTube strategy you see online is optimizing for the first. SaaS founders should be optimizing for the second.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice: 63% of my YouTube views come from search. Of that, 26% comes from Google directly, not YouTube's own search bar.   \n  \n\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDGO-xbkAECPMV.jpg)\n\n63% People coming for search. 26.4% coming from google search\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDHBQZbwAAWg0B.jpg)\n\nGoogle Search accounts for 73% of external search\n\nPeople are Googling their problem, my video appears in the results, they watch it, and they become customers.\n\nThe videos don't go viral. They go useful. And useful compounds in a way that viral never does.\n\n# The Customer Pain Content Flywheel\n\nThe system has three steps, and each step feeds the next:\n\n1. Harvest customer pain.\n2. Turn pain into tutorials.\n3. Turn tutorials into search assets.\n\nThen the assets bring new customers, who bring new pain, and the cycle compounds.\n\n# Step 1: Harvest customer pain\n\nDon't brainstorm content ideas. Harvest them.\n\nEvery piece of content should come from a real person with a real problem. There are four places to find them:\n\n1. Communities where your customers already hang out.\n\nFacebook groups, Skool communities, Discord servers, Reddit.\n\nDon't go there to promote. Observe. Look for:\n\n* Questions that repeat every few days\n* Posts with unusually high engagement\n* Long comment threads, these signal unresolved pain\n\nEvery repeated problem goes into a running list. That list is your content calendar.\n\n2. New user onboarding emails.\n\nAs soon as someone signs up, send an email asking if they want a custom tutorial for their use case.\n\nMost founders would never do this for a low-priced, self-serve product. But here's what happens: users reply describing exactly what they're trying to do, where they're stuck, and what confuses them.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDIDgVbIAIaSyJ.jpg)\n\nThey hand you longtail content ideas for free.\n\nThe key is framing: \"Want me to make a tutorial for your specific use case?\" gets honest responses. A generic feedback survey doesn't.\n\n3. Support tickets and live conversations.\n\nThis is probably the highest value source of all.\n\nWhen a customer reaches out, don't just resolve the ticket. Ask them to share their actual files. Then record a screen share tutorial solving their specific problem.\n\nDo this consistently and you'll build a library of private support recordings, real edge cases, real language, real frustrations that never show up in keyword tools.\n\nOver time, I've recorded 1,500+ of these.\n\nMany of my best public tutorials are simply cleanedup versions of private support videos. The content already exists. You're just making it public.\n\n4. YouTube comments in your niche.\n\nComments are unfiltered objections.\n\nFind videos in your niche with a high comment-to-view ratio. That ratio signals a content gap, people watched, but their problem wasn't fully solved.\n\nScrape the comments. List every objection, confusion, and unanswered question. Then create content that fills those gaps directly.\n\nSome of my best-performing videos came from exactly this approach.\n\n# Step 2: Turn pain into tutorials\n\nOnce the pain is clear, creating the content becomes almost automatic.\n\nThe rule: create content for one specific person with one specific problem.\n\nBecause the pain comes from real conversations , not brainstorming,  you already know the exact words they use, the exact step where they get stuck, and the exact outcome they want.\n\nThis changes everything about how you create:\n\n* One problem per video. Don't bundle multiple topics. Solve one thing completely.\n* Use their language, not yours. If customers say \"full wrap mockup,\" that's your title, not \"comprehensive mockup automation tutorial.\"\n* Mass appeal is not the goal. A video that solves a real problem for one customer will solve it for hundreds of others searching for the same thing.\n\nThe content practically writes itself when the source material is real customer pain.\n\n# Step 3: Turn tutorials into search assets\n\nThis is where most founders leave money on the table.\n\nThey upload and hope the algorithm picks it up. That's a losing strategy for low view, high intent content.\n\nInstead, treat every video as a long term search asset. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's recommendation engine.\n\nHere's why: if you want to rank on Google with a blog post, you need backlinks, domain authority, and months of effort. With video, the bar is dramatically lower.\n\nA well structured tutorial targeting a specific search query can rank on page one of Google with zero backlinks. Searches like \"mug mockup full wrap\" or \"wall art mockup\" surface YouTube videos directly in Google results.\n\nThe SEO itself is simple:\n\n* Put the keyword in the title\n* Put it in the description\n* Address it clearly in the first 30 seconds of the video\n* Add structured chapters so both Google and AI tools can parse the content\n\nThat's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nEvery video becomes a permanent acquisition asset that works while you sleep.\n\n>Pain → tutorial → search asset → new customer → new pain → repeat. That's the flywheel.\n\n# \"I don't have time for content\"\n\nThis is the most common pushback. And it's based on a false assumption, that content creation is a separate workload.\n\nIt isn't. Not with this system.\n\nThe support recording you made for one customer? That becomes a public tutorial with 20 minutes of editing.\n\nThe question someone asked in a Facebook group? That becomes a video title.\n\nThe comment thread under a competitor's video? That becomes your content plan for the month.\n\nYou're not adding work. You're recycling work you're already doing into assets that compound.  \n  \n\n\n# Why this matters even more in 2026\n\nThere's a shift happening right now that makes this system significantly more valuable than it was even a year ago.\n\nAccording to \n\n[Ahrefs' research on AI citations](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-cited-domains-ai-mode/)\n\n  \n, YouTube is the second most cited domain in Google's AI Mode , with 961,938 mentions, accounting for 9.51% of all AI citations. Only Wikipedia ranks higher.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDKzi3aYAEVTbQ.jpg)\n\nAnd this isn't just a Google thing. YouTube is also the sixth most-cited domain by ChatGPT.\n\n OpenAI trained GPT-4 on over a million hours of YouTube transcriptions. YouTube content is baked into both the input and output of every major AI assistant.\n\nWhat this means is simple: when someone asks an AI tool a question, the answer increasingly comes from YouTube. But not from all YouTube videos, from videos with clear structure, proper chapters, and well-written descriptions.\n\nIf your videos don't have that, they're invisible to AI. And that's a growing share of how your potential customers will find solutions in 2026.\n\nThis is one of the problems I'm working on solving. I'm building youTube tools specifically for founders and operators who use video as a revenue channel. \n\n# The framework, summarized\n\nFor founders who want the quick version:\n\nHarvest → Find real customer pain from communities, onboarding emails, support tickets, and YouTube comments.\n\nCreate → Make one video per problem, using the customer's own language. Solve one thing completely.\n\nOptimize → Treat every video as a search asset. Keyword in title, description, and first 30 seconds. Add chapters. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's algorithm.\n\nCompound → New customers bring new pain. New pain creates new content. The flywheel accelerates.\n\nStop chasing views. Start solving problems on camera.\n\nThe founders who figure this out early won't need to buy ads for a very long time.\n\nIf this framework clicked for you, share it with a founder who's been told they need to \"go viral\" to grow. They don't.\n\nEdit - I didn’t expect this to resonate this much.\n\nA lot of people are asking whether this only works for certain types of businesses.\n\nIt doesn’t work for every business.\n\nHere's where I have seen it work/or should work\n\n-Shopify apps\n-WooCommerce plugins\n-Webflow tools\n-Zapier-style automation tools\n-AI tools that require prompts or workflows\n-Design plugins (Figma / Photoshop / Canva)\n-Technical B2B SaaS\n\nExample: TinyHost an Indie Product, already does $1M ARR using the same strategy.\n\nP.S. I’ve started writing deeper breakdowns of this system in a newsletter for founders using YouTube as a revenue channel. It’s linked in my profile if useful.",

The shift from \"content for audience\" to \"content for customers\" is something we had to learn the hard way too.  \n  \nOne thing that's underrated in your framework is the speed at which you can validate demand. When someone replies to your onboarding email with a specific use case, you already know there's at least one person who needs that solution. Make the video, send it to them first, and their reaction tells you immediately if it's worth publishing wider.  \n  \nWe started doing something similar with screen recordings for sales calls. Instead of generic demos, we'd record specific solutions to prospects' problems. The conversion rate jumped because they could see exactly how it worked for their situation, not some hypothetical scenario.  \n  \nThe support ticket approach is brilliant because you're essentially getting paid twice for the same work. Once when you solve it for that customer, and again every time that video brings in someone new with the same problem.  \n  \nWhat's your process for deciding which support recordings are worth turning into public tutorials versus keeping private?",

      "text": "I have a PhD in bioinformatics. I can write Python scripts that process genomic data. I cannot, for the life of me, build a web app. I don't know React. I didn't know what Tailwind was until 6 months ago. I still Google \"how to center a div\" at least once a week.\n\nAnd yet I launched a SaaS 25 days ago that now has 2,000+ users, 100+ paying customers, and about $1K MRR. No co-founder, no agency, no bootcamp. Just me, Claude, Cursor, and a mass of copy-pasted Stack Overflow answers that somehow compiles.\n\nPeople call it \"vibe coding.\" I call it \"I don't understand half of my own codebase but the tests pass.\" The product is [Plottie](https://ai.plottie.art) — an AI tool that creates publication-ready scientific figures. Researchers describe what they want, the AI generates it, and they can edit everything on an infinite canvas. Think Canva meets ChatGPT, but for scientific papers.\n\nHere's everything I learned.\n\n## The Pixabay-to-Canva playbook (this was my best decision)\n\nBefore building the AI tool, I built a free discovery platform: [plottie.art](https://plottie.art). It's a searchable database of 100,000+ scientific figures scraped from open-access papers in Nature, Science, Cell, etc. Researchers can browse, search, and save figures for inspiration.\n\nWhy build this first? Because I had no idea if the AI product would work, and I needed traffic.\n\nThe discovery site took ~2 months to build. It started ranking on Google within weeks because it's genuinely useful — if you search for \"volcano plot examples\" or \"heatmap scientific figure,\" we show up. It now gets consistent organic traffic. Every page has a subtle nudge: \"Want to create a figure like this? Try Plottie AI →\"\n\nThis is essentially the Pixabay → Canva model:\n- **Pixabay**: Free stock photos, massive SEO traffic\n- **Canva**: The paid product that Pixabay users naturally graduate to\n\nFor us:\n- **plottie.art**: Free figure discovery, SEO traffic\n- **ai.plottie.art**: The AI creator that discovery users convert to\n\nThe discovery site now drives new users to the AI product every single day, and I spend $0 on ads. If I were starting over, I'd build the free SEO content product first every time. It's the most underrated SaaS growth hack — give away something genuinely useful, let Google do the distribution, and make the paid product the natural next step.\n\n## The paid beta: don't test for free, test for money\n\nWhen the AI tool was ready for testing, I didn't do a free beta. I charged half price from day one.\n\nHere's why: Free users will tell you \"this is great!\" and never come back. Paying users — even at $6/month — will tell you exactly what's broken, because they expect it to work. The feedback quality is completely different.\n\nI recruited on Twitter and a few research communities. 97 people joined at 50% off. Some of the best product decisions came from these 97 people:\n\n- They told me the chat-based UI was broken (I was copying ChatGPT's layout — chat on the left, figure on the right). Turns out researchers need to see 8-24 figures side by side, not one at a time. I scrapped it and built an infinite canvas instead.\n- They told me AI output needed to be editable. My V1 was generate → export → done. Researchers hated it. They need to tweak exact colors for journal guidelines, adjust font sizes for figure legends. AI gets you 80%, but the last 20% is what reviewers actually care about.\n- They told me they wanted diagrams, not just data plots. I built for bar charts and heatmaps. They flooded me with requests for flowcharts, pathway diagrams, and scientific illustrations.\n\nEvery one of these would have taken months longer to discover with a free beta. When someone pays, they're invested enough to actually tell you the truth.\n\n## The numbers (raw, unfiltered)\n\n- **Launch date**: January 21, 2026\n- **Users**: ~2,000+ (organic only, $0 paid acquisition)\n- **Paying**: 100+\n- **MRR**: ~$1,000\n- **Infra cost**: $100-500/month (Cloudflare, Fly.io, Supabase, LLM APIs, E2B sandbox)\n- **Time to build**: ~6 months total (2 months discovery site, 4 months AI tool)\n- **My web dev background**: Zero. Literally none.\n\nThe conversion rate from free to paid is high. The problem isn't conversion. The problem is **top-of-funnel**: I need more people to know this exists.\n\n## What I got wrong\n\n**Marketing. All of it.**\n\nI'm a researcher. I know how to write papers, run experiments, and present at conferences. I do not know how to market a product. My \"marketing strategy\" for the first month was posting on Twitter and hoping. Spoiler: hoping is not a strategy.\n\nWhat's working so far:\n- **SEO via the discovery site** — this is 60%+ of our traffic. Researchers Google for figure types and find us.\n- **Word of mouth in labs** — one researcher tries it, tells their labmates. This is slow but the conversion quality is insane. When someone's PI recommends a tool, they don't comparison shop.\n- **Research communities** — posting genuine value (tutorials, figure tips) in places where researchers hang out, then mentioning Plottie when it's relevant.\n\nWhat's not working:\n- Cold outreach. Researchers ignore cold DMs harder than any market I've seen.\n- Paid ads. Tried briefly. CPA was ridiculous for a $12/month product.\n- Product Hunt. We got some traffic but almost zero conversion. The PH audience doesn't overlap with working scientists.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is distribution. The product-market fit signal is strong — people who find us tend to stay and pay. I just can't figure out how to get in front of 10x more researchers without spending money I don't have.\n\n## Vibe coding: honest assessment\n\nSince people will ask — yes, I built this entire thing with AI assistance. Here's the honest version:\n\n**What works**: Claude/Cursor can scaffold a full Next.js app, write Go API endpoints, build Python FastAPI services, and handle 90% of the frontend. For someone who can't code, this is genuinely life-changing. I went from \"I have an idea\" to \"I have a working product\" in months, not years.\n\n**What doesn't work**: Debugging. When something breaks in production at 2am and the error message is about a Supabase cookie authentication race condition, Claude gives you 5 different answers and 3 of them make it worse. I've spent entire weekends debugging issues that a real developer would fix in an hour.\n\n**The real cost**: My codebase is probably 40% great, 40% \"works but I don't know why,\" and 20% \"this will definitely break at scale and I'm choosing not to think about it.\" I have tech debt that I can't even identify because I don't have the knowledge to recognize it.\n\nBut here's the thing: the product is live, people are paying for it, and the figures they're creating are actually going into published papers. Imperfect code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't exist.\n\n## AMA\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n- Building for academic/research markets\n- The discovery-site-to-paid-product pipeline\n- Paid betas vs. free betas\n- Vibe coding a multi-service SaaS (frontend + backend + AI engine)\n- Anything else\n\n**Disclosure: I'm the founder of Plottie.** This is my product. Sharing because I genuinely want to compare notes with other founders, but I'm upfront about it.\n",

PostHog (Error Tracking + Session Replay)\n\nNot even for “analytics” in the spreadsheet sense. More like “ok, what exactly did the user do right before it broke?”. Watching a replay is often faster than reading logs or guessing. Funnels/retention are a nice bonus, but Replay is the superpower. Ever since they released Error Tracking, I never looked back at Sentry.\n\n2) AI SaaS safety rails\n\nThe boring stuff that saves weekends: rate limiting, a simple LLM cost kill-switch, and actually testing backup/restore once. Nobody wants to spend time on this… until they really, really do.\n\nOn distribution: your “free discovery → paid creator” thing is basically the right playbook. If conversion is decent, I’d just double down on programmatic SEO + internal linking between figure types (“if you searched volcano plot, here are 5 adjacent figure styles”) and “make one like this” templates. If you're seeing results, keep doing it :)\n\nIf you want, I can also do a quick free sanity check of your architecture and/or setup (auth/billing/background jobs/cost controls + what to measure first in PostHog). I'm a software architect by trade and would love to help you out, possibly in exchange for your feedback/advice as I'm a learning entrepreneur myself :)\n\nSide note: Could your app be used for AI-generating software architecture diagrams?

We built up a large library of real visualizations, when plottie create those plots, it can learn from the library to achieve professional story. You cannot benchmark it, but the satisfaction is good. 3. For all the plot types, especially for illustrations generated by AI, plottie supports manually edits. We can convert images to svg so users can editor elements including texts. it's even better then adobe illustrator. 4. we designed the UX as a canvas, it's very easy to organize the figures and export.",

Lowkey demoralizing it feels like im shouting in a void sometimes. Like what I like to do is give some advice and then say hey i built x to do x, is this similar to what you did?\n\nThere are some people who use it but drop off , do you have any insights on trying to reach out to these people to get their feedback on how to approach it?\n\nI'm trying to offer free trial $15 USD credit at the moment to non technical founders to hopefully learn from them using my app and what can be improved, reason is I want to get good feedback and work on their pain points better so I can have that edge over competitors. However I know you mentioned paid beta is better, should I be removing the free trial you think? \n\nThank you! Any response is appreciated",

When you ask \"why is this Supabase auth failing\", it gives you 5 valid auth fixes but doesn't know which packages you're on, what your middleware chain looks like, or what you changed 3 commits ago.\n\nOur solution: memory files. Every agent reads a state file at session start with past mistakes, system gotchas, and working patterns. When an agent hits a production bug, the fix goes into the memory file so the next agent session doesn't try the same 5 wrong answers.\n\nVibe coding works, but you need institutional memory or you'll rediscover the same bugs every week.",

Free tools are another massive way to get incoming traffic. Think templates etc. Ahrefs or SEMRush have generous free tiers to silo keywords you believe your ICP is googling. \n2. Good on cutting ad spend. Isn’t really rewarding for startups as much as it used to be because costs have been driven up by VC and PE. \n3. Don’t sell yourself too short. Some seasoned engineers may be able to debug a little faster, but looking at foreign code for most takes time to understand. My recommendation is to ask Cursor to inline comment functions and return reasons for the code output and have Claude generate you a md file on the feature implementation and how it works. Saves you a bunch of time when needing to come back to things weeks Lester and you may not fully understand what the async function is doing etc. \n4. I’ve never met a more unnecessary complex backend structure than supabase. I know it has a lot of serverless value and gets you up quickly but I found just rolling auth with a proven library and working with a familiar DB (Postgres/MySQL) saved me 50% of my issues when bootstrapping another project I am working on with v0. \n\nI would also be happy to review your codebase also in exchange for feedback on my product https://tryscheeme.com. I found critical leaks with AI generated supabase code so I actually created a codebase scanner to quickly do checks when I spin up projects. It’s open source https://vibecheck.tylerpalmer5.com",

Duplicated logic and files with thousands of lines of code that could be optimized. Hidden scaling bottlenecks... Stuff that doesn’t show up until it really hurts.\n\nAt some point, it’s worth having someone technical review the system before growth compounds the mess.\n\nThat’s literally why I built [https://vibecode-audit.com](https://vibecode-audit.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com) human-led code quality, scalability and production audits for AI-built SaaS. We turn the findings into concrete tickets + prompts you can paste back into Claude/Cursor and clean the codebase.\n\nNot saying you *need* it tomorrow, you’ve clearly validated hard.

We run 6 AI agents that ship code to production daily, and the biggest operational lesson was: Claude is brilliant but inconsistent without constraints. What solved it for us: per-agent memory files (persistent learnings across sessions), hard verification gates (tests must pass before deploy), and structured work queues so agents can't take shortcuts.\\n\\nOnce you have those infrastructure layers, the vibe coding stops being chaos and starts being repeatable. The jump from 'made a thing' to 'runs reliably' is mostly about the plumbing around the AI, not the AI itself.",

What’s exciting is that the answer seems to be coming from a solo builder with no prior coding skills. Wild.\n\nAnother thing to note: general purpose LLMs are getting so good that in all likelihood they’re eventually going to eat many specialized AI tools’ lunch. But you made the clever decision to turn your interaction layer on its head and make it canvas based. This is going to be a little harder for general purpose LLMs to replicate. The UX layer becomes the moat and looks like you’ve built yourself a fairly unique one.\n\nOne line of question I have: there is definitely a lot of complex heavy lifting being done in your product (detecting variable relationships, selecting an appropriate type, and generating aesthetically pleasing outputs, having a workable canvas, etc) — how did you go about crunching through all this to getting reliable results? Was this very difficult? How did you research the libraries and frameworks you needed without knowing what to ask for? Super curious about your building journey.",

A lot of people get stuck waiting to “learn the tech” before they start, but you’ve shown that you can iterate, test ideas, and ship something people find valuable without that barrier.

Honestly the \"learn the tech first\" trap almost got me too — I spent two months reading React docs before I realized I could just... start building and fix things as they broke.\n\nOn onboarding — I didn't have a proper onboarding flow at first. What I did was post screenshots and demo videos on social media. The product just looked different from anything else out there (an infinite canvas for scientific figures isn't something people had seen before), so the visuals did the selling. People DMed me asking to try it, and I funneled them into a beta group.\n\nThe first few users were an absolute firehose of learning. Two examples:\n\n1. Right-click didn't work on Windows. I'm on Mac. Never occurred to me to test right-click context menus on Windows. A user reported it day 2. When you're a solo founder building on one OS, you have massive blind spots you don't even know about.\n\n2. LLM rate limits hit immediately. When it's just me testing, I never trigger rate limits. The moment 20+ people start generating figures at the same time? API goes down. This is the kind of thing that's impossible to catch in solo testing — you literally need multiple concurrent users to surface it.\n\nFirst week was basically firefighting. But within \\~7 days I'd patched most of the critical issues and the experience got noticeably smoother. That's another argument for paid beta — those users stuck around through the rough patches because they'd paid, and they kept reporting issues instead of just churning silently.\n\nUsers also flooded me with feature requests, which was encouraging because most of them were things already on my roadmap. When your users independently ask for the same features you planned to build, that's a decent PMF signal.\n\nIf I had to distill the onboarding lesson: don't over-engineer onboarding before launch. Ship, watch real people use it, and fix the things that actually block them.\n\nThe issues that matter most are ones you literally cannot predict from your own desk.",

The OS example alone shows how different real users are from “founder testing.” It’s wild how many issues only appear once you have concurrent usage and different environments in play.\n\nAlso love your point about not over-engineering onboarding. A lot of founders burn weeks polishing flows that don’t even address the actual friction points. You basically let real behavior define onboarding instead of guessing, which is way more efficient.\n\nThe fact that users were requesting features already on your roadmap is a strong signal too. When demand starts aligning with your instincts, that’s when things get interesting. Sounds like you’re in a solid learning loop right now.",

Also (if you aren’t doing this) one thing that I’ve found helps when working with Claude is to document everything in md files where the code is, and have a Claude.md to index it. It doesn’t replace actually knowing everything that’s going on with your code base, but it helps. Claude automatically opens this file when it starts up, which speeds a lot of things up. Additionally test cases are great for identifying the consequences of code changes. Ideally run them before every deployment. Also if you aren’t using git (dunno why you wouldn’t), you really should. ",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

Not Product Hunt specifically, but a big splash launch that brought a flood of signups we weren't ready for. The thing nobody talks about is the opportunity cost - while you're firefighting infrastructure and support, you're not iterating on the product. So the users who might have stuck around get a frozen, buggy experience and leave anyway.\n\nThe pattern I've seen work better is what some people call a \"slow launch\" - intentionally throttle signups, onboard in cohorts, and use each batch to find and fix the retention leaks before opening the gates wider. Less exciting, zero champagne emojis, but you actually learn what makes people stay.\n\nAlso the competitive research signups thing is so real. After our launch about 40% of our \"users\" had competitor company emails. They inflated every metric and made it impossible to read our actual data for weeks.",

If people aren't coming back on day 3 when there's no hype, no homepage feature, no dopamine hit from being \"discovered,\" then you don't have a product problem solved by more traffic. You have a retention problem that more traffic just exposes faster.\n\nNow when I see founders obsessing over their PH launch strategy I just ask them one question: what happens on day 8?

They'll never convert and they skew every metric you try to learn from.\n\nThe lesson I took from a similar experience: treat your launch as the beginning of a funnel experiment, not a revenue event.

The answer-first formatting is something I've been testing heavily over the last few months and the results are real.\n\nWe track where our traffic comes from for a few service business clients, and what jumped out is that about 30% of their organic visibility now comes from AI-generated answers and featured snippets rather than traditional blue links. That number was closer to 12% a year ago.\n\nThe topic cluster approach you mentioned is huge. We rebuilt one client's entire blog from individual keyword-targeted posts into proper pillar structures - maybe 40 articles consolidated into 8 clusters. Organic traffic dipped for about 3 weeks then came back 2.2x stronger. The key was aggressive internal linking and making sure each cluster had a genuinely comprehensive pillar page, not just a thin overview.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: structured data markup is becoming way more important for AI scraping. FAQ schema, HowTo schema, even just clean heading hierarchies. We saw a noticeable uptick in AI Overview citations after implementing proper schema across a client's service pages.\n\nThe E-E-A-T piece is the one most people underestimate though. We started putting real author bios with verifiable credentials on every piece of content and it made a measurable difference in rankings within about 6 weeks.

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and crazy slow load times.\n\nMy conversion tanked to 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari. Basically losing money on every single signup.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw a 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser.

          "text": "The \"everyone congratulating us while we were dying\" part is so painfully accurate. We had a smaller version of this. Got about 600 signups from a single Reddit post that blew up. Team was pumped. Two weeks later our DAU was actually lower than before because the infrastructure costs ate into our runway and we'd shifted focus from building for existing users to onboarding new ones.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about launch spikes is the support load. Those 2000 signups probably generated what, 300-400 support tickets in the first week? And most of them are from tire-kickers who will never convert, but you can't tell which ones are which so you have to respond to all of them. Meanwhile your actual power users who were there before the spike are getting slower response times and worse experience.\n\nI think the real lesson here is that launch readiness has nothing to do with the product being ready. It's about having the retention infrastructure ready. Do you have an onboarding sequence that works without hand-holding? Do you have a clear activation metric that you know correlates with retention? Do you have automated support for the top 10 questions?\n\nIf the answer to any of those is no, a big launch will actively hurt you because you're creating first impressions at scale and those first impressions are bad ones.\n\nThe Tuesday at 3pm test is perfect honestly. That should be the standard before anyone even considers a big launch push.",

          "text": "Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don’t think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts — the backend, the frontend, the integrations, the onboarding flows, the tiny UX details that nobody notices until they’re broken — it’s staggering, and you’ve clearly navigated all of that to put something real into the world.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive, to me at least, is how much of a vision it takes to carry a project like this from idea to launch. It’s not just coding, or designing, or marketing in isolation — it’s a kind of sustained, chaotic orchestration where every tiny choice ripples through the rest of the system. A single misjudged assumption early on could have snowballed into invisible bugs, abandoned features, or unhappy users, and yet here we are. That kind of focus, and the willingness to iterate publicly, is something a lot of people underestimate.\n\nI also think it’s worth acknowledging how personal a launch like this is. There’s a weird mixture of exposure, hope, and anxiety — you put months or years of thought into something, and now other people are encountering it for the first time. And that first interaction, that initial “aha moment” for users, is deeply validating in a way that’s hard to explain until you’ve experienced it. I hope you’re taking a moment to soak it in, because the grind and the hustle often hide the fact that this is genuinely something to be proud of.\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to overdo it, but seriously: congratulations. Launching a SaaS is one of those things where everyone talks about the hype, the numbers, the growth, but the reality is that the act itself — shipping, iterating, surviving the early weirdness — is already a victory. So here’s to your achievement, to the learning curve that got you here, and to whatever weird, wonderful, unexpected directions it takes you next.",

                  "text": "I actually didn't use a single traditional keyword tool (Ahrefs/Semrush). They’re too slow for how fast AI search is moving.  exact workflow I used is below:\n\nI fed Claude my site ​URL and my top competitors. I asked it to find the content gaps, basically, what are people typing into ChatGPT or Gemini that competitors aren't answering? I had it build a 30-day content plan where every article logically flows into the next one, creating a web of internal links.\n\nInstead of random blog posts, I made sure every piece of content supported another. This tells Google (and AI models) that you are an absolute authority on that specific niche. If a user reads one, the next one is the natural next step for them.\n\nThen i gave claude my main Keywords and asked it to spit out variations...Once I had the core pillar keywords from Claude, I didn't want to write 100 variations by hand. I created a dynamic template for the variations.\n\n​Manual: 5 high-quality pillar articles.\n​Programmatic: 100+ targeted variations with ai.\n\nBecause the content was built as an interconnected net rather than just random keywords, Google indexed it way faster. Now, when someone asks Gemini or ChatGPT a specific question in my niche, my site is the one being cited because I have the most specific  answer.\n\n​takeaway for you: Stop chasing High/low Volume keywords in tools. Use AI to find the High Intent gaps and then use article content to fill those gaps at scale. Along with targeted pSEO pages. This will really move your needles. I used a paid tool in this process. I don't want to look like that spammer, so i am not telling you. If you need to know, you can dm. Rest all folks who reads can follow this startegy, i guarantee this works.",

Here's the reframe though: your first 50 users shouldn't come from one channel.  \n  \nThey should come from you manually doing things that don't scale. That means going where your target users already are and being genuinely helpful before you ever mention your product. Reddit's actually perfect for this because there are hyper-specific communities for almost any niche, and if you answer questions helpfully, people will check out your profile and find your product naturally.  \n  \nThe key is being active in 3-5 subreddits where your ICP hangs out, commenting daily with actual value (not pitching), and only mentioning your product when it's truly relevant. Most people quit after a week because it feels slow, but the ones who stick with it for 2-3 months start seeing real traction. You're playing the long game here.  \n  \nThat said, if you don't have time to do the manual work or you're worried about getting banned for self-promo (which happens a lot), there are done-for-you services that handle Reddit engagement on your behalf. I came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions . com) recently and it's basically this, they find relevant conversations and post helpful responses for B2B companies so you get discovered without the spam risk. Could be worth looking into if you want the benefits of Reddit without the time investement. ",

It takes me two weeks. It is easy. The bill is reasonable.\n\nBut if a founder comes to me and says I need it built with Microservices and Kubernetes so we can scale to millions I smile and double the quote.\n\nWhy? Because they just gave me permission to over engineer everything.\n\nInstead of a simple session now I have to set up a separate Auth Service. That is 10 billable hours. Instead of one SQL DB now we need three different ones syncing via events. That is a week of work. Instead of a 5 dollar VPS I get to bill them for setting up a complex AWS cluster.\n\nI am not scamming them. I am building exactly what they asked for. They asked for a Netflix scale architecture for a to do list app with zero users.\n\nThe funny part is the app does the exact same thing as the boring version. It just costs 5000 a month to maintain instead of 50.\n\nI see devs on here complaining about clients picking complex stacks. Stop complaining. If a client wants to pay for a Rube Goldberg machine let them.\n\nSmart founders hire devs to tell them what to cut. Rich founders hire devs to build everything they read about on Twitter.\n\nI am happy to work for either. But just know that when you demand scalability on day one you aren't buying better software. You are buying my next vacation.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.",

The server itself ideally would just be a thin scalable layer connecting pages to the database. Scale when you need more connections. \n\nStart with a web server and a database, maybe s3 for assets, and cf caching. I don’t let anything touch the server if possible. Need to upload an asset? Signed request from your api for s3, so it goes straight from browser to s3. Need to process an image? The browser is capable in most cases, no sharp libraries if I can get away with it. Cloud functions for anything over a second and under 30s. Sudden need to scale? Vertical if it’s marginal, horizontal if it’s significant (New redis server, load balancer/autoscaling). Database performance degrading? Read only time. Query optimization. Vertical if needed (feels like giving up). \n\nI really try to do as little as possible on my actual web server though. But if you’re crafty you can keep costs low or zero for most things. As the project grows, I’ll break things out as needed based on what needs what.",

As well as a potential API for UK property market - possibly another revenue stream.\n\nRevenue model: Tiered subscriptions unlocking additional features and analytics, services subscription/featured boosts, possible API.\n\nI’m mainly looking for early-stage marketing ideas: \n• how to attract initial homeowners listing locally\n• how to onboard service providers to advertise \n• and generally how to reach marketplace liquidity without agents",

But everyone needs to understand their money. Most advisors charge a percentage of AUM annually which can get expensive.

Simulates life events and tells you if your plan survivors a major market event. Has a retirement simulation as well.",

It searches:\n\n\\- \"project management software comparison 2026\"\n\n\\- \"free PM tools for small teams\"\n\n\\- \"Asana vs Monday vs ClickUp\"\n\n\\- \"project management tools under $50\"\n\n\n\nWhy This is Interesting:\n\n\n\nIf you're creating content and want it to show up in ChatGPT's answers, you need to know these sub-queries exist.\n\n\n\nSo I Built a Tool:\n\n\n\nIt's a free Chrome extension that captures every query ChatGPT runs in real-time.\n\n\n\nInstall it, ask ChatGPT anything, and it shows you:\n\n\\- All the sub-queries it generated\n\n\\- Which websites it pulled from\n\n\\- The exact sources used\n\n\n\nSome Cool Patterns I've Noticed:\n\n\n\n\\- Comparison questions generate 5-7 sub-queries\n\n\\- \"Latest\" or \"best\" questions trigger web search more often\n\n\\- ChatGPT uses Bing for search (it's a Microsoft product)\n\n\\- Tables and FAQs get cited way more than paragraphs\n\n\n\nIt's Completely Free:\n\n\n\nNo premium tier, no upsell. Just wanted this to exist.\n\n\n\nChrome Store: Search \"ChatGPT Query Insight\"\n\n  \nExtension Link : [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-query-insights-ai/knnmhmhmckepgcgfmclibjhkhjikifkb?utm\\_source=item-share-cb&pli=1](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-query-insights-ai/knnmhmhmckepgcgfmclibjhkhjikifkb?utm_source=item-share-cb&pli=1)\n\n\n\nCurious What You'll Find:\n\n\n\nIf you try it, drop what patterns you notice. I'm collecting data and the more users test it, the more we learn.\n\n\n\nAlso building versions for Claude and Perplexity if there's interest.\n\n\n\nThoughts?",

Makes sense  it's easier to extract a clean answer from a table than from the middle of a 2,000 word essay.\n\nInterested in the Claude version if you build it. but I am not sure if it is givving trackable refferences ",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** I analyzed 19 Starter Story founder interviews (all $10K-$200K+ MRR). The #1 pattern: distribution beats product every time. Not a single founder credited product quality as their primary growth driver. Reddit and SEO were the most common channels (37% of founders). I open sourced all 17 playbooks as a Claude Code skill you can query from your terminal.\n\nI'm a systems engineer by day. I reverse engineer things for a living. It's how my brain works. I can't just consume something, I have to pull it apart.\n\nSo when I found Starter Story and started watching founder interviews, I couldn't just watch. I had to extract the blueprint.\n\nI saved 19 interviews (every recent episode featuring a founder making $10K-$200K+ MRR) to a knowledge management tool I'm building, extracted the transcripts, and ran cross-content analysis to find what's repeatable vs what's unique.\n\nHere's what I found.\n\n# The #1 Pattern: Distribution > Product\n\nEvery founder who grew fast had a distribution strategy before or alongside building. The ones who struggled built first, then scrambled for users.\n\nThis wasn't most founders. This was all 19.\n\nThe biggest surprise: not a single founder credited product quality as their primary growth driver. Every one pointed to distribution first. Even the founders with genuinely great products. They'll tell you distribution is what moved the needle.\n\n# Distribution Channels Ranked by Speed-to-Revenue\n\n# Tier 1: Fastest to $10K MRR\n\n**Reddit** \\- Roman (Goji Berry AI - that we've all seen here) went from $2K to $34K MRR in 6 months using Reddit alone. Generated 11M impressions and 40K+ website visitors.\n\nHis system:\n\n* Warm up accounts 7-14 days (comment and upvote only, zero marketing)\n* Post authentic stories with proof: screenshots, revenue dashboards, real numbers\n* Get 10+ upvotes in first 10 minutes (he coordinated with 15 friendly marketers)\n* Reply to every single comment\n* Never put the SaaS link directly in the post. Trigger curiosity instead.\n* Turn any life event into content: \"Got rejected from YC? Post about it. Paid 5 influencers and it flopped? Post about it.\"\n\n**TikTok** \\- Louis (GlowUp AI) validated his idea through TikTok comments BEFORE building anything. He read thousands of makeup TikTok comments to find pain points, created content about the solution, and only built the app after the content went viral. Scaled to 7 accounts posting 8-12x daily. $800K in year one. His rule: \"Content before code. If it goes viral, build the app.\"\n\n**Discord** \\- Sam (Algrow) found niche communities on discboard.org, joined voice chats, and screen-shared his tool without even talking. Just showing it solving problems in real time. Built rapport through genuine helpfulness. Community owners organically promoted him. $0 to $14K MRR. His take: \"Discord is 10x better than email for building relationships with users.\"\n\n**Partnerships** \\- Hassam (LaunchFast) had zero audience. He identified a coaching company that already had his target customers, built a demo in 48 hours with Cursor, and sent it over: \"Give me 48 hours. If you like it, we partner. No strings attached.\" Gave up equity for instant distribution. $0 to $25K MRR in 90 days. His math: \"50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.\"\n\n# Tier 2: Sustainable Growth ($10K → $100K+ MRR)\n\n**SEO + Content Marketing** \\- Mike ($200K MRR across 5 apps) was the loudest voice here: \"It is never, ever, ever, ever too early to start writing content.\" His playbook: write competitor comparison pages (\"X vs Y\"), \"alternative to\" pages, and publish consistently. The content compounds. The longer it's live, the more Google and AI search tools index it. He funds 1-2 years of content production using LTD capital (more on that below).\n\n**Influencer Marketing** \\- George (Wrestle AI, $17K MRR) DM'd 100 influencers per day. First words: \"Paid promo?\" Influencers skip everything else. Always negotiate on phone, never in DMs. Deal structure: 20-50% upfront, 4-5 videos, view guarantee at $2-5 CPM. He scaled from $0 to $17K MRR on roughly $500/month in influencer spend.\n\n**Building in Public** \\- Rob (SuperX, $10K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month across 5 products) both grew by sharing progress on Twitter/X. Tibo routed all customer support to Twitter DMs until each product hit $10K MRR. Builds real relationships and creates advocates who share your product for you.\n\n# Channel Frequency Across All 19 Founders\n\n* Reddit: 37%\n* SEO/Content: 37%\n* TikTok/Short-form video: 32%\n* Twitter/X (building in public): 32%\n* Influencer/UGC marketing: 26%\n* Paid ads: 21%\n\nMost successful founders used 2-3 channels max and went all in on what worked.\n\n# The Two Playbooks\n\nTwo distinct frameworks emerged from the data:\n\n# Playbook A: The Methodical B2B SaaS Playbook\n\n**Best for:** SaaS tools, B2B products, productivity software **Timeline:** 6-18 months to $10K MRR **Source:** Mike ($200K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month)\n\nThe condensed version:\n\n1. Pick a proven idea. Something that exists but has bad UX. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said do NOT chase novel ideas.\n2. MVP in days, not months. Take shortcuts, use boilerplates, use AI tools.\n3. Launch a private Lifetime Deal ($59-100) in Reddit groups, Facebook groups, LTD communities. Goal: raise \\~$30K.\n4. Never give away free accounts. If people pay, they use it and give feedback.\n5. Launch on AppSumo for massive reach. Goal is to close LTD phase with $100K in the bank.\n6. Start writing SEO content immediately. Competitor comparison pages, \"alternative to\" pages.\n7. LTD users become your review army (G2, TrustPilot). They want you to succeed.\n8. Transition to MRR once content compounds and organic traffic replaces LTD runway.\n\nThe LTD strategy is worth highlighting because it's brilliant: you raise $50-100K in capital, get hundreds of users giving feedback and writing reviews, and fund your content engine for 1-2 years. Then you close the LTD forever and move to monthly pricing. Mike's done this with 5 products.\n\n# Playbook B: The Content-First Mobile/B2C Playbook\n\n**Best for:** Mobile apps, B2C, visual/consumer products **Timeline:** 1-3 months to $10K MRR (faster but more volatile) **Source:** Louis ($800K/year), George ($17K MRR), Connor ($20K MRR)\n\nThe condensed version:\n\n1. Mine TikTok/Instagram comments for pain points people literally type out.\n2. Create content about the solution BEFORE building anything.\n3. If content goes viral, you've validated the idea. Build the MVP fast.\n4. Scale content: start at 1 post/day, then 4-6x/day when you see traction, then multiple accounts.\n5. Add anchor links (download buttons) only once videos hit 500K+ views. Adding them too early kills the video.\n6. Build referral loops: \"Invite 3 friends = free feature\" - users return to viral videos to share referral codes in comments, which boosts engagement, drives more views, drives more downloads.\n7. Layer in influencer marketing once you have traction.\n\nGeorge had a useful framework he called the \"gotcha moment.\" Every successful app needs something that stops the scroll and conveys value in 5 seconds. He said it was in the back of his mind during every design decision.\n\n# The Idea Selection Pattern\n\nThis one surprised me. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said to pick proven ideas, not novel ones.\n\nMike ($200K MRR): \"Pick an idea that's been done before. New ideas are risky. If you pick an idea that's been done before, you know that people want it.\"\n\nTibo ($700K/month): \"You will have a 90% failure rate. If you find a way to compress that in weeks, you're going to reach success much much faster.\"\n\nDavid ($12K MRR): literally found a successful app, made it 1% different, and launched.\n\nHow they found ideas:\n\n* **Personal frustration** \\- Hassam spent 20-30 hrs/week on Amazon research manually, built a tool to automate it\n* **TikTok comment mining** \\- Louis read thousands of comments to find pain points\n* **Discord chat history** \\- Sam copy-pasted days of chat into ChatGPT: \"List all pain points discussed\"\n* **Competitor analysis** \\- Pontus used Ahrefs to find apps with organic + paid traffic (strong signal), then built better versions\n* **Free tools as validation** \\- Bhanu (SiteGPT, $13K MRR) built 50+ free tools driving 50K monthly visitors from Google. 90% of his traffic comes from free tools, not the main product.\n\n# The Contrarian Takes\n\nNot everyone agreed on everything. A few founders pushed back on the dominant patterns:\n\n* **Mike** ($200K MRR): \"We will never go after an AI focused business.\" He avoids building on APIs he doesn't control. Notable given that most founders in the dataset lean heavily on OpenAI/Claude APIs.\n* **George** ($17K MRR): \"Distribution doesn't matter if you don't have a viral idea.\" Pushes back on the \"distribution > product\" narrative. He argues the product concept itself needs viral potential baked in.\n* **Louis** ($800K): \"You don't have to love the idea. Makeup is not my passion. It's my capitalistic endeavor.\" Separates passion from business.\n\n# Revenue Mechanics That Work\n\nCommon milestones across the dataset:\n\n* $0 to $1K MRR: 1-4 weeks (with a distribution strategy in place)\n* $1K to $10K MRR: 1-3 months (organic channels: Reddit, TikTok, Discord)\n* $10K to $50K MRR: 3-12 months (add SEO, ads, affiliates)\n* $50K to $100K+: 6-24 months (scale what works, kill what doesn't)\n\nInfrastructure costs across all 19: roughly $100-400/month to run a $10K+ MRR business. The default stack in 2025-2026 is Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + Stripe + Cursor or Claude Code.\n\nThe portfolio approach came up repeatedly. Tibo runs 5 apps ($700K/month combined), Mike runs 5 apps ($200K MRR), Katie runs 20 WordPress plugins ($150K/month). If one dies, the others survive.\n\n# What I'm Doing With This\n\nI taught myself to code in my 30s. Now I'm trying to build different products and launch. I built a knowledge management tool and used it to run this entire analysis. Saved all 19 videos, extracted transcripts, ran cross-content analysis to find the patterns.\n\nThen I turned every finding into an open source Claude Code skill. 17 playbooks you can install and query from your terminal while you're building. Ask \"how do I get my first users for a B2B SaaS?\" and it pulls the specific founder tactics with real numbers.\n\n**Open source:** [https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill](https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill)\n\nNow I'm applying these playbooks to my own growth. Starting with Reddit (hi), SEO content, and building in public. This isn't theoretical. It's my roadmap, and I'm following it in public.\n\n**If you're building right now: what distribution channel are you betting on?**\n\nThe data says most successful founders use 2-3 channels max and go all in on what works. Genuinely curious what's working for people here.",

          "text": "This is gold. The distribution > product insight hits different when you see it across 19 founders. I've been in the alternative finance space for years and watched so many technical founders build these perfect products that nobody ever finds. They'll spend 6 months perfecting features while someone with a janky MVP and solid Reddit game is already pulling revenue.\n\n\n\nThe LTD strategy Mike uses is clever - we've seen something similar work in fintech where companies do early access programs to fund development. Though in regulated industries you can't quite do lifetime deals the same way, the principle of getting users to fund your growth while becoming advocates translates. At Starter Stack AI we took a different path - focused on enterprise pilots first since our document processing engine needed that kind of scale to prove ROI. But for consumer/SMB products, that LTD to MRR transition seems repeatable.\n\n\n\nYour point about picking proven ideas resonates hard. In finance tech especially, innovation often means taking something that works and removing friction, not inventing new financial products. The best opportunities are usually where established players have gotten complacent - they're still making money so they don't fix the terrible UX. That's where you slip in with the same solution but 10x better experience. Curious if you're planning to apply this to your knowledge management tool or pivot to something more proven?",

I’ve been on the B2B side and the sales cycle typically a lot longer and it seems you need to prove yourself a lot more before closing. \n\nB2C is a new world for me. So I am testing different strategies and figured learning from others was the best path. Im guilty of overbuilding before I have distribution so focusing on meeting people where they are, having conversations, and pitching when it makes sense. Seems like we all have something to offer but proving value and preventing churn is the challenge",

If it’s sharp, even small channels compound.\n\nCurious, in the interviews you analyzed, did most of them start with a tight niche from day one? Or did clarity come after a few failed attempts?",

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook is way lower than Safari that's your leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

The metrics that mattered at Day 30 often shift by Day 365. Also, consider layering in behavioral signals (feature usage, support tickets) alongside firmographic data. It helps you catch expansion opportunities early. Keep building!",

A few tactical patterns that work:\n\n**Job change signals** - New VP Eng at target company = budget reset + tool evaluation window. Set up alerts for role changes in your ICP companies (Sales Nav or scrapers). Outreach window is weeks 2-8 (past onboarding chaos, before locked into inherited stack).\n\n**Hiring velocity** - Company goes from 2 to 8 backend engineer openings = scaling pain incoming. They need your infra/dev tools in 30-60 days. Job posting data is public gold.\n\n**Problem confession posts** - Engineers complaining about CI times, flaky tests, deploy anxiety. If your product solves it, reply with tactical advice first (free value), then \"we built X because we had this exact problem\" as closer. Zero pitch in the advice part.\n\n**Event attendance** - Speaking at/attending conferences signals active evaluation mode. People research solutions right after seeing talks about problems. Track conference hashtags + attendee lists.\n\nThe key is *timing + specificity*. Generic \"we help companies scale\" gets ignored. \"Saw you just joined as Head of Platform—congrats! Curious how you're thinking about observability as you inherit the stack\" opens doors.\n\nWhat intent signals are you tracking?",

This one stood out.\n\nThe founder : 24-year-old French dev, making €700/month as an intern.\n\nWhat he built : 2 LinkedIn tools — one for AI-assisted commenting, one for content creation.\n\nResults after 8 months :\n\n€16k/month revenue\n\n50 sales in first 12 hours of launch\n\n€0 spent on advertising\n\n100% organic acquisition\n\n\n\nWhat I found interesting:\n\nHe sold where his users already were. No Product Hunt launch. No Twitter. His users are on LinkedIn, so he sold on LinkedIn. Simple but most founders default to PH or HN.\n\nHard paywall from day 1. No freemium. His logic: if people pay, the product is validated. If they don't, move on fast. No months wasted on a free tier.\n\nHe hit €16k/month with just 2 products solving the same core problem (LinkedIn growth) for the same audience. No pivot, no new market. Just depth in one niche.\n\nStack : Next.js, Supabase, Stripe. Total infra cost \\~€50/month. No complex architecture.\n\nDistribution was 100% his own LinkedIn content. He posted daily about LinkedIn growth tips (not about his products). His audience was already his ICP so every post was indirect marketing.\n\nI interviewed him for about an hour and broke down his full funnel, pricing decisions, and mistakes.\n\nCurious what approach others here have taken, hard paywall vs freemium for micro-SaaS at launch ?",

They already know they need it, they've tried doing it manually, they're exhausted. So when they see a solution, the friction to pay is low.\n\nFor products where the problem is less urgent or where users need to \"discover\" the value, freemium probably wins. The key question is : does your ICP already know they have the problem?\n\nOn his LinkedIn strategy, that's actually the most interesting part of the whole case. He never posted about his tools. He posted LinkedIn growth tips (algorithm hacks, engagement strategies, profile optimization). His audience was people who wanted to grow on LinkedIn. His product helps people grow on LinkedIn. So every post was indirect marketing without ever feeling like a pitch.\n\nThe mistake most people make is posting ABOUT their product. He posted about the PROBLEM his product solves.

At \\~€50/month overhead, he only needed like 5-6 customers to be profitable. That changes the math completely vs a SaaS burning $2k/month on servers.\n\nFreemium makes more sense when your acquisition is cold traffic (SEO, ads, app stores) because there's no pre-existing trust. The free tier's job is basically to build the trust that his LinkedIn content was already doing organically.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot is people defaulting to freemium because \"that's what everyone does\" without asking whether their distribution channel already handles the trust-building part.

Seriously.\n\nThe \"your content IS the free trial\" insight is exactly what Yannis did without even theorizing about it. He just intuitively understood that if someone watches 20 of his LinkedIn posts about growth hacks, by the time they see Linkhub, the trust is already built. The product page isn't doing the convincing — 3 months of free content already did.\n\nYour cost structure point is key too. At €50/month infra, his break-even is basically 2 customers. That removes all the pressure that pushes founders toward freemium out of desperation. Most people choose freemium not as a strategy but as a fear response, \"what if nobody pays ?\" When your burn is near zero, you can afford to find out.\n\nI'd add one nuance from his case : he also used the hard paywall as a filter. The people who paid on day 1 were his most engaged users, the ones who gave the best feedback, reported bugs fastest, and became word-of-mouth advocates. A free tier would have diluted that signal with casual users who never really needed the product.\n\nI actually analyzed another founder recently : 248k followers, launching a SaaS, who took the opposite approach. Freemium V1, paid later. Completely different logic but equally valid given his distribution. That case study drops Monday if you want to compare the two strategies.\n\n",

The main upside isn’t revenue, it’s clarity: you instantly see if you’ve nailed a specific pain, pricing, and message. If no one pays, you tweak the offer or kill it fast instead of dragging a zombie product with 300 free users and zero signal.\n\n\n\nWhat’s worked for me is: waitlist → cheap “founding plan” → then proper monthly pricing. Keep it simple: one main plan, annual option, and a 7-day money-back guarantee instead of a freemium tier. That gives people a safety net without training them to expect free.\n\n\n\nFreemium makes more sense when there’s network effect, viral loops, or clear in-product upgrade triggers; most micro-SaaS don’t have that. For discovery, I’ve leaned on things like Phantombuster and Taplio for LinkedIn, plus Pulse for Reddit to catch threads where my exact ICP hangs out and join in with actual examples, not spray-and-pray cold outreach.\n\n\n\nSo yeah: for micro-SaaS, paid from day one with a soft refund > classic freemium.",

This guy clearly got the \"sell where your users are\" part right. Most tools launch on Twitter/X and wonder why their LinkedIn product isn't selling.\n\nFor anyone curious about the space: the tools that focus on voice training (making AI output not sound like generic AI slop) seem to be pulling ahead. I've been using Reepl for agency clients and the difference vs generic ChatGPT output is noticeable. The carousel builder is surprisingly useful too.\n\nRe: freemium vs paywall.

His logic makes sense for a micro-SaaS with a tight ICP if you're selling to LinkedIn power users who already spend money on tools, a paywall filters for serious buyers fast. But I think it depends on the market. For something like cold email tools, freemium works better because the switching cost is high once someone has campaigns running. You get them in free, they build their sequences and upload contacts, and now leaving means rebuilding everything somewhere else. That's a moat.\n\nThe €50/mo infra cost is what really stands out though. Next.js + Supabase + Stripe is becoming the default micro-SaaS stack for a reason you can run profitably from day one without VC money. The old playbook of burning cash on AWS for 18 months before monetizing is dead for indie builders.",

Yannis (the founder) literally never launched on Product Hunt. Zero. His logic was simple: my users spend 2 hours a day on LinkedIn, they spend 0 minutes on PH. Why would I launch where they're not?\n\nOn the paywall, exactly right. His ICP is people already paying for LinkedIn Premium, Sales Navigator, outreach tools. Adding €30/month for a commenting tool is a no-brainer for them. Totally different story if you're selling to consumers or students.\n\nThe infra cost thing is actually crazier than it looks. €50/month infra, and he built everything himself as a solo dev. No team. No designer. No cofounder. So his margins are essentially 99%. That's the micro-SaaS dream right there.\n\nOn churn : honestly, that's been his biggest challenge. Linkhub did have real churn issues. LinkedIn tools are fragile by nature, one API change and things break. He's been transparent about that. His answer was building LinkPost (content creation) as a second product for the same audience. So instead of relying on one tool, he diversified his revenue across two products serving the same ICP. Smart hedge.\n\nBut yeah, churn on LinkedIn tools is a real thing and anyone building in that space should plan for it.\n\nI wrote a deeper dive on his full acquisition funnel (how he converts LinkedIn followers → paying users step by step) if that's something you'd want to read.",

FAQ schema and HowTo schema make your content’s structure machine-readable in a way that aligns with how these systems chunk documents. Worth implementing, though it’s hard to isolate as a variable.\n\nOn tracking: Semrush’s AI overview feature gives partial Google signal. For ChatGPT/Perplexity specifically, you’re mostly flying blind right now. Best proxy metrics are branded direct traffic spikes that correlate with content publishing, and ‘dark traffic’ (sessions with no referrer attribution). Imperfect, but directional.\n\nThe real unlock most people miss: getting cited depends more on whether you’re THE authoritative source for one specific narrow question than whether you rank well broadly.

There are thousands of them, most die within a week or are stuck at 1k-3k MRR. **I managed to get mine to 20k - without having an audience.**\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022288626772770816)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022197853545017345)\n\n\n\n# The hard stuff (prologue)\n\nThe concept of a social media scheduler is simple: you connect your social media channels and then post (or cross-post) to all platforms at the same time.\n\nThere are a few dominators in this market, like Hootsuite and Buffer (making around $2m per month). You can't win against those beasts by offering the same thing; you must be super innovative and serve underserved markets.\n\nBut even if you do, you will see a lot of churn, because once users stop posting, they cancel their subscriptions.\n\nEven today, Postiz has 17% churn (which is enormous for SaaS tools), so this month it will lose $3,400 in paid subscriptions.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022288440763772928)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022200012407787520)\n\n# Starting in open-source\n\nPostiz started (and still) an open-source social media scheduling tool (26k stars), which means that all Postiz code is out (all of it)!\n\nBuilding everything in open-source been my mantra forever, especially in the world of AI, when everybody can copy your product, what does code even mean?\n\nThat made code less important, so to be transparent and reliable, I open-sourced everything and brought many developers into the app.\n\nDevelopers never paid me in cash, but they did contribute code, test the app, write about it in many places, and bring me to $3k in MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022289290533986304)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022202113372327936)\n\n# Stuck (until I discovered...)\n\nFor a few months, I was just stuck. I had the same MRR, but my customers changed frequently. There is a formula that you can use to calculate your [Max MRR](https://longform.asmartbear.com/max-mrr/)\n\nAccording to the amount of subscriptions you bring in every month and your churn, you can understand where you can be. And I was at a dead end.\n\nSo I started serving underserved audiences and added tons of channels to Postiz. While most schedulers have 11 channels, Postiz has 30.\n\nI started to serve:\n\n* Web3 users\n* Reddit users\n* Education users (Skool / Whop)\n* Chat users (Discord / Slack / Telegram / Whop / Twitch)\n\nThat opened up my market for a higher acquisition and offered a solution that doesn't exist anywhere else.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022204000805040128)\n\nAnd so, I got to $7k MRR (grinding my ass off) but got stuck again.  \nUntil I saw an interesting YouTube video - \"How to create viral reels on TikTok using Postiz and N8N\", the video was not selling Postiz as a tool, but selling Postiz as a part of an automated funnel.\n\nPeople take these n8n templates that do a lot of stuff:\n\n* Generate a video with veo3\n* Generate a cover picture\n* Put sound in\n* Post it using Postiz\n\nPostiz was just the last step to help you post to social media. And the workflow was automated, which means we don't need users to schedule their own posts, and that means much, much lower churn.\n\nSo it opened it up to automation people, and then OpenClaw opened it upto everybody.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022205767198420995)\n\n# Always run hypes - ALWAYS\n\nFor me hypes a sort of big marketing push to get a surge of trials and subscriptions - they can be long-term, they can be short-term, but they give you big jumps.\n\n* N8N had an incredible 2025, and I rode that hype like crazy.\n* MCP was also super incredible in 2025, so I ran fast, made a chat agent for Postiz and MCP that you can connect to your LLM, and launched it on Product Hunt.\n* [TrustMRR](https://x.com/@TrustMRR)  was booming like crazy, I listed Postiz there, got tons of traffic, and also got contacted by  [starter\\_story](https://x.com/@starter_story)   [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPM4ImzcIFc) .\n* [openclaw](https://x.com/@openclaw)  still going on - it's the biggest one.

At the start, it brought me around 250k views; over time, it dropped to 25k, and the channel saw me again and again. Total self-promotion is very rare on Reddit, except for open-source projects. [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l68fi2/postiz_v1470_open_source_social_media_scheduling/), [Example #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1mhhs94/postiz_v225_opensource_social_media_scheduling/).\n\n2. Product Hunt - Every number of months, I publish Postiz on Product Hunt, and every time I send a request to [ProductHunt](https://x.com/@ProductHunt) to publish before 8 months, luckily, they usually approve me 🙏🏻  \n  \nI won every launch almost. The trick here is outreach.  \nIf you have no audience, the chances of you winning on Product Hunt are low, because even when people see your posts, they don't upvote.  \nAlso, Product Hunt doesn't count votes of new users to reduce cheaters, so to win, I understood that outreach is key - might seem gray sometimes, but that's the only option. So every launch I message people on.\n\n* Active Slack Groups with founders\n* LinkedIn connections\n* X connections\n* Telegram Product Hunt groups\n\nIt's harder to say \"no\" to you when you message people directly.\n\n3. SEO - Postiz currently has 70 DA, mostly thanks to open-source.  \nThis is a channel that takes a lot of time; it's not enough to create blog posts, you actually need to get valuable backlinks and be mentioned in many places.\n\n* Open Source Directories - There are some strong directories in GitHub you can list your project on, like: \" [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) \", \" [awesome-oss-alternatives](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) \" There are so many more; look for 'awesome' on GitHub.  \n* SaaS Directories - Like most founders, I started listing my application in every possible directory. It usually boosts your domain DA (it costs money, prepare for it) and lists it on platforms like  [UneedLists](https://x.com/@UneedLists) ,  [tinylaunch](https://x.com/@tinylaunch) ,  [theresanaiforit](https://x.com/@theresanaiforit)  (They also give you traffic.)  \n* Paid Directories (recurring) - This brings a lot of traffic, like  [ossalternative](https://x.com/@ossalternative) ,  [selfh.st](https://selfh.st/) . While it doesn't bring purchases, it brings a lot of traffic to the open-source and, of course, increases my DR.  \n* Using  [outrank\\_so](https://x.com/@outrank_so)  \\- It writes me one blog post a day and brings tons of backlinks to my articles. This is super useful; it's a little AI Sloppy, but it works.  \n* Outreach - I am working with multiple people who outreach to other founders about my SaaS and ask for ABC exchanges. It means I (website A) send a link to website B, and website C sends a link to website A. You can't just switch with people A <-> B; Google will mark you as spam.  \n* Free tools (pSeo) - if you have seen  [pbteja1998](https://x.com/@pbteja1998)   [starter story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adl5_lJfkEE)  He created many free tools on the website to drive traffic to himself. I did something similar, created a tool like \"font generator\" and duplicated it to all my socials like \"Instagram font generator\", \"Facebook font generator\", etc. This brings the most traffic per month, but not the most conversions.  \n\n3. Outreach - the previous company I sold was a LinkedIn outreach tool. I have seen people using it so spammy all the time, just sending you a connection request offering their services 🤢 I hated it, and I don't think it works. What I did was a little bit different.\n\nI understood that people are using n8n automation with Postiz, and luckily, they were easy to target. If you go to [Skool.com](https://skool.com/) You can see tons of N8N groups. So I went to Upwork and paid someone to lead-gen the groups (I know you can write your own scraping code or use OpenClaw today), but I didn't have it back then, and it's so cheap and fast.\n\nI asked the person from UpWork to get me a list of the group owners (name, group name, email). I bought a new domain \"getpostiz .com\" and warmed it with Lemwarm, then I started an outreach campaign with Lemlist. The reason that I bought a new domain is that I didn't want it to be marked as spam (in case somebody does it)\n\nI started to send people this email:\n\n[https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh](https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220443953115137)\n\nThe goal was not only to \"ask\" but also to give. I gave tons of free lifetime deals for Postiz.\n\nI saw tons of new YouTube videos about Postiz, and many new n8n templates with Postiz.\n\nAnd that month, I doubled my revenue from $6k MRR to $12k MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220789702086656)\n\n# Joined every possible community\n\nI joined so many communities that cost money, so I can socially interact with people, and here and there push Postiz, notable ones are:\n\n* Smallbets - by  [dvassallo](https://x.com/@dvassallo)  \n* Starter Story by  [thepatwalls](https://x.com/@thepatwalls)  \n* Growth Mentor by  [FotiPanagio](https://x.com/@FotiPanagio)\n* AI Thinkers by  [thekitze](https://x.com/@thekitze)  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022225357655748608)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* Start today - You might be excited about all the things AI can do, and the possibility of what you can build, but actually, everybody thinks that, and everybody is building. SaaS becomes easy to build but hard to sell. I believe that if I built Postiz around 2020, I would be 1m+ ARR. Don't wait, it will become harder.\n* Build a good product - In the end, your product must be flawless (no bugs), more bugs = more churn. UX build/break a SaaS. Each feature you ship can cause more bugs. So before you ship any feature, make sure you fix your product.\n* Don't price it low - Even today, some people say that Postiz is more expensive than Buffer. I don't compete on the price; I compete on value. The lower your price is, the less you can spend on paid marketing channels and stay cash flow positive. Let's take an example. Imagine that it costs you $20 to acquire one person. Still, your pricing starts at $9, it will take 3 months to return your money, in that time you will be cashflow negative, that's hard - you would have to shut down your acquisition channel and focus only on organic channels eventually. Not to talk about spikes in your server costs.\n* Measure, Measure, Measure - If you don't know what's going on with your SaaS (can't measure it), it will be harder for you to grow. I used a website analytics tool called [PlausibleHQ](https://x.com/@PlausibleHQ). I love it, super slick. But very quickly, I realized it's hard to really understand where your purchases come from, so I switched to [marclou](https://x.com/@marclou) and [DataFast\\_](https://x.com/@DataFast_) because I want to know which blog pages / free tools brought me X amount of money so I can double down on them.  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022221743080058882)\n\n* If something doesn't work (like churn), stop doing the same thing. You might improve by 1%-5 %, but the better option is to pivot.\n* Always think short term and long term: Long term - brand, SEO. Short term - Hypes, launches, social media.\n* Be transparent - reveal all your metrics: total subs, money, churn - it's good for marketing, but let's face it, most chances you are not building a deep tech company. More of an AI-driven API orchestrator? Thousands more people are building something like that. Being transparent can put you above the others.\n* Growth takes time. You can build a \"hypey\" product and get tons of traffic fast (maybe also fast churn), but real growth and a brand take time. If you kept your marketing and did something for a year+, you will see an exponential growth in your SaaS, because of \"brand\" and word-of-mouth.\n* Find \"high reward channels\" - I see people who are super eager to \"build in public\" on X. It's nice, but you can find channels that will bring you a lot more views, like Reddit and TikTok. Just because some people are nailing it doesn't mean you have to.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022224464705196032)\n\n\n\n# What's next for me?\n\nI want to take my churn to the next level - \"0%\". I launched a new service called \"Postiz as a service.\" You can basically use Postiz inside your SaaS without exposing it. Since this is an infrastructure tool, it can have almost no churn. It's part of another SaaS.\n\nThank you for reading it :)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/status/2022361200932315279)",

The fact that you're growing despite that says a lot about your acquisition engine.\n\nThe automation angle is clever. Turning a manual tool into infrastructure that runs in the background changes the entire retention dynamic. Users don't cancel things they forget they're paying for, especially when those things are quietly doing their job inside a workflow.\n\nThe open source play is interesting too. Most founders in saturated markets try to differentiate on features, which is a losing game against Hootsuite and Buffer. Building community and ecosystem around the product creates a moat that feature parity alone never will.\n\nCurious about the Slack communities strategy. How did you identify which ones had your target audience versus just other founders promoting their own stuff? That signal-to-noise ratio seems like the hardest part to get right.",

Turned out most of my drop off was from in-app browsers.\n\nWhen people click ads on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok they land in those app browsers and those things are terrible for checkout. No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook is way lower than Safari that's your leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

Curious if you’re tracking *why* people still cancel at 20k MRR (like with something InsightLab-style cancel flows or even just scrappy tagging), since feeding that back into your hype cycles + scheduler UX could be a sneaky way to unlock the next plateau.",

One thing I've noticed that makes a HUGE difference is doubling down on a specific niche *within* the overall market. Like, instead of being a general scheduler, focusing on something like podcast promotion, TikTok growth for e-commerce, or even internal comms for remote teams can really help you stand out. It lets you build features that actually solve very specific pain points that general tools miss, and it's way easier to market to a hyper-targeted group. Just a thought!",

Users see value without doing the heavy lifting, and that turns churn into something you can actually measure and improve.",

That’s the part most SaaS builders miss: they ship a tool, not a component others can bake into their own playbooks and sell for you.\n\nYour Reddit + open-source combo is also underrated. I’ve seen similar compounding from shipping in r/selfhosted, then layering on tools like SparkToro, Ahrefs, and Pulse for Reddit to catch niche questions in real time and reply with something genuinely useful instead of drive‑by promos. The pattern I’m taking from this is: pick one saturated market, over-connect it (30+ integrations), then attach yourself to every adjacent hype/automation stack and let those communities drag you up. That’s the main takeaway worth copying.",
