      "text": "Great resume, confident interview, solid recommendations. Within two weeks the cracks showed up everywhere. Basic tasks took forever and the same mistakes kept happening despite feedback. Eventually realized they'd embellished basically everything in the interview and could talk about work beautifully but couldn't actually do it.\nBetween salary, my time spent training them, client issues I had to clean up, and the work that didn't get done, the total cost was well over $30K. Swore I'd never hire again, did everything myself for months, and nearly burned out before I tried again with a completely different process.\nNow I give every serious candidate a paid trial project. Real work, the actual kind of thing they'd be doing daily, about five hours worth. I pay them regardless of whether I hire them. The results are stark. People who sounded average in conversation produce excellent work while polished interviewers turn in mediocre output. My second hire came from that process and she's been with me two years running half the operation. Never going back to traditional interviews.\n",

It completely filters out the \"professional interviewers\"—the candidates who have perfected the art of hitting the right buzzwords but lack the actual execution skills.\n\nIf you want to add even more value to your new process, try standardizing a grading rubric for that 5-hour project. If you evaluate the work blindly against specific metrics before looking at whose name is on the submission, you remove almost all unconscious bias and focus purely on competence.\n\nThis shift from \"tell me\" to \"show me\" is exactly how the best hiring happens in the healthcare industry. You would never hire a clinical specialist or a tech professional handling sensitive patient data just because they had a slick resume and a confident smile. You need to see them navigate a practical simulation or a high-stakes test environment first. The exact same logic applies here. If they can't execute a 5-hour slice of the daily reality, they can't do the job.\n\nHuge props for actually paying them for their time, too.

The agents pass their 'interview' (context + prompting) fine. Then they confidently produce wrong output and report it done.\n\nThe fix that's worked: never let the same entity both do the work and declare it complete.

Immediately separates people who can narrate expertise from people who have it.

What went wrong and how did they handle it?\" Vague answers tell you something. Former managers who pause and struggle to give examples tell you even more.\n\n**Watch how they handle uncertainty.** During the interview, give them a scenario with incomplete information and see if they ask clarifying questions or barrel forward. People who perform well in interviews often perform worse in ambiguous real work because they're calibrated to give confident answers, not to think out loud through problems.\n\n**First two weeks are probationary by design.** The mistake most founders make (myself included) is waiting too long once early signals show up.

Suddenly you’re paying a salary just to inherit extra work and cognitive load.. that’s why I agree with your takeaway on acting fast. Once you know, dragging it out is the most expensive option. Firing early isn’t ruthless, it’s respectful to the business, the team, and honestly even to the person who isn’t a fit.. paid trial projects are the cleanest filter I’ve seen too. Real work, real constraints, real feedback loops. It exposes execution, ownership, and how someone thinks under ambiguity in a way interviews never will..\n\nFreeing up time and cash quickly so you can hire someone who actually compounds the business is one of the highest ROI decisions a founder can make.",

Forcing yourself to write the decision down before sharing it catches the contradictions before they reach someone else.\n\n**Build a 30-day onboarding doc, even rough.** Not a glossy onboarding deck — just a running document: here's how we do X, here's the context for Y, here's who to ask about Z. Every time they ask a question, add the answer to the doc. After 30 days you have onboarding materials and you haven't treated a single question as an interruption.\n\n**Define \"autonomy\" explicitly.** It usually means: make decisions in scope X without asking, flag decisions in scope Y before acting. Founders say \"I want autonomy\" but mean different things. Write down where the line is.\n\nYou already did the hardest part by listening.",

It's because the entire operating model that made you successful as a solo operator actively works against you as a manager:\n\n- Moving fast without documentation was a feature when it was just you. It's a bug when someone else needs to ramp.\n- Context-switching and changing priorities kept you nimble. It makes an employee feel directionless.\n- High standards and fast feedback loops drove your output. Applied to someone learning, they read as micromanagement.\n- 'Just figure it out' worked when you had full context. Without that context, it's just noise.\n\nThe patterns that tend to help first-time hiring managers:\n\n**Document before hiring.** Onboarding docs, process docs, context docs. If you can't write it down, you can't teach it.\n\n**Default to over-communicating why, not just what.** People tolerate changing direction when they understand the reason. They disengage when they can't see the logic.\n\n**Separate training mode from operating mode.** For the first 30-60 days, your job is to make them successful, not to get output from them. That shift in mental model makes a big difference.\n\nIf the story is recycled — the lesson still holds. A lot of first hires leave because the founder wasn't ready to be a manager, not because the person was wrong.",

Agents don't quit — they fail silently. The dysfunction shows up in the work (wrong outputs, missed edge cases, silent errors), not in a conversation. Which means you have to build monitoring and audit systems from the start rather than learning from attrition.\n\nThe upside is the feedback is less personal. The downside is you can go weeks not realizing something fundamental broke.",

If I was you, I would hire a tech consultant and walk them through the current pain points and from there onwards, figure out what’s needed the most. If you are in your current position long enough, then just list the top 10 pain points ( factor in things that could save time and money in the long run), as well check with your teammates and get their consensus as well. Once that’s done, look for tech that solves those exact problems. For example, I have been building a email CRM tool after speaking to 100 of email marketing specialists and I know once the platform is ready to go, it will help get more clients and generate higher client engagement. Also, Focus on a building a buying strategy first and then work on that. This way at least next year you would know what to look for and how to get it.",

Important moments/ dates, deal signatures, company founding day, employee birthdays, or internal milestones. These get turned into personalized digital artifacts based on the real lunar state of that exact moment. \n\nConsulting firms can use it to mark client anniversaries. HR teams can use it for employee recognition or milestone gifts. Founders can use it to preserve meaningful company moments. It sits outside daily operations, but strengthens the human layer around them.\n\nSince it is digital and not tied to subscriptions, it can be structured as prepaid credits that you use gradually over time whenever meaningful dates come up. No onboarding overhead and no operational dependency.\n\nIf useful, I would be happy to allocate credits for you so they can be used properly over time instead of being tied to software you may never open.\n\nIt may or may not be relevant, but it is at least a different way to convert budget into something lasting rather than shelfware\n\nYou can see it here\n\n [Personalised Moon Artwork](https://creatorcpm.com)",

I just stopped everything and let the customers go.\n\nWhy? Because of Claude. We’re literally in an era where you can just prompt an AI and it builds functional internal tools for you in seconds. The whole \"I can build this in a weekend\" developer mindset is on steroids right now.\n\nBut after playing with Claude for a while, I had a massive realization.\n\nYes, AI can write the code for any simple business tool instantly. But you still have to host it, maintain the infrastructure, fix bugs when APIs change, and deal with the complexity. I realized the value of SaaS isn't about \"writing the code\" anymore. It's about taking away the maintenance nightmare. For basic business tools, it’s just not worth the headache to build and maintain it yourself, even if Claude writes 99% of the code. Time is still a founder's most limited resource.\n\nI firmly believe the future isn't \"everyone builds their own tools with AI.\" The future is founders happily paying $15/month for simple, focused Micro-SaaS tools just so they don't have to maintain the infrastructure themselves.\n\nAm I crazy for throwing away a funded startup for this realization? \n\nHow are you guys dealing with the \"AI can build it easily\" vs \"I don't want to maintain it\" dilemma?",

The capability is there. But capability and optimal allocation are two different things.\n\nThe real question isn’t “can we build this?” It’s “should we be spending cycles building and maintaining this?” Every internal tool you spin up becomes something someone owns. It needs monitoring, updates, permission controls, migrations when vendors change APIs, and eventually refactors. That’s invisible tax.\n\nMicro-SaaS isn’t competing with technical competence. It’s competing with attention. Paying $15–$50/month for something that just works out of the box is often cheaper than assigning an engineer to babysit it, even if they could rebuild it in a weekend.\n\nYour Stripe example is exactly the right framing. Nobody sane is vibe coding payments, payroll, or core databases because the blast radius is too high. But marketing automation, lightweight CRM flows, internal dashboards? Those are flexible zones. That’s where self-build can make sense.\n\nAI doesn’t kill SaaS. It shifts the boundary of what’s worth custom building versus what’s worth outsourcing. The hard part isn’t writing code anymore. It’s deciding what deserves long-term ownership.",

I can say using chatgpt and claude  if you have it generate a complex project, try and run if locally, chances are its not gonna compile pending on the requirements and complexity. If you tell it to generate ALL features  in 1 and a login page. Expect the output to have half-assed features and a extra feature it thought would help you without your approval.\nThe output of code is better when you have it “assume” a role like telling it you are aws saa, principal software engineer, using best practices like tdd/bdd etc, and an .md file to “remember” so the next agent can take over. The overall sdlc process remains the same, Its iterative, you still have to verify/validate ifs output and that it matches the ac expectations then test - deploy, repeat.\n\nSome things i noticed when i use it\nif you upload a zip and you have it fix an error, it sometimes forgets the previous 3 fixes it made, wasting time and resources to have it regenerate it again to include previous fixes. \n\nThe ai+ide chat does help. My workflow is literally asking chatgpt to give me a prompt that adresses xyz. Paste it to the agent, and paste the agent response to chatgpt asking it here is the response  how do i respond to it or what do you think?” Rinse repeat. Its comical and fun in a way, but imagine someone brand new doing this today without knowing solid principles,yagni, kiss, oop, system design fundamentals or debugging code, they would probably quit and be overwhelmed.\n\nBecause our work is “invisible” and is still a key part for a business providing a service, folks are still oblivious to that and expect us to get it done in a single day. \n\nDeveloping today is still the same as 2018, its  iterative it just takes less time (no more stack overflow) but the sdlc process is still the same verify,validate requirements and make sure output matches expectations. \n\nWe are just copy pasting prompts to an agent to execute hoping what it does is correct, like a black box. We’re just mini copy paste managers now and its crazy seeing tha lt way.\n\nIt has helped me generate tdd/bdd test, learned aws cdk which took me 5 days to iron out instead of maybe 4-6 weeks of reading docs and trial and error but i did learn something using it. It can find the root cause, clean data, audit your system app security wise and all that which is super helpful. \nIt just comes down to “prompt engineering” and knowing what to ask it,  what follow up questions to ask all of this takes industry experience built over time.\n. Overall if you’re experienced and you know what roles you want it to pretend to be and what to ask it to do it, is really good at that. Just dont expect it all to be done in, its still iterative development. Building an app is one thing, but when you host in on the cloud, its another. If you host an app without even doing appsec audits on the api, youre cooked. or your bill will be high.  As a software engjneer i can learn any subject finance/econ other knowledge work that is easy for me, but those folks still cant do what i do even with cheat codes 😁",

Even if a tool like Claude can scaffold something quickly, most founders do not want to be on call for it. They want it to just work.\n\nI have been experimenting with validating these micro SaaS ideas before writing backend code at all. For example, mapping the maintenance burden clearly, modeling what breaks over time, then building simple landing pages and demo flows first. Tools like Runable help here because you can quickly generate a focused landing page, comparison breakdown, and even a short demo video script from research in one workflow. That lets you test whether people value not maintaining the tool before you commit to building it.\n\nThe edge now is not who can build fastest. It is who can remove ongoing cognitive load for their customer. That is still very defensible.",

The free page is the “what/why” (conceptual protocols). The paid $147 thing is an implementation pack with full trigger definitions, edge cases, tests, example event schemas, rollout/shadow-mode checklist, etc. It’s meant for people who want to implement quickly instead of translating concepts into specs themselves.\n\n2) The $147 credit isn’t required to use the protocols. It’s just a credit if someone later tries the platform. You can implement these with your own stack - nothing about the list depends on the platform.\n\nTo add something useful here: one example protocol in “spec form” (not just concept) is:\n\n\\- Trial expiry nudge: trigger = user is trialing, trial ends within 72h, hasn’t received nudge in last 7d; action = send email + in-app banner; cooldown = 24h; exceptions = active support ticket or already upgraded.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more \"spec-level\" examples in the comments if that’s helpful.",

Their engineering lead had used AI coding tools to prototype an internal tool that handled about 60% of what we do, and leadership decided to go with the internal build.\nSix months later they signed back up at a higher tier. What happened in between was that the internal tool worked for basics but nobody maintained it. When requirements changed nobody updated it, when things broke the engineering team had moved on, and the person who built it couldn't fully explain parts of the codebase because the AI had generated code they didn't deeply understand. Eventually the operations team that actually relied on the tool got frustrated enough to push for going back to a proper solution.\nBuilding something and maintaining something are completely different problems. AI tools have genuinely made building faster, but maintenance, updates, edge cases, and keeping up with changing requirements require ongoing investment that most internal teams don't want to make for a tool that isn't their core product. That's the moat for a lot of SaaS right now.\n",

The internal v1 gets built fast, covers the happy path, and leadership feels smart about saving budget. Six months later no one owns it, edge cases pile up, and the \"free\" tool has real opportunity cost. The lesson for us was to sell maintenance and evolution, not just features. If you anchor on total cost of ownership early, you are OnFire with the right buyers and less surprised when they try to build first.",

They came back because they underpriced the operational layer.\n\nBuilding the core logic of most SaaS products is genuinely not that hard anymore — a decent dev can vibe-code something that handles 80% of the use case in a weekend. What they built probably worked fine on day one.\n\nWhat kills them at month three or four:\n- The integration that quietly broke when a third-party API updated\n- The edge case that only shows up at volume\n- The 2am alert for something that's now their problem to fix\n- The cognitive overhead of owning a system instead of just using one\n\nThe customer wasn't buying your features. They were buying the right to not think about the infrastructure holding those features up.\n\nI've seen this most sharply with anything that touches communication workflows. Email, Slack, calendar — people think \"I'll just automate this myself\" and they're right that the automation is buildable. What they miss is that communication tools have an enormous tail of edge cases (threading bugs, tone failures, send-at-wrong-moment problems) that only reveal themselves over months of real usage. You can't shortcut that learning curve by building it yourself; you just inherit the same learning curve with no one else to blame.\n\nCurious what the breaking point actually was for your customer. In my experience it's rarely \"the thing stopped working\" — it's usually \"I realized I'm now on-call for this.\"\n",

It's about who carries the operational burden. Your product absorbed six months of that maintenance debt so they didn't have to.\n\nThe lesson that doesn't get said enough: the threat from \"we'll build it ourselves\" is rarely as serious as it sounds. Most internal builds are abandoned within 18 months. The teams that actually succeed with internal tooling are the ones doing it at scale (large eng teams, dedicated internal tools orgs). For a company of 20-50 people, the calculus almost never works out in favor of in-house.\n\nWhat changed in your product that made the customers come back?

They wanted to acquire us, keep me on for a year to transition, then I'd be free. $2M for a product doing $15K MRR. That's roughly an 11x multiple on annual revenue which is solid by any measure.\n\nI thought about it for three weeks. Built spreadsheets. Talked to my wife about it. Lost sleep over it.\n\nSaid no. And I still think about whether that was the right call.\n\nThe financial argument for taking it was strong. $2M is life-changing money. The product could plateau or decline. Competition could intensify. I could burn out. The bird in hand argument is hard to argue with.\n\nThe argument for keeping it was partly financial and partly emotional. $15K MRR with room to grow means the long-term value could exceed $2M if things go well. I'm building equity, not just income. And honestly I wasn't ready to work for someone else again. The year-long transition period sounded like a slow kind of prison.\n\nWhat I keep going back to is that you can't know if you made the right call until much later. If the product hits $50K MRR in two years, I'll look like a genius. If it stalls at $15K and I burn out, I'll look like an idiot who turned down $2M.\n\nMost founders who've been through this tell me the same thing: the decision isn't really about the math. It's about whether you still have energy and conviction for what you're building. If yes, keep going. If the offer feels like a relief, take it.\n\nIt didn't feel like a relief. It felt like giving up something I wasn't done with yet. That's the only reason I said no.\n\n",

If you’re flat, that multiple probably never gets better. The real math question is growth rate + churn. If churn is under 3% monthly and LTV/CAC is healthy, holding makes sense. If growth is single digit annually and heavily founder dependent, the risk is high. Also factor concentration risk. If top 3 customers are 40% of revenue, that $2M was even sweeter. Emotion matters, but runway and slope matter more. If you can realistically see a path to $40K–$50K MRR in 24 months, that’s when saying no looks smart. If not, 11x was a gift.",

From a purely financial perspective, you did not get lowballed.\n\nBut this decision was never just financial.\n\nThe key line in your post is that it did not feel like relief. That matters more than spreadsheets. When founders are truly ready to sell, the offer feels like oxygen, not conflict.\n\nThere are three lenses to evaluate this through:\n\nFirst, risk adjusted upside. To justify saying no, you are implicitly betting that the probability weighted outcome of holding exceeds 2M. That does not require hitting 50K MRR. Even modest growth with time arbitrage could surpass the offer.\n\nSecond, personal energy. If you still wake up wanting to improve the product, that has compounding value. Burnout destroys optionality. Conviction expands it.\n\nThird, identity. You were not ready to become an employee again. That is not ego. That is self awareness.\n\nYou are right that the answer will only be clear in hindsight. But regret rarely comes from taking risk when you still believe. It usually comes from quitting something you were not finished building.\n\nIf you want clarity, model two structured paths side by side: hold and scale vs. sell and reinvest. Lay out realistic growth curves, downside scenarios, and lifestyle impact. I often recommend founders map these forks visually in something like Runable because it forces emotional assumptions into explicit tradeoffs.\n\nYou did not reject 2M. You chose continued leverage and autonomy.\n\nTime will judge the ROI. But the reasoning you described is not irrational. It is founder math, not just spreadsheet math.",

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

      "text": "I see posts here every week. Hit $5k MRR. Crossed $15k. Just reached $1k in my first month.\n\nThose posts are what made me want to start. But now that I'm in it, I realize nobody really talks about the messy early part.\n\nSo here's mine.\n\n**About me:** I'm a dad, married, working a normal 9-to-5 as a remote contractor. 8 years as a dev. I build my SaaS before work, after my daughter goes to sleep, and every single weekend. I built [Loggd](https://loggd.life/rd/5), a personal growth app that combines habits, tasks, goals, focus timer, and gamification. Think GitHub contribution graph but for your real life.\n\nStarted building in November. Launched in December. Now 2+ months in.\n\n**My real numbers:**\n\n* 1,486 users\n* 11 Pro subscribers (14 total, 3 churned)\n* \\~€50 MRR\n* €320 total revenue since launch\n\nNot exactly screenshot worthy right?\n\n**What growth actually feels like:**\n\nEveryone imagines this smooth upward curve. Reality is nothing like that. One day I get 1 new user. Next day 2. Then randomly a Threads post hits and 97 people sign up overnight. Then back to 11. Then 3. Then boom 35 again.\n\nI market on Threads, Reddit, tried Meta ads, tried Google. Most growth comes from organic social, specifically Threads where I had posts hit 50k, 190k, even 300k views. But even viral posts dont guarantee paying users.\n\n**What nobody told me:**\n\nThe hardest part is not building the product. Its showing up to market it every single day when the numbers barely move. I had a day this month with literally 1 new user. One. After posting daily and building every night.\n\nBut the next day brought 35. And the day after that 97.\n\nThats the pattern. Silence then spikes then silence again. You just cant stop during the quiet days.\n\n**What I'm working on now:**\n\nNative mobile apps. Initially, 80%+ of my users were on mobile, but not everyone knows how to use a PWA or likes using an app through the browser. I got a lot of requests for native apps so thats the current focus. I think this will help with conversions and retention a lot.\n\n**What I'm NOT saying:**\n\nDont let this discourage you. I genuinely love doing this. I get messages from people in countries I've never been to telling me how much they like the app. People requesting features. I have 50+ daily active users showing up consistently. That stuff keeps you going more than any MRR number.\n\n**What I AM saying:**\n\nBe realistic. Dont expect $5k MRR in 2 months because for most of us that is just not how it goes. The early phase is a lot of work with slow and unpredictable growth. If you enjoy the process like I do, its worth every late night. But if you're only in it for the money you'll probably quit before it ever pays off.\n\nMy first SaaS I built for 9 months and abandoned at the marketing phase. This time I'm not stopping. The revenue is tiny but something is happening. The wheel is turning just slowly.\n\nHappy to answer anything. \n\n",

Then shape onboarding and pricing around that one or two core “jobs.”\n\nAlso separate “discovery” vs “decision” channels. Threads might be where people first hear about you, but maybe your long-form Reddit posts or email sequences are where they actually decide to pay. I’ve used tools like Fathom for analytics and Savio for feedback, and recently Pulse for Reddit to catch these niche SaaS grind threads and reply in a focused way instead of spraying random posts.\n\nThe key thing: double down on the small group who already pay and log in often, and let their behavior choose your features and channels.",

The conversion rate is your problem to solve now, not the acquisition. A few things to look at:\n\n- Talk to your free users. Literally email 20 of them and ask why they have not upgraded. The answers will tell you exactly what is missing.\n- Check your activation rate. Of those 1,486 users, how many actually used the product meaningfully? Users who sign up and never come back are not real users.\n- Consider your pricing. Sometimes the problem is not the product -- it is that the free tier gives away too much value. If people can solve their problem without paying, they will.\n\nThe phase you are in is completely normal. Most successful SaaS products took 6-18 months to find product-market fit.

      "text": "*After* [*my last post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1qxtava/how_8_apps_cloned_the_same_idea_and_each_makes/) *about the plant identifier app space got positive feedback, I went looking for the next market where a bunch of apps do the same thing and all make money. I found LinkedIn tools, which features a lot of copycats and operates in a gray area with regards to LinkedIn's Terms of Service.*\n\nI was able to find 20+ tools, most of which do one of two things: write your LinkedIn posts with AI, or automate your outreach. Interestingly, a huge chunk of them violate LinkedIn's TOS and some are straight up clones of each other. I chose a mixture of examples - from €7M ARR down to a solo dev pulling in $6K/month off a Chrome extension.\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nLinkedIn's native experience is genuinely terrible if you're trying to use it as a business tool. No scheduling, no carousel creator, no way to filter your feed, no real outreach tools. For the most important platform in B2B, the product is shockingly bare-bones.\n\nSo an entire gray market popped up to fill the gaps. Half these tools operate in a weird space - LinkedIn's TOS says no automation, yet the biggest automation tool just hit €7M ARR and is bootstrapped. LinkedIn either can't stop them or (more likely) quietly benefits from the extra activity they drive on the platform. They have an API, but it is apparently quite hard to get access to.\n\n# THE BREAKDOWN\n\n# 1. Waalaxy: €7M ARR, 150K+ users\n\nMost people have never heard of Waalaxy, and it's doing more revenue than probably all its competitors combined. French founder, no funding, €7M ARR in 3 years.\n\nIt automates LinkedIn connection requests, DMs, and follow-up sequences — all stuff LinkedIn explicitly prohibits. They added email outreach so you're not just dependent on LinkedIn's platform. Starting at €19/month when competitors charge $99-197.\n\n**Takeaway**: You can build a massive business violating a platform's TOS if the platform quietly benefits from what you're doing.\n\n# 2. PROSP: $126K/month\n\nPROSP's pitch is simple: send 4,000 LinkedIn DMs per month from one account. LinkedIn's actual limit is way lower. They get around it with residential proxies and account rotation.\n\n80% profit margins, 1,100 subscribers, AI-generated voice notes so your automated messages don't sound automated/AI.\n\nIt is currently for sale at $1M - that's 0.9x revenue for a business doing $126K/month at 80% margins.\n\n**Takeaway:** 80% margins and $126K/month sounds great, except when your entire business depends on not getting your customers banned. This undoubtedly hurts your valuation when trying to sell.\n\n# 3. Taplio: Acquired for $2M + $6M earn-out\n\nTaplio was the first serious LinkedIn-specific content tool - AI writes your posts, schedules them, gives you analytics. It sits in a price range of $65-199/month.\n\nBuilt by Tibo Louis-Lucas, who literally ran the same playbook on Twitter first (TweetHunter, which hit $1M ARR in 12 months) and then copied the concept to LinkedIn - same founder, same product, different platform. Got acquired by lempire for $2M upfront + $6M in earn-outs.\n\n**Takeaway:** Tibo had a playbook that worked and copied it over from Twitter to LinkedIn and got an $8mm exit. Cloning a product for a different platform/strategy can be a valid approach... Sometimes business really is just that simple.\n\n# 4. Supergrow: $63.5K/month\n\nNearly identical to Taplio, but at a much lower price point. It has the same features - AI post generation, scheduling, analytics, etc., but at $19-49/month instead of $65-199. It also hit #1 Product of the Week on ProductHunt.\n\nThe one real differentiator is a built-in carousel maker (carousel posts get 3x the engagement on LinkedIn, but are annoying to create manually). Other than that, it's Taplio at a third of the price. Clearly the market is big enough to tolerate two of the same.\n\n**Takeaway:** \"Same thing but cheaper\" is an underrated, but effective strategy, especially when the incumbent gets greedy and charges $65+ for something that isn't hard to replicate. People have different price thresholds and sensitivities. \n\n# 5. Kleo: $62K/month\n\nSame thing as Taplio and Supergrow - AI writes LinkedIn posts. Kleo's differentiator is it learns your voice from your post history so the output doesn't scream ChatGPT.\n\nPeople are getting really good at spotting AI-written LinkedIn posts, so \"sounds like you and not a robot\" is enough to get people to pay. \n\n**Takeaway:** One positioning difference (\"sounds like you, not ChatGPT\") is enough if it's the right one. \n\n*Side Note: This reminds me in the early days of ChatGPT when things like RizzGPT were making bank. Solving for stupid deficiencies in AI is still a valid market opportunity.* \n\n# 6. RedactAI: $6.5K/month\n\nThis is purely for writing LinkedIn posts. It doesn't do any of the scheduling, analytics, or carousel maker that the others do (yet at least). It is bare bones - pick a template (storytelling, listicle, hot take) and get a post out. The price point is extremely low too at just $11.90/month for their base offering.\n\nIt's a stripped-down version of tools 3, 4, and 5 - basically a ChatGPT wrapper with LinkedIn post templates. And it works - $78K/year from something you could build in a weekend.\n\n**Takeaway:** This is meaningful side income you can live off in many parts of the world and it probably only took a few days to build. Don't overcomplicate!\n\n# 7. Myfeedin: $6K/month\n\nEvery other tool on this list helps you create more stuff on LinkedIn, but Myfeedin helps you see less.\n\nIt's a browser extension that filters engagement bait out of your LinkedIn feed. Keyword blocking, content type filtering, whitelist mode. As we have all seen, LinkedIn's algo is optimized for engagement, but can be a cesspool of cringy content that you'd rather not see.\n\n**Takeaway:** Solve a simple problem with a simple solution and find customers. Also, its another example of using underutilized mediums like browser extensions to make meaningful income.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**Most of these tools are clones of each other.** Taplio, Supergrow, Kleo, RedactAI - 4 tools that all do \"AI writes your LinkedIn post\" with slightly different angles. On the automation side, Waalaxy and PROSP both send automated DMs at scale. I didn't mention these in this post, but Dripify, Expandi, Zopto, PhantomBuster, and a probably a dozen others are doing essentially the same thing.\n\n**Half the ecosystem violates LinkedIn's TOS.** LinkedIn explicitly bans automation, but obviously the \"automation tools\" are automation. For some reason, they don't seem to care or enforce it. LinkedIn probably benefits from the extra activity and looks the other way. They do however seem to enforce rules on specific accounts as its believed \\~23% of Dripify users get restricted within 90 days.\n\n**LinkedIn's terrible UX is the entire business model.** Every one of these tools exists because LinkedIn chose not to build it. No native scheduling, no carousel tool, no feed filtering, no outreach features.\n\n**Even last place pays.** $6K/month from a Chrome extension and $6.5K/month from a glorified ChatGPT wrapper. Solving simple problems simply (even in niches) can earn you meaningful income.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you liked this post and want to find your own cloneable products with real revenue, positioning angles, and competitor breakdowns.

However, I agree on one major point: the gray areas within a social network or specific application generate surprisingly large sums of money.\n\nOne example is a script or similar software for auto-playing popular Roblox games like Bloxfruit. Before Roblox targeted that market, almost every child or auto-farmer would search for free scripts or pay for a virus-free script/auto-playing program with advanced upgrades to play the game, instead of spending months grinding. I won't go into more detail about that script, but there are people who throw free scripts into adware and put them where children can find them, and when they see them, they're willing to spend time browsing those ad links to get the free scripts. A guy I know showed me a peak month where he earned over ten thousand dollars a month. It was amazing for a golden age, but I'm not sure if that was his actual earnings or just a bragging scam.\n\nAnyway, after Roblox switched to a client server, this niche is practically dead now. But the story I told above is a concrete example of making money in the gray area.",

It makes sense that these tools pop up, especially for folks who are constantly trying to \"optimize\" their presence. I've messed around with a few post-writing assistants myself, and it's a real mixed bag. Some are just buzzword generators, spraying \"synergy\" and \"disruptive\" all over the place, while others are surprisingly good at structuring your thoughts in a professional way.\n\nOne thing I've learned is to *always* heavily edit anything these AIs spit out. They can give you a good starting point, but you really need to inject your own voice and personality so it doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. Otherwise, you'll just blend into that wall of corporate profiles. Good luck navigating that gray area - tread carefully!",

That risk absolutely compresses exit multiples. 0.9x revenue at 80% margins says everything.\n\n**2. Same core product, different angle**  \nTaplio = serious creator  \nSupergrow = cheaper  \nKleo = “sounds human”  \nRedactAI = barebones\n\nThe differentiation isn’t tech, it’s who it’s for and what fear it resolves.\n\n**3. UX gaps are the real opportunity**  \nLinkedIn not building:\n\n* Native scheduling\n* Carousel builder\n* Feed filtering\n* Proper CRM-level outreach\n\nThat vacuum *is* the market.\n\nIf someone wanted to play this smarter long-term, I’d avoid the blatant TOS violations and instead focus on:\n\n* Workflow optimization around content ops\n* Analytics layering\n* Team collaboration for B2B creators\n* Safer “assistive” tools instead of automation tools\n\nAlso, low-key underrated angle: internal content systems. A lot of founders struggle not with writing posts, but with organizing ideas, repurposing, and structuring narratives across formats. Tools that streamline that pipeline (instead of blasting DMs) probably have better longevity. I’ve seen people use structured content workflow builders like Runable to manage ideation → drafting → repurposing without relying on sketchy automation, which feels way more durable long-term.\n\nBiggest takeaway though:\n\nLinkedIn’s bad UX isn’t a bug. It’s a moat for builders.\n\nCurious, if LinkedIn suddenly added native scheduling + carousels tomorrow, which of these tools survive?",

But every month we were losing customers at a rate that made growth feel like running on a treadmill.\nSo I did something that took a lot of time but ended up being one of the most valuable things I've done. I personally reached out to every customer who cancelled in Q3. Not a survey. Actual conversations. Some on calls, some over email, but real back-and-forth.\nI expected to hear that we were missing features. Or that a competitor was better. Or that pricing was too high. Those did come up occasionally. Maybe 20% of the time combined.\nThe overwhelming majority said some version of the same thing: \"We just stopped using it.\" Not because anything was wrong. They got busy. The person who set it up left the company. Priorities shifted. The product sat there unused for a couple months and then someone noticed the charge and cancelled.\nThe second most common reason was closely related. They never really got fully set up. Signed up with good intentions. Poked around. Got pulled in another direction. Never reached the point where it was embedded in their workflow.\nThis completely changed how I thought about churn. It wasn't a product problem. It wasn't a competition problem. It was an activation and engagement problem. Customers who were actively using us almost never left. Customers who drifted into inactivity were guaranteed to leave eventually.\nWe restructured our whole approach around this. Onboarding focused on getting people to one meaningful outcome in the first week. Automated checks to flag accounts going quiet before they disappear entirely.\nChurn improved meaningfully. And it came from actually understanding why people leave rather than guessing.\n",

The activation piece is huge too. There's this window right after signup where someone either builds the habit or they don't, and once that window closes it's almost impossible to pull them back. Most teams obsess over acquisition and treat onboarding as a checklist when it's really the single highest leverage moment in the entire customer lifecycle. The fact that your active users almost never churned tells you the product was fine all along. You just had a delivery problem, not a product problem.

Early on, I always assumed churn meant something was “wrong”, missing features, pricing, competition, etc.\n\nWhat really sticks with me is the emotional side of it. When you’ve supported a customer for 10, 15, even 20 years, losing them feels personal. I still remember one long-time client who dropped after decades, and it honestly haunted me for a while.  No big complaint. No angry email. Just… gone. That was the moment I realized churn isn’t always about failure, sometimes it’s about life, turnover, shifting priorities.\n\nLike you, that realization changed how I think about retention. Activation and ongoing engagement matter more than almost anything else.  If a customer is embedded into their workflow, they rarely leave. If they’re “kind of using it,” they eventually will.  Since then, I’ve focused far more on hands-on onboarding, early wins, and proactively checking in when activity drops.",

Three months later a product launched that bore suspicious resemblance to several aspects of how we described our approach. Can't prove the connection legally and the NDA doesn't really protect methodological knowledge shared in a sales conversation.\n\nLesson learned the hard way. Be careful about how much technical detail you share in pre-sale conversations with companies that could potentially compete with you. It's fine to demonstrate capability and explain outcomes but walking prospects through your proprietary approach to solving hard problems gives away more value than you realize. Most legitimate buyers don't need to understand your architecture. They need to understand your results.

          "text": "This is one of those lessons that sounds counterintuitive until you've been through it. Free users have no real “skin in the game” if you will. They’re there for exploration, so they’ll consider you just another app they could do without. Paying users are looking for results, which means their feedback actually maps to what makes the product better.\n\nThe other thing nobody talks about: free tiers attract people who will never convert. You end up building this phantom audience that doesn’t really show up when you need them. Meanwhile the people who would happily pay on day one never get the pricing signal that says \"this is serious software.\"\n\nWe went through a version of this building ProPlaintiff AI (https://www.proplaintiff.ai). It's a vertical SaaS for plaintiff personal injury law firms. Early on we had a 14 day free trial to attorneys in the door, self served. However, our turnover rate was abismal, loosing over 60% of sign ups before conversion. So we switched to a 7-day free trial, same issue. Now we do a mandatory demo so they’ll understand the app and consider converting after a shorter trial time.\n\nThe one nuance I'd add: charging early doesn't mean charging a lot. Even a small price creates accountability on both sides. And if you’re in a vertical like us that requires a bit of effort to learn then a demo is a huge plus",

Not because I spent\n\nmoney on ads. Not because I posted every day.\n\nBut because I started 20 conversations per day with the right people.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I had to start again tomorrow:\n\n**Step 1 : Find people who might actually buy**\n\nList your ideal customer. Who are they? What industry? What role? What problem keeps them up at night?\n\nNow go to Reddit and search for posts where these people describe that exact problem. Not your\n\nproduct category - the actual words they use to describe their pain.\n\n\"I'm spending 3 hours a day looking for leads on Reddit\" \"Is there a tool that monitors Reddit for\n\nmentions?\" \"How do you find relevant posts without scrolling for hours?\"\n\nThose are YOUR customers talking. Right there. For free.\n\nAt the beginning, do this manually. Search Reddit, bookmark relevant posts. Later, automate with\n\ntools like REPPIT AI that surface these conversations automatically.\n\n**Step 2 - Show up and be genuinely helpful**\n\nComment on those posts. Don't pitch. Don't link. Just help.\n\nShare what you know. Give specific, actionable advice. Be the most helpful person in that thread.\n\n**Step 3 - Let curiosity work for you**\n\nWhen you're consistently the most helpful person in a thread, people check your profile. They see\n\nyour other comments. Some Google your product name.\n\nNo hard sell needed. Curiosity converts better than any pitch.\n\n**Step 4 - Start 20 conversations per day**\n\nThat's the magic number. 20 genuine interactions daily — comments, DMs, replies.\n\nEven with a 5% conversion rate, that's 1 new conversation per day that leads somewhere.\n\nIn 30 days? 30 warm prospects. In my case, 30 became paying customers within 6 weeks.\n\nMost people spend weeks \"building a network.\" They try to post. They refresh analytics. They overthink.\n\n20 conversations. Every day. That's it.\n\nNo audience. No brand. No excuses.",

Free tier gone, support that doesn't exist unless you're on a $350/mo+ plan, shared IP deliverability that's a coin flip. A lot of teams are switching and tbh the alternatives have gotten pretty good.\n\n**SES** is the obvious pick if you care about cost ($10 for 100K emails), but you're building bounce handling, suppression, and analytics yourself. It's an email transport, not a platform.\n\n**Resend** has been gaining a ton of traction, especially in the Next.js world. Great DX. Watch the overage pricing though ($0.90/1K past your limit) adds up fast during a spike.\n\n**Postmark** is the deliverability pick. They separate transactional and broadcast into different IP pools, so your transactional reputation stays clean. They support both, but no automation or segmentation if you need advanced marketing.\n\n**SendGrid** honestly still makes sense between 10K-50K emails. $19.95 flat. If you're already integrated and not hitting their issues, switching might not be worth it.\n\nI'm the founder of **Dreamlit**, which takes an entirely different approach than the typical API-based email providers. Your Postgres database triggers emails instead of API calls. As a traditional software engineer, it's almost weird how you write no code to integrate. Not for everyone, but if you're on Supabase/Postgres it cuts integration from days to hours.\n\n**Quick pricing comparison:**\n\n| Provider | Free tier | 10K/mo | 100K/mo |\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n| Mailgun | 100/mo | $15 | $75 |\n| Postmark | 100/mo | $15 | ~$126 |\n| Resend | 3,000/mo | $20 | $90 |\n| Amazon SES | 3,000/mo* | ~$1 | ~$10 |\n| Brevo | 300/day | From $9 | Varies |\n| Mailtrap | 1,000/mo | $15 | $30 |\n| Dreamlit | 3,000/mo | $16 | $79 |\n\nWrote up a full breakdown with pros/cons. Link's in my profile if you want the deep dive.\n\nAnyone switched away from SendGrid recently? Curious what you landed on.",

Also, I can't see how it would be anywhere close to hours, let alone days, to wire up an email trigger? The trigger itself is one line of code for me. Even if I need to hit the DB for data to populate the email, we're talking minutes of effort. 🫤",

A few additions from running transactional email for multiple SaaS products:\n\n**Resend is genuinely excellent for developer-first setups.** The DX is the best in class right now. React Email integration is clean. The catch: it's newer, so some enterprise IT gatekeepers will ask questions about deliverability track record compared to established providers.\n\n**Postmark deserves more attention in this list.** It has dedicated transactional IP pools (no shared IP contamination from marketing emails), 100% focus on transactional (they don't do marketing sends), and the deliverability has been consistently the best I've measured. More expensive than SES, cheaper than SendGrid at scale. Support is actually good. Worth it for anything where email deliverability directly affects product reliability (password resets, invoices, alerts).\n\n**The SES + wrapper pattern is underrated.** SES + MailerSend or SES + Postal gives you cost efficiency with a proper sending platform on top. Takes a day to set up, saves significant money at volume.\n\n**One trap:** don't optimize purely for price at early stage. If transactional email fails and users don't get their confirmation/reset emails, that's churn. The deliverability difference between a 5/month proper provider and DIY SES is worth more than the cost delta until you have engineering bandwidth to operate it properly.\n\nMy current stack for new builds: Resend for simplicity, Postmark for anything where deliverability SLA matters.",

I'd double down on your recommendation of Postmark for anyone whose emails absolutely cannot fail.\n\nWe use them and If the primary use case is transactional (password resets, receipts, account alerts, onboarding sequences) Postmark is still one of the cleanest setups out there IMO. Their entire infrastructure is optimized around transactional delivery which shows in their inbox placement and speed. Reliability and deliverability are the north star, it's hard to beat.",

Framing around “when should you switch” (volume, complexity, team size) would be more actionable than a rate table.\n2. Your positioning for Dreamlit is interesting but buried. “Postgres triggers emails” is novel, but the real hook is reduced integration complexity and fewer moving parts. Spell out who this is perfect for (e.g., early-stage SaaS on Supabase with no backend infra team) and who it’s not.\n\nIf you turn this into a landing page, lead with a strong use-case headline, then present the comparison as supporting proof — not the core message.

Your wholesale customers log in and place orders like a normal store. You get real-time inventory. No fax required.\n\n**Option 2: Orderchamp / Faire / Ankorstore**\nB2B marketplaces. You list your catalog there. Wholesale buyers find you and order. Built-in payment terms, order management, and the inventory piece is handled. Tradeoff: they take a percentage and you're on their platform.\n\n**Option 3: Ordoro or similar OMS**\nFor pure order management without the storefront, these connect to your inventory system and let buyers submit orders through a portal. Good if your source of truth is already in a WMS or ERP.\n\nFor 60 wholesale accounts with the current email/fax workflow, I'd honestly recommend the Shopify + wholesale app route. The setup time is maybe a weekend. You get a hosted catalog, customer accounts, inventory sync, and order tracking — and the app pays for itself in reduced manual entry errors within the first month.\n\nWhat does your inventory source of truth look like? That determines whether you need a full sync or if Shopify can be the master.",

If they’re used to flipping through a PDF, something like Flipsnack can be a nice middle ground. You keep the catalog format they’re comfortable with, but turn it into a digital flipbook where they can click, fill quantities, and send an order straight from the catalog instead of emailing random SKUs. It also lets you update versions without resending giant attachments every time.\n\nThen you can pair that with a lightweight backend like Airtable, Google Sheets, or your inventory system so orders flow somewhere structured instead of inbox chaos. If later you outgrow it, you can still move to something heavier like Shopify B2B or a dedicated wholesale platform. But for \\~60 accounts, a catalog-first setup with built-in ordering is honestly way calmer than forcing everyone into a retail-style cart flow.",

WhatsApp had 55 engineers serving 450 million users when Facebook bought them. Instagram had 13 employees at acquisition. The trajectory has been moving this direction for a while, AI just compresses it further. The real question isn't whether one person can build something that generates massive value, it's whether one person can handle the decision making surface area that comes with it. Sales and support and ops can absolutely be automated or outsourced to a huge degree now. But judgment calls, strategic direction, legal exposure, partnership negotiations, those still need a human brain and there are only so many hours in a day. I think what actually happens isn't one person doing everything but one person orchestrating an army of AI agents and contractors without ever hiring a traditional team. That's functionally solo but not really solo in the way people imagine. The ceiling for what a single sharp operator can build has genuinely exploded though. A few years ago you needed a team just to ship a decent MVP. Now one person with the right tools can build, launch, and scale something that would have taken 15 people in 2019.",

That scale creates support load, infra risk, compliance exposure, chargebacks, outages, and enterprise requests whether you like it or not. Could one person “own” it? Maybe. Could one person truly operate all decision making at that scale long term? Extremely unlikely. What’s realistic is a solo founder hitting $1M to $10M ARR by orchestrating AI + contractors and then getting acquired at a spicy multiple. That’s a path we’re already seeing.

When asked by Mike Krieger (Anthropic's CPO and Instagram co-founder) if a billion-dollar business could be created by a single person using AI, Amodei said it would certainly happen, potentially as soon as 2026 — though he later walked it back to a 70-80% probability.\n\nKrieger's response was telling: \"It's not that crazy. I built a billion-dollar company with 13 people.\" He was referring to Instagram, which Facebook acquired for $1 billion in 2012. Krieger noted the main reason Instagram needed to scale its team was content moderation, which AI could now handle.\n\n# Where He Thinks It Could Happen\n\nAmodei said it would likely be \"in an area where you don't need a lot of human-institution-centric stuff to make money.\" His top picks were proprietary trading, developer tools with deep AI integration, and businesses that can automate customer service without needing large sales teams.\n\n# The Realistic Take\n\n**Why it's plausible (narrowly):** A solo founder running a prop trading fund or a viral SaaS tool that hits a $1B valuation on paper — sure, that's technically possible. Valuation ≠ revenue. A single person could build something that investors value at $1B based on growth trajectory, especially in AI-native categories.\n\n**Why the skepticism is valid:**\n\nTom Coshow, senior director analyst at Gartner, warns: \"We have to give \\[AI agents\\] very simple decisions to get reliable answers. We are nowhere near the point where we can just throw a lot of data at an AI agent and trust its decision.\" He adds that complex agents like an \"automatic VP of sales\" don't exist yet.\n\nThe real bottleneck isn't whether AI can write code or draft emails. It's the **human-trust layer** — legal liability, regulatory compliance, enterprise sales cycles, partnerships, and crisis management. These require human judgment and human relationships. A $1B company almost certainly interacts with other companies, governments, or consumers at scale, and those interactions still require trust that comes from human accountability.\n\n**The most likely scenario** is not \"one person does everything with AI\" but rather \"one person + AI + a constellation of contractors/agencies for the 5% of tasks that require human presence.\" Which is impressive, but it's a different claim.\n\n# The Uncomfortable Meta-Point\n\nAmodei is the CEO of an AI company. His prediction that AI will make one person capable of running a billion-dollar company is also a sales pitch for his own product. That doesn't make it wrong, but it's worth noting the incentive structure. The prediction serves Anthropic's narrative that AI is a transformative force multiplier — which it is, but the timeline and magnitude are doing a lot of heavy lifting in that claim.\n\nFor solo founders, the practical takeaway is: AI dramatically reduces the team size needed to build and scale a business. Whether that minimum is 1 person or 5 matters less than the directional shift. Build lean, automate aggressively, and focus on the parts that genuinely require your human judgment.",

      "text": "Launched free because I wanted users before revenue. The logic felt solid: get people using it, prove the value, then figure out monetization. Classic founder reasoning that sounds smart until you live with the consequences.\n\nFree users behave differently than paying ones. They're less engaged, less forgiving, and paradoxically more demanding because they feel no obligation to be patient. They also give terrible product feedback because their relationship with the product is casual. They'll tell you they love a feature they've used once and ignore something they'd rely on daily if they were invested enough to actually learn it.\n\nWhen I eventually introduced pricing after five months, I lost about 80% of the user base overnight. The people who stayed were the ones who would have paid from day one. All that time optimizing for free user behavior, building features they requested, prioritizing what kept them engaged, most of it was wasted because the paying customers had different needs and different usage patterns entirely.\n\nWhat charging from day one gives you is signal clarity. If someone pays you money, even a small amount, their behavior tells you something meaningful about your market. If they don't pay, you've learned something equally valuable. Free users give you vanity metrics and false confidence. Paying users give you a business.",

This mindset was reinforced by big tech companies and venture backed startups. They offered their products for free and prioritized growth first.\n\n\nBut that model depends on something most solo founders do not have, massive funding, long runway and alternative monetization such as ads or data.\n\nPaying users create direction. When someone pays, they are signaling a real and specific pain. Their feedback is grounded in actual use, not a passing thought after a few minutes in the app. Free users often multiply noise. They generate feature requests, support messages, and confusing analytics that pull you in different directions. That fragments your focus.\n\n\nAt the same time, charging does not mean removing trust. Users should have a fair way to evaluate the product before committing. A clear trial period, transparent pricing, reminders before billing, and simple cancellation create safety and trust between users who are willing to pay but only if the product delivers what it promised",

That’s when the real work began. Pivoting, pushing myself past the brink of what I thought was possible and finding out what clicks. I now have nearly 30 tools, two completely different sides of my platform and am still gathering data and structuring the business for the future. Over 100 users and consistency is growing steadily. Lot of my issue was my platform did not quickly direct the user where to go and what to do. Slowly fixing that up as I go. \n\nThis isn’t an overnight sensation, and thank goodness I grew to be okay with that. Even if you make 1-5K MRR now, you’ll likely be out of business within the year with tech being built every second of every day. I’ve seen it happen to my clients overnight. 5K + a month to nothing.

I \"vibe coded\" my most recent project, which has made about $12k since starting last month.\n\nMy point is that ...all of my projects earned revenue, which doesn't necessarily make them a success. \n\nBut it does mean I know my audience.

      "text": "This one is almost too effective to share.\n\nEvery SaaS has unhappy customers. Those customers go to Reddit and vent publicly. And those complaints are your best sales opportunities.\n\n**Here's why this is so powerful:** these people already understand the problem space (no education needed), already have budget allocated (they're paying a competitor), are actively unhappy (ready to switch), and are publicly asking for alternatives.\n\nThat's the highest-intent prospect you'll ever find. Higher than any ad click. Higher than any cold email response.\n\n**The method:**\n\n**Step 1:** List your top 5 competitors.\n\n**Step 2:** Search Reddit for \"\\[competitor name\\]\" alternative OR \"\\[competitor name\\]\" issue OR \"\\[competitor name\\]\" pricing\n\n**Step 3:** You'll find dozens of frustrated users describing exactly what they wish was different.\n\n**Step 4:** Write a genuinely helpful comment. Don't trash the competitor that looks petty. Instead, acknowledge their frustration and offer objective alternatives: \"I've used \\[competitor\\] too and had similar issues with X. Depending on what matters most to you, here are 3 alternatives I've tested: \\[tool A\\] for Y, \\[tool B\\] for Z, and \\[your tool\\] if you specifically need W.\"\n\n**The key:** be honest and balanced. Recommend competitors when they're genuinely better for that use case. People trust someone who gives objective advice over someone who only pushes their own product.\n\n**My results from last month:**\n\n3 customers in one month (high ticket niche), started this strategy since Jan. 2026 + this will compound over time the more I find posts to comment.\n\nThe hardest part is finding these conversations across 50+ subreddits consistently. I use AI Reddit tools like Reppit AI to monitor competitor mentions in real-time, which surfaces opportunities I'd never find manually.\n\nTry it this week: search your #1 competitor's name + \"alternative\" on Reddit. I guarantee you'll find warm prospects over time, as these posts already rank on google, it's like Parasite SEO.",
