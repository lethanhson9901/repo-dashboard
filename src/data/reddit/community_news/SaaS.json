      "text": "I need to say this because I see this sub is filled with people crying about \"marketing is hard\" while trying to sell a $5 month habit tracker to broke college students XD\n\nI’ve built 30+ MVPs. The ones that have failed? Almost exclusively were B2C \"lifestyle\" apps. The ones making  $20k MRR right now? Boring, ugly B2B tools for unsexy industries.\n\nIf you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, B2C is a trap. You are playing the lottery. You need millions of users to make a living wage. You are competing with TikTok for attention.\n\nStop trying to be the next Zuckerberg. Be the guy who helps a plumbing company organize their invoices.\n\nHere is the \"Value\" part that most devs ignore:\n\n1. The \"Wallet Friction\" Reality\nI built a fitness app for a client once. Getting a consumer to pay $9.99 a month was like pulling teeth. They churned if the UI wasn't perfect.\nThen I built a crappy inventory management tool for a local warehouse. It looked like Windows 95. The owner paid $500 month without blinking. Why? **Because it saved him $2,000 month in lost stock.**\nBusinesses spend money to make money. Consumers spend money to be entertained (and they hate paying for it).\n\n2. You can't out design big tech\nIn B2C, your UI/UX has to be world-class. If your animation stutters, users leave.\nIn B2B, nobody cares. I have a client running a logistics SaaS where the main dashboard is literally a giant HTML table. No React, no Tailwind, just data. His users love it because it loads in 100ms and does the job.\nBoring problems = Lower technical bar = Faster MVP.\n\n3. Marketing is actually easier\nMarketing a consumer app means buying ads and praying for viral tweets.\nMarketing a B2B app? You find 50 plumbing companies on Google Maps and you email them. You can literally call your customers. Try calling your users for your \"AI dating coach.\"\n\nThe Actionable Advice:\nStop looking for ideas on ProductHunt. Go talk to your uncle who runs a roofing business. Go ask your dentist what software they hate.\n\nFind a business that is using Excel to manage a complex process. Build a SaaS that replaces that Excel sheet. Charge $100 month. You only need 80 customers to make six figures.\n\nOr keep building your \"Social Network for Gamers\" and wondering why you have 0 revenue.\n\nBoring pays the bills. \"Cool\" burns the runway.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.",

B2B is boring in a very specific way that not everyone can actually stick with. Calling plumbers, dealing with procurement quirks, weird payment cycles, legacy workflows, zero dopamine feedback. It pays but it’s not magically easier emotionally.\n\nThe wallet friction thing is dead on though. Once something ties directly to revenue or cost leakage, the conversation flips completely. I’ve seen businesses argue for weeks over a small monthly increase on a consumer product and then approve a chunky invoice in one call because it reduced some operational headache. It’s not about design or vibes at that point, it’s math.\n\nWhere I slightly disagree is the idea that B2C is always a lottery. It is if you’re chasing vibes and virality. It’s less so when there’s a very specific job being done and distribution is already there. Most people don’t have that, so they default to building for themselves and hope the market shows up.\n\nThe Excel replacement advice is evergreen. If you find a spreadsheet that someone is afraid to touch because it might break, there’s usually money hiding there. I’ve gotten into the habit of quietly tracking where time actually goes in these projects and it’s wild how often the boring stuff is what compounds.\n\nCurious how many folks here who swear by B2C have actually sat across from a business owner and watched how fast they decide when something clearly saves them money.",

      "text": "I'm a PM at [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) now, but before this I was the founding engineer at a startup that sold for $15M in 18 months. Sharing bc I think this is relevant for founders here.\n\nThe founders had been running this playbook for years. One had 8 successful exits, the other had 3. When they hired me, they told me exactly how it would go. I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as they said.\n\nHere's the playbook:\n\n**Step 1: Pick a legacy industry (this is the most important step)**\n\nFind an industry as far from Silicon Valley as possible. The key criteria: customers and competitors should not be able to build anything themselves. Ideally, you or your co founder has domain expertise. If you don't, find a co founder who does\n\nWe sold to benefits brokers, the people who handle 401(k)s and HSAs. Other good verticals: oil and gas, medical SaaS, logistics, construction tech.\n\nWhat to avoid: anything where your customers are technical. Dev tools would be a terrible choice. If your buyer can look at your product and think \"I could build this,\" you're in the wrong market.\n\n**Step 2: Build a product and raise money, but not for the reasons you think**\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: the product doesn't have to be great. You shouldn't waste too much time making it perfect. The product is the least important part of this playbook.\n\nWhat matters is legitimacy & credibility. Raising money signals to people in these industries that you're a real company, not two people in a garage. Most people in legacy industries don't know Sequoia from some random angel syndicate, so don't waste time chasing name-brand VCs. Just raise around $1M and move on.\n\nHiring a few people also helps. It makes you look like a \"real\" company. The whole point here is building trust and brand recognition within the industry.\n\n**Step 3: Sign design partnerships with potential acquirers**\n\nI know most people on the internet advise against design partnerships, but for this playbook they're essential, with one critical caveat: your design partners need to be companies that could eventually acquire you.\n\nWe partnered with 4 big names in the employee benefits space. If you can, get them to invest in your company. Give their CEOs board seats. You're not optimizing for product feedback here. You're optimizing for relationships and positioning.\n\n**Step 4: Build deep rapport over 12+ months**\n\nThis is the step that takes the longest, but it's what makes everything else work.\n\nOur CEO was talking to all 4 design partner CEOs on a weekly basis. You need to understand what initiatives they have going on, what they care about, what keeps them up at night. You need to become a trusted advisor, someone they see as a technology expert who actually understands their space.\n\nIf these companies have subsidiaries, start meeting with them too. Cast a wide net within the org.\n\nWhile this is happening, you can talk to other customers and generate some revenue, but honestly, revenue is the least important metric in this playbook.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the opportunity**\n\nIf you've done steps 1 through 4 correctly, this part is actually easy.\n\nIn our case, one of our design partners had a subsidiary that grew rapidly. They suddenly needed an AI solution to handle some stuff around the benefits they were selling. What they needed was adjacent to our product, but not exactly what we built.\n\nThis is the sweet spot. They had a problem. We had the team, the trust, and enough product to be credible.\n\nInstead of offering to build them a feature, we offered to sell them the whole company. If you can create this dynamic with multiple design partners at once, even better. Deal heat is real.\n\n**Step 6: Close**\n\nCall it an acqui-hire, call it a quick sale, whatever. Close the deal.\n\nYou'll probably need to stay on afterward to build the solution you discussed, but that's fine. You just sold your company for 8 figures.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Go into a narrow legacy industry where buyers can't build\n2. Build credibility as a tech expert and domain expert\n3. Sign design partners who could be acquirers\n4. Build deep rapport over 12+ months\n5. Identify an adjacent opportunity\n6. Sell the company, not a feature\n\nI know this seems counterintuitive. This playbook basically does everything most people online advise against. Don't obsess over product. Don't focus on revenue. Do design partnerships. Optimize for relationships over growth.\n\nIf you're trying to build a billion dollar company, this is NOT the playbook for you. Many people here are swinging for that, and that's great. But if you want a low 8-figure exit in under 2 years, this works. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

The point is not to have a good product that solves a real problem, the point is to build your personal brand within said industry and become a trusted advisor to senior executives.   \n  \nI know this seems counterintuitive, but this is why this playbook is different and has worked for us in the past",

It’s not about the beer, it’s about removing the transactional layer. Once people stop feeling like they’re being worked, they open up.

      "text": "If you are tired of posting on LinkedIn for 0 likes, hate the idea of sending 100 cold emails a day, or just feel like \"standard\" growth tactics are too slow, this is for you.\n\nI just hit $27k MRR with my new project, Rebelgrowth.\n\nAnd i did it by ignoring most of the standard \"SaaS advice.\"\n\nHere is the thing.\n\nEveryone focuses on the tool.\n\n\"Look at my AI wrapper.\" \"Look at my new feature.\"\n\nBut the money isn't in the tool.\n\nIt’s in the **Offer + The Funnel.**\n\nI learned this the hard way.\n\nBefore this, I sold my previous startup (CreativiU) to 7-figures.\n\nI spent years obsessing over what Russel Brunson teaches in Expert Secrets.\n\nAnd here is the \"ugly\" truth about how i actually grow.\n\n**1. The \"Anti-Free Trial\" Offer**\n\nStop asking people to marry you on the first date.\n\nStandard 14-day free trials are boring. They have no urgency.\n\nFor my previous company, i used a \"free + shipping\" model. I gave away physical supplies and just charged $7.99 for shipping.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause getting someone to pull out their wallet changes the relationship.\n\nIt is 10x easier to upsell a customer who paid $7.99 than it is to convert a free user.\n\nI’m using this same logic for Rebelgrowth (an AI SEO tool).\n\nInstead of a generic trial, my offer is: **3 Days Free + First Month for $9.**\n\nThe regular price is $97/mo, which kicks in at Month 2.\n\nThis works because it stops the scroll.\n\nIt’s an \"unusual\" offer in a sea of sameness.\n\nThen, inside the app, I upsell to a $299 plan.\n\nThis \"tripwire\" approach covers my ad spend so i can acquire customers for essentially $0.\n\n**2. The \"Trojan Horse\" SEO Strategy**\n\nI love SEO, but waiting 6 months for traffic sucks.\n\nSo i cheat.\n\nI call this the **Trojan Horse Interview.**\n\nBack in the day, i started a marketing podcast.\n\nBut the goal wasn't listeners. The goal was backlinks.\n\nI would interview experts and run a \"contest\" for their audience.\n\nTo enter the contest, the guest had to host the participation guidelines on **THEIR** website.\n\nAnd guess what was in those guidelines?\n\nA juicy backlink to my site.\n\nThey got engagement/traffic. I got domain authority.\n\nWin-win.\n\n**3. Paid Ads (For people who hate losing money)**\n\nI treat ads like a vending machine.\n\nI put $1 in, i need to know when $2 comes out.\n\nI built a massive spreadsheet where every row is a touchpoint (CPM, CPC, Click rate, Churn).\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend, knowing i’ll be profitable in 3 months.\n\nMy strategy is stupidly simple:\n\n* **Meta:** I target broad. US + Europe. My creative is my targeting. I use UGC style videos (15-30 seconds). I use tools like Sora Pro to make hooks because i’m lazy.\n* **Google:** I only bid on **Competitor Keywords**. I don't use their name in the text (don't get sued), but i pin my \"$9 Offer\" in the headline.\n\n**4. Being an Early Adopter (The \"Shiny Object\" Strategy)**\n\nYou have to be where your competitors aren't.\n\nIn Nov 2025, i saw John Rush launch TinyAdz. I jumped on it immediately. Cheap traffic.\n\nWhen Marc Lou launched TrustMRR, I bought an ad spot instantly.\n\nIt was the best ROAS i’ve ever had.\n\nBut you win some, you lose some.\n\nI also burned $500 paying an X influencer who got me zero clicks.\n\nThe point is to move fast.\n\n**Summary of the playbook:**\n\n1. Create an irresistible, \"weird\" offer (low friction entry).\n2. Use that offer to liquidate your ad spend (break even immediately).\n3. Use \"Trojan Horse\" tactics for authority.\n4. Upsell the backend to make profit.\n\nMost people are trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.\n\nFix the offer (the bucket), and filling it becomes easy.\n\nHas anyone else tried a $1 or $9 \"tripwire\" offer for SaaS? Or is everyone still stuck on \"Freemium\"?\n\nBorja Obeso, founder [Rebelgrowth.com](http://Rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)",

I enter the flow state. I spend months over-engineering the backend, setting up Docker/K8s for a simple app, perfecting the database schema. It feels like \"work\" so I feel productive.\n3. **The Reality:** App is ready. It works. Now I have to market it.\n4. **The Freeze:** I just... stop.\n\nI am a massive introvert. The idea of \"building a personal brand\" or doing tiktok dances makes me cringe. honestly i feel like a scammer whenever i try to \"sell\" something, even if i know the code is solid.\n\nSo the project just sits there. 0 users. eventually i lose interest, archive the repo, and start a new one. I’m tired of this cycle. I have the tech skills to build anything but i just cant sell to save my life. How do you force yourself to do the marketing side? Is it actually possible to grow a SaaS in 2026 without showing your face or being an \"influencer\"?\n\nAny advice for a dev tired of building ghost towns?",

So it’s been compounding as I find rhythm. \n\nFirst, I started learning to code last year. Piece by piece I built a system. Piece by piece I expanded the system. Went from building a simple tool for my clients to having an arsenal of tools of at least 40 now that have the ability to dominate an underserved industry. \n\nNext, was the marketing. And ugh what a drag.. Like all of you devs out there, I just wanted to build and my product to sell itself. Well with 100 or less users a month, that wast gonna happen lol. I have built a marketing system that is incredible now. Email marketing I can send out to everyone at any time, social media marketing that’s automatic (paid for some of this), and SEO is somewhat picking up. Still learning a lot and I am still faceless. I do use LinkedIn to generate a lot of buzz now though using myself to build trust. But no videos no dancing no nonsense. Just posting and hitting pain points. \n\nPoint being, it’s a slow process but you can do it. If you can spend 8 months crafting an awesome app, you can spend time creating a marketing system. Just improve 1% a day and you’ll see results months later.",

Maybe you can test outbound first, and you can use AI platforms, why? because these AI tools have a good base knowledge level, gives you standardization, and can do a lot of heavy lifting for you, while you keep building:\n\nMy recommendation:\n\n1. Give Claude your initial ICP definition and ask it to divide it into keywords, for example \"B2B software startups and scaleups with 1-10 employee count, revenue $500K-$5M and located in USA - targeting founders, co-founders, CEOs and VPs of sales, growth and GTM\" -> then divide location / revenue / employee count and some other keywords into multiple sub keywords -> example: USA -> NYC, SF, Chicago, ...\n2. \\[I use this tool and am happy, but any other similar platform can do the work\\] Go to Starnus (it's your Claude for Sales), choose one of their template lead gen prompt templates and dump your ICP keywords there (for sub keywords, choose 1 at a time). Then get a clean leads list with enriched data and contact info.\n3. Either manually connect with those leads on LinkedIn with a small note attached, or again use Starnus to send those requests.\n4. Track conversions, iterate and improve.\n\nSome tips:\n\n\\- You need 200-500 reachouts per week (at least), use 1-3 LinkedIn accounts (with LI Premium you get up to 250-300 connection requests per week per account).\n\n\\- Be hyper personalized, and it's not just saying Hi {{ first\\_name }}, you need to research the leads, Starnus will do it for you, or you can use Sales Nav to do manual search or other auto-signals and auo-enrichment tools.\n\nBottom line, start setting up your pipelines, and experiment, iterate and improve, until you find something that seems like it can scale.",

This part alone is the work of 3 people, easy. Spending 15 minutes researching each person and messaging them, which seems pretty quick to me if we’re actually personalizing the message, still only gets you a total of 160 contacts on a 40 hour week if you don’t spend a single minute on anything else.

Give yourself permission to do things that you think are 'cringe', that's the only way you'll get the feedback you need to improve.\n\nAnnounce to friends and family, build in public, get real people (especially strangers) to test it.

Tech people need to pick up a lot of “soft people skills” and the “people” dimension if they want to successfully connect, engage, and trigger the “buy” emotion.\n\nLost in all this GROK voodoo magic? Maybe start by creating a “Buyer Journey Map” for your product and/or service.\n\nIt provides a visual guide of the communication paths and protocols needed for making an effective two-way connection with YOUR target audience.\n\nIt also helps you identify noise and gaps on your communication channels.\n\n\nOnce you have your map, you can start thinking marketing and sales funnels. And building your communication stack with relevant metrics to measure signal strength and noise.\n\nBuilding SaaS solutions requires mastering some frameworks, connecting software blocks, mastering program interfaces and adapting databases to name just a few of the many necessary tasks for delivering a viable solution.\n\nA similar process is needed for triggering “buy emotions.” \n\nSo create your “Buyer Journey Map”, identify the communication channels, configure the communication protocols, and zero in on the “right” BUY frequency for YOUR SaaS solution.",

So I wrote down size, industry, buying power, tech stack, and 80% of the companies I was chasing didn’t make sense.\n* I learned that different professionals live in different channels: C-level respond on LinkedIn in the morning, mid-level managers usually check emails after lunch, and sales pick up cold calls.\n* I didn’t have an organization system. I was just using linkedIn, notion for notes, google docs for templates, and a calendar. But it was a mess, so I had to learn how to build automated flows and manage it. Now, for me, it's a combination of pipedrive, sales navigator, and linked helper.\n* I realized people don’t react to lists of features, they react to the one thing that’s currently painful, so I began writing mini-essays about something specific.\n* Personalization is not {FirstName}; it’s showing that you looked at the person. I refer to recent posts or updates on their product or to something happening in the market.\n* I decided to track 3 metrics that really show the process and results: connection-to-meeting rate, reply rate by channel, win/loss ratio.\n* I decided to test changes in small bites - not to change the entire template or funnel, but only the CTA or only the hook. It showed better what really worked.\n\nNot saying it’s the right way to do outbound, but it really worked for me, so hope it helps.",

Was it a hiring spike, churn issue, new tool rollout, budget reset, whatever. That becomes your trigger playbook, and you can start grouping micro-campaigns around those instead of broad segments.\n\n\n\nSecond, your metric stack is solid, but I’d tag each touch with the core angle (case study, problem callout, teardown offer, etc.) so you can see which angle actually moves connection-to-meeting per persona.\n\n\n\nOn tools: I’ve bounced between Apollo and Clay for enrichment, and use Sales Nav the way you do; Pulse for Reddit has been useful just to spot live pain posts and steal the exact wording prospects use in the wild.\n\n\n\nSo yeah: go narrow ICP, clear “why now,” then scale what gets real replies, not just sends.",

I've built everything from small business sites to big brand used by millions, and I'm currently working on my own SaaS.\n\nOne thing I've learned after all these years: even the most experienced developers and designers need a fresh pair of eyes.\n\nYou can stare at your own product for weeks and completely miss things that a stranger would catch in 30 seconds, whether it's a confusing UX flow, a landing page that doesn't convert, copy that misses the mark, or a technical choice that will bite you later.\n\nSo here's the deal: drop your SaaS link in the comments and I'll give you real, actionable feedback for free.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Don't tell me what your SaaS is for, I need to know it by looking at your page instantly.\n\nNo strings attached. I genuinely enjoy reviewing products, and I always learn something in the process too.\n\nDrop your links below!\n\n**EDIT:** With all the comments, I will not be able to review everyone unfortunately, I will do my best but here major issues I find in almost all sites:\n\n1. Add trust in your hero, like how many businesses or people use your tool.\n2. Add a video of your product right after hero.\n3. Add good testimonials.\n4. Add a great about page, many visitors will check this page to know who's behind the business.\n5. Most importantly, add a cookie consent banner, many countries, like EU/EEA countries, require an opt-in cookie consent, and you could have trouble.",

              "text": "This is cleaner than most resume tools I've seen. \"The cleanest resume scanner\" is a specific claim and the page backs it up. No sidebar ads, no upsell popups mid-flow, no LinkedIn audit nonsense distracting from the core job.\n\nThe before/after comparison (48 -> 94) does real work. Showing weak bullet points transformed into quantified achievements makes the value immediately obvious. That's proof, not just promises.\n\nYour competitor comparison table is bold. Most tools avoid naming competitors directly. You're saying \"here's how we're different from Jobscan, Enhancv, and MyPerfectResume\" and backing it with specifics. That confidence signals you've actually thought about positioning.\n\nTestimonials are solid too. Real names, photos, verified badges, and specific outcomes (\"Score: 45 -> 92\", \"3 interviews in 1 week\"). That's how social proof should work.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nThe hero buries the outcome slightly. \"Optimize Your ATS Score\" is the mechanism. \"Land More Interviews\" is the outcome. I'd flip the emphasis. Nobody wakes up wanting a higher ATS score. They want callbacks.\n\n\"The cleanest\" is a strong claim but subjective. You might test something more concrete like \"No ads. No noise. Just your resume, optimized.\" You already have that as subhead copy. It's more defensible.\n\nThe page is long. That's fine for SEO and thoroughness, but the path from landing to \"Upload Your Resume\" could be shorter. Consider whether everything above the fold earns its position.\n\nVisually it's the same dark mode with teal accent that half of SaaS uses right now. Not a problem, just not distinctive. The product is strong enough that the design doesn't need to do heavy lifting, but it's worth noting.\n\nOverall this is well-executed. You understand your user's problem (\"75% of resumes never reach a human recruiter\") and you've built clear proof throughout the page. Most resume tools feel like they're trying to extract money. This one feels like it's trying to solve a problem. That comes through.",

Just small details that could help you look more trustworthy. When i opened your landing page the cta was actually cropped out from view. There was a lot of text I didnt even try to read since it became quite an overload, try to guide the user where to look and what to read because right now there is a bit too much going on at once and it's very hard to get a precise idea of what its about. Also I'd strongly suggest changing or dimming down these glow effects (green/blue/purple neons) also they could look cool they are strongly associating your saas to poorly generated AI software we see everywhere. It's not a simple task but if I were you I would try and look closely and understand the more premium designs of other software to obtain a more mature look. Hopefully this helps!",

It tells me what shelf you're on, not why I should pick you up. \"Get discovered without cold outreach\" is an actual promise. Lead with that.\n\nRight now the page explains the mechanism before establishing why I should care. Flip it. Outcome first, system second.\n\nOne other thing: \"FOR FOUNDERS. BY FOUNDERS.\" doesn't do much without a story behind it. Who built this? What did you fail at before building it? That context builds trust more than the badge.\n\nVisually it's clean but the dark mode with teal accent is everywhere right now. Nothing breaks through as distinctly GrowBase. Not a dealbreaker, just something to consider as you grow.\n\nYou're not a fundraising CRM. You're the anti-pitch-deck. Own that harder and the right founders will find you.",

On my desktop your main hero section has a big blank section in the middle, it seems very scattered towards the sides of the view. When your users land on your landing page you want the primary focus to be on the center of the screen, it's where users most often expect to find their information. Having your heading and animation be seperated like that feels quite off. Also i would strongly suggest using ease in/ease out for your animations, to help smooth out the animations, they feel quite harsh right now. And as you scroll downwards it feels a bit too much free and might be hard for the user to understand whats going. I think there is a need for things to be sectionned off more precisely so that your user slowly reads the info one by one. Let me know if this helps!",

First, privacy is becoming a huge deal. Asking a company to upload thousands of sensitive IBANs or VAT numbers to a random server just to check a checksum is a massive security risk. I wanted to see if I could solve that by keeping 100% of the logic inside the browser.\n\nSecond, I've seen how messy data can be in most companies. Often, they don't bother cleaning up their databases because specialized APIs are just too expensive for a \"first pass\" validation. My tool lets them do that big initial scrub without the high costs or the risk of a data leak.\n\nRight now, I'm targeting SMEs, accountants, and other devs who deal with bulk financial records. If you have a messy CSV and need to make sure the data is mathematically sound before hitting \"pay\" or importing it into an ERP, this is for you.\n\nAs for the money, I literally launched yesterday, so I’m sitting at exactly $0 MRR right now ! This is my first project as a side-indie dev, so I’m mostly focused on proving the concept and getting feedback. I also open-sourced the core engine as a NuGet package because I genuinely think this kind of basic validation should be accessible to any .NET dev out there.",

I think this glow blue/purple effect starts to be seen in a lot of places and is starting to look like 'AI slop' or quickly generated website. I would suggest avoiding this aesthetic. Furthermore, your type needs a bit more refining, the kerning is too narrow on the header and too wide on the buttons/navbar feels quite off. And the use of uppercase and lowercase feels inconsistent. Also your CTA is a bit unclear, I get that you want to make the user try a feature but make it as simplest as possible in the landing page so that the user is easily guided to try it out. Just a few details that really wont hurt to adjust for creating trust.",

      "text": "Early stage marketing is brutal...  \n  \n... because nobody gives a shit about your product  \n  \n“Just post every day.”  \n  \n“Just do SEO.”  \n  \n“Just run Meta ads.”  \n  \n“Just build in public.”  \n  \nOk.  \n  \nNow try doing that with:  \n  \nno audience  \n  \nno brand  \n  \nno trust  \n  \nno one searching your name  \n  \nand 3 months of runway  \n  \nYou realize fast that most advice is written by people who already made it out.  \n  \nThe early stage is not about “marketing.”  \n  \nIt’s about not being invisible.  \n  \nNobody cares about your product.  \nThey care about what’s already in front of them.  \n  \nPosting into the void is not distribution.  \nIt’s journaling.  \n  \nThe shift for me was realizing:  \n  \nTraffic is rented.  \n  \nDistribution is owned.  \n  \nAnyway, I’ve made the same mistakes twice now, so here’s the only stuff that actually worked for me, channel by channel, rapid fire:  \n  \nSEO #1 tip:  \n  \nTarget high-intent keywords correctly.  \nNot “how to do X” keywords.  \n  \nMore like “best X for Y” or “X alternative” or “X pricing”.  \nIntent prints money. Traffic doesn’t.  \n  \nOutreach #1 tip:  \n  \nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.  \n  \nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.  \n  \nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.  \n  \nJust start a convo like a human.  \n  \nAds #1 tip:  \n  \nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.  \n  \nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.  \n  \nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.  \n  \nSocial #1 tip:  \n  \nHooks are everything.  \n  \nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.  \n  \nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.   \n  \nPartnerships #1 tip:  \n  \nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.  \n  \nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.  \n  \nContent #1 tip:  \n  \nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.  \n  \nNot like a SaaS landing page.  \n  \nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.  \n  \nThat’s basically it.  \n  \nMost founders don’t need more tactics.  \n  \nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E  \n  \nWe're building [Rebelgrowth](https://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit) around this idea (owned distribution through SEO + leveraged citations), $26k MRR so far, still grinding.  \n\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?  \n\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria",

Reddit, niche Slack/Discords, industry forums, whatever. Think “be the helpful regular,” not “drop my link everywhere.”\n\nTwo practical tweaks:\n\n1) Build a tiny “signal system”: F5bot or Mention for brand/keyword alerts, plus something like SparkToro to find where your buyers hang out, plus Pulse in the background surfacing high-intent Reddit threads so you’re not guessing where to jump in.\n\n2) Tie every channel to one clear ask that leads to a quick win (template, calculator, teardown). If that doesn’t convert, fix the offer, not the channel.\n\nSo yeah: early game is all about engineered serendipity, not generic “marketing.",

Strangers want chaos and laughs. That mix usually turns into trolling, not a product people pay for every month. Imagine your power bill or pipes if some bored dude decides “tropical vacation” at 3am all week.\n\nIf you like this space, flip the concept: same tech, but used for very small, trusted circles and clear value. Example: shared homes, student housing, or Airbnbs where guests can pick “scenes” (lighting, music, temp presets), and hosts get data on what configs people actually like. That’s closer to a hospitality tool than a social app.\n\nI’d prototype cheap: Home Assistant + a simple web UI, test in one building, see if anyone would pay actual money. I used Reddit plus tools like Zapier and Pulse for Reddit to sanity-check ideas like this before writing any serious code.\n\nSo: as pitched, fun joke, not a $14.95/mo for 50k users kind of thing.",

I mean how clueless can people be? Use SEMRush or Google Keyword Planner or some similar tool to figure out if anyone is actively searching for it before you build it. If no one is searching for it, there is no demand and if you don't have a multimillion dollar ad budget to create the market, then don't do it. \n\nA child could figure that out.\n\nNothing is over when there is demand. That's like saying \"restaurants are over\" or \"clothing is over\".\n\nNo market is \"saturated\". This is also a weird notion people have.\n\nSaturated means \"high demand\"... what YOU are supposed to be doing is building something better or simpler or cleaner and more intuitive or emphasizing a great feature that no one else does or whatever... not avoiding huge demand to get into spaces with zero demand and then spending months building something and then spending your days scratching your head wondering why your new money tree isn't bearing fruit.\n\nFrankly, its painful to watch.",

Today they have to look at patient records in their EHR, look at the schedulers in their practice management system, look at their email client to find their referrals and results, look up the medical journals to find supporting evidence for their treatment plans. \n\nThe doctor of the future will have a single pane of glass that connects all of these systems together under the hood and then presents a set of workflows to automate all of the tasks that are needed to connect the dots. \n\nThe use cases shift from looking at data to processing and compiling data and then presenting it. \n\nGive me a list of patients that haven’t had an annual check up for 2 or more years\n\nTriage all the incoming results and rank them based on urgency \n\nMonitor my schedule and alert patients proactively  when I’m running behind \n\nWhen designing the next killer app, it can’t just be a slick UI and a few jobs to be done. You need to dive into the inefficient workflows and unblock them; integrations and multi-step automated workflows are the next moats.",

Traffic doesn’t.\n\n**Outreach #1 tip:**\n\nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.\n\nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.\n\nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.\n\nJust start a convo like a human.\n\n**Ads #1 tip:**\n\nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.\n\nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.\n\nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.\n\n**Social #1 tip:**\n\nHooks are everything.\n\nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.\n\nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.\n\n**Partnerships #1 tip:**\n\nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.\n\nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.\n\n**Content #1 tip:**\n\nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.\n\nNot like a landing page.\n\nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.\n\nThat’s basically it.\n\nMost founders don’t need more tactics.\n\nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria from [Rebelgrowth.com](http://rebelgrowth.com/) ",

You push content in, measure whats coming out, adjust inputs. Its not instant gratification like code but its not pure vibes either. Analytics, attribution, even just asking people how they found you.\n\nBiggest mistake I see devs make is they launch once, see nothing happen, and give up. Marketing compounds over time in ways code doesnt. That blog post from 6 months ago might suddenly start ranking and driving leads.\n\nBut yeah building is definitely the comfort zone lol.

We found our footing and now we're making good money.\n\nYay.\n\nBut just as my blood pressure has began reaching a normal human level - we found product market fit in a completely untapped area in a multi trillion dollar industry. \n\nTo make matters worst, we have already started selling our MVP and customers love it. \n\nThere's one small problem though - I'm burnt out (and I feel guilty about it).\n\nThe irony is that this opportunity is the greatest fiscal opportunity in my life! \n\nI would have given ANYTHING 4 years ago to have an opportunity like this fall on my desk but no matter how hard I try - I can't feel any excitement about it. \n\nNot one little bit.\n\nThe only joy that I get professionally recently is running a small group for founders (I'm not promoting!

In fact, people planning a divorce record a perceived increased happiness equal to those planning their wedding up until the event and afterwards. \n\nIn the case of constantly working under pressure, not only do the blood pressure rise, the amygdala in the brain is constantly looking for the tiger that it believes is the root of the perceived fear in order to run - preferably away from it.

You can build a coaching / advisory path around this and keep an economic stake in the SaaS without being the hero.\n\nOn the sales side, tools like HubSpot plus Apollo and even Pulse for Reddit to quietly surface enterprise conversations can let others handle growth while you protect your sanity.\n\nMain point: design a setup where the business scales but your nervous system doesn’t get dragged back into the blender.",

      "text": "This is painful to write but I think it might help someone else avoid the same mistake.\n\nLast year we decided to go upmarket. Our self-serve product was doing fine—about $800K ARR—but we kept hearing that the real money was in enterprise. Longer contracts, higher ACVs, lower churn. The promised land.\n\nSo we spent 8 months and roughly $180K (mostly engineering time, some contractors) building enterprise features. SSO, SAML, advanced permissions, audit logs, custom integrations, the whole thing.\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n**1. We built before we sold.** We assumed if we had enterprise features, enterprise customers would come. We never actually validated that enterprises wanted what we built. We were building a checklist, not solving problems.\n\n**2. We didn't understand the enterprise sales cycle.** Turns out you can't just add features and have enterprises show up. They have procurement processes, security reviews, legal negotiations. The sales cycle went from 2 weeks to 4-6 months overnight. We weren't staffed for that.\n\n**3. Our pricing was wrong.** We priced our enterprise tier at $500/month thinking that was \"expensive.\" Enterprise buyers saw that price and assumed we weren't serious. Legitimate enterprise tools cost $2-5K/month minimum. Our low price actually hurt credibility.\n\n**4. The customers we did get were nightmares.** The few enterprise deals we closed came with custom requirements, constant hand-holding, and executive escalations. The support cost per customer was 10x our regular customers. Even at higher prices, the unit economics were worse.\n\n**5. We neglected our core product.** While we were chasing enterprise, our self-serve product stagnated. Competitors shipped features, we didn't. Our core customer base got frustrated.\n\n**Where we are now:** We've basically abandoned the enterprise push. Wrote off most of that $180K in development. Refocused on our core market. We're growing again but we lost a year.\n\nThe lesson I'm taking from this: if you're going to go upmarket, treat it like starting a new company. Different product, different sales motion, different support model, different everything. Don't try to bolt enterprise onto a self-serve business and expect it to work.\n\n",

          "text": "$500 is not an enterprise deal. Enterprise realistically starts around $100,000 per year, and even that number has very little to do with the product itself. What you are really paying for is hand holding.\n\nOnce you cross that line, you are dealing with procurement, security reviews, legal, financing, and a long list of custom edge cases. The first time you go through it, it is painful. After that, you learn how to do it, and it becomes easier each time.\n\nEnterprise is also about compliance. A lot of compliance. Going enterprise dramatically increases compliance costs, and that is not a value add to the product. In practice, compliance becomes a drag on product velocity, not a multiplier.",

Spent months building features nobody asked for.  \n  \nThe thing that would've saved us is what you mentioned but I want to emphasise it even more: sell before you build. I mean literally get 3-5 enterprise customers to commit (even just verbal LOIs) to buying if you build X, Y, and Z. Then build exactly those things for those customers.  \n  \nWe eventually figured this out on our second attempt. Found 4 target companies, got on calls with their teams, asked what they'd actually need to switch from their current solution. Two of them agreed to pilot it if we built specific integrations. That gave us a real roadmap instead of guessing.  \n  \nThe other thing is enterprise sales needs a completely different person than self-serve. The founder who's great at optimising conversion funnels usually isn't the same person who can navigate a 6-month procurement cycle with legal reviews. We had to bring in someone who'd done it before.  \n  \nHonestly though, going back to your core market sounds like the right call. $800K ARR in self-serve is solid and there's probably way more room to grow there.  \n  \nDid you have any enterprise customers actually asking for these features before you built them, or was it mostly assumptions?",

The fact that your self-serve product was healthy at $800K ARR shows you had product-market fit there—this is a valuable lesson for anyone considering a pivot. Great post-mortem. 🔥",

More important you're hoping they would actually become the customer that pays and you're hoping that if there are any investors they see the vision earlier than after the fact. \n\nI have major respect for small teams and solo devs that are bootstrapping and when you build anything meaningful that isn't few prompt vibe coded system you realize the headaches the time the sleepless nights why one stupid function doesn't want to work. Let's not even get into the operational things these teams go through like registration, domains, dns configs,  gateways etc. They essentially put multiple hats on, developer, architect, code reviewer, analyst, marketing, admin in operations and whatever else that comes. \n\nThe grind is something not many can get through...at least without a sane mind when you're on the other side lol.

Everyone talks about $10k in 6 months because, yeah that happens all the time right?\n\nI launched a website change detection tool 10 years ago. It took a decade to hit $6.5k MRR. Not a typo. Ten years.\n\nHere's what I got wrong and what actually worked:\n\n**Boring verticals > sexy markets.** I kept trying to market to \"everyone who needs to monitor websites.\" Too broad. Zero traction. Then enterprise compliance teams found me. Law firms. Banks. Regulatory tracking. They signed up and never left. 95%+ retention. Compliance monitoring isn't sexy, but compliance teams have budget and urgency.\n\n**Sticky beats viral.** Wasted years trying to get featured, go viral, hack growth. Meanwhile, my enterprise users just... stayed. Month after month. One sticky customer is worth 100 churned free trials.\n\n**The two real problems nobody warns you about.** Website monitoring sounds simple. Check page, detect change, send alert. In reality, noise kills you (sites change constantly, users drown in garbage alerts) and blocking kills you (Cloudflare, bot detection, CAPTCHA everywhere). Solving those two is 90% of the work. The \"detecting changes\" part is easy.\n\n**The long game is underrated.** Most competitors from 2015 are dead. I'm still here. Sometimes, just not quitting is the whole strategy.\n\nI just rebuilt Changeflow from scratch with modern tech and AI. Back to $119 MRR. Starting the climb again, but this time I know who I'm building for.\n\nWhat's the most counterintuitive thing you've learned building yours?",

          "text": "Hi!\n\nLate to the party, but this is exactly the struggle we went through... cost tracking that's either a full-time job or gets ignored entirely. A few things that actually helped us move toward \"cost awareness as a default\" rather than a side project:\n\nAutomated anomaly detection is non-negotiable. Manual checking will always fall behind. You need something that alerts you when costs deviate from baseline, not just when they hit an arbitrary threshold.\n\nPush reports to stakeholders, don't pull them. If DevOps is the bottleneck for cost visibility, you'll never escape it. Automated weekly/monthly reports to team leads means they own their spend without you playing middleman.\n\nTie costs to business context. Raw AWS costs are nearly useless for decision-making. What actually matters is cost-per-customer, cost-per-feature, or cost-per-transaction - that's what helps you spot inefficiencies and justify infrastructure decisions to leadership.\n\nFor tooling, if you want something purpose-built for this, check out Beakpoint Insights. It does the automated anomaly detection and alerting you mentioned, plus it maps your cloud spend to customers and features so you're not just seeing \"EC2 went up 30%\" but why it went up and whether it's actually a problem. Integration is fast (most teams are live in a few hours via OpenTelemetry + AWS), which matters when you're a small team that can't afford a multi-week implementation project.\n\nThe goal you described, cost awareness built into operations, not a separate initiative, is exactly the right framing. Good luck!\n\nCheck out BeakpointInsights.com. I think it’ll will help you. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nWinston",

This could potentially put the users accounts at risks of ban or suspension.  \nI wont go deeper into this, but the marketing copy on the landing page and the content in the TOS page are contradictory. Please look into this.\n\nThe testimonials section will get you in trouble. Right now these read as placeholder content (random user pics + FAANG companies mentioned (p.s do not mention company names, im not a lawyer but its probably not a good idea to use their names here.) Its better to start with early access user testimonials or remove this section entirely until you have real and authentic reviews.

The problem is real and the no SEO knowledge needed angle will definately attract founders. The strategy to connect GSC and GA4 data is smart, it can tell what pages are getting higher clicks, what content is underperforming, what users are searching for, etc.\n\nNow you are claiming 'Human Quality' content that is posted daily and runs on auto pilot... Either this is actully good (which needs human oversight) or its again generic ai content. so theres risk here that instead of helping people post quality content the ai generates typicall mass produced content which might just end up doing more harm. The 'no human required' is not really a feature. You are selling to founders who care about their brand, without human oversight, the content might be no different than the slop generated by ai models.  \n  \n Last year google had released their \\[helpful content update\\](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content) in which they clearly prioritize helpful and reliable content rather than content that adds no value. There is no mention about this on the page. If your product can infact rank after these algorithm updates, then a proof should be displayed on the website to boost credibility.\n\nThe testimonial with claims of ranking #1 across search keywords in just 22 days is not credible enough. Its way too short time to actully prove SEO success. Showing a long term before/after case study would be more beneficial to gain users trust.\n\nAnd one more thing, the comparison chart might be sort of misleading. Other SEO tools make you analyze data vs your tool plans the strategy automatically, this makes it sound like your AI is smarter than the founder at their own bussiness, which it probably is not. Strategic thinking cannot be replaced here.",

Email marketers can damage their sender reputation by sending ( a lot of ) emails without warming up, to the bought email lists. The platform is addressing a real gap of email deliverability risk. The cost estimation slider is a good touch along with the clear pricing.\n\nHere's the main issue: Trust.  \nYou are asking people to upload their emails (which are one of their most valuable bussiness assets) to an unknown provider. Without Testimonials, Social proof, brand reputation and compliance certifications, winning the trust of the potential customers, especially established companies is incredibly difficult. Getting SOC 2 certification as well as bring GDPR/ CCPA compliant will help users trust your platform.\n\nThe how it works section is too vague. It doesnt mention anything about what process you do. What patterns are you checking, are you checking engagement history patterns, DNS records? There needs to be something concrete here.\n\nAn example showing a real risk assessment on sample dataset would've been nice. Along with this a section on how dangerous it is to damage sender reputation (why sendgate) will definately help you sell better.\n\nAnd finally, you need to rework your terms and privacy policy.",

          "text": "Writing the code is fast. But setting up the CI/CD pipeline, wrestling with Kubernetes manifests, and dealing with security compliance? That’s still a manual, frustrating grind. Even with a dedicated DevOps team, the backlog is real, and the overhead is exhausting.\n\nThat’s why we built [CodeOpsAI](https://codeopsai.com). Think of it as a private DevOps assistant that lives right beside you.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Connect your repo: The agent scans your code to understand the context (language, framework, dependencies).\n2. Auto-Pilot CI: It automatically writes a pipeline to run your specific tests, build artifacts, and publish Docker images.\n3. Security First: It runs a security scan on the built image before you even ask.\n4. Deployment Ready: It generates the K8s manifests and sets up a full GitOps workflow out of the box.\n\nBasically, it handles everything that happens after git commit, so you can focus on building, not configuring.\n\nLink - https://codeopsai.com NOTE - We only support python repos as of now.",

So I built one.\n\n\n\n**Tech:**\n\nReact Native and Expo, TypeScript, Supabase, RevenueCat\n\n\n\n**The grind:**\n\n* 112 builds over 6 months\n* 2 Apple rejections, they test on iPad even if you disable tablet support\n* Hardest problem was syncing haptics to breath phases so you can use it eyes closed during a meeting\n\n\n\n**Monetization:**\n\n* Freemium, core breathing techniques are free, advanced features behind a paywall\n* RevenueCat handling in app purchases\n\n\n\n**What worked for launch:**\n\n* Hit #4 on Product Hunt & #1 on Uneed\n* Marketing on X, Linkedin\n* “I built this because I needed it” beats feature lists every time\n\n\n\n**What I am struggling with:**\n\n* 400 downloads, only 2 subscriptions even with lot of daily use.\n* Getting users to open Squair instead of doomscrolling when anxiety hits\n* Figuring out whether push notifications help or annoy\n\n\n\nHonest question for this sub: how do you solve retention for an app people only need in specific moments? It is not a daily habit app. It is an emergency tool. That makes the retention game completely different.\n\n\n\n[https://squair.app](https://squair.app) (iOS and Android)\n\nThe site also has an online box breathing tool if you've never tried it before.",

Ask \"what were you doing right before you opened Squair?\" and \"what would've happened if you didn't have it?\"\n\nYou'll probably find 2-3 people who'd pay way more than $5 - not for breathing exercises, but for the peace of mind.",

Users don’t need to open Squair often; they need to **remember it exists when panic hits**.\n* Push notifications are risky, but *contextual* ones could work (e.g. opt-in reminders during known stress windows like work hours).\n* The value might not be “open every day,” but “worked the 3 times I truly needed it.” That’s harder to measure but way more honest.\n* Monetization might align better with reassurance than usage: lifetime access, employer reimbursement, or “support the app” pricing rather than habit-based subscriptions.\n\nAlso: 400 downloads + daily use with only 2 subs doesn’t mean failure; it might mean you built something people rely on quietly, not something they binge.",

One approach I think can work well is to create a community around the app. Think about integrating a space where users can share their experiences with anxiety, breathing techniques, or even tips on managing stress. This gives users a reason to return even when they’re not in crisis mode. You could also consider adding a section with articles or tips on anxiety management that can help users feel supported and engaged.  \n  \nAnother tactic could be to implement some gentle reminders. Instead of push notifications that might annoy users, perhaps try sending occasional checkins with positive affirmations or quick breathing tips. This way, it feels less intrusive and more like a supportive nudge.  \n  \nLastly, consider reaching out to the users who are using Squair regularly but haven’t subscribed. Ask them what would make the app more valuable for them, this could lead to features you hadn’t considered but that could really enhance retention and conversion.",

But what stands out here is the shift in your positioning:\n\n\n\n0 sales with 20+ demos = you were selling to the wrong people or not addressing their real problem.\n\n1 sale with 1 demo = you finally understood what actually matters to your buyer.\n\n\n\nI've been building a medical appointment platform for clinics, and this mirrors my journey almost exactly:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The demo problem:\\*\\* At first, I'd show all the features I was excited about. Clinics didn't care. They cared about: \"Will this reduce my admin time?\" and \"How many patients can I manage without hiring?\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The simplification insight:\\*\\* Once I stripped away features and focused on THEIR pain point, demos became way shorter and conversion jumped. The 20+ demo failures meant you were optimizing for things your customer didn't value.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The enterprise angle:\\*\\* You went from SMB/generic to \"publicly listed company.\" That tells me your simplified, focused product likely solved ONE problem really well. That's what enterprises buy.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for you:\\*\\* \n\n\\- Did your messaging/positioning change, or just the product?\n\n\\- When you demoed to the CEO, what was the ONE thing that made them say yes?\n\n\\- Are they a reference customer or mostly validation that the market wants this?\n\n\n\nAlso, $7K is solid for a first enterprise close, but are you thinking about how to scale this? The gap between 1 enterprise customer and a repeatable enterprise sales motion is where most solo founders get stuck.\n\n\n\nEither way, congrats on breaking the seal. That first enterprise win is psychological momentum even if the economics aren't there yet.",

      "text": "I want to share how I went from **zero to $100 MRR in just 7 days** after launching my SaaS, without ads, followers, or luck. This is exactly what happened.\n\n**Day 0:** Launch. I put my app, [Postpire](http://postpire.com), live on X (formerly Twitter). A couple thousand views rolled in — exciting, but no paying users yet.\n\n**Days 1–4:** I realized that visibility alone wasn’t enough. So I joined **build-in-public communities**. Everywhere people talked about SEO, content, or SaaS growth — I was in the comments, genuinely helping, answering questions, sharing insights. Slowly, people started noticing.\n\n**Day 5:** My **first paying customer** signed up. It was small, but seeing someone pay for something I built without prior clout? Huge confidence boost.\n\n**Days 6–7:** I kept doing **“Day X updates”** — daily posts documenting:\n\n* Marketing experiments I tried\n* Features I added or improved\n* Struggles and lessons learned\n\nOn **Day 7**, I got my **second paying user**, bringing me to $100 MRR.\n\n**Lessons i learned:**\n\n* **Join the conversation, don’t just broadcast.** Hanging out in the right communities and actually helping people got me noticed way faster than posting announcements.\n* **Show the messy middle.** Sharing my daily wins, fails, and random experiments made people care about the journey, not just the polished end result.\n* **Keep showing up.** Even small updates add up — every day I posted, more people started following along.\n* **Celebrate tiny wins.** My first paying user felt like a victory, and it kept me motivated to push through the early grind.\n\nThis proves you **don’t need clout to get traction**. You need persistence, transparency, and small, consistent actions.\n\nCurious: for other SaaS founders here, what strategies got your first paying users without ads?\n\n[Proof ](https://www.notion.so/Proof-Postpire-2f93b6a24255802e960fd6c31194a769?source=copy_link)",

Now I can go from idea to MVP in days instead of weeks. For my iOS apps, I use Swift Kit (theswiftk.it.com) which gives me all the boring stuff pre-built.\n\nThe time I save on setup goes straight into what you described - being active in communities, helping people, shipping fast. Day 1 can actually be Day 1, not \"Day 1 after 2 weeks of setup.\"\n\nCurious: what tech stack did you use for Postpire? And did you build everything from scratch or use any frameworks/templates?",

But outbound also pays off when you do 100s of reachouts per week, you shouldn't expect 20X growth with 10-100 reachouts.\n\nMy recommendation:\n\n1. Give Claude your initial ICP definition and ask it to divide it into keywords, for example \"B2B software startups and scaleups with 1-10 employee count, revenue $500K-$5M and located in USA - targeting founders, co-founders, CEOs and VPs of sales, growth and GTM\" -> then divide location / revenue / employee count and some other keywords into multiple sub keywords -> example: USA -> NYC, SF, Chicago, ...\n2. \\[I use this tool and am happy, but any other similar platform can do the work\\] Go to Starnus (it's your Claude for Sales), choose one of their template lead gen prompt templates and dump your ICP keywords there (for sub keywords, choose 1 at a time). Then get a clean leads list with enriched data and contact info.\n3. Either manually connect with those leads on LinkedIn with a small note attached, or again use Starnus to send those requests.\n4. Track conversions, iterate and improve.\n\nSome tips:\n\n\\- You need 200-500 reachouts per week (at least), use 1-3 LinkedIn accounts (with LI Premium you get up to 250-300 connection requests per week per account).\n\n\\- Be hyper personalized, and it's not just saying Hi {{ first\\_name }}, you need to research the leads, Starnus will do it for you, or you can use Sales Nav to do manual search or other auto-signals and auo-enrichment tools.\n\nBottom line, start setting up your pipelines, and experiment, iterate and improve, until you find something that seems like it can scale.",

Every small update shows progress. The dopamine hit of following someone's progress is a real driver.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Helping > Selling\\*\\* - Being in build-in-public spaces and actually answering people's questions (not pitching) creates trust. When you eventually mention your product, people are already rooting for you because you've been adding value.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Transparency catches attention\\*\\* - Sharing your failures (\"tried this, it flopped\") makes people take you seriously. The polished founder narrative is boring. The real story is interesting.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The thing nobody talks about:\\*\\* Community-based growth is slower to START, but it's a moat. Once you've built real relationships with 20-50 people who genuinely care about your success, they become distribution. They reply, they share, they refer. That scales.\n\n\n\nCurious about the follow-up: Did your Day X updates continue after Day 7? I find that's where most founders lose momentum and watch traction flatten. The first paying user is the sugar rush—maintaining that daily cadence for weeks 2-4 is what separates success from one-time wins.\n\n\n\nGreat execution. This needs more visibility in founder circles than the Airbnb referral loop myth.",

      "text": "I'm the founder of Linkedify, a LinkedIn automation tool with AI campaign creation and rental accounts so users don't risk their own profiles.\n\n60+ accounts on the platform. Thousands of campaigns. A lot of failures before we figured out what actually works.\n\nHere's everything we've learned.\n\n\n\n**Targeting is where most campaigns fail**\n\nMost people start with \"VP of Sales at SaaS companies with 50 to 200 employees.\" That's fine. But the real unlock is timing.\n\nTrigger based targeting beats static lists every time.\n\n**Job changers in their first 90 days** are gold. They're building their stack, trying to prove themselves, open to new ideas. Filter for \"started new position\" on Sales Navigator.\n\n**Recent posters and commenters** are 2 to 3x more likely to respond than ghost profiles. Someone active on LinkedIn actually checks their inbox. We built social signal scraping specifically for this.\n\n**Companies hiring for related roles** tell you what they care about. If they're hiring SDRs they care about pipeline. If they're hiring marketers they care about leads.\n\n**Funding announcements 30 to 60 days after** hit the sweet spot. Money just landed. They're spending. Too early and they're still planning. Too late and budgets are locked.\n\nHow we structure it: Start with ICP filters like title, company size, industry. Layer on a trigger. Keep lists to 500 to 1000 people max because smaller batches let you iterate faster.\n\n\n\n**The message sequence**\n\nConnection request needs to be under 300 characters. No pitch. No ask. Just relevance.\n\nWhat works:\n\n\"Saw you're building out the sales team at \\[Company\\], always interested to connect with folks scaling outbound.\"\n\nWhat doesn't:\n\n\"Hi \\[Name\\], I help companies like yours generate 50+ meetings per month using our AI powered platform. Would love to connect and share how we could help \\[Company\\] grow.\"\n\nFirst one feels human. Second one is obviously automated even when it's not.\n\n**Day 1 after they accept.** Acknowledge the connection. Give value. No ask yet.\n\n\"Thanks for connecting. Saw \\[Company\\] is pushing into \\[market\\]. Curious how you're approaching outbound there. We work with a lot of teams in \\[adjacent space\\] and happy to share what's working if useful.\"\n\n**Day 3.** Light follow up. Add specificity.\n\n\"Was actually looking at how \\[Competitor\\] structures their outreach. Noticed some patterns that might be relevant for \\[Company\\]. Worth a quick chat?\"\n\n**Day 7.** Direct ask. Make it easy.\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\], don't want to be that guy who keeps following up. If outbound is a priority right now happy to do 15 mins. If not no worries, timing is everything.\"\n\n**Day 14 if you want.** Breakup message. Works surprisingly well.\n\n\"Going to assume the timing isn't right. If things change feel free to reach out, always happy to talk \\[topic\\].\"\n\n\n\n**The numbers that actually matter**\n\nFrom our data:\n\nConnection acceptance rate. Average is 25 to 30 percent. Good is 35 to 45. Great is 50 plus.\n\nReply rate of people who connected. Average is 8 to 12 percent. Good is 15 to 20. Great is 25 plus.\n\nPositive reply rate. Average is 3 to 5 percent. Good is 6 to 10. Great is 12 plus.\n\nIf your acceptance rate is below 20 your targeting is off.\n\nIf your reply rate is below 5 your messaging is the problem.\n\n\n\n**What kills campaigns**\n\nPitching in the connection request. Instant ignore. You haven't earned the right to pitch yet.\n\nGeneric personalization. \"I noticed you work in sales\" is worse than no personalization at all.\n\nToo many follow ups too fast. More than 4 messages or less than 2 days apart feels desperate.\n\nTargeting too broad. \"Anyone in marketing\" means your message resonates with no one.\n\nUsing your real account at scale. One mistake and your network is gone. This is why we built rental accounts into Linkedify.\n\n\n\n**Account health stuff**\n\nSince we track this obsessively:\n\nDays 8 to 14 are the danger zone. New accounts get flagged here. Keep activity low.\n\n20 to 50 connection requests per day max depending on account age and warmth.\n\nIncomplete profiles get restricted faster. Fill everything out even the headline.\n\nAPI based beats browser automation. We moved to API and saw immediate stability improvement.\n\n\n\n**What we use internally**\n\nSales Navigator plus custom social signal scraping for targeting.\n\nLinkedify with API based sending for automation.\n\nClay for company data and custom scripts for hiring signals.\n\nEverything exports to Sheets then HubSpot.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this. What's working for you guys right now? Curious what others are seeing.",
