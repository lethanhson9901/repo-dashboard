      "text": "I'm a PM at [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) now, but before this I was the founding engineer at a startup that sold for $15M in 18 months. Sharing bc I think this is relevant for founders here.\n\nThe founders had been running this playbook for years. One had 8 successful exits, the other had 3. When they hired me, they told me exactly how it would go. I was skeptical, but it worked exactly as they said.\n\nHere's the playbook:\n\n**Step 1: Pick a legacy industry (this is the most important step)**\n\nFind an industry as far from Silicon Valley as possible. The key criteria: customers and competitors should not be able to build anything themselves. Ideally, you or your co founder has domain expertise. If you don't, find a co founder who does\n\nWe sold to benefits brokers, the people who handle 401(k)s and HSAs. Other good verticals: oil and gas, medical SaaS, logistics, construction tech.\n\nWhat to avoid: anything where your customers are technical. Dev tools would be a terrible choice. If your buyer can look at your product and think \"I could build this,\" you're in the wrong market.\n\n**Step 2: Build a product and raise money, but not for the reasons you think**\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: the product doesn't have to be great. You shouldn't waste too much time making it perfect. The product is the least important part of this playbook.\n\nWhat matters is legitimacy & credibility. Raising money signals to people in these industries that you're a real company, not two people in a garage. Most people in legacy industries don't know Sequoia from some random angel syndicate, so don't waste time chasing name-brand VCs. Just raise around $1M and move on.\n\nHiring a few people also helps. It makes you look like a \"real\" company. The whole point here is building trust and brand recognition within the industry.\n\n**Step 3: Sign design partnerships with potential acquirers**\n\nI know most people on the internet advise against design partnerships, but for this playbook they're essential, with one critical caveat: your design partners need to be companies that could eventually acquire you.\n\nWe partnered with 4 big names in the employee benefits space. If you can, get them to invest in your company. Give their CEOs board seats. You're not optimizing for product feedback here. You're optimizing for relationships and positioning.\n\n**Step 4: Build deep rapport over 12+ months**\n\nThis is the step that takes the longest, but it's what makes everything else work.\n\nOur CEO was talking to all 4 design partner CEOs on a weekly basis. You need to understand what initiatives they have going on, what they care about, what keeps them up at night. You need to become a trusted advisor, someone they see as a technology expert who actually understands their space.\n\nIf these companies have subsidiaries, start meeting with them too. Cast a wide net within the org.\n\nWhile this is happening, you can talk to other customers and generate some revenue, but honestly, revenue is the least important metric in this playbook.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the opportunity**\n\nIf you've done steps 1 through 4 correctly, this part is actually easy.\n\nIn our case, one of our design partners had a subsidiary that grew rapidly. They suddenly needed an AI solution to handle some stuff around the benefits they were selling. What they needed was adjacent to our product, but not exactly what we built.\n\nThis is the sweet spot. They had a problem. We had the team, the trust, and enough product to be credible.\n\nInstead of offering to build them a feature, we offered to sell them the whole company. If you can create this dynamic with multiple design partners at once, even better. Deal heat is real.\n\n**Step 6: Close**\n\nCall it an acqui-hire, call it a quick sale, whatever. Close the deal.\n\nYou'll probably need to stay on afterward to build the solution you discussed, but that's fine. You just sold your company for 8 figures.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Go into a narrow legacy industry where buyers can't build\n2. Build credibility as a tech expert and domain expert\n3. Sign design partners who could be acquirers\n4. Build deep rapport over 12+ months\n5. Identify an adjacent opportunity\n6. Sell the company, not a feature\n\nI know this seems counterintuitive. This playbook basically does everything most people online advise against. Don't obsess over product. Don't focus on revenue. Do design partnerships. Optimize for relationships over growth.\n\nIf you're trying to build a billion dollar company, this is NOT the playbook for you. Many people here are swinging for that, and that's great. But if you want a low 8-figure exit in under 2 years, this works. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

Ideally leave it. \n\n I feel kind of stuck and mentally drained. I know how hard it is to acquire clients in these industries, which makes me nervous.

The current state of \"MVP development\" is an absolute clown show.\n\nI scroll through Twitter and see these \"founders\" bragging about building a SaaS in a weekend using nothing but vibes and Cursor. Then I see the poor non-technical founders hiring these guys, thinking they’re getting a steal.\n\nHere is the hard truth: You aren't getting a deal. You are getting scammed.\n\nI’ve spent the last six months cleaning up the mess left behind by these \"24-hour ship\" agencies. Honestly, it’s becoming the bulk of my consulting work lately. It is horrifying. These aren't developers. They are professional copy-pasters. They don’t know how code works; they only know how to hit \"Tab\" on an AI suggestion.\n\nThey are selling you a car with a glossy paint job that has a lawnmower engine and no brakes.\n\nHere is why your \"vibe coded\" app is absolute trash (and why I usually end up billing for a total rewrite):\n\n*   **They literally can’t read code.** If the AI hallucinates a security flaw, they ship the security flaw. I audited a project last week where user passwords were being stored in plain text because the \"dev\" didn't know what hashing was. That’s not a bug; that’s a lawsuit waiting to happen. I had to patch that emergency live while the client basically hyperventilated.\n*   **The shitty architecture.** They pile library on top of library because they don't know how to write a simple function. Your simple to-do list app ends up being 500MB because they imported the entire internet to make a button change color. When I come in to fix these, I’m usually deleting 60% of the codebase just to make the thing load under 5 seconds.\n*   **It’s unmaintainable garbage.** The second you ask for a feature that the AI can't easily one-shot, the project dies. They can't debug it because they never understood it in the first place. They ghost you, and that's usually when I get the desperate email to come save the sinking ship. You're left with a zip file of spaghetti code that no serious engineer will touch without a hazmat suit.\n\nStop falling for the \"we move fast\" hype. Moving fast into a brick wall isn't progress.\n\nIf you are hiring a dev and they can't explain how the database talks to the frontend without looking at a prompt window, fire them immediately. You are burning your seed money on digital landfill.\n\nI have a couple of slots opening up next month for MVP builds. I’m not the cheapest option, but I’m the one you hire when you want it done right the first time. No junior devs, no outsourcing, just solid code that scales. If you're serious about your project, DM me and let’s see if we’re a fit.\n",

              "text": "A database does **not talk directly to the frontend** in most real-world systems. Instead, there’s a **backend in between**. Here’s the clear, practical breakdown from simplest to production-grade.\n\n---\n\n## The Standard Flow (Most Common)\n\n```\nFrontend  →  Backend (API)  →  Database\n```\n\n### 1. Frontend (Browser / Mobile App)\n\n* Written in **HTML/CSS/JS**, React, Vue, Swift, etc.\n* Makes **HTTP requests** (usually via `fetch` or Axios)\n* Example request:\n\n```http\nGET /api/users\n```\n\n⚠️ Frontends **cannot safely access databases directly**\n(You’d expose credentials, allow data corruption, and break security.)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Backend (Server / API)\n\nThis is the **translator and gatekeeper**.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Authenticates users\n* Validates requests\n* Runs business logic\n* Talks to the database\n* Sends back formatted responses (JSON)\n\n**Common backend stacks:**\n\n* Node.js (Express, NestJS)\n* Python (Django, FastAPI)\n* Java (Spring)\n* Go, Ruby, PHP, etc.\n\nExample backend code:\n\n```js\napp.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {\n  const users = await db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\n  res.json(users);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Database\n\n* Stores and retrieves data\n* Only talks to the backend\n* Uses **SQL** or database-specific query languages\n\n**Common databases:**\n\n* PostgreSQL, MySQL (SQL)\n* MongoDB (NoSQL)\n* Redis (cache)\n\nExample:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```\n\n---\n\n## How Data Moves (Step-by-Step)\n\n1. User clicks a button on frontend\n2. Frontend sends an HTTP request\n3. Backend receives request\n4. Backend queries database\n5. Database returns data\n6. Backend formats response (JSON)\n7. Frontend displays it\n\n---\n\n## Why This Separation Exists\n\n### 🔐 Security\n\n* Database credentials stay secret\n* Prevents SQL injection and data leaks\n\n### 🧠 Business Logic\n\n* Rules live in one place (backend)\n* Frontend stays simple\n\n### 📈 Scalability\n\n* Multiple frontends can use the same backend\n* Database load is controlled\n\n---\n\n## Exceptions (Rare / Controlled)\n\n### 🔹 Serverless / BaaS\n\nSome platforms blur the lines but **still use an API layer**:\n\n* Firebase\n* Supabase\n* Hasura\n\nEven then:\n\n```\nFrontend → Secure API → Database\n```\n\n### 🔹 Local Apps\n\n* SQLite in desktop/mobile apps\n* Still not exposed to the internet\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n> ❌ Database does **not** talk to frontend\n> ✅ Frontend talks to backend\n> ✅ Backend talks to database\n\nIf you want, I can:\n\n* Draw a diagram\n* Show a real React + API example\n* Explain how auth fits in\n* Explain GraphQL vs REST\n\nJust tell me 👍\n/s",

O pessoal mais junior acaba gastando energia demais aprendendo a ferramenta da vez em vez de entender como software funciona de verdade: arquitetura, fluxo de dados, segurança básica, por que as coisas são do jeito que são.\n\nSoma isso com a cultura de bootcamp de 12 semanas que forma gente pra fazer CRUD bonito mas não pra pensar em manutenibilidade, e você tem a receita perfeita pra esse cenário. O dev sabe usar 15 bibliotecas mas não sabe explicar o que é uma race condition.\n\nDito isso, acho que o problema não é a ferramenta. É a falta de honestidade sobre o que ela entrega. Vibe coding tem seu lugar: validar ideia rápido, testar mercado antes de investir pesado. O problema é vender isso como \"produto pronto pra escalar\" quando claramente não é.\n\nA pergunta que fundador não-técnico deveria fazer não é \"você usa IA pra codar?\" e sim \"me explica como você estruturou isso e por que\".

      "text": "I got restricted on LinkedIn twice in 4 months while doing legit B2B outbound, and it was the overall pattern of my account looking “low-trust.”\n\nHere’re my mistakes. This is not “how to evade,” it’s what reduced restrictions once I cleaned up behavior and stopped chasing volume.\n\n1/ I had 380 pending connection requests just sitting there. Apparently LinkedIn gets suspicious when you have too many pending invites because it means low acceptance rate, so you look like spam. They recommend keeping it under 500 but from what I read now even that's pushing it, more like 200-300 is safer. Now I just withdraw old invites, LinkedIn doesn't notify these people, so I can re-invite them in 3 weeks.\n\n2/ there's a weekly invitation limit now, 100-200 invites per week depending on your account. I was aiming for 230 a week to get the following. I thought I was fine because I stayed under daily limits. But the weekly number matters just as much.\n\n3/ I set my tool to send only 35 requests every day at the same time. But real people can send 20 today at 10:00 AM, 40 tomorrow at 16:30 and 0 on Friday. So now I use randomization for everything. I vary daily limits between 20-30 and different timing.\n\n4/ I was only sending connection requests and sending messages, but I also needed to like posts, write comments etc. Real people browse, read content and reply in comments.\n\nWhat other triggers have you seen that cause restrictions (especially the non-obvious ones)?\n\n",

Giving feedback and being useful builds way more trust than jumping straight to “book a call.” And you’re dead right about follow-ups  most replies don’t come from the first touch at all.\n\nAlso appreciate you calling out that the first month sucks.

We're really growing.\"\n\nI looked at his traffic stats. He has 400 daily active users.\n\nThat’s not scaling. That’s bleeding.\n\nI see this constantly. You hire a \"modern\" full-stack dev who wants to pad their resume, so instead of building you a business, they build a Rube Goldberg machine. They don't want to use a boring $20 server; they want to use Kubernetes, 40 microservices, and a serverless architecture that spins up a Lambda every time a user sneezes.\n\nHere is the truth about \"modern\" cloud stacks:\n\n* Resume Driven Development is killing your runway**:** Your lead dev isn't picking that complex stack because it's good for *your* product. They picked it because they want to get a job at Netflix next year, and they’re using your seed money to learn the tools.\n* Microservices are a trap for 99% of startups**:** Unless you are Uber, you don't need microservices. You need a monolith. Splitting a simple app into 12 different services just introduces network latency and makes debugging a nightmare. I’ve never seen a seed-stage startup die because their monolith was too big. I’ve seen plenty die because they couldn't maintain their distributed mess.\n* The \"Serverless\" premium**:** It sounds cheap until you actually get users. I just migrated a client off a fully serverless setup back to a boring, standard VPS.\n\nThe result?\n\nThe site is 3x faster because we aren't dealing with cold starts. The monthly bill went from $1,800 to $60.\n\nI literally paid for my own consulting fee for the next two years just by turning off the fancy toys and turning on a boring Linux server.\n\nFounders, stop being impressed by complex architecture diagrams. If your dev can’t run the app on a single machine, they don’t know what they’re doing.\n\nBoring stacks make money. Shiny stacks make debt.\n\nAm I the only one who misses when we just shipped code to a server and went to sleep?",

And now you can do as many microservices as you want at no pay and that should handle 400 active users a day swimmingly.\n\nThe real trap of overengineering a solution at the start is complexity and development speed. A startup needs to be flexible, pivot fast, focus on providing value to the customer first and foremost. Once you figured out the direction and stabilise the business and/or growth really takes off,  you will need to redevelop big parts of your software anyways, so don't start out too fancy. Keep it simple, focus on the product, reliability and security (because trust is hard to repair once lost). The technology stack really doesn't matter in the beginning. \n\nProfessionally I work on a large microservice platform. But personally all my own projects I start out as simple monoliths, frontend, backend, database, that's it.

You're still on one server: no need to orchestrate anything, if the hardware goes down your site is down. And you still have to manage your VM OS and k8s distribution on top. You'd be better just spinning up a linux server and maybe run Docker on it if you want to use public containers.\n\n\"I need High Availability\". Ok. If you want a good HA k8s cluster you're looking for at least 7 servers, add 3 for storage, manage secrets, have a good recovery plan (which could mean doubling your cluster for a blue/green solution) etc. Or you can accept to lose availability for an hour or two when stars align until you have enough revenue to pay for this kind of overhead.",

They are afraid to turn off services because they lack the technical acumen to work with infrastructure, so services lay idle and accrue costs or worse, they kill services haphazardly and suddenly things implode.\n\nI had a talk with an intern the other day, I’m a SWE. He had a project that he was working on and he said he wanted to use Amazon CloudWatch and asked my opinion about it. I asked him what he would use it for, what his budget was, and what he thought their actual monthly bill would be. \n\nI wasn’t surprised that he didn’t have an answer but you could ask this question to a senior developer and they’d give the same blank stare. Most devs are going to suck at answering the question because the money isn’t coming out of their pocket. It’s not their problem, so they don’t care.\n\nAs founders, we care about the numbers, or at least you should IMO. Numbers always come to my mind in my day job. How much will this cost? Is this work what we should be doing now or is there other work that will make a greater impact?",

Traffic doesn’t.  \n  \nOutreach #1 tip:  \n  \nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.  \n  \nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.  \n  \nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.  \n  \nJust start a convo like a human.  \n  \nAds #1 tip:  \n  \nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.  \n  \nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.  \n  \nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.  \n  \nSocial #1 tip:  \n  \nHooks are everything.  \n  \nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.  \n  \nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.   \n  \nPartnerships #1 tip:  \n  \nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.  \n  \nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.  \n  \nContent #1 tip:  \n  \nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.  \n  \nNot like a SaaS landing page.  \n  \nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.  \n  \nThat’s basically it.  \n  \nMost founders don’t need more tactics.  \n  \nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E  \n  \nWe're building [Rebelgrowth](https://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit) around this idea (owned distribution through SEO + leveraged citations), $26k MRR so far, still grinding.  \n\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?  \n\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria",

Reddit, niche Slack/Discords, industry forums, whatever. Think “be the helpful regular,” not “drop my link everywhere.”\n\nTwo practical tweaks:\n\n1) Build a tiny “signal system”: F5bot or Mention for brand/keyword alerts, plus something like SparkToro to find where your buyers hang out, plus Pulse in the background surfacing high-intent Reddit threads so you’re not guessing where to jump in.\n\n2) Tie every channel to one clear ask that leads to a quick win (template, calculator, teardown). If that doesn’t convert, fix the offer, not the channel.\n\nSo yeah: early game is all about engineered serendipity, not generic “marketing.",

I genuinely enjoy reviewing products, and I always learn something in the process too.\n\nDrop your links below!\n\n**EDIT:** With all the comments, I will not be able to review everyone unfortunately, I will do my best but here major issues I find in almost all sites:\n\n1. Add trust in your hero, like how many businesses or people use your tool.\n2. Add a video of your product right after hero.\n3. Add good testimonials.\n4. Add a great about page, many visitors will check this page to know who's behind the business.\n5.

              "text": "This is cleaner than most resume tools I've seen. \"The cleanest resume scanner\" is a specific claim and the page backs it up. No sidebar ads, no upsell popups mid-flow, no LinkedIn audit nonsense distracting from the core job.\n\nThe before/after comparison (48 -> 94) does real work. Showing weak bullet points transformed into quantified achievements makes the value immediately obvious. That's proof, not just promises.\n\nYour competitor comparison table is bold. Most tools avoid naming competitors directly. You're saying \"here's how we're different from Jobscan, Enhancv, and MyPerfectResume\" and backing it with specifics. That confidence signals you've actually thought about positioning.\n\nTestimonials are solid too. Real names, photos, verified badges, and specific outcomes (\"Score: 45 -> 92\", \"3 interviews in 1 week\"). That's how social proof should work.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\nThe hero buries the outcome slightly. \"Optimize Your ATS Score\" is the mechanism. \"Land More Interviews\" is the outcome. I'd flip the emphasis. Nobody wakes up wanting a higher ATS score. They want callbacks.\n\n\"The cleanest\" is a strong claim but subjective. You might test something more concrete like \"No ads. No noise. Just your resume, optimized.\" You already have that as subhead copy. It's more defensible.\n\nThe page is long. That's fine for SEO and thoroughness, but the path from landing to \"Upload Your Resume\" could be shorter. Consider whether everything above the fold earns its position.\n\nVisually it's the same dark mode with teal accent that half of SaaS uses right now. Not a problem, just not distinctive. The product is strong enough that the design doesn't need to do heavy lifting, but it's worth noting.\n\nOverall this is well-executed. You understand your user's problem (\"75% of resumes never reach a human recruiter\") and you've built clear proof throughout the page. Most resume tools feel like they're trying to extract money. This one feels like it's trying to solve a problem. That comes through.",

Just small details that could help you look more trustworthy. When i opened your landing page the cta was actually cropped out from view. There was a lot of text I didnt even try to read since it became quite an overload, try to guide the user where to look and what to read because right now there is a bit too much going on at once and it's very hard to get a precise idea of what its about. Also I'd strongly suggest changing or dimming down these glow effects (green/blue/purple neons) also they could look cool they are strongly associating your saas to poorly generated AI software we see everywhere. It's not a simple task but if I were you I would try and look closely and understand the more premium designs of other software to obtain a more mature look. Hopefully this helps!",

It tells me what shelf you're on, not why I should pick you up. \"Get discovered without cold outreach\" is an actual promise. Lead with that.\n\nRight now the page explains the mechanism before establishing why I should care. Flip it. Outcome first, system second.\n\nOne other thing: \"FOR FOUNDERS.

That context builds trust more than the badge.\n\nVisually it's clean but the dark mode with teal accent is everywhere right now. Nothing breaks through as distinctly GrowBase.

On my desktop your main hero section has a big blank section in the middle, it seems very scattered towards the sides of the view. When your users land on your landing page you want the primary focus to be on the center of the screen, it's where users most often expect to find their information. Having your heading and animation be seperated like that feels quite off. Also i would strongly suggest using ease in/ease out for your animations, to help smooth out the animations, they feel quite harsh right now. And as you scroll downwards it feels a bit too much free and might be hard for the user to understand whats going. I think there is a need for things to be sectionned off more precisely so that your user slowly reads the info one by one. Let me know if this helps!",

First, privacy is becoming a huge deal. Asking a company to upload thousands of sensitive IBANs or VAT numbers to a random server just to check a checksum is a massive security risk. I wanted to see if I could solve that by keeping 100% of the logic inside the browser.\n\nSecond, I've seen how messy data can be in most companies. Often, they don't bother cleaning up their databases because specialized APIs are just too expensive for a \"first pass\" validation. My tool lets them do that big initial scrub without the high costs or the risk of a data leak.\n\nRight now, I'm targeting SMEs, accountants, and other devs who deal with bulk financial records. If you have a messy CSV and need to make sure the data is mathematically sound before hitting \"pay\" or importing it into an ERP, this is for you.\n\nAs for the money, I literally launched yesterday, so I’m sitting at exactly $0 MRR right now ! This is my first project as a side-indie dev, so I’m mostly focused on proving the concept and getting feedback. I also open-sourced the core engine as a NuGet package because I genuinely think this kind of basic validation should be accessible to any .NET dev out there.",

I think this glow blue/purple effect starts to be seen in a lot of places and is starting to look like 'AI slop' or quickly generated website. I would suggest avoiding this aesthetic. Furthermore, your type needs a bit more refining, the kerning is too narrow on the header and too wide on the buttons/navbar feels quite off. And the use of uppercase and lowercase feels inconsistent. Also your CTA is a bit unclear, I get that you want to make the user try a feature but make it as simplest as possible in the landing page so that the user is easily guided to try it out. Just a few details that really wont hurt to adjust for creating trust.",

Just really weird how small your screenshot is and even weirder how you have to add a View Full Image button. That just creates friction for the user that did not need to be there in the first place. Showing a screen recording in big could be nice and showing it higher in the landing page would help a lot in my opinion. Hopefully this helps!",

There’s still a lot to improve, but the foundation is solid.\n- The user actually found the product via ChatGPT, not ads or social media.\n- I’ve been heavily focused on SEO, with a fully automated blog publishing ~5 niche-relevant articles per day, translated into multiple languages without manual work.\n\nThis single paying customer already covers my entire \nmonthly stack.\n\nI’m not making money ye, but I’m not losing any either. I’ve reached break-even at the infrastructure level. The only real cost now is time.\n\nI’m not posting this to promote my SaaS (I won’t share the name here), but just to share something encouraging:\n\nWhen you focus on clarity, distribution, and actually solving a problem, even quietly, results eventually come.  Sometimes from places you didn’t expect.\n\nHappy to answer questions if it can help\n\nBack to building 💪🏻",

The products that rank high usually have a strong network pushing votes.

This is increasingly important. Make sure your docs/content are structured for LLM retrieval (clear schema markup, FAQ format, API examples).

For me, a SaaS that can’t easily connect to other tools is a real limitation today.\n\nI also built Make and Zapier modules so non-dev users can plug the product into their workflows without friction.\n\nI strongly believe that making your app accessible this way (API + integrations) helps not only adoption, but also legitimacy in the eyes of both LLMs and Google. \n\nIt’s another signal that the product is actually used, not just talked about.\n\nReally appreciate the insights 🙏",

It means:\n\n✓ Your value proposition is crystal clear\n\n✓ The onboarding flow actually works\n\n✓ The product delivers immediate value\n\n\n\nMost founders overthink this. If users can figure it out themselves, you've already won half the battle.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The ChatGPT Discovery Channel\\*\\*\n\nThis is fascinating and honestly underrated. While everyone's chasing social media algorithms and paid ads, ChatGPT is becoming a real discovery channel. We've seen similar patterns in our user analytics.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip\\*\\*: Make sure you're optimizing for AI discovery:\n\n\\- Clear problem/solution statements on your landing page\n\n\\- Structured data that LLMs can parse\n\n\\- Documentation that answers \"how does X solve Y\" questions\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Break-Even Achievement\\*\\*\n\nReaching infrastructure break-even at 1 customer is RARE. Most SaaS founders struggle with this for months. You clearly:\n\n\\- Kept costs lean\n\n\\- Priced appropriately from day one\n\n\\- Built efficient automation\n\n\n\nThis gives you the runway to focus on growth without burning cash.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Your SEO Strategy\\*\\*\n\n5 articles per day, automated, multilingual - that's ambitious. One caution from experience: quality > quantity when it comes to SEO longevity. Google's getting smarter about AI content. Make sure you're adding genuine value and not just chasing keywords.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What's Next?\\*\\*\n\nSince you're at this milestone, here's what worked for us:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Talk to this customer\\*\\* - Even if they didn't need hand-holding, understanding their use case will unlock product insights\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Double down on what worked\\*\\* - ChatGPT discovery is working? Optimize for it. SEO is driving traffic? Keep refining.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Set up proper analytics\\*\\* - Track activation metrics, feature usage, churn indicators NOW while it's simple\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Build the testimonial relationship\\*\\* - This customer will be gold for future social proof\n\n\n\nThe journey from 0→1 customer is often harder than 1→100. You've proven product-market fit exists.\n\n\n\nWhat's your SaaS in? (No pressure to share if you want to keep it private). Curious what space is seeing this kind of immediate conversion.",

Traffic doesn’t.\n\n**Outreach #1 tip:**\n\nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.\n\nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.\n\nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.\n\nJust start a convo like a human.\n\n**Ads #1 tip:**\n\nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.\n\nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.\n\nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.\n\n**Social #1 tip:**\n\nHooks are everything.\n\nNobody reads your post. They read the first line.\n\nAlso, leverage bigger accounts however you can: replies, collabs, remixing their format. Borrow attention.\n\n**Partnerships #1 tip:**\n\nOne good distribution partner is worth 6 months of posting.\n\nFind someone with the audience and give them an unfair deal.\n\n**Content #1 tip:**\n\nWrite like you’re texting one smart friend.\n\nNot like a landing page.\n\nThe moment you sound “marketing-y” peopl bounce.\n\nThat’s basically it.\n\nMost founders don’t need more tactics.\n\nThey need one channel to actually work and compound.\n\nL E V E R A G E\n\nWhat channel has worked for you and what single advice would you give on it?\n\nCheers and good luck,  \nAria from [Rebelgrowth.com](http://rebelgrowth.com/) ",

We found our footing and now we're making good money.\n\nYay.\n\nBut just as my blood pressure has began reaching a normal human level - we found product market fit in a completely untapped area in a multi trillion dollar industry. \n\nTo make matters worst, we have already started selling our MVP and customers love it. \n\nThere's one small problem though - I'm burnt out (and I feel guilty about it).\n\nThe irony is that this opportunity is the greatest fiscal opportunity in my life! \n\nI would have given ANYTHING 4 years ago to have an opportunity like this fall on my desk but no matter how hard I try - I can't feel any excitement about it. \n\nNot one little bit.\n\nThe only joy that I get professionally recently is running a small group for founders (I'm not promoting!

In fact, people planning a divorce record a perceived increased happiness equal to those planning their wedding up until the event and afterwards. \n\nIn the case of constantly working under pressure, not only do the blood pressure rise, the amygdala in the brain is constantly looking for the tiger that it believes is the root of the perceived fear in order to run - preferably away from it.

You can build a coaching / advisory path around this and keep an economic stake in the SaaS without being the hero.\n\nOn the sales side, tools like HubSpot plus Apollo and even Pulse for Reddit to quietly surface enterprise conversations can let others handle growth while you protect your sanity.\n\nMain point: design a setup where the business scales but your nervous system doesn’t get dragged back into the blender.",

I mean how clueless can people be? Use SEMRush or Google Keyword Planner or some similar tool to figure out if anyone is actively searching for it before you build it. If no one is searching for it, there is no demand and if you don't have a multimillion dollar ad budget to create the market, then don't do it. \n\nA child could figure that out.\n\nNothing is over when there is demand. That's like saying \"restaurants are over\" or \"clothing is over\".\n\nNo market is \"saturated\". This is also a weird notion people have.\n\nSaturated means \"high demand\"... what YOU are supposed to be doing is building something better or simpler or cleaner and more intuitive or emphasizing a great feature that no one else does or whatever... not avoiding huge demand to get into spaces with zero demand and then spending months building something and then spending your days scratching your head wondering why your new money tree isn't bearing fruit.\n\nFrankly, its painful to watch.",

If we cannot find customers at those conditions it’s not worth our time.  What we’ve found is that in this way customers churn is low we lose only 1% tot 3% of customers,  growth is also slower only 25% a year. But it’s steady and predictable. We won’t win any prices for fastest growth or be hip . We are making money though. \n\nAnd I know of lots of other companies that follow similar paths.

That stuff matters later.\n\nWe went with Intercom's Product Tours (cheaper tier) since we already used them for support. Not perfect, but got us 80% there for way less money. UserGuiding is another option that early-stage teams like. Self-serve pricing, no sales calls.\n\nReal talk though: are you trying to improve activation or just guide people through features? If it's activation, a good email sequence + custom in-app prompts often works better than any tour tool. Pendo sells the dream but retention comes from your product, not tooltips.",

      "text": "This is painful to write but I think it might help someone else avoid the same mistake.\n\nLast year we decided to go upmarket. Our self-serve product was doing fine—about $800K ARR—but we kept hearing that the real money was in enterprise. Longer contracts, higher ACVs, lower churn. The promised land.\n\nSo we spent 8 months and roughly $180K (mostly engineering time, some contractors) building enterprise features. SSO, SAML, advanced permissions, audit logs, custom integrations, the whole thing.\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n**1. We built before we sold.** We assumed if we had enterprise features, enterprise customers would come. We never actually validated that enterprises wanted what we built. We were building a checklist, not solving problems.\n\n**2. We didn't understand the enterprise sales cycle.** Turns out you can't just add features and have enterprises show up. They have procurement processes, security reviews, legal negotiations. The sales cycle went from 2 weeks to 4-6 months overnight. We weren't staffed for that.\n\n**3. Our pricing was wrong.** We priced our enterprise tier at $500/month thinking that was \"expensive.\" Enterprise buyers saw that price and assumed we weren't serious. Legitimate enterprise tools cost $2-5K/month minimum. Our low price actually hurt credibility.\n\n**4. The customers we did get were nightmares.** The few enterprise deals we closed came with custom requirements, constant hand-holding, and executive escalations. The support cost per customer was 10x our regular customers. Even at higher prices, the unit economics were worse.\n\n**5. We neglected our core product.** While we were chasing enterprise, our self-serve product stagnated. Competitors shipped features, we didn't. Our core customer base got frustrated.\n\n**Where we are now:** We've basically abandoned the enterprise push. Wrote off most of that $180K in development. Refocused on our core market. We're growing again but we lost a year.\n\nThe lesson I'm taking from this: if you're going to go upmarket, treat it like starting a new company. Different product, different sales motion, different support model, different everything. Don't try to bolt enterprise onto a self-serve business and expect it to work.\n\n",

          "text": "$500 is not an enterprise deal. Enterprise realistically starts around $100,000 per year, and even that number has very little to do with the product itself. What you are really paying for is hand holding.\n\nOnce you cross that line, you are dealing with procurement, security reviews, legal, financing, and a long list of custom edge cases. The first time you go through it, it is painful. After that, you learn how to do it, and it becomes easier each time.\n\nEnterprise is also about compliance. A lot of compliance. Going enterprise dramatically increases compliance costs, and that is not a value add to the product. In practice, compliance becomes a drag on product velocity, not a multiplier.",

Spent months building features nobody asked for.  \n  \nThe thing that would've saved us is what you mentioned but I want to emphasise it even more: sell before you build. I mean literally get 3-5 enterprise customers to commit (even just verbal LOIs) to buying if you build X, Y, and Z. Then build exactly those things for those customers.  \n  \nWe eventually figured this out on our second attempt. Found 4 target companies, got on calls with their teams, asked what they'd actually need to switch from their current solution. Two of them agreed to pilot it if we built specific integrations. That gave us a real roadmap instead of guessing.  \n  \nThe other thing is enterprise sales needs a completely different person than self-serve. The founder who's great at optimising conversion funnels usually isn't the same person who can navigate a 6-month procurement cycle with legal reviews. We had to bring in someone who'd done it before.  \n  \nHonestly though, going back to your core market sounds like the right call. $800K ARR in self-serve is solid and there's probably way more room to grow there.  \n  \nDid you have any enterprise customers actually asking for these features before you built them, or was it mostly assumptions?",

The fact that your self-serve product was healthy at $800K ARR shows you had product-market fit there—this is a valuable lesson for anyone considering a pivot. Great post-mortem. 🔥",

It is not a daily habit app. It is an emergency tool.

Users don’t need to open Squair often; they need to **remember it exists when panic hits**.\n* Push notifications are risky, but *contextual* ones could work (e.g. opt-in reminders during known stress windows like work hours).\n* The value might not be “open every day,” but “worked the 3 times I truly needed it.” That’s harder to measure but way more honest.\n* Monetization might align better with reassurance than usage: lifetime access, employer reimbursement, or “support the app” pricing rather than habit-based subscriptions.\n\nAlso: 400 downloads + daily use with only 2 subs doesn’t mean failure; it might mean you built something people rely on quietly, not something they binge.",

One approach I think can work well is to create a community around the app. Think about integrating a space where users can share their experiences with anxiety, breathing techniques, or even tips on managing stress. This gives users a reason to return even when they’re not in crisis mode. You could also consider adding a section with articles or tips on anxiety management that can help users feel supported and engaged.  \n  \nAnother tactic could be to implement some gentle reminders. Instead of push notifications that might annoy users, perhaps try sending occasional checkins with positive affirmations or quick breathing tips. This way, it feels less intrusive and more like a supportive nudge.  \n  \nLastly, consider reaching out to the users who are using Squair regularly but haven’t subscribed. Ask them what would make the app more valuable for them, this could lead to features you hadn’t considered but that could really enhance retention and conversion.",

                  "text": "If you want to stay organic and avoid ads, simplify and go deep instead of trying everything at once:\n\n\\- Start by focusing on 1–2 platforms only, for example LinkedIn plus YouTube Shorts. Commit to them consistently and go deeper instead of spreading thin across many channels.  \n\\- Share interview-related content rather than promoting the product directly. Th\\`\\`is can include common interview mistakes, sample questions, before-and-after answers, or short feedback clips. The goal is to be genuinely helpful and let people associate you with interview expertise.  \n\\- Engage where people are already asking for interview help. LinkedIn works especially well for this. Be careful with DMing. Add value first by engaging on their posts and contributing to the conversation, don't pitch.\n\nIn each post, point people to a simple lead magnet such as interview tips, a checklist, or sample questions, case studies (this is solid). This will help you build an email list, which is extremely valuable. Why:\n\n\\- Email lets you nurture people over time with interview tips and value. Do not sell in your first email sequence. Build trust first.  \n\\- When they are warm/ready, you can introduce your product naturally.  \n\\- Your email list is an asset you own. If a social platform gets limited or suspended, you still have direct access to your audience.\n\nRemember: people buy from those they know and trust. Nurturing is key here.\n\nOnce this organic B2C motion is in place, you may also want to explore B2B alongside B2C.\n\nIn B2B, you would target career coaches, bootcamps, or recruitment firms. This is often easier to grow without ads because they already have trust and direct access to people who need mock interviews.\n\nInstead of convincing individuals one by one, you sell once to someone who brings many users at once. For ex:\n\n\\- A coach includes your tool in their program  \n\\- A bootcamp bundles it for all students  \n\\- A recruitment firm uses it with candidates\n\nThis usually means fewer sales conversations, higher willingness to pay, and more predictable revenue. It can lead to earlier income compared to pure B2C because you bypass heavy ad spend and tap into existing audiences.\n\nFor B2B, cold outreach works well, whether through cold email or cold calling. You can also use an allbound approach by combining inbound and outbound. Publish valuable content on LinkedIn to build credibility and authority. Then support it with cold outreach (impt: do not sell yet. Your goal is to invite them into a conversation or sales meeting). Many B2B prospects will do a quick background check by looking you up on LinkedIn or Google before responding.\n\nIf you have a landing page, feel free to share it. Happy to give quick feedback.",

The fact that you’re replying to real questions, shipping demos, and testing short-form video is exactly where most good products start.\n\nA few things that usually help at this stage: double down on one audience and one problem (e.g., “fresh grads struggling with confidence in interviews”), then document real usage.  \n  \nSo instead of using polished testimonials, record short clips of users using the product, reacting to feedback, or talking about what surprised them. On Reddit, keep doing what you’re doing, comment where your ICP hangs out, share learnings, and only mention the product when it’s contextually helpful.  \n  \nPaid ads can wait.

For a mock interview platform, I'd go straight to career services directors at universities, bootcamp founders, or recruitment agency owners. Find 20-30 people who'd genuinely benefit, research them properly, and reach out with something personalised. Email or LinkedIn DMs work if you're not being salesy.  \n  \nAlso, content is solid but it needs distribution. Instead of just posting shorts, comment genuinely on career advice threads, then occasionally mention \"we built a tool for this exact problem\" when it's relevant. You're already doing this a bit, but lean into it more.  \n  \nPartnerships could be huge for you too. Career coaches, bootcamps, and university programmes might promote you to their audience if there's value in it for them.  \n  \nWhat's your conversion rate like from the people who do find your product organically?",

More important you're hoping they would actually become the customer that pays and you're hoping that if there are any investors they see the vision earlier than after the fact. \n\nI have major respect for small teams and solo devs that are bootstrapping and when you build anything meaningful that isn't few prompt vibe coded system you realize the headaches the time the sleepless nights why one stupid function doesn't want to work. Let's not even get into the operational things these teams go through like registration, domains, dns configs,  gateways etc. They essentially put multiple hats on, developer, architect, code reviewer, analyst, marketing, admin in operations and whatever else that comes. \n\nThe grind is something not many can get through...at least without a sane mind when you're on the other side lol.

Everyone talks about $10k in 6 months because, yeah that happens all the time right?\n\nI launched a website change detection tool 10 years ago. It took a decade to hit $6.5k MRR. Not a typo. Ten years.\n\nHere's what I got wrong and what actually worked:\n\n**Boring verticals > sexy markets.** I kept trying to market to \"everyone who needs to monitor websites.\" Too broad. Zero traction. Then enterprise compliance teams found me. Law firms. Banks. Regulatory tracking. They signed up and never left. 95%+ retention. Compliance monitoring isn't sexy, but compliance teams have budget and urgency.\n\n**Sticky beats viral.** Wasted years trying to get featured, go viral, hack growth. Meanwhile, my enterprise users just... stayed. Month after month. One sticky customer is worth 100 churned free trials.\n\n**The two real problems nobody warns you about.** Website monitoring sounds simple. Check page, detect change, send alert. In reality, noise kills you (sites change constantly, users drown in garbage alerts) and blocking kills you (Cloudflare, bot detection, CAPTCHA everywhere). Solving those two is 90% of the work. The \"detecting changes\" part is easy.\n\n**The long game is underrated.** Most competitors from 2015 are dead. I'm still here. Sometimes, just not quitting is the whole strategy.\n\nI just rebuilt Changeflow from scratch with modern tech and AI. Back to $119 MRR. Starting the climb again, but this time I know who I'm building for.\n\nWhat's the most counterintuitive thing you've learned building yours?",

          "text": "Hi!\n\nLate to the party, but this is exactly the struggle we went through... cost tracking that's either a full-time job or gets ignored entirely. A few things that actually helped us move toward \"cost awareness as a default\" rather than a side project:\n\nAutomated anomaly detection is non-negotiable. Manual checking will always fall behind. You need something that alerts you when costs deviate from baseline, not just when they hit an arbitrary threshold.\n\nPush reports to stakeholders, don't pull them. If DevOps is the bottleneck for cost visibility, you'll never escape it. Automated weekly/monthly reports to team leads means they own their spend without you playing middleman.\n\nTie costs to business context. Raw AWS costs are nearly useless for decision-making. What actually matters is cost-per-customer, cost-per-feature, or cost-per-transaction - that's what helps you spot inefficiencies and justify infrastructure decisions to leadership.\n\nFor tooling, if you want something purpose-built for this, check out Beakpoint Insights. It does the automated anomaly detection and alerting you mentioned, plus it maps your cloud spend to customers and features so you're not just seeing \"EC2 went up 30%\" but why it went up and whether it's actually a problem. Integration is fast (most teams are live in a few hours via OpenTelemetry + AWS), which matters when you're a small team that can't afford a multi-week implementation project.\n\nThe goal you described, cost awareness built into operations, not a separate initiative, is exactly the right framing. Good luck!\n\nCheck out BeakpointInsights.com. I think it’ll will help you. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nWinston",

I also joined two Twitter Spaces and briefly shared what I made, surprisingly got a bunch of signups from that.\n\nThe crazy part? The first startups listed are already receiving adquisition offers.\n\nNo ads. No hacks. Just being honest, helpful, and responsive. Let me know if you have any questions!",

You basically tapped into intent, not just eyeballs: SideProject + startup subs + #buildinpublic + Twitter Spaces are all places where people are already thinking “I want to launch or buy something,” so your offer slotted right into an active desire.\n\nOne thing I’d double down on now: systematize what just worked. Make a simple Notion/Sheet with columns for sub, post type, angle, and conversion, then keep iterating on the formats that drove actual listings vs just traffic. Same on Twitter: log which replies or Spaces hosts brought signups and treat those like mini-channels, not one-off wins.\n\nIf you want to scale this without losing the honest vibe, tools like SparkToro or F5bot can help you find more intent-heavy convo pockets, and Pulse for Reddit is decent for catching those “I’m buying/selling a startup” threads in real time.\n\nMain point: you didn’t need tricks, you just put a clear offer in front of the right people and stuck around to talk like a human-keep tightening that loop.",
