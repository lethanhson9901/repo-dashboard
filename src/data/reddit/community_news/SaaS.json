      "text": "A few months back, I finally sold my ecommerce SaaS for a decent exit after hitting $500K ARR in 8 months.   \n  \nTook me three tries to get there - the first two were complete disasters.\n\nThis whole thing was brutal. I'm talking thousands of hours, doing the same tedious tasks over and over, saying goodbye to weekends, constantly second-guessing myself, running tests that went absolutely nowhere. But it worked out in the end.\n\nNow I'm working on [this SAAS ](https://gojiberry.ai)(helps B2B companies find and contact high-intent leads), and if I had to do it all over again, these are the exact habits I'd stick to every single day to get to $10k MRR as fast as possible.\n\nI've screwed up in every way you can imagine:\n\n* Wasted 6 months building something nobody wanted\n* Created a \"brilliant\" product that nobody would pay for\n* Got 2,000 people on my waitlist but couldn't convert a single one to paid\n\nSo this is me paying it forward.\n\nIf you're just starting out, trying to get from zero to actual traction, just do these 5 things. Every day with no exceptions.\n\nYour brain's going to fight you on this. It'll whisper \"don't send that message,\" \"don't post that - you'll look like an idiot,\" \"it's beautiful outside, take the day off.\" Don't listen.\n\nGrowth happens when you're uncomfortable. Not when you're cozy.\n\nPush through that voice. Do the work anyway. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nHere are the 5 daily habits that actually move the needle:\n\n1. Send 20-30 LinkedIn connection requests to your ideal customers. Just 20 minutes. Do it manually. Pick the right people. Connect. Done.\n2. Message 20-30 people on LinkedIn. Don't sell them anything. Just talk. Ask questions. Share what you're building and see if they have the same problem.\n3. Send 20-100 cold emails 20 if you're writing them yourself, 100+ if you're using tools. Keep them short. Don't be pushy. Just start real conversations. The magic happens in your follow-ups - send 2-3.\n4. Comment on 10 Reddit threads in your space. Go where your customers hang out. Jump into \"looking for alternatives to X\" posts. Actually help people. Only mention your product when it genuinely fits. People can smell fake help from a mile away.\n5. Post something on LinkedIn every day. This builds up over time. Write about problems your customers face, share what you've learned, tell quick stories about wins and losses. Give away good stuff for free. Build your lead magnets into the content. Just show up consistently.\n\nAt the beginning, it feels pointless.\n\n* 1 like on your posts\n* 1 response for every 20 messages you send\n* Radio silence on your first batch of emails\n\nBut stick with it every single day, and things start to compound.\n\nYou get better at writing. Your messages start working. People begin to recognize you. Someone books a call. Then 2 more. Then 10. Then they start referring people.\n\nThat's how you actually win. Not by getting lucky, but by showing up every day.\n\nEven when it's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nThe boring stuff is what actually grows your business.\n\nTrust me, it's worth it ! ",

      "text": "Two years ago I walked away from a $200k base salary. I wanted to focus on building something on my own and leveraging my skills. On paper everything seemed flawless. In reality this was the hardest decision I have ever made.\n\nMost people talk about going all in like it is a movie montage. It is not. It is a messy, isolating grind that breaks most people.\n\nThe Structure Shock When you are a Staff Engineer you have built in momentum. You have stand ups, tickets, and peers who validate your existence. When you go solo that scoreboard vanishes. I spent the first three months working 14 hour days and feeling like I had accomplished zero. There is no done state anymore. There is just an endless void of tasks where coding is actually the easiest part of the day.\n\nThe Work Multiplies and the Clock is Ticking People think quitting means you finally get time to build. It does. But now you are the entire company and you are bleeding cash. Every single department shows up at your door every morning and the financial weight is heavy. You are responsible for:\n\n* Product Improvement: This is critical. You are constantly obsessing over the roadmap and refining the vision to ensure the core value actually exists.\n* Financial Pressure: You are paying thousands in infrastructure and operations. You are spending thousands more on ads to get eyes on the product. The clock is ticking and it is ticking fast.\n* QA and Support: You are the one answering every customer question and ensuring the product actually works when people log in.\n* Marketing and Sales: Trying to get anyone to care while running demos for people who might never buy.\n* Onboarding and Retention: Making sure users stay after they sign up and figuring out why they churn.\n\nThe Skills Gap is a Wall I am technical enough to have won multiple hackathons running on a few hours of sleep including OpenAI and Horizon AI. That is just the easier part of the game. Scaling a SaaS is the real sauce. Distribution is the game and the product is just your entry ticket. That is a hard truth for an engineer to swallow. Marketing is a specific type of pain because it is so broad. You have to learn SEO, paid ads, funnels, and copy that does not sound like a robot.\n\nThe Momentum Mismatch In engineering effort usually equals output. In a startup you can push a boulder uphill for a month, lose your grip, and end up further back than where you started. That mismatch is brutal. I have spent countless nights staring at a screen until 2:00 AM brainstorming improvements and wondering why the momentum is not matching my expectations. You put in the work but the needle just does not move.\n\nThe Loneliness is Underrated My friends think I am living the dream because I work from home. They see the sweatpants and assume the lifestyle is chill. It is not chill. There is no teammate to share the burden or say we are fine. Nobody else fully understands the specific problem you are trying to solve. You move from confidence to anxiety and from hope to frustration daily. It is not just building a product. It is managing your own psychology.\n\nWhere it stands now The SaaS is growing and making thousands in MRR but I am always with the constant thought that it is not growing fast enough. I have stopped romanticizing motivation and started treating this like a long war. I ship, I measure, I talk to users, and I repeat. Some weeks nothing works. Then one small thing clicks and you remember why you started.\n\nI have learned more in these 24 months than in a decade of traditional jobs because the market does not care about your feelings. It only cares if you solve a problem.\n\n# Question for the community\n\nFor those who quit a high-paying job to build SaaS:\n\nWhat was the hardest part for you?  \nAnd what do you wish you knew before you made the jump?",

The highs are higher - even if someone uses my product and gives me a good feedback, I'm excited.\n2. The lows are lower - if a user even emails that I want to deactivate my account or delete my data, it hits bad - even though there might be thousands of users.\n\nInvestors do ghost you no matter how diligently and seriously you prepared and how much good of a fit you might be. They might ghost you, they might not get back, they might say that you are at a very early stage, or maybe they will wait for a few months before they can connect with you again. There might be pseudo or wrong signals of growth, and you might need a course correction after going down the wrong path. Speed is the king or speed is the key of working at a start-up or building your own company. If you do not work with speed, not only will you get bored, but someone else will build it instead of you. Finally, you will get thousands of thoughts whether I should be doing this or not. The only question that you need to remember is, \"If you stop doing it, will you be able to live with the question that this unanswered? How far could I have taken it had I still been doing it?\"\n\nFocus and consistency while eliminating noise is a very difficult task! Mixed with emotions it might cause a turmoil, but that makes you thick-skinned and makes you a true founder.",

You lose your employees, lose confidence in yourself, run into debts etc. I am starting over again with a proper SAAS this time. I studied engineering but my coding sucks.

Basically, any time someone had a problem my app could solve, Id jump in. It got me my first users and actually helped with SEO down the line. The problem was just how much time it took. I ended up building a tool for myself that automates finding those conversations across Reddit, X and even LinkedIn, its crazy how much time that saved. It was just an internal thing at first, but I realized other founders might be dealing with the same problem. I found organic outreach through relevant conversations a great way to get my first users, and they tend to be more engaged as they came from a genuine conversation around their needs If you think it could help you surface more of those entry ticket opportunities, let me know.",

As much as he is giving me tons of product advise and insights, bulk of the work has been on me for the past several months given that he doesn't possess the technical know-how to build a product/platform. \n\nI'm currently at the juncture where a mentor of mine told me recently to stop building and to instead start looking for actual customers/indicators of demand in the market. I kind of dread it tbh because like you've mentioned, marketing and sales does not reflect the effort you put into it. No idea, how it will turn out in the coming months but I guess I will try to make the best out of what I can do.\n\nWishing you luck as well",

I will work from a co-working space 3 days a week.  \n  \nAdding a co-founder is extremely beneficial if you can. The best co-founders are people you've previously worked with.\n\nJournaling is critical. Real inner thoughts collected daily. Not just meeting notes in Notion. I tried that (and Obsidian and Reflect) and figured out nobody had created exactly what I needed as a founder. It was something I had to have, so I started a side project just to get this right. Now I have a second brain following the evolution of my company and tracking my mood/productivity.\n\nPeople. You have to have your people too. Your community and support network is critical. A spouse will be supportive, but you probably shouldn't burden them with the full weight of your journey. Friends will not get it, like you said. What then? Other founders! And not online. Find your startup spaces, clubs, groups, etc. and have IRL conversations. Put in the reps (show up), and people will get to know you and what you're building. Founders can't help but ideate. They will be a wellspring of fresh connections, the inside track on opportunities you didn't know existed and much more.\n\nSleep and exercise. You can't sacrifice your health for your company. Your company needs you to be healthy. Exercise fights depression and a lot of the feelings that come with trying to bring your idea to life. The right gym bakes in another layer of community too.

Especially the **loss of structure + momentum mismatch** — that part rarely gets articulated well.\n\nFor me, the hardest part wasn’t financial risk or workload, it was **the identity whiplash**. In a high-performing job, effort is legible: meetings, deliverables, praise, promotions. Solo SaaS work strips all of that away. You’re forced to internalize validation *before* the market gives it back to you — sometimes months later, sometimes never.\n\nWhat I wish I knew before jumping:\n\n1. **Psychology > code.** Managing your own energy, expectations, and self-talk is a core skill, not a side effect. Burnout doesn’t come from hours — it comes from effort without feedback.\n2. **Distribution deserves first-class status.** I intellectually knew “marketing matters,” but emotionally I still treated product as the main event. In reality, product just earns you the right to compete.\n3. **Loneliness compounds decision fatigue.** Even small choices feel heavier when you’re the only brain in the room. Having *any* peer loop (founders, users, advisors) is oxygen.\n4. **MRR growth is nonlinear and humbling.** Weeks of nothing followed by one tiny lever that changes everything — but only in hindsight does it look obvious.\n\nRespect for sharing this without romanticizing it. The “long war” framing feels right. You don’t win by being constantly motivated — you win by staying sane, shipping consistently, and surviving long enough for compounding to kick in.",

Same thing with distribution on Reddit/communities – I’ve seen a mix of SparkToro for discovery, Apollo for targeted outreach, and then tools like Pulse for Reddit to catch and reply to high-intent threads work way better than just throwing more money at Meta/Google.\n\nAlso co-founder ambition alignment is huge, but I’d stress expectation alignment too: who owns which decisions, what “done” means, and how much risk each is actually willing to take. That clarity early saves a ton of drama later.\n\nYour list basically shows that boring fundamentals compound way harder than clever growth hacks.",

That’s similar to how we structure delivery pipelines , small changes, fast feedback, observable outcomes.\n* Relying solely on pre-build guesses can mislead if you don’t define what success actually means in measurable terms.\n\nThe SaaS founders I’ve worked with who move fastest aren’t those who “validated perfectly” before writing a line of code , they’re the ones who build minimal but observable paths to value and iterate quickly based on real signals from users.\n\nTo me, it’s less about “validate or don’t” and more about integrating validation into your delivery cycle so every deploy tells you something meaningful about actual user behavior.",

I'd rather write code than cold DMs. But here's what I learned getting my[ SEO tool](https://blogseo.io) to $50k ARR ([proof](https://profile.stripe.com/blogseo/iROCSdxX)):\n\n**1. \"Do you know someone who...\" DMs**\n\nI messaged everyone I knew – ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections, random people I'd met at events. But instead of pitching directly, I asked: \"Do you know someone who could use this?\"\n\nTwo things happen: If they're interested, they say \"yeah, me actually.\" If not, they might intro you to someone. You win either way. Way less awkward than a hard sell.\n\n**2. Posting consistently (even with a small audience)**\n\nLinkedIn 2-3x a week. Nothing fancy. Just sharing what I was building and learning. Multiple people DM'd me asking about the product who became paying customers. The compounding effect is real, even if your posts only get 50 likes.\n\n**3. Cold email (but targeting the right people)**\n\nThis didn't work great at first because my sequence sucked. But here's what I learned: spend 80% of your time on targeting the RIGHT people (nail your ICP), 20% on the copy. Later I pivoted to targeting potential affiliates instead of customers directly – much higher leverage.\n\n**4. SEO (the most underrated channel for SaaS)**\n\nI automated my own blog content since that's literally what my product does. After a few weeks, pages started ranking and I got traffic from both Google and ChatGPT.\n\nThe thing most SaaS founders miss: SEO isn't just Google anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pulling from web content too. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing chunk of your potential customers.\n\nOne of my users reached 450+ clicks a day from organic search alone.\n\n**5. Small ad spend ($200 each on Google + Meta)**\n\nOnly did this AFTER I had organic conversions. Ads amplify what's already working – they won't fix a broken funnel. Even people who didn't buy gave me their email. That list became valuable later.\n\n**6. Obsessing over first customers**\n\nTreated my first 10 customers like they were paying me $10k/month. Jumped on calls. Fixed bugs same-day. Asked for feedback constantly. Result? They became my best marketers. Reviews, referrals, case studies.\n\n**7. Affiliate program**\n\n30% commission. Made it dead simple to join from inside the app. One good affiliate = ongoing customer stream, not just one sale.\n\n**8. Directory launches**\n\nLaunched on \"There's an AI for That\" – got a nice traffic spike. Lost 10 signups to an onboarding bug though (painful lesson: test your critical flows obsessively).\n\n**The honest truth about SaaS growth:**\n\nStop waiting for the perfect growth hack. These tactics aren't sexy. None of them went viral. But they compound.\n\nWhile everyone's chasing the next viral strategy, you can quietly stack Stripe notifications with boring, consistent work.\n\nIf I had to pick one channel that's most underrated for SaaS founders, it's SEO. Not because it's fast – it's not. But because it compounds. Every article you publish keeps working for you months (even years) later. And now with AI search pulling from web content, the surface area for discovery is bigger than ever.\n\nI put together a doc with the 15 specific SEO tactics I used to grow my business to $50k ARR. No fluff, just the stuff that actually moved the needle:\n\n👉 [15 High-Reward SEO Tactics I Used to Grow My Business to $50k ARR](https://www.notion.so/15-High-Reward-SEO-Tactics-I-Used-to-Grow-My-Business-to-50k-ARR-2d68871b675680c88878fa41f33cb0a6?source=copy_link)",

I’ve seen so many solid products die because the founder assumed “if it’s good, people will find it.” Distribution is a skill, not a one-time event, and starting that habit early compounds just like product improvements do.\n\nCurious in hindsight: which channel gave you the fastest signal that something about onboarding or the core feature was off?",

Lowering the barrier of entry unlocked a lot of creativity, but it also led to a massive wave of low-effort businesses. I think SaaS is heading toward a similar sloppification, possibly on a much larger scale.\n\nWe’re probably going to see more low-quality SaaS than ever, and I don’t think that’s just because of AI tools (even though they clearly accelerate this). The bigger shift is that the barrier used to be capital and deep technical skill. Now it’s much lower, which invites more non-technical founders, opportunists, and people trying to extract value quickly. This feels similar to how VC and PE incentives often lead to enshittification subscriptions everywhere, ads in cars, etc.\n\nThe effects already seem obvious: companies getting flooded with cold emails, distribution channels becoming completely saturated, and SaaS starting to resemble dropshipping more than product building. LinkedIn “build in public” and hustle culture just adds more noise on top of it.\n\nTech people can grift too, but more often there’s at least curiosity and a real attempt to understand the problem. My concern is that making a real living from SaaS will become much harder when every distribution channel is filled with low-effort, look-alike products.\n\nHow do you think this plays out over the next few years? Does the market self-correct, or does SaaS just become increasingly noisy with fewer real winners?",

The slop dies because the founders quit after a few months of zero traction, not because users get smarter. What survives is either distribution (you own a channel that's hard to copy) or taste (you actually know what to leave out). The Shopify comparison is spot on—dropshipping stores died but real brands survived. Same thing will happen here. The noise is annoying but it's also the filter.",

The ones who keep trying to better themselves will eventually standout. They'll take more time but sooner or later they will.",

As someone somewhat new to the space I’ve been tempted myself but you quickly realize that unless you’re 1 in a million level lucky it’s most likely not gonna work out. The real talent is gonna differentiate itself with grit, doing the hard work and innovating where others don’t. But to even get there you have to be actually passionate, dedicated to the craft, and willing to learn, fail, and try again…which a lot of the slop merchants aren’t.

We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

Here's what worked for us after testing every imaginable method of making sales.\n\n**What didn't work:**\n\nWe tried SEO with blog posts - extremely slow, generates impressions but zero sales or signups. X (Twitter) posting produced no measurable results. LinkedIn organic posting gets good engagement but conversions are painfully slow. We needed faster traction.\n\n**What is currently working:**\n\nWe run three cold-email campaigns across our founder emails:\n\n1. Founder 1\n2. Founder 2\n3. Competitor campaign (rotates through both founder emails) - targeting users of competitor or similar products (think Apollo / ZoomInfo etc..)\n\n**Campaign Results:**\n\n* Founder 1: [https://i.imgur.com/2Wer6mU.png](https://i.imgur.com/2Wer6mU.png)\n* Founder 2: [https://i.imgur.com/3P39xDM.png](https://i.imgur.com/3P39xDM.png)\n* Competitor: [https://i.imgur.com/eJ4y272.png](https://i.imgur.com/eJ4y272.png)\n\nThe competitor campaign underperformed significantly - zero deals, mostly rejections. Founder campaigns directly to our ICP convertred EXTREMELY well. \n\n**Our trick to getting responses:**\n\nWe flipped the usual cold email playbook. Instead of **Email first → LinkedIn follow-up**, we do **LinkedIn first → Email after**.\n\nThe strategy is simple: engage with prospects before ever hitting their inbox. We use our own product to first scrape LinkedIn posts matching our ICP, comment/engage genuinely, then follow up via email 24-48 hours later.\n\nOur LinkedIn messaging is short and direct - we have shared templates we tested [here](https://www.predictent.ai/templates/linkedin), and adapted them to fit our ICP. For connection requests, we send blank requests (no message). They consistently outperform requests with messages attached as people find it spammy / too salesy - on LI genuine interactions always work better.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nWhen we email someone after engaging on LinkedIn, we're not a random cold email anymore. We're someone who actually paid attention to their content. Reply rates reflect that - we're seeing 4%+ consistently, with the pre-warmed prospects converting at noticeably higher rates.\n\nThe deals closed in early January came almost entirely from this approach - prospects we'd engaged with on LinkedIn in late December who were ready to move fast once back from holiday.",

That’s basically proof that list quality + real human context beats clever targeting tricks. I’ve seen the same thing with Apollo + Clay + Pulse-style Reddit monitoring: the tech only works when the narrative and targeting are boringly specific.\n\n\n\nThe other underrated piece: you’re actually interacting with people’s posts, not just liking and spraying generic DMs. Most folks skip that step because it doesn’t feel scalable, but that’s usually where the signal lives.\n\n\n\nIf you want to push it further, I’d test: 1) one short loom in the follow-up only for those who engaged back on LinkedIn, 2) a “sunk cost” email (“we already pulled X insights from your LI motion, here’s 1 thing we’d change”) to see if you can lift reply rate another point.\n\n\n\nWarm first, precise targeting, then email is clearly the right order here.",

      "text": "I almost tanked my startup not because we ran out of money, but because I literally couldn't send money to my developers. I'm running a small SaaS, and my dev team is 3 Belarusian guys living in different cities in Poland. I was using Wise to pay them - worked perfectly fine for 2 years. Then in late November, two of them got their Wise cards blocked. Wise sent them notices saying they need to prove EU residency by January 30 or lose access completely, something about new EU sanctions compliance. They're all in Poland on work visas but don't have permanent residency yet, so can't provide what Wise is asking for.\n\nThey went almost a month without getting paid while I was scrambling to find another way. Imagine trying to tell someone who's counting on you that \"sorry, still figuring it out\" for the third week in a row. PayPal doesn't work for receiving payments if you're Belarusian (they only allow sending, not receiving). Tried crypto but my team wasn't comfortable with it because it's hard to withdraw legally. My lead dev finally told me he's looking for other work. Can't blame him - dude has rent to pay, and here I am becoming the unreliable client even though I have his money sitting in my account.\n\nPosted in a few startup discords asking for help and someone mentioned The Stape, so I tried it, it was 3 months ago. Decided to leave an honest review here in case someone's struggling like I was.\n\nI set up all contractors once and then just send payments in one click. I schedule all 3 payments for the month at once and forget about it, contractors get money in their account same day and withdraw it however they want. Support is good, they responded quite fast when I had questions during setup, which was a nice surprise compared to Wise taking days. This is actually my first experience with payroll platforms, but I compared some other platforms with %-based fees, and turned out that their fixed fees per transaction are way cheaper. But not cheaper than crypto, tbh. If you're comfortable paying in crypto and your team is okay with it, I probably wouldn't switch. But for me crypto stopped being okay, so now I'm paying $50 per transaction. The upside is contractors don't pay anything on their end.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share in case someone's having the same issues. Do you guys have backup payment methods set up or am I just paranoid now? What's your contingency plan if your main payment provider suddenly stops working?",

It could probably fix your platform risk with stripe but you need to have a plan for the UX side or risk your tanking conversion.\n\nDo your users have a crypto wallet already? If not you need to think hard about how to onboard them and get their accounts funded. Stable coins probably the easiest to conceptually understand. But then you also need to consider the transaction fees which must be paid in the native currency of the blockchain unless you employ some form of fee abstraction.\n\nAnd then you have to deal with network selection. You’ll likely choose ethereum since that where most volume is. But that ecosystem alone has many “flavors” of chains (rollups are the technical term).\n\nLike others have mentioned, you’ll be inviting a lot of new technical and UX problems if you go down this route. If you still want to go down this route feel free to DM if you wanna talk about it more, I’ve got some experience so might be able to help you speed run things as much as possible.",

Has Pre-approved communication flows (get signoff from compliance, legal, executive leadership, external comms, etc) prior to sending to avoid decision dependencies + back and forth of the \"perfect language\" for the target audience all while battling downtime.\n\nReally cleans up incident communication handling, creates audit trails on who sent what in the past, gets rid of copy & paste communications during the chaos of Org incidents and allows engineers to jump in, run incident in 30 seconds instead of spending their first 30 minutes of an incident telling all the relevant parties they are having downtime instead of fixing it. Oh, & all under a BYOA (Bring your own account) model - so you appear as your own org over all channels instead of the tooling's brand.\n\nMainly for SREs, Platform Engineers, DevOps, IMOC (mainly teams that are first to the fire when issues arise within organizations)\nStage: MVP\n\nFeel free to check it out and let me know what you think.",

          "text": "We’re working on bloort.ai. It’s a tool for designers to paste a website URL and instantly get a fully branded AI chatbot they can drop into the site. It’s for freelance designers and small agencies who keep getting asked for “AI stuff” by clients but don’t want to learn embeddings, RAG pipelines, or spend hours wiring things together. Bloort pulls the site content, matches the branding automatically, and gives you one embed so you can ship fast and keep the site clean. It takes only 5-10 minutes and is easier than using canva (speed and removing friction for designers is our main and true purpose) \n\nWe’re past our zero to one and have seen good data from our beta. We may still be early, but the cool part is designers are actually using it on real client websites, which has been a big confidence boost. The main feedback so far is around setup speed and how client-ready it feels. Definitely still growing and iterating, but it’s been nice to see the target audience actually trust it enough to ship it live.",

Getting real feedback before I take this thing wider. The app is live, stories are generating, kids are actually asking to read (wild, I know), and now I’m figuring out what works and what needs work.\n\nThe whole concept is making kids the hero of their own illustrated stories so reading feels like playtime instead of homework. Sight words get highlighted, stories adapt to what they’re into for example dinosaurs, space, and whatever.",

You can save dishes you like, add ingredients to your shopping list as you cook, and plan meals without guessing what they’ll cost. It’s completely free while I grow it, train the AI and hopefully create a community around it. \n\nThe bigger goal is to help people cook better, spend less, and give something back. I’m aiming to donate 50% of any income to UK food banks, so every smart meal helps someone else eat too. Longer term, I want to work directly with supermarkets to get live pricing and eventually let people order ingredients straight from their saved recipes.",

              "text": "You're absolutely right - B2B distribution to decision makers is incredibly challenging. The biggest hurdle is often just getting past the gatekeepers and noise to reach the person who actually cares about your solution.\n\nA few things that can help: 1) Focus on very narrow ICP initially - the more specific you are, the easier it is to find and reach the right people. 2) Leverage any existing networks or warm intros you can get, even tangentially. 3) Consider bottom-up adoption strategies where individual contributors can start using your tool and become internal champions.\n\nThe LinkedIn/cold email spray-and-pray approach rarely works anymore. Building genuine relationships and creating content that demonstrates deep understanding of their specific problems tends to be more effective, though slower.\n\nHappy to compare notes - feel free to DM me!",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI launched my first SaaS product about three weeks ago. It’s a B2B tool for collecting user feedback, managing a roadmap, and publishing updates — aiming to help small teams turn feedback into something actionable and visible.\n\nSo far, I’ve had zero users.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried:\n\n    •\tPosting a few times on X\n    \n    •\tPosting on Reddit\n    \n    •\tBasic SEO work: sitemap, meta tags, a few blog posts\n\nThe result has been almost no traffic and no signups.\n\nLately, I’ve been doing some self-reflection and I’m starting to question my original assumptions.\n\nThis is an existing and fairly mature space, and my initial thinking was simple: if I make the product easy enough to use and well-designed, users would eventually come. I come from a technical background, and coding is very much my comfort zone. Building and refining the product felt like the most logical and controllable thing to do.\n\nMarketing, on the other hand, feels very much outside my comfort zone — and I’m realizing that may have led me to spend most of my time building, instead of validating whether I was solving a problem people feel strongly enough about to switch tools for.\n\nAt this point, I’m trying to be realistic and more intentional with how I spend my limited time each week. I’m stuck on this question:\n\nHow should a solo founder allocate time between SEO and social/community efforts in the very early stage?\n\nMore specifically:\n\n    •\tIs SEO worth continuing this early, knowing it may take months to pay off?\n    \n    •\tOr should I focus more on social platforms, communities, and direct 1-on-1 conversations?\n    \n    •\tFor those who’ve been through the zero-to-first-user phase: what actually helped you get unstuck?\n\nI’m not looking for growth hacks or shortcuts — just honest advice from people who’ve learned this the hard way.\n\nThanks in advance. Any perspective or hard-earned lessons would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "If you’ve launched a SaaS anytime in the last ten years, you’ve probably had the same advice shouted at you from every corner of the internet: Just use Stripe\n\nFor a long time, that was the gold standard. Stripe’s API was a work of art. They took the nightmare of legacy payment gateways and turned it into a developer’s playground. But lately, if you're building in Europe, the vibe has shifted\n\nThe reason isn’t that Stripe has become less capable… FAR FROM T... Rather, the very nature of what’s required to sell software in the european union has fundamentally changed.\n\n*The European Tax Dragon got hungrier.*\n\n**1/ VAT quietly became the real problem**\n\nStripe did not get worse. The environment did. When you use Stripe directly, you are the seller of record.\n\nThat means you are responsible for knowing where every customer lives, registering for OSS, filing quarterly VAT returns and dealing with multiple EU tax authorities..\n\nWhat feels like a simple payment decision slowly turns into ongoing legal and admin work\n\n**2/ Merchant of Record changes the equation**\n\nPlatforms like Paddle, Polar and Lemon Squeezy take a different approach. They act as the Merchant of Record and become the legal seller of your product.\n\nThey calculate and collect VAT, handle remittance, and manage compliance. You get paid out, minus their fee, without worrying about tax filings or cross-border rules.\n\n**3/ Payments are no longer enough**\n\nModern SaaS is much more than simply charging a card. The purchase often needs to unlock a dashboard, grant Discord access, invite someone to a GitHub repo, issue a license, or upgrade an account..\n\nWith Stripe, you assemble all of this yourself using webhooks and custom logic. Newer platforms treat entitlements as a core feature.. often making these flows configuration instead of code\n\n**4/ The Economics of Time Versus Money**\n\nMerchant of Record platforms usually charge higher fees than Stripe. But that comparison misses the hidden costs. Time spent on VAT, maintaining integrations, and managing compliance risk adds up quickly..\n\nFor many founders, paying a bit more per transaction is worth avoiding those distractions\n\n**5/ Why this matters more in Europe**\n\nStripe’s still great if you’re keeping things simple or selling in one place. But if you’re a small team trying to grow across europe, you’ve gotta ask yourself: what actually lets you focus on your product.. instead of drowning in tax forms and weird edge cases?\n\nFor more and more founders in EU, that answer is turning out to be a Merchant of Record",

I work with a founder who exited for $9M in the subscription space, and we saw this constantly: if the MoR decides your new AI feature or vertical is suddenly \"high risk,\" they shut you down. Because they are the legal seller, you have zero recourse. You don't just lose payment processing; you lose the ability to sell entirely.\n\nThe alternative path (which we built our infrastructure around) is Payment Orchestration. You keep direct relationships with multiple gateways (like Mollie + Stripe + Adyen) so you control your own routing and risk, and you just layer a tax automation tool on top. We ended up building our own infrastructure ([Resub.io](http://Resub.io)) to solve this because the existing options were too clunky for e-com, but the principle applies regardless: stop using aggregators and get your own direct MID.\n\nIt’s slightly more setup than a \"one-click\" MoR, but you actually own your revenue stream instead of renting it",

Just visuals.\n\nI posted it in a few founder communities, and within 5 days it had over 1,000 waitlist signups.\n\n\n\nI’m not linking anything because I know the rules here, but if anyone wants to see what it looked like or how I structured it, I can DM the quick demo.\n\n\n\nHappy to break down the method too, this stuff is fun.",

Got about 300 signups in a week, which felt validating at the time.  \n  \nBut here's what I learned the hard way: signups don't always mean you've validated the problem. When we actually launched, only about 8% of those converted to trials, and half churned within a month.  \n  \nThe gap was that people were excited by the concept (shiny UI, clean demo) but hadn't actually felt the pain point sharply enough to change their workflow.  \n  \nNow I focus more on conversations during that validation phase. I'll still use the mockup, but I book 20-30 calls with signups before building anything. Ask them what they're using now, how much time/money it costs them, what they've tried before. If they can't articulate the pain clearly or aren't already trying to solve it somehow, that's a red flag.  \n  \nThe mockup gets attention, but the conversations tell you if it's worth building.  \n  \nWhat kind of validation are you planning to do with those 1,000 signups before you start development?",

I was running outbound for my agency, had like 8 months of connections and active deals in the pipeline.Linkedin didn't send me any warning, I just got a full permanent ban.\n\nSpent two weeks researching wtf happened because their support just said that I violated platform terms of service.. I really thought I was careful with automating my outreach. I was using Waalaxy extension with what I thought were safe limits maybe 40-50 connection requests a day sending personalized messages.\n\nturns out I f\\*cked up in a couple of ways with this automation. My limit was not so safe at all, it's better to send around 25 a day, especially for accounts like mine, without much platform activity history. But the thing that was surprising for me is that the chrome extension I was using actually injects javaScript code into the LinkedIn page, so LinkedIn sees that something foreign is running, found it[ in this article](https://www.linkedhelper.com/blog/bad-linkedin-extensions/). Found out that there are also some other types of using automation. Services that make API calls to linkedin servers, they are expensive as hell, but much better than extentions, although can also be detected by Linkedin, so money is no guarantee here, I guess. And the last one is separate browser, LinkedIn just sees it as regular Chrome. during all this research I kept running into articles from LinkedHelper (they make a standalone browser). I was skeptical because obviously they're promoting their product, but the explanations actually made sense.\n\nso I started testing it about 2 months ago on my main account. setup was annoying, it took me like 3 hours to figure out the campaign settings because their UI, and I had to get used to keeping my computer on all the time it works. But by now it works ok, I send invites and messages without restrictions, even booked 8 meetings through this outreach. But I still worry what if LinkedIn is gonna block me in a couple of months again? Has anyone else used standalone browsers long-term (6 months or so) and how it's been?\n\n",

The risk with any automation is that LinkedIn keeps changing their detection methods, so even if something works for 6 months now, there's no real guarantee it won't get flagged tomrrow.

      "text": "I have built and launched over 30 SaaS MVPs for clients in the last few years.\nThe ones who launched a \"Community Discord\" on Day 1 almost always regretted it.\n\nHere is the trap: You think a community will create \"engagement\" and \"superfans.\"\nWhat it actually creates is a **Union for Angry Customers.**\n\n**1. The \"Bug Riot\" Effect**\nWhen a user finds a bug via email support, it’s a private 1-on-1 conversation. You fix it, apologize, and they stay.\nWhen a user posts a bug in your `#support` channel, three other people jump in: \"Yeah, me too!\" \"This app is always breaking!\"\nSuddenly, a minor edge-case bug feels like a systemic failure. The vibe shifts from \"help me\" to \"let's grab pitchforks.\" I’ve seen perfectly good products die because the Discord sentiment turned toxic over one bad weekend deployment.\n\n**2. Your \"Superfans\" are actually distracting you**\nThe people who hang out in SaaS Discords all day are usually not your ideal enterprise customers. They are the tinkerers.\nThey will demand niche features, complain about pricing, and eat up 4 hours of your day.\nMeanwhile, your *real* customers—the business owners paying $99/mo—are too busy working to chat in a Discord. They just want the tool to work.\n\n**3. Email is a Feature, not a Bug**\nWhen I build MVPs for clients, I intentionally integrate boring, old-school support widgets (like Help Scout or Crisp).\nWhy? Because it forces **async communication**.\nIt gives you breathing room to triage bugs, fix them, and reply calmly. Discord forces you to be \"always on.\" If you don't reply in 10 minutes, the chat assumes you're dead.\n\n**My Advice to Founders:**\nBuild the product. Put a support email on the landing page.\nOnly launch a community when you have 1,000+ happy users and you can afford to hire a full-time Community Manager to police the toxicity.\nUntil then, control the narrative. Don't hand the microphone to the guy who is cancelling his subscription.\n\n**Unpopular opinion? Maybe. But I’d rather have boring support and low churn than a lively Discord and a leaking bucket.**",

No scheduling no sales rep needed. People can just hop in and see if it fits their use case. Some bounce sure but way less than with broken free trials.\n\nIf youre serious about fixing this you need automation. Like actual automation not just better calendar tools. Consensus and walnut both do this and theres a few others. Basically you preload product flows and let buyers pick their own path. Saves your team from doing 50 custom demos a week and prospects dont wait 3 days for a zoom link.\n\nYour free trial probably sucks because theres no guidance. People log in see 100 buttons and leave. Interactive demos solve that by walking them through exactly what matters to them. Way higher conversion than dumping someone into a raw product.",

In production teams, we aim to reduce friction and reveal value fast, demos should follow the same principle.\n\nA couple of things that help:\n\n* Run a quick discovery upfront: clarify prospect pain points before the demo so you can focus only on what matters to them. That makes the actual demo shorter and more relevant.\n* Show the “aha moment” first: start with the part of the product that delivers clear value right away, not a long tour of every feature. That helps prospects see usefulness before drilling into details.\n* Automate personalization: pre-demo surveys or trial usage data tied to the demo can tailor the experience so you’re not building context from scratch each time.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, this is just like improving a delivery pipeline ,reduce unnecessary steps, optimize for the fastest path to value, and measure where prospects drop off. That alignment between demo flow and delivery mindset tends to speed things up without losing quality.",

That video is sent to stakeholders before the meeting or played at the start, so everyone comes in aligned and already interested.\n\nOnce people have seen the overview, meetings get faster and more focused. You can skip the surface level explanations and go straight into the details that matter. It shortens sales cycles and makes conversations more productive because you are talking to people who are already engaged.\n\nI’ve done this for both large companies and smaller teams, and the results are the same. A strong product video sets context, builds confidence, and saves time.\n\nI’m now building products myself, not just making videos, so I understand both sides.

Get wasted spend, search term leaks, negative keyword gaps, bid strategy issues. Full diagnostic in 3 minutes.\n\n**2. Meta ads audit** \\- Paste account data or export. Get campaign structure issues, audience overlap, creative fatigue signals, scaling opportunities. Where to focus first.\n\n**3. Ad spend allocator** \\- Paste multi-channel spend + results. Get reallocation recommendations, diminishing returns flags, budget shift priorities.\n\n**4. A/B test analyzer** \\- Feed it test results. Get stat sig check, segment breakdowns, \"why it worked\" hypotheses, next test ideas.\n\n**5. Competitor teardown** \\- Paste a landing page URL. Get positioning analysis, messaging hierarchy, objection handling, CTA strategy. 2 hours of work in 3 minutes.\n\n**6. Landing page audit** \\- Upload screenshot or URL. Get headline clarity, CTA placement issues, trust signal gaps, mobile friction. Prioritized by impact.\n\n**7. UTM & tracking generator** \\- Describe campaign structure. Get consistent UTM taxonomy, GA4 event naming, conversion tracking specs. No more naming chaos.\n\n**8. Email sequence writer** \\- Give it ICP + offer + objections. Get full nurture sequence with subject lines, preview text, body copy. Maintains voice throughout.\n\n**9. Content repurposer** \\- Give it one long-form piece. Get LinkedIn posts, tweet threads, email snippets, ad hooks. Keeps your voice.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO builder** \\- Give it niche + data source. Get page templates, title patterns, internal linking logic, schema markup. Scale without looking scaled.\n\n**Quick thoughts:**\n\n* Skills are markdown files. Upload in Claude settings → Features → Skills.\n* Build your own: document a workflow you repeat, add examples, save as .md\n* Community ones on GitHub, quality varies\n\nI use Ad spend allocator and A/B test analyzer weekly for client reporting. Competitor teardown whenever we're pitching or repositioning.\n\nLink if you want to try: [https://github.com/irinabuht12-oss/claude-marketing-skills](https://github.com/irinabuht12-oss/claude-marketing-skills)",
