I still remember the feeling when I try a LOT of methods and it still doesn't improve the result by a tiny bit. Yet the resilience and knowledge I learned from these experiences helped me later in life.\n\nYou can do solo or group. I hope you learn a lot on Kaggle, since I did too!",

You don't want to learn how to do many things poorly if you want a job; you want to learn how to do things well and then move on.\n\nOnce you do enough projects well, you will get better at learning new things and doing them well.\n\nIf you just move on, you will only build poor intuition and become a black-box API caller, which will open no doors for job seeking.",
