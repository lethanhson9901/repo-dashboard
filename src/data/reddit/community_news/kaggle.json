I’ve been on Kaggle for 3 years, but I never really competed because I only have a laptop and no other resources. Do you think it’s still possible to become a Kaggle Expert or even a Master without a good GPU? Has anyone achieved this, especially in recent competitions?",

Having owned a small 4070 gpu, Googlr colab TPUs and T4s and kaggle gpus were enough, go for gcp credits and gpus next and then get a b200 for a dollar an hour in prime intellect \n\nI mean there is so much stuff you can do before spending good money on a gpu ( im a cloud architect/ data and ai team lead).\n\nOfc if you love the new box feeling or really need to build custom kernels, expand the local models or have privacy concerns \n\nGo for it ( and money to spend)\n\nOtherwise, i suggest stick to publically available gpus cuz descion trees are going to be your bread and butter for most of kaggle",

For example, in the recent cmi competition, you could train competitive models in your laptop, or with the notebooks, and you can pay 10 euros to have extra hours of gpu. However you do need resources for competitions like the math ai olympiad, or the current christmas competition of packing n trees, since those heavily benefit from computing resources rather than just intelligent tricks",

My advice: if you’re in university they might have a HPC so you can try to take ML courses. Like a NLP course or something that probably requires GPU. And while taking that course you can use the GPU for your personal projects lol…\n\nThat’s what I did and turns out even after the semesters over I still have access to their a100 gpus and I’m at mid size uni so other unis might have a HPC too. If you think this is unethical then I’d recommend reaching out to a professor or the ppl in charge of the HPC themselves to see if you can use their resources for learning purposes.",
