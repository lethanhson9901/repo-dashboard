I still remember the feeling when I try a LOT of methods and it still doesn't improve the result by a tiny bit. Yet the resilience and knowledge I learned from these experiences helped me later in life.\n\nYou can do solo or group. I hope you learn a lot on Kaggle, since I did too!",

You don't want to learn how to do many things poorly if you want a job; you want to learn how to do things well and then move on.\n\nOnce you do enough projects well, you will get better at learning new things and doing them well.\n\nIf you just move on, you will only build poor intuition and become a black-box API caller, which will open no doors for job seeking.",

      "text": "As AI evolves at an unprecedented pace, measuring intelligence can’t be done by a handful of research labs alone—it requires the imagination, curiosity, and collective expertise of the global community.\n\nToday, we’re launching Kaggle Community Benchmarks: a new way to build, run, and share custom benchmarks to evaluate AI models on real-world use cases, with transparent and reproducible results shaped by the community.\n\nWith Community Benchmarks, you can:\n\n* Access leading models (free within usage quotas)\n* Run reproducible evaluations with auditable outputs\n* Benchmark multimodal, multi-step, and tool-based tasks\n* Create tasks, group them into benchmarks, and compare performance on shareable leaderboards\n\nIf you’re interested in building your own benchmark, check out the quick tutorial and get started! \n\n📺 Tutorial video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBlyJJ7PTD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBlyJJ7PTD8)\n\n📖 Learn more about community benchmarks: [https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-announcements/667898](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-announcements/667898)  \n  \n👉 Get Started: [https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks?type=community](https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks?type=community)\n\nWould love to hear how you’re thinking about benchmarking models or what kinds of tasks you’d want to evaluate.
