I feel fairly comfortable with basic data cleaning and model training, but I’m struggling to consistently improve my feature engineering.\n\nI’d love to hear how others approach feature creation, especially when you’re not deeply familiar with the domain. Do you rely more on exploratory data analysis, reading related papers/blogs, or learning from public notebooks after a competition ends?\n\nIf you have general advice, learning strategies, or common mistakes to avoid, I’d really appreciate it.

And while taking that course you can use the GPU for your personal projects lol…\n\nThat’s what I did and turns out even after the semesters over I still have access to their a100 gpus and I’m at mid size uni so other unis might have a HPC too. If you think this is unethical then I’d recommend reaching out to a professor or the ppl in charge of the HPC themselves to see if you can use their resources for learning purposes.",

I also tried creating a temporary account just to keep working, but even phone verification SMS doesn’t arrive (German number, +49).\n\nImportant clarifications:\n\n* I do **not** have Gmail aliases (dots or +)\n* I had **two separate email addresses** in the past (same name), but not the same inbox\n* I didn’t get any suspension or violation email\n* This feels like an automated account/identity lock, not deletion\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would really help.

      "text": "As AI evolves at an unprecedented pace, measuring intelligence can’t be done by a handful of research labs alone—it requires the imagination, curiosity, and collective expertise of the global community.\n\nToday, we’re launching Kaggle Community Benchmarks: a new way to build, run, and share custom benchmarks to evaluate AI models on real-world use cases, with transparent and reproducible results shaped by the community.\n\nWith Community Benchmarks, you can:\n\n* Access leading models (free within usage quotas)\n* Run reproducible evaluations with auditable outputs\n* Benchmark multimodal, multi-step, and tool-based tasks\n* Create tasks, group them into benchmarks, and compare performance on shareable leaderboards\n\nIf you’re interested in building your own benchmark, check out the quick tutorial and get started! \n\n📺 Tutorial video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBlyJJ7PTD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBlyJJ7PTD8)\n\n📖 Learn more about community benchmarks: [https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-announcements/667898](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-announcements/667898)  \n  \n👉 Get Started: [https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks?type=community](https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks?type=community)\n\nWould love to hear how you’re thinking about benchmarking models or what kinds of tasks you’d want to evaluate.
