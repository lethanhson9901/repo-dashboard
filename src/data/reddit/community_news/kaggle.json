      "text": "While the game itself is mathematically solved, it remains surprisingly difficult for LLMs. Why? Because it requires maintaining a 7×6 mental board, reasoning through gravity mechanics, anticipating diagonal threats, and planning multiple steps ahead - all through text alone.\n\nThis benchmark is designed to test structured, deterministic reasoning under pressure:  \n • No access to minimax solvers or game trees (pure neural reasoning)  \n • Models must justify every move before it’s executed  \n • Fixed rules eliminate ambiguity, exposing planning weaknesses\n\nAs models improve at generation, benchmarks like this help us measure something deeper: consistency, foresight and logical rigor.\n\nExplore the new Four-in-a-Row leaderboard in the Game Arena: [https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/four-in-a-row/leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/four-in-a-row/leaderboard) ",
