      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a Computer Science undergrad working on a college Machine Learning project, and I’m trying to build a small computer-vision model that estimates soil properties from images — basically predicting things like nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium (NPK), pH, or overall fertility class from soil photos.\n\nTo be clear:  \nThis is strictly for an academic project. I’m not asking anyone to build my project, and there’s no commercial use involved. I just want to experiment with whether visual soil features correlate with lab measurements.\n\n\n\n# What I’ve tried so far\n\nI’ve spent the last couple weeks digging through:\n\n* Kaggle\n* GitHub repos\n* Google Dataset Search\n* a few agriculture papers I could access\n\nI did find datasets with **soil classification images** (soil type/texture/color) and also some **tabular soil chemistry datasets**, but I haven’t been able to find a dataset that actually *links the two together*. Most image datasets stop at “loam/sandy/clay”, and most lab datasets don’t have images.\n\n\n\n# What I’m specifically looking for\n\nIdeally a dataset containing:\n\n* soil photos/images (field photos or controlled images — either is fine)\n* AND corresponding lab measurements such as:\n   * N, P, K values\n   * pH\n   * organic carbon\n   * fertility rating (even categorical labels would help)\n\nEven a small dataset, thesis dataset, or partially labeled research dataset would be incredibly helpful. I’m also happy to contact researchers if someone knows a lab/group that has published something similar.\n\nI will properly cite and credit the dataset owner/research group in my report and project documentation.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve seen a paper, university repository, agricultural institute dataset, or even a “hidden” dataset that isn’t well indexed on Kaggle, I’d really appreciate a pointer. Even leads (like a specific research group or keywords I should search) would help a lot.\n\nThanks for reading — and sorry if this is slightly outside the usual posts here. I’m mainly trying to learn and test whether this idea is even feasible.\n\nAppreciate any suggestions!",
