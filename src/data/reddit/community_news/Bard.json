Google app 17.2 reveals work on four capabilities, starting with: \n\n>- **Live Thinking Mode:** “Try a version of Gemini Live that takes time to think and provide more detailed responses.”\n\n>- **Live Experimental Features:** “Try our cutting-edge features: multimodal memory, better noise handling, responding when it sees something, and personalized results based on your Google apps.”\n\n>Live today is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Those two Labs suggest that Gemini Live will soon be powered by Gemini 3. Live Thinking Mode could be using either the Thinking or Pro models for its “more detailed responses.”\n\n>Meanwhile, the Live Experimental Features are capabilities offered in the chat experience with Gemini 3 Flash and Pro. This includes Personal Intelligence’s Connected Apps and Past Gemini chats. Better noise cancellation is always needed, while “responding when it sees something” could be a Project Astra capability.\n\n>The other Labs features are:\n\n>- **UI Control:** “Agent controls phone to complete tasks”\n\n>- **Deep Research:** “Delegate complex research tasks\n\n>We're unsure what the last item is specifically about, but we've long been expecting Gemini Agent to come to Android as part of [Computer Use.](https://9to5google.com/2026/01/15/android-16-qpr3-screen-automation/)",

Please ffs.\n\nNot only does it get what i say wrong, on top of that, it will randomly decide you're done speaking and immediately send the query to the model. Can i please think for a second??\n\nEven the google keyboard stt on android is better somehow than this.\n\nIt's bizarre because google has had free voice transcription before any company, yet now theyre behind openai on it?\n\nChatgpt's whisper is amazing, seriously. The ui is perfect. you click the button, it shows you that its recording now, you speak for as long as you like, be silent and think what you wanna say, and once youre done, even if its 3 minutes later, it will transcribe it for you. it's literally perfect.\n\nThere have been times when i have used chatgpt to transcribe something and then copy paste that into gemini, just because gemini's transcriber is nowhere close.\n\nPlease google, rather than stealing \"answer now\" button from chatgpt, steal this instead!",

It can't understand the whole context to fix the text you want to say. Like in Mandarin, 'muscle' and 'chicken' sound the same, so it’s a total toss-up for Gemini. Same goes for 'service' versus 'surface' in English, it just mixes them up because they sound too similar.",

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down:  \n[**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

The evolution of AI coding assistants has progressed through distinct phases*\" and literally *never* gets near an answer to my question, just writing nebulous filler about loosely related topics like a student trying to hit a word count minimum. I get better answers from Opus or GPT5.2 with thinking than I get from Gemini with deep research",

I have been using Chatgpt and Gemini  for roughly 2 years.I used them from finding info about MCU's that have no publically available data sheets or documentation. Mst of the time give me wrong info about MCU  but deep research improved that.A month ago, I tried to dump code from this aliexpress bluetooth gamepad for mobiles. As as usual the text on Micorontroller does not show up any thing at all in any searches.Since I had Chatgpt Plus and Gemini pro I spun up a quick deep research Attached close up images and gave a description of controller and it's name from aliexpress. Gemini found it which a suprise to me while chatgpt did not it gave wrong mcu.\n\nI probe main pins such as VCC and GND and tried to get dump of firmware which is my mistake.\n\nBut the point is Gemini 3 searched through sources like scribd and some chinese docs and pinpointed the exact mcu.\n\nIt might not seem a big thing but deep reserch of gemini  which uses mutiple sources is kinda rectifying the errors i usually get from normal and thinking modes of chat  since a Micrcontoller usually has mutiple variants.\n\nEven this game pad MCU has 2 variants .\n\nGemini :Yichip YC-1021  \nChatgpt:Jieli AC6951C \n\npardon my typos\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lauo7jvdzvdg1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf4838a0dfd54eebfcc23895498e8c3a56a6ba7b\n\n",

      "text": "This post is specifically about the \"laziness\" of 3.0. Or the quantization, or whatever you wanna call it. And tests are involved btw. Not just opinions. And this is not AI-written.\n\nI'm an author who uses Gemini / ChatGPT for almost every step in the writing process except the writing itself. More details on that are in my profile posts, but suffice it to say that AI saves me a lot of time and money. A whole lot. Need a decent cover without spending $$$? Banana Pro image output at 4k, some photoshop edits, and then the cover text itself added in Canva. It's funny how mad the writing subreddit users are when I say I use AI for my covers, and then, when I DM them the results, they're like... holy shit. That looks more professional than my $350 cover!\n\nYeah. Ya'll sleeping on how fast these image generators are progressing.\n\nSorry, got off track there. Anyway, you need to look up specific historical details and don't want to spend an hour doing so? Ask AI to do the research for you and give you a full outline. Want to make sure that you used the appropriate terminology for a government facility? AI. (again, you can just google these things, but usually the question is more specific, and AI is great at combining lots of sources into one.)\n\nLet's get down to business. I loved, truly loved, 2.5 for the writing process. Asking it to give me a detailed outline for virtually any reason caused it to carefully, slowly, search the web, ending up with all kinds of sources. And now... 3.0 is here. It's lazy. Simple as that.\n\nTest one:\n\nI wanted to edit a minor subplot in my fifth book of a series. So, I gave detailed outlines of each proceeding book (almost 40k words in total)  and also gave both Gemini and ChatGPT the exact same prompt. I wanted them to deeply understand the overall plot, check real-world details, etc, and give me ten options for the specific change that I wanted. Told them to cut no corners and read and understand EVERY word.\n\nChatGPT did so almost perfectly. It understood the sci-fi aspects and rules, generally understood the plot as a whole, and gave me ten ideas in an output that was 2.6 k words long.\n\nGemini hallucinated a lot more important details, missed some massive implications, and gave me... 1.1 k words. Oh, and ChatGPT took six minutes to actually look over the document. Gemini took fifteen seconds. Yes, I was using Pro btw. Not flash or thinking. Listen, when I select the \"pro\" model, I hope that the model actually THINKS about what it is doing, you know? Not just spit out a summary in ten seconds. Lazy! And this is how it is for every prompt, too. ChatGPT takes like five times as long to actually do any damn research, Gemini just seems to skim over it and check a couple sources instead of a dozen.\n\nLazy.\n\nTest two:\n\nI wanted to create a cheat sheet of every single character from book two. Same thing; exact same prompts, be detailed, don't miss a word, etc. Uploaded the 82k word long txt file in it's entirety. This time I used Deep Research.\n\nChatGPT gave me a list that was damn near perfect and took thirty minutes, rather than the eight minutes of Gemini, who forgot half of the people. (or got them mixed up, idk.)\n\nTest three:\n\nI asked each to give me a long, super detailed critical beta-testing style review on book one as a whole, rating it 3.5 stars (to keep from gushing over it but also not creating mistakes when there are none), and to make the output as long as possible. Short was bad. Long was good.\n\nChatGPT didn't understand the plot as well as Gemini did this time, so that's one point for 3.0. However, it wasn't that much worse, and you wanna guess what the \"super long\" output was for Gemini? 4.8 k words. That's it! You know how long ChatGPT's was? 26 k words.\n\nThat's literally twenty thousand words longer than Gemini's! What the hell, bro? Really? Gemini's was basically just a summary! Literally shorter than many of my chapters. Come on now. I tried again, making it even clearer that I wanted a LOOOOONG review, no corners cut, and.... Gemini was at 5.2 k words. ChatGPT gave me THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND WORDS!\n\nSorry. I'll quit yelling. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I am NOT a \"Gemini is so much worse than ChatGPT, haha\" spammer. If you look over my profile posts, you'll see where I said, on multiple occasions, that 2.5 was better in general at... well, things in general. But, although I think 3.0 is better at coding, making photos, searching videos, and being less censored overall than ChatGPT, it simply isn't the \"best\" overall anymore. At least not for my use cases. AND FIX THE DAMN DICTATION. ALSO, WHERE ARE THE FOLDERS? WHERE ARE THE-\n\noh. I said I'd quit yelling.\n\nTest four. This morning, I was going over a very dry ebook on how to be a better author.\n\nVery, very, very dry. But useful. So, I extracted the text and gave each chapter to both Gemini and Chatgpt, telling it to break down the chapters (which averaged around 4k words) and give me a easier to understand breakdown that would be 1.2k words per chapter. Oh, and it needed to act as though these breakdowns were written from my fake Professor, a close friend of mine. Easy enough, right?\n\nNow, I will say that Gemini broke it down into easier to understand language than Chatgpt did. But, exactly SEVEN chapters later, it gave up on the \"professor\" persona entirely. ChatGPT did not. Cool, whatever. I reminded it, and it went back into character.\n\nSkip to chapter... hold on. Let me pull up the notes I have so I'M not the one hallucinating. Okay. So, at chapter eleven, I started to notice something was wrong. Even though I told Gemini not to use bullet points, it had started using them. And the outputs were growing shorter and shorter each time. So, I copied ChatGPT's outputs, and checked the word length for all of them. They turned out to be 12,043 words on average. I checked Gemini... yeah. The first two were 1.2k words. Next one was 1.17k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was a big drop, down to just below a thousand words. That drop-off continued, and by chapter 11, it was down to just 847 words.\n\nWhat the hell, Gemini? You can't remember an explicit instruction from twelve prompts ago? Really? Maybe I'm just wearing rose-tinted glasses, but 2.5 would've let me do two entire books before something that major went wrong.\n\nFine. I told it what it was doing wrong, and it fixed the length and the bullet points on the next chapter. But... the professor persona was gone! It defaulted back to a generic chatbot. Sigh.\n\nLong story short, we finished up the Ebook at chapter 27. By then, I only had to warn ChatGPT once about something, and that was because it too slipped into a \"bullet-point\" summary style. But none of the outputs were less than 1.1 k words long, and it never forgot to be the \"professor.\" Gemini, on the other hand, had me warn it SIX TIMES to simply remember the damn instructions!\n\nI'm sorry, but this is pathetic. And the fact that Google has said nothing about it is even more pathetic.",

I have said before that I have a set of around 25 characters, a world (present day earth, non sci fi) which they inhabit, and a backstory. \n\n\nCombined - 4 months of summarised backstory, world rules, character bios, this amounts to about 12,000 tokens (I've test uploaded it to AI Studio to count) \n\n\nGemini 3 Pro via the Gemini App or Web UI, is ignoring major points from the very first response. Hallucinations based on a jumble of data that does exist in the document, but is not connected to the question at hand. \n\n\nIf I ask for a projected beat sheet to cover a projected week it's immediately ignoring the backstory, disregarding character personas, and totally dismissing the ruleset that applies to the world/environment. \n\n\nPlot holes that make it clear it has absolutely not \"read\" the full document. \n\n\nFor context, my support document is basically broken up into: \n\n\n----\n\n\nSection - Backstory\nW1\nW2\nW3\nW4\nW5\nW6\netc\n\n\nSection - Characters\nCharacter 1\nCharacter 2\netc\n\n\nSection - Company\nBuilding layout\nCompany purpose and structure \nInternal culture\nCommunication style \nBranding\n\n\n----\n\n\nI've experimented with this as one long document, separate documents, different file formats - the result is unchanged. \n\n\nWhen starting a new chat, I tell it to analyse the back story and cast, look for unresolved plot lines, underutilized characters, suggest potential new beats involving daily events that might occur with people who work in a company in this line of business. \n\n\n2.5 was very good at this, even down to spotting conflicts or inconsistencies in historical events. \n\n\n3.0 just cannot do it with any degree of reliability.\n\n\nOne of they things about my setting is that, whilst it's a high performance company, people are collaborative, \"nice\", high performing teams, they want to do an awesome job. It's designed to mirror a startup I worked for a few years back. This is all very explicit in the source material I provide.\n\n\nIn the first response I'm getting pure Devil Wears Prada - \"My office. Now\", bullying, humiliation, \"get this done by next week or you're finished here\", surveillance, tracking etc. \n\n\nWhen I query Gemini about where did those elements come from, and do they align with my backstory, it says that no - in fact they are the opposite of what is specified in the material. \n\n\nIt's, to put it bluntly, lazy - like you say. It's got the information there at its fingertips, it just doesn't do anything with it.",

This seriously frustrates the hell out of me. When I saw it I was wondering if Google updated it because it was not like this yesterday.\n\nYesterday I used AI Studio for 2 hours and before that I got 3 hours most days.. The change in rate limit is absurd after weeks/months. I remember being able to use AI Studio for 7 hours at one point before hitting the limit on the free tier. I am honestly kind of shocked even when I looked into what the tier above gives you and it's not really any way significantly better than not not paying for it.\n\nClaude does the same insignificant difference between free and pro tier. I know because I started using Claude 3 days ago to see if it was any better for free tier and needless to say it's better at some things but the cons outweigh the pros. One thing Claude does better is that the limit resets every 5 hours instead of waiting until midnight every time you hit a limit with AI Studio but that doesn't mean the limits aren't worse than AI Studio.\n\nOne thing that I find so ridiculous between both is that you can never see how close you are to the limit before you even put in a prompt only on Claude so they sometimes tell you you have 2 messages left or don't tell you how many at all. There's no display for either one except if you had an API Key from AI Studio at least I think correct me if I'm wrong but for the free tier there's no indication of the limit.\n\nI use both for roleplaying and it's seriously annoying when you use Claude for 40 minutes and get limited. Then try to use AI Studio and only be able to use it for almost an hour even though it doesn't feel like it.\n\nRant over.",

I don't know how many times I've asked it to remove this addition from it's memories, and I've added a request in the settings TWICE to NOT do this.\n\nI also have a prompt for writing informational texts in a certain format. I want it to only use this format when I ask for it, because it's quite long.
