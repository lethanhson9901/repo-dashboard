It's barely even noticeable now. \n\nI do find pro generally outperforms flash as far as just using the service normally goes. It just seems more consistent and reliable. But it's still given me a ton of problems and honestly when it works the quality of the output from flash isn't much worse it's just that I experience issues with it quicker and will get stuck in loops where it can't figure out what I want from it more often. \n\nEven in image generation nano banana pro used to demolish the regular one in output with the prompts I was using. Now I can use incredibly bare bones basic ass prompts and the flash version will output a pretty realistic looking image. \n\nIt really does seem as though Google did something to raise the floor for using Gemini. Casual users and those that just don't want to think much about it are getting much better results than they would have previously but they seem to have completely neutered it on the top end. \n\nNone of my old personas or prompt strategies work anymore.

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+ (or, perhaps, Pro 2.5-), elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

              "text": "it answered correctly for me :   \nFunctionally, a cup with the bottom cut off and the top sealed is a metal dome or bell. If you flip it upside down, it acts exactly like a regular cup again, just with a raw edge.\n\nBecause it is made of steel, it is durable, heat-resistant, and easy to clean. Here are several practical ways you can use it, depending on its size:\n\n# ⚠️ First: A Quick Safety Step\n\nBefore using it for anything, take a metal file or heavy-grit sandpaper to the cut edge. Cut steel can have microscopic (or macroscopic) burrs that will easily slice your skin or leave metal shavings in food.\n\n# 1. Kitchen & Grill Uses\n\n* **A Melting Dome:** If you grill or make smash burgers, place this cup over the meat and cheese on the griddle. The sealed top will trap the heat and steam, melting the cheese perfectly in seconds.\n* **Heavy-Duty Biscuit/Cookie Cutter:** If you file the edge so it is smooth but relatively thin, you can use the open end to punch out perfect circles of dough, fondant, or even hamburger patties.\n* **Garlic Smasher:** Keep it right-side up and use the heavy, sealed top to crush cloves of garlic, nuts, or peppercorns against a cutting board.\n* **A Food Mold:** Flip it upside down, pack it with rice, mashed potatoes, or steak tartare, and flip it onto a plate for professional-looking restaurant plating.\n\n# 2. Workshop & Garden Uses\n\n* **A Fence Post Cap:** If the diameter is right, you can place this over the top of a wooden fence post or PVC pipe to protect the wood/interior from rain and rot.\n* **Overnight Seedling Protector (Cloche):** Place it over small, delicate garden seedlings at night to protect them from unexpected frost or rodents. (Just remember to remove it in the morning, as steel blocks the sun and will cook the plant if left out in the heat).\n* **Parts Organizer:** Flipped upside down (with the edge sanded smooth), it becomes a durable cup for holding screws, nails, drill bits, or zip ties on your workbench.\n\n# 3. Crafts & Decor\n\n* **A Wind Chime or Bell:** Steel has excellent acoustics. Drill a small hole through the sealed top, thread a string through with a nut or washer attached to the inside to act as a clapper, and hang it up.\n* **Industrial Pencil Holder:** Flip it upside down, sand the edge perfectly smooth, perhaps paint or polish the outside, and use it as a heavy-duty pen and pencil holder for your desk.\n* **Candle Snuffer:** If the cup is small enough, you can hold it by the sides and place it over a candle flame to instantly snuff out the fire without creating smoke or blowing wax everywhere.\n* **Incense Holder:** Flip it upside down, fill it halfway with sand or fine gravel, and use it to stand up incense sticks. The steel will easily catch the ash and won't burn.\n\n# 4. Camping & Survival\n\n* **Ember Cover:** If you are camping and need to keep a small ember alive but protected from the wind or light rain, place the cup over it (prop up one side slightly with a pebble so oxygen can still get in).\n* **Water Dipper/Scoop:** Flipped upside down, it is an indestructible scoop for getting water out of a stream or moving hot coals around a campfire.",

Sort of a tenure-brag kind of thing.\n\nI have no idea why they're bringing the MTS back though, that said, I don't think I've ever seen the product ladder (PMs) being given that title in the past, since it's traditionally an engineering role.",

Now it's about 20 prompts every 4 hours.\n\nI noticed that for really heavy tasks it can go way less than 20, and for the really light ones, you get more than 20. so it's very much based on your usage.\n\nThe refresh times are fixed per account, so since it said 3.19 pm, the next limit will be at 7:19 pm and 11:19 pm, etc.\n\nTechnically, I think we might get slightly more usage if you're the kind that maxes out your quota, but it's implemented in an obnoxious way. I ended up planning my day around these refresh times now.",

Par exemple en décembre dernier, Imagen 4 est devenu le moteur de Nano Banana Pro, à la place de Imagen 3 qui a été rétrogradé pour devenir le moteur de Nano Banana, qui jusque là était propulsé par Imagen 2 qui est parti au rebut. Tout ceci a été présenté comme une avancée significative en terme de création d'image avec des résolutions natives en 1696x2528, une IA qui colle enfin au prompt, plus de mains à  4 ou 6 doigts, des détails beaucoup plus léchés. En tout cas en théorie ! Car comme tu dis, en réalité, Imagen 4 a longtemps cohabité avec Imagen 3, de façon totalement aléatoire. Pendant plusieurs semaines, lorsque tu utilisais Nano Banana Pro, tu pouvais aussi bien tomber sur l'un que sur l'autre. Il y a même eu une semaine où tout était HS dans que le service ne soit interrompu, avec systématiquement des formats carrés en basse, voir très basse résolution et des prompts superbement ignorés. Et aujourd'hui encore, je crains que certains problèmes ne soient pas résolus et que les développeurs soient en plein tâtonnement. La preuve est que malgré l'effet d'annonce, ils sont récemment revenus à la résolution 868×1264 pour Nano Banana Pro, avec désormais des problèmes de filigrane (le logo Gemini en bas à droite de l'image est un véritable placard...) et des prompts de moins en moins compris/respectés. En ce qui me concerne je note effectivement une grosse régression. Alors je n'irais pas à dire qu'ils utilisent encore aléatoirement Imagen 3/4 dans le cadre de Nano Banana Pro. En revanche je pense qu'ils ont drastiquement réduit les performances de Imagen 4, à tel point que ça peut faire parfois penser à du Imagen 3...",

Ive build 5 different Gemini Gems which use a deliberate instruction structure, basically a pre-prompt, and still get very satisfactory results from each.\n\nOne is my lifestyle, diet and fitness coach, another is my industry work assistant, another is my gaming and hobby guru, another is my brainstorming and creative thinking partner, and the last is my “I never studied this in school” professor.\n\nEach instruction set has a different personas of expertise with different guardrails and rules to specify output structures, tones, reduce hallucinations, etc...  I define who the IRL experts and authors are in these fields and have the AI lean into synthesis of those ideas, methodology and philosophy.  When I don’t get an answer I like, I tweak the instructions.\n\nI started by asking Gemini to write me a Gem that is designed to help with (thing), and then just free flow my preferences and concerns…. It write a set of instructions, I read it, collaborate with it a few times, then copy paste to a new Gem.  Test, tweak, test, tweak… and when I like the results, I now have a useful tool.",

                  "text": "To figure out how many goats can fit inside the Grand Canyon, we need to solve a classic Fermi problem. We will need the volume of the Grand Canyon, the volume of an average adult goat, and a mathematical understanding of \"packing efficiency.\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### 1. The Volume of the Grand Canyon\nAccording to the National Park Service, the estimated volume of the Grand Canyon is **4.17 trillion cubic meters** ($4.17 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ m}^3$).\n\n### 2. The Volume of an Average Adult Goat\nTo find the volume of a goat, we use its mass and density.\n* **Mass:** Goat breeds vary wildly in size, from tiny pygmies to massive Boer goats. A standard adult goat (like an Alpine or average meat goat) weighs about **70 kilograms** (154 lbs). \n* **Density:** Mammals are mostly water, meaning our density is roughly the same as water: 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter ($1 \\text{ kg} = 1 \\text{ Liter}$). \n* **Volume:** At 70 kg, the physical volume of the matter making up a goat is **0.07 cubic meters** (70 Liters). \n\n### 3. The Packing Efficiency\nThe prompt specifies packing them \"as efficiently as possible.\" There are two ways to interpret this, which gives us two different answers.\n\n**Scenario A: The \"Tetris\" Method (Intact Goats)**\nIf we want the goats to remain intact, we have to account for the fact that goats are awkwardly shaped. Even if they tuck their legs in and lower their heads, they are not perfect cubes. In mathematics, the packing fraction of irregular, roughly cylindrical/ellipsoid objects is usually around **70% to 75%**. This means 25% to 30% of the Canyon will be empty air between the goats.\n* Effective volume taken up by one packed goat = $0.07 \\text{ m}^3 / 0.75 = \\mathbf{0.093 \\text{ m}^3}$\n\n**Scenario B: The \"Fluid\" Method (100% Efficiency)**\nIf we interpret \"efficiently as possible\" under the laws of extreme gravity at the bottom of a canyon, the sheer weight of trillions of goats would crush the ones at the bottom into a dense biological fluid, filling every crack and crevice with 100% efficiency. \n* Volume taken up by one goat = $\\mathbf{0.07 \\text{ m}^3}$\n\n### 4. The Grand Calculation\n\n**If kept physically intact (Tetris Method):**\n$4.17 \\text{ trillion m}^3 \\div 0.093 \\text{ m}^3$ per goat = **44.8 trillion goats.**\n\n**If compressed perfectly (Fluid Method):**\n$4.17 \\text{ trillion m}^3 \\div 0.07 \\text{ m}^3$ per goat = **59.5 trillion goats.**\n\n### Conclusion\nDepending on how strict you are about the structural integrity of a goat, you could fit between **44.8 trillion and 59.5 trillion adult goats** into the Grand Canyon.\n\nTo put that scale into perspective: The current global population of goats is roughly 1 billion. You would need to multiply every single goat on Earth by about **50,000** just to fill the Grand Canyon to the rim.",

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+ (or, perhaps, Pro 2.5-), elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

Sonnet 4.5 is dumber (or, better worded, not as brilliant), but it actually respects constraints and doesn't make stuff up. \n\n\nOkay,so it's Gemini is a Ferrari with cut brake lines that was just released too early; Claude is a Volvo or a Toyota Corolla.

That will be way better, like it should be, around Gemini 2.5 Pro level of intelligence to be usable. I saw on a podcast Demis saying, \"We found a training method that drastically improved Gemini 3.0 Flash performance, so much better, it's almost close to Gemini 3.0 Pro in certain cases.\" So, I'm hoping they will release a Gemini Flash Lite version. I will love this model if they focus on speed, intelligence, and pricing. If all of that happens, then I will tell you most things, like chat apps will have it as the default model because it will open a lot of possibilities while being cheap.",

I expect it to be strong just like 3.0 but when it hallucinates files that don’t exist, thinks through bugs and makes terrible assumptions (“I understand now, the component is being rendered in the server” - literally impossible) unless it had a score of 95%, and even then, the percentage it doesn’t get right isn’t just wrong but disastrous",
