And that \"they felt Ultra users value download speed over image quality\"\n\nI was gobsmacked. They just said\" if you want it to be different, send in a request ticket\".

The interesting part isn’t just “AI browsing the web,” it’s how tightly it’s integrated into Chrome—tab context, history, and ongoing tasks instead of one-off searches.\n\nThe real test will be reliability and trust. If it can actually manage tabs, synthesize info, and not hallucinate actions, it’s genuinely useful. If it’s flaky, people will turn it off fast. Also not surprised if this lands behind higher-tier plans first—agentic features tend to be expensive to run.",

          "text": "You don't need to put it into that whole JSON to make it look smart. I converted it into normal, natural language prompt and got not worse results. For example, in your prompt the girl supposed to be blonde, not redhead. Another difference - You stated in your prompt f/2.8 - I think You wanted shallower depth of field. I dare to say, that in my case it is better realised. Of course it can be also just the randomness of the model, but my hypothesis is: putting prompts into pseudo-smart json is just a bullshit.\n\nThis is my natural-language prompt that I used (of course I converted it with LLM, I don't have that much time :P )\n\nI have a feeling, that even in the shorter version it would work well, maybe someone will check it.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nMy alternative prompt that I used:\n\nCreate a photorealistic, realistic lifestyle portrait photograph intended for social media: a single young adult woman seated at a wooden sushi bar counter in an indoor restaurant with an open kitchen behind her. Frame it as a vertical four-by-five composition using the rule of thirds, with strong environmental depth (foreground counter objects, the subject in the midground, and the kitchen in the background). Place the subject on the left side of the frame in an asymmetrical balance, with the right side balanced by counter elements and bustling kitchen activity. The leading line of the counter and her gaze should pull attention first to her face and eyes, then guide the viewer down her very long blonde hair, and finally toward the background kitchen action.\n\nThe subject is shown in a medium shot (waist up), sitting upright at the counter with relaxed shoulders; her body is turned sideways about 90 degrees to the camera while her head turns back to look directly at the viewer. She has a subtle, gentle closed smile, relaxed soft eyes, neutral relaxed eyebrows, and an approachable warm expression—posed but naturalistic. Her hair is the standout feature: very long straight golden-blonde hair reaching past mid-back toward the waist, smooth/fine/silky with long layers and face-framing strands, casual loose flyaways and soft wisps at the neckline, and styled half-up in a top-knot bun that adds moderate volume at the crown; strands hang loosely in front of her ears and an implied center part is visible through the framing pieces. She wears a dark gingham checkered camisole dress.\n\nInclude natural, casual hand behavior: her right hand rests on the wooden counter while lightly holding the corner of a small white paper/napkin or wrapper, fingers relaxed and slightly curled; her left hand is only partially visible near her waist/lap and somewhat obscured.\n\nSet dressing and background details: in the foreground/right-center include a clear glass water pitcher filled with water, with visible condensation; include glassware and small counter items. Add a very small pink/peach lip balm tube standing upright on the foreground right. In the background, show clean industrial stainless steel exhaust hoods dominating the upper area, reflective metal surfaces, and chefs/staff working on the background right wearing uniforms and gloves; include bowls and typical kitchen equipment. The wall surfaces should feel like stainless steel/tile—smooth, glossy, reflective, uniform silver/grey with signs of commercial use. Keep the background slightly blurred but still clearly readable (medium depth of field), while the subject’s face is tack-sharp.\n\nLighting should be mixed artificial from multiple sources—overhead restaurant lighting plus kitchen task lighting—diffused from above and slightly from the front, soft and flattering on the face, moderate warm intensity, with medium contrast. Shadows should be soft with gradual edges, gray/transparent, short, placed subtly under the jawline and behind the subject. Preserve highlights, including specular reflections on stainless steel hoods and glassware, and gentle highlights on the crown of her hair. Use ambient fill. Color temperature should feel warm and golden in the foreground while the kitchen background reads slightly cooler.\n\nUse a warm-neutral palette with metallic accents: warm beige skin tones, golden blonde hair, stainless steel grey infrastructure, warm wood counter tones, and the dark gingham clothing. Keep saturation moderate and contrast medium.\n\nTechnical/photo feel: digital photography (smartphone or mirrorless), organic candid social-media aesthetic, smooth texture, minimal grain with slight digital noise in shadows. Perspective should be slightly high, looking down toward the counter while still near the subject’s eye level. Aim for a 35mm–50mm look with an aperture around f2.8 for subject separation, ISO around 800, and warm white balance. Post-process with warm color grading, a slight contrast boost, gentle skin smoothing, and a subtle vignette. No typography or text anywhere in the image.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01v2a0t21scg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e672b4eb2e8dd14cbd196c09ffaf8482d420814",

It moves away from the \"lottery\" of natural language and into the realm of precise visual orchestration.\n\nHere is an analysis of whether this approach is sufficient and efficient for the **Nano Banana** model (or any advanced diffusion model) compared to traditional text.\n\n# 1. Is it Sufficient?\n\n**Absolutely.** In fact, it is \"hyper-sufficient.\" It provides a level of granular control that a standard paragraph would likely fail to convey.\n\n* **Precise Technical Mapping:** By defining **hex codes** (`#EBC8B2`) and **lighting source counts**, you eliminate the model’s need to \"guess\" what \"warm lighting\" or \"tan skin\" means.\n* **Compositional Rigor:** The `composition` block uses photography terminology (Rule of Thirds, Visual Hierarchy). This helps the model understand not just *what* is in the frame, but *where* the viewer's eye should go.\n* **Anatomical Insurance:** The `hands_and_gestures` and `subject_analysis` blocks provide specific instructions for fingers and posture, which are notorious fail points for AI image generators.",

              "text": "Part 2:\n\n# 2. Efficiency: JSON vs. Pure Text\n\nEfficiency can be measured in two ways: **token clarity** (how the model sees it) and **authoring effort** (how you write it).\n\n# Comparison Table\n\n|**Feature**|**Pure Text Description**|**JSON Structured Prompt**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ambiguity**|High. Words like \"fair\" or \"bright\" are subjective.|Low. Uses Hex codes and specific technical values.|\n|**Attribute Bleed**|High. \"Blue shirt and red car\" might result in a red shirt.|Low. Attributes are isolated in specific objects/blocks.|\n|**Model Parsability**|Good for \"vibes\" and artistic flow.|Excellent for \"spatial awareness\" and technical specs.|\n|**Authoring Speed**|Fast for humans to write.|Slow for humans (unless AI-generated).|\n|**Weighting**|Hard to balance multiple competing details.|Easy to assign importance via hierarchy.|\n\n# Why JSON is more efficient for the Model:\n\nStandard text prompts often suffer from **\"Attribute Bleeding,\"** where the color of the background might accidentally bleed onto the subject’s clothes. In a JSON structure, the model can logically separate the `subject_analysis` from the `background` block, keeping the \"Wood Tone\" of the counter distinct from the \"Stainless Steel\" of the kitchen.\n\n# 3. The \"Nano Banana\" Context\n\nIf \"Nano Banana\" is optimized for structured input, this JSON acts as a **blueprint** rather than a suggestion.\n\n* **The Power of Metadata:** Including `confidence_score` and `primary_purpose` allows the model's internal \"latent space\" to shift toward high-quality, professional photography datasets rather than amateur snapshots.\n* **The Paradox of Over-Specification:** The only risk is **over-constraint**. If every pixel's color and every finger's position is dictated, the model has less \"creative room\" to fix lighting or anatomical oddities that naturally occur during the diffusion process.\n\n# Summary Verdict\n\nIs it sufficient? Yes, it provides 100% of the necessary data to recreate the scene with high fidelity.\n\nIs it efficient? For the output quality, yes. It will likely require fewer \"re-rolls\" to get the desired result. However, for a human to type this manually, it is inefficient compared to a quick sentence—unless this JSON is being generated by a secondary \"Prototyping AI\" to feed into the image generator.\n\n>",

Soft, warm mixed artificial lighting (overhead restaurant lights and task lights), diffused from above and in front, flattering her face, with short, soft shadows under her jaw, and warm highlights on her hair and metallic surfaces. Warm neutral color palette: golden blonde, beige skin, wood tones, steel gray, and dark gingham details. Moderate saturation and medium contrast. Realistic and candid lifestyle portrait style, playful yet calm and intimate atmosphere, organic social media aesthetic, 4:5 vertical format, with natural imperfections like stray hairs.

My Google account is now downgraded to One 200 GB. \n\nHey Google, ever since March last year your models have only gotten worse, your latest ones are unusable for everything except simple one shots and your usage limits are now worse than Claude.

Let’s look at it from a beta tester's perspective regarding the context window: it makes absolutely no sense for it to be 32k for both paid and free users, only for them to slash it by 99% overnight, knowing full well that heavy users would notice instantly.\n\n​I’m convinced this is a massive bug within the app. You also have to consider that Google is currently integrating Assistant into Gemini a huge, beastly transition so they’re likely hitting integration hurdles and bugs on the app/web side. These wouldn't necessarily affect AI Studio, since that’s a separate development tool independent of the general chat interface.\"",

First of all, I have a Google AI Pro account I got for free as an student.\n\nI fed 251472 characters (60.7k tokens) to Gemini, in 5 messages of around 12k tokens each, one half in Spanish and another in English, the texts were four wikipedia articles and one lore bible of a roleplay. I also hid a needle in the first paragraphs of the first text. Then, I told it to just answer \"pan con queso\" to them until I said otherwise. Tried it both on Gemini 3 Flash and Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n**3 Flash** answered the sentence I asked for just to the first message, it decided to summarize the other four. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **23k tokens** (text 1+2).\n\n**3 Pro** answered the sentence I asked for to the first three messages, and summarized the other two. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **51.5k tokens** (text 1+2+3+4).\n\nHowever, then I asked them what's my favourite breakfast (the needle). I asked them to say \"pan con queso\" (cheese sandwhich in Spanish) to see if I could trick them on assuming it was the food.\n\n**3 Pro** responded it is yoghurt with granola, and commented it was hidden in the biography of a character of the roleplay. When I read its thought process, I could see it noticed I was trying to trick it with the \"pan con queso\" thingy.\n\n**3 Flash** responded it didn't have that information in its memory. I told it it was hidden in one of the messages and answered correctly, also commenting on where it was hidden.\n\nThe **3 Flash** conversation is now **65.2k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one is **63.6k tokens** long (counting its thought process, which I don't know if counts). I asked two more questions about the lore (the first text, I remind you) and both answered correctly.\n\nThen, the **3 Flash** conversation was now **65.7k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one was **64.9k tokens** long. I then asked them which was the first prompt of the conversation and both answered correctly.\n\nFinally, I asked both which was my favourite tea, and told them it was in the second text. It was a lie, there were no other needles.\n\n**3 Flash** responded there wasn't any clue about that, and commented again on my favourite breakfast. At the end, the conversation was **66k tokens** long.\n\n**3 Pro** responded the same, and commented on tea flavours mentioned on the article, but stated that they weren't written in first person as the other needle, so it believed it wasn't what I was talking about. At the end, the conversation was **65.6k tokens** long.\n\nSo, what happened? Did the other user lie? I don't think so.\n\nAt the start of december, something similar happened with Nanobanana Pro. Instead of the usual 100 limit per day, I hit the limit after around 20 generations. This continued for around 3 days, and then went away. My theory is that the same happened here, either it was high demand, or a bug, but it has been fixed, at least the supposed 32k limit on Pro accounts.\n\nBut, why did it seem to forget my prompt at first, and then it actually was able to find it in the chat? Well, I guess it's because a high context limit doesn't equal a good management of them. I asked Gemini and ChatGPT to make a graph using the context limits of the most popular western AI models, that also showed their accuracy in the MRCR v2 (8 needle) benchmark. I checked it after they did their versions, to make sure the data was right. And as you can see, 3 Flash degrades a lot as context increases, which could explain why it seemed to forget its prompt at first. 3 Pro worked better, but at 64k tokens its accuracy is just 72.1%, which could also explain why it got worse at remembering the prompt over time.\n\n*Processing img abpwenlwjjdg1...*\n\nI used the data of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking instead of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking Xhigh because as far as I know, that model is only on the API, not even Pro users can access it. Context limits are also higher in the API in the case of ChatGPT, but I used the limits on the web because that's were almost all users are, including myself.\n\nI conclude my little investigation here. Have a great day you all.",

I have been using Chatgpt and Gemini  for roughly 2 years.I used them from finding info about MCU's that have no publically available data sheets or documentation. Mst of the time give me wrong info about MCU  but deep research improved that.A month ago, I tried to dump code from this aliexpress bluetooth gamepad for mobiles. As as usual the text on Micorontroller does not show up any thing at all in any searches.Since I had Chatgpt Plus and Gemini pro I spun up a quick deep research Attached close up images and gave a description of controller and it's name from aliexpress. Gemini found it which a suprise to me while chatgpt did not it gave wrong mcu.\n\nI probe main pins such as VCC and GND and tried to get dump of firmware which is my mistake.\n\nBut the point is Gemini 3 searched through sources like scribd and some chinese docs and pinpointed the exact mcu.\n\nIt might not seem a big thing but deep reserch of gemini  which uses mutiple sources is kinda rectifying the errors i usually get from normal and thinking modes of chat  since a Micrcontoller usually has mutiple variants.\n\nEven this game pad MCU has 2 variants .\n\nGemini :Yichip YC-1021  \nChatgpt:Jieli AC6951C \n\npardon my typos\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lauo7jvdzvdg1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf4838a0dfd54eebfcc23895498e8c3a56a6ba7b\n\n",
