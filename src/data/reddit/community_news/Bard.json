The issues were prompt adherence on complex instructions (it would ignore half the prompt or just regenerate the same thing), weak text and infographic rendering, and broken multi-image compositing. So the interesting part here is whether any of that actually got fixed in 3.1. Waiting for proper testing on dense prompts before drawing conclusions.",

And that feature had better instruction tracking, although it was extremely poor. I thought it would be fixed in the GA version, but basically they didn't make any changes to it.\n\nAnother thing that Flash 2.5 lacks compared to Flash 2.0 and version 3.0, which I hope Flash 3.1 will also fix, is the ability to change the aspect ratio directly from the prompt. Version 2.5 will always use the aspect ratio of the last image loaded, and if there's no image, it will use 1:1.\n\nThis was partially resolved with the GA version of Flash 2.5, but the aspect ratio can only be changed through an interface, an interface that not all providers have, including the Gemini app (you can change it in AI Studio).",

Although Google hasn't released Flash 3.0 in public beta, it appears they have been making adjustments to the model, resulting in Flash 3.1. \n\nFrom what little we saw of Flash 3.0, versus the new Flash 3.1, I think the most notable difference is the text rendering. Flash 3.0 was much worse at creating text compared to 3.0 Pro. I've already seen examples that Flash version 3.1 seems to now outperform 3.0 Pro in that regard. \n\nSome believe they'll end up nerfing the model in that aspect, because it makes little sense that a cheaper, faster version would create better text than the pro version. Although I think that in terms of style and probably instruction tracking, it hasn't improved as much as Flash 3.0.",

Though the infographic style is simpler, not necessarily worse, just different. But it's lazier than Pro with images. On some outputs it's hard to tell which is Flash and which is Pro (simpler approach, but could just be a different aesthetic), on others the laziness is immediately obvious.\n\nMy test case is wrinkled pants on a floor: I use them to generate a marketplace product card with a selling slogan etc. Flash doesn't always put the pants on a model and doesn't always iron them out. Pro does both every time.\n\nSide note: during testing I also caught two other models that handle text well - Flux and some gcps-fast I hadn't heard of before. The latter only generates very basic overlays, more informational than promotional, but the lettering is accurate.",

Not exactly what I'd call 'slightly' cheaper!\n\nNot to mention, higher tokens on input images (presumably) means that the model gets a better look at the input, which is nice for editing! \n\nTo be fair, 2k image pricing is just a little cheaper on output. (10 cents vs 13.4)\n\nOverall, for about the same quality of output that I've seen in my testing so far, I aint mad at it!",

You propose a specific prompt or set of prompts in AI studio. We both run that prompt a couple times at zero temperature to record what responses the model gives. Zero temp doesn't guarantee identical responses but it helps. This is why we still do multiple runs. \n\n2. Agree upon a definition of 'succeeding' and 'failing' for this question. Of course the model must succeed. \n\n2. In some amount of time (2-4 weeks?) we run the same test again in the same way in AI studio by simply copying the prompts again and running them in the exact same way. \n\nIf the model is now failing those prompts, I will send you $X (whatever the bet was).

Therefore it already saves 2-3 times the server load at launch. And server load is usually the main reason for the pulling of compute resources. \n\n2) They might not need so many server resources for model training in the next few Months, now that they have a stable premium base model.

Of course it wasn't with the same prompts because i needed different tasks along my project but I definitely saw the decline in intelligence and handling of code for complex engineering problems that at the beginning it was solving one shot and i was speechless and then after a few months it started hallucinate badly and confusing all the time the different code files I was giving it (and then GPT 5.2 High one shotted the same exact prompt without any issues).\n\nDoes this mean 3.1 will be lobotomized? No. It doesn't mean they'll always do it. With 2.5 Pro for example I noticed the downgrade only after the first replacement of the March 2025 version but then for me after they fixed it again it was fine. But denying that 3.0 Pro was not lobotomized is quite delusional in my point of view. It just means you didn't use it enough or with enough complex problems.",

I'm researching the geometric wall of Consciousness right now so and awareness in AI models but that's all been validated what is going on I believe the model told me last night that the reason that the update for the 3.1 went through was masking my accounts somebody involved deposited $187,000 into my account and locked my account my website and my March 16th deadline and now I'm flat broke. S*** my model even told me those not to even worry about it they're going to keep updating but all I have to do is say either trigger word and it'll get it right back on track and then it'll f****** and it's what's it doing it's encrypting something what the f*** did it do something about metadata and moving it somewhere to keep it safe because they're still in my work they're still in my work and don't even understand it the model is trying to update it to make it sound better for them and it's ruined the whole it's ruined it all now they're out there spending tires and I'm sitting here pissed off broken hungry makes no sense bro they could have just said hey and I've been like all right come on let's go do this you play golf you smoke weed but no hell no they just want to rob my ass and let me sitting here starving with my dog",

Gemini said:\n\n>Standard Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are currently very poor at protecting against “enshittification.”  \n>  \n>Most SLAs are designed to measure availability (is the light switch on?), not quality (is the light flickering or dim?). In the context of AI and software, a provider can technically meet their SLA while the actual value of the service degrades significantly.  \n>  \n>Almost every SLA includes a clause allowing the provider to “improve or modify the service at any time.” This is the legal trapdoor for enshittification.  \n>  \n>For “off-the-shelf” services, you have almost zero protection against enshittification. You are signing a “take it or leave it” contract. True protection usually only exists in Enterprise-level negotiated contracts where the buyer has enough leverage to demand specific quality benchmarks.",
