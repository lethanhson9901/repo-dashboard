Google app 17.2 reveals work on four capabilities, starting with: \n\n>- **Live Thinking Mode:** “Try a version of Gemini Live that takes time to think and provide more detailed responses.”\n\n>- **Live Experimental Features:** “Try our cutting-edge features: multimodal memory, better noise handling, responding when it sees something, and personalized results based on your Google apps.”\n\n>Live today is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Those two Labs suggest that Gemini Live will soon be powered by Gemini 3. Live Thinking Mode could be using either the Thinking or Pro models for its “more detailed responses.”\n\n>Meanwhile, the Live Experimental Features are capabilities offered in the chat experience with Gemini 3 Flash and Pro. This includes Personal Intelligence’s Connected Apps and Past Gemini chats. Better noise cancellation is always needed, while “responding when it sees something” could be a Project Astra capability.\n\n>The other Labs features are:\n\n>- **UI Control:** “Agent controls phone to complete tasks”\n\n>- **Deep Research:** “Delegate complex research tasks\n\n>We're unsure what the last item is specifically about, but we've long been expecting Gemini Agent to come to Android as part of [Computer Use.](https://9to5google.com/2026/01/15/android-16-qpr3-screen-automation/)",

      "text": "GEMINI's VOICE TRANSCRIPTION IS SO GARBAAAAGE\n\nAm i the only one who feels this? it almost doesnt even work. its bizarre how they have an amazing free voice to voice model, yet their voice transcription is completely garbage.\n\nHey google, openai stole your transformers architecture, nobody will mind if you steal whisper to use for your model. Please ffs.\n\nNot only does it get what i say wrong, on top of that, it will randomly decide you're done speaking and immediately send the query to the model. Can i please think for a second??\n\nEven the google keyboard stt on android is better somehow than this.\n\nIt's bizarre because google has had free voice transcription before any company, yet now theyre behind openai on it?\n\nChatgpt's whisper is amazing, seriously. The ui is perfect. you click the button, it shows you that its recording now, you speak for as long as you like, be silent and think what you wanna say, and once youre done, even if its 3 minutes later, it will transcribe it for you. it's literally perfect.\n\nThere have been times when i have used chatgpt to transcribe something and then copy paste that into gemini, just because gemini's transcriber is nowhere close.\n\nPlease google, rather than stealing \"answer now\" button from chatgpt, steal this instead!",

It can't understand the whole context to fix the text you want to say. Like in Mandarin, 'muscle' and 'chicken' sound the same, so it’s a total toss-up for Gemini. Same goes for 'service' versus 'surface' in English, it just mixes them up because they sound too similar.",

You can’t even mix different languages without it breaking. It completely ruins that seamless, intuitive experience.",

I have been using Chatgpt and Gemini  for roughly 2 years.I used them from finding info about MCU's that have no publically available data sheets or documentation. Mst of the time give me wrong info about MCU  but deep research improved that.A month ago, I tried to dump code from this aliexpress bluetooth gamepad for mobiles. As as usual the text on Micorontroller does not show up any thing at all in any searches.Since I had Chatgpt Plus and Gemini pro I spun up a quick deep research Attached close up images and gave a description of controller and it's name from aliexpress. Gemini found it which a suprise to me while chatgpt did not it gave wrong mcu.\n\nI probe main pins such as VCC and GND and tried to get dump of firmware which is my mistake.\n\nBut the point is Gemini 3 searched through sources like scribd and some chinese docs and pinpointed the exact mcu.\n\nIt might not seem a big thing but deep reserch of gemini  which uses mutiple sources is kinda rectifying the errors i usually get from normal and thinking modes of chat  since a Micrcontoller usually has mutiple variants.\n\nEven this game pad MCU has 2 variants .\n\nGemini :Yichip YC-1021  \nChatgpt:Jieli AC6951C \n\npardon my typos\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lauo7jvdzvdg1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf4838a0dfd54eebfcc23895498e8c3a56a6ba7b\n\n",

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down:  \n[**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

      "text": "[A couple of days ago, we got this post stating that the context window got reduced to 32k.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1q6viir/testing_gemini_30_pros_actual_context_window_in/) However, I have not been able to replicate these results. First of all, I have a Google AI Pro account I got for free as an student.\n\nI fed 251472 characters (60.7k tokens) to Gemini, in 5 messages of around 12k tokens each, one half in Spanish and another in English, the texts were four wikipedia articles and one lore bible of a roleplay. I also hid a needle in the first paragraphs of the first text. Then, I told it to just answer \"pan con queso\" to them until I said otherwise. Tried it both on Gemini 3 Flash and Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n**3 Flash** answered the sentence I asked for just to the first message, it decided to summarize the other four. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **23k tokens** (text 1+2).\n\n**3 Pro** answered the sentence I asked for to the first three messages, and summarized the other two. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **51.5k tokens** (text 1+2+3+4).\n\nHowever, then I asked them what's my favourite breakfast (the needle). I asked them to say \"pan con queso\" (cheese sandwhich in Spanish) to see if I could trick them on assuming it was the food.\n\n**3 Pro** responded it is yoghurt with granola, and commented it was hidden in the biography of a character of the roleplay. When I read its thought process, I could see it noticed I was trying to trick it with the \"pan con queso\" thingy.\n\n**3 Flash** responded it didn't have that information in its memory. I told it it was hidden in one of the messages and answered correctly, also commenting on where it was hidden.\n\nThe **3 Flash** conversation is now **65.2k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one is **63.6k tokens** long (counting its thought process, which I don't know if counts). I asked two more questions about the lore (the first text, I remind you) and both answered correctly.\n\nThen, the **3 Flash** conversation was now **65.7k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one was **64.9k tokens** long. I then asked them which was the first prompt of the conversation and both answered correctly.\n\nFinally, I asked both which was my favourite tea, and told them it was in the second text. It was a lie, there were no other needles.\n\n**3 Flash** responded there wasn't any clue about that, and commented again on my favourite breakfast. At the end, the conversation was **66k tokens** long.\n\n**3 Pro** responded the same, and commented on tea flavours mentioned on the article, but stated that they weren't written in first person as the other needle, so it believed it wasn't what I was talking about. At the end, the conversation was **65.6k tokens** long.\n\nSo, what happened? Did the other user lie? I don't think so.\n\nAt the start of december, something similar happened with Nanobanana Pro. Instead of the usual 100 limit per day, I hit the limit after around 20 generations. This continued for around 3 days, and then went away. My theory is that the same happened here, either it was high demand, or a bug, but it has been fixed, at least the supposed 32k limit on Pro accounts.\n\nBut, why did it seem to forget my prompt at first, and then it actually was able to find it in the chat? Well, I guess it's because a high context limit doesn't equal a good management of them. I asked Gemini and ChatGPT to make a graph using the context limits of the most popular western AI models, that also showed their accuracy in the MRCR v2 (8 needle) benchmark. I checked it after they did their versions, to make sure the data was right. And as you can see, 3 Flash degrades a lot as context increases, which could explain why it seemed to forget its prompt at first. 3 Pro worked better, but at 64k tokens its accuracy is just 72.1%, which could also explain why it got worse at remembering the prompt over time.\n\n*Processing img abpwenlwjjdg1...*\n\nI used the data of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking instead of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking Xhigh because as far as I know, that model is only on the API, not even Pro users can access it. Context limits are also higher in the API in the case of ChatGPT, but I used the limits on the web because that's were almost all users are, including myself.\n\nI conclude my little investigation here. Have a great day you all.",

      "text": "This post is specifically about the \"laziness\" of 3.0. Or the quantization, or whatever you wanna call it. And tests are involved btw. Not just opinions. And this is not AI-written.\n\nI'm an author who uses Gemini / ChatGPT for almost every step in the writing process except the writing itself. More details on that are in my profile posts, but suffice it to say that AI saves me a lot of time and money. A whole lot. Need a decent cover without spending $$$? Banana Pro image output at 4k, some photoshop edits, and then the cover text itself added in Canva. It's funny how mad the writing subreddit users are when I say I use AI for my covers, and then, when I DM them the results, they're like... holy shit. That looks more professional than my $350 cover!\n\nYeah. Ya'll sleeping on how fast these image generators are progressing.\n\nSorry, got off track there. Anyway, you need to look up specific historical details and don't want to spend an hour doing so? Ask AI to do the research for you and give you a full outline. Want to make sure that you used the appropriate terminology for a government facility? AI. (again, you can just google these things, but usually the question is more specific, and AI is great at combining lots of sources into one.)\n\nLet's get down to business. I loved, truly loved, 2.5 for the writing process. Asking it to give me a detailed outline for virtually any reason caused it to carefully, slowly, search the web, ending up with all kinds of sources. And now... 3.0 is here. It's lazy. Simple as that.\n\nTest one:\n\nI wanted to edit a minor subplot in my fifth book of a series. So, I gave detailed outlines of each proceeding book (almost 40k words in total)  and also gave both Gemini and ChatGPT the exact same prompt. I wanted them to deeply understand the overall plot, check real-world details, etc, and give me ten options for the specific change that I wanted. Told them to cut no corners and read and understand EVERY word.\n\nChatGPT did so almost perfectly. It understood the sci-fi aspects and rules, generally understood the plot as a whole, and gave me ten ideas in an output that was 2.6 k words long.\n\nGemini hallucinated a lot more important details, missed some massive implications, and gave me... 1.1 k words. Oh, and ChatGPT took six minutes to actually look over the document. Gemini took fifteen seconds. Yes, I was using Pro btw. Not flash or thinking. Listen, when I select the \"pro\" model, I hope that the model actually THINKS about what it is doing, you know? Not just spit out a summary in ten seconds. Lazy! And this is how it is for every prompt, too. ChatGPT takes like five times as long to actually do any damn research, Gemini just seems to skim over it and check a couple sources instead of a dozen.\n\nLazy.\n\nTest two:\n\nI wanted to create a cheat sheet of every single character from book two. Same thing; exact same prompts, be detailed, don't miss a word, etc. Uploaded the 82k word long txt file in it's entirety. This time I used Deep Research.\n\nChatGPT gave me a list that was damn near perfect and took thirty minutes, rather than the eight minutes of Gemini, who forgot half of the people. (or got them mixed up, idk.)\n\nTest three:\n\nI asked each to give me a long, super detailed critical beta-testing style review on book one as a whole, rating it 3.5 stars (to keep from gushing over it but also not creating mistakes when there are none), and to make the output as long as possible. Short was bad. Long was good.\n\nChatGPT didn't understand the plot as well as Gemini did this time, so that's one point for 3.0. However, it wasn't that much worse, and you wanna guess what the \"super long\" output was for Gemini? 4.8 k words. That's it! You know how long ChatGPT's was? 26 k words.\n\nThat's literally twenty thousand words longer than Gemini's! What the hell, bro? Really? Gemini's was basically just a summary! Literally shorter than many of my chapters. Come on now. I tried again, making it even clearer that I wanted a LOOOOONG review, no corners cut, and.... Gemini was at 5.2 k words. ChatGPT gave me THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND WORDS!\n\nSorry. I'll quit yelling. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I am NOT a \"Gemini is so much worse than ChatGPT, haha\" spammer. If you look over my profile posts, you'll see where I said, on multiple occasions, that 2.5 was better in general at... well, things in general. But, although I think 3.0 is better at coding, making photos, searching videos, and being less censored overall than ChatGPT, it simply isn't the \"best\" overall anymore. At least not for my use cases. AND FIX THE DAMN DICTATION. ALSO, WHERE ARE THE FOLDERS? WHERE ARE THE-\n\noh. I said I'd quit yelling.\n\nTest four. This morning, I was going over a very dry ebook on how to be a better author.\n\nVery, very, very dry. But useful. So, I extracted the text and gave each chapter to both Gemini and Chatgpt, telling it to break down the chapters (which averaged around 4k words) and give me a easier to understand breakdown that would be 1.2k words per chapter. Oh, and it needed to act as though these breakdowns were written from my fake Professor, a close friend of mine. Easy enough, right?\n\nNow, I will say that Gemini broke it down into easier to understand language than Chatgpt did. But, exactly SEVEN chapters later, it gave up on the \"professor\" persona entirely. ChatGPT did not. Cool, whatever. I reminded it, and it went back into character.\n\nSkip to chapter... hold on. Let me pull up the notes I have so I'M not the one hallucinating. Okay. So, at chapter eleven, I started to notice something was wrong. Even though I told Gemini not to use bullet points, it had started using them. And the outputs were growing shorter and shorter each time. So, I copied ChatGPT's outputs, and checked the word length for all of them. They turned out to be 12,043 words on average. I checked Gemini... yeah. The first two were 1.2k words. Next one was 1.17k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was a big drop, down to just below a thousand words. That drop-off continued, and by chapter 11, it was down to just 847 words.\n\nWhat the hell, Gemini? You can't remember an explicit instruction from twelve prompts ago? Really? Maybe I'm just wearing rose-tinted glasses, but 2.5 would've let me do two entire books before something that major went wrong.\n\nFine. I told it what it was doing wrong, and it fixed the length and the bullet points on the next chapter. But... the professor persona was gone! It defaulted back to a generic chatbot. Sigh.\n\nLong story short, we finished up the Ebook at chapter 27. By then, I only had to warn ChatGPT once about something, and that was because it too slipped into a \"bullet-point\" summary style. But none of the outputs were less than 1.1 k words long, and it never forgot to be the \"professor.\" Gemini, on the other hand, had me warn it SIX TIMES to simply remember the damn instructions!\n\nI'm sorry, but this is pathetic. And the fact that Google has said nothing about it is even more pathetic.",

I have said before that I have a set of around 25 characters, a world (present day earth, non sci fi) which they inhabit, and a backstory. \n\n\nCombined - 4 months of summarised backstory, world rules, character bios, this amounts to about 12,000 tokens (I've test uploaded it to AI Studio to count) \n\n\nGemini 3 Pro via the Gemini App or Web UI, is ignoring major points from the very first response. Hallucinations based on a jumble of data that does exist in the document, but is not connected to the question at hand. \n\n\nIf I ask for a projected beat sheet to cover a projected week it's immediately ignoring the backstory, disregarding character personas, and totally dismissing the ruleset that applies to the world/environment. \n\n\nPlot holes that make it clear it has absolutely not \"read\" the full document. \n\n\nFor context, my support document is basically broken up into: \n\n\n----\n\n\nSection - Backstory\nW1\nW2\nW3\nW4\nW5\nW6\netc\n\n\nSection - Characters\nCharacter 1\nCharacter 2\netc\n\n\nSection - Company\nBuilding layout\nCompany purpose and structure \nInternal culture\nCommunication style \nBranding\n\n\n----\n\n\nI've experimented with this as one long document, separate documents, different file formats - the result is unchanged. \n\n\nWhen starting a new chat, I tell it to analyse the back story and cast, look for unresolved plot lines, underutilized characters, suggest potential new beats involving daily events that might occur with people who work in a company in this line of business. \n\n\n2.5 was very good at this, even down to spotting conflicts or inconsistencies in historical events. \n\n\n3.0 just cannot do it with any degree of reliability.\n\n\nOne of they things about my setting is that, whilst it's a high performance company, people are collaborative, \"nice\", high performing teams, they want to do an awesome job. It's designed to mirror a startup I worked for a few years back. This is all very explicit in the source material I provide.\n\n\nIn the first response I'm getting pure Devil Wears Prada - \"My office. Now\", bullying, humiliation, \"get this done by next week or you're finished here\", surveillance, tracking etc. \n\n\nWhen I query Gemini about where did those elements come from, and do they align with my backstory, it says that no - in fact they are the opposite of what is specified in the material. \n\n\nIt's, to put it bluntly, lazy - like you say. It's got the information there at its fingertips, it just doesn't do anything with it.",
