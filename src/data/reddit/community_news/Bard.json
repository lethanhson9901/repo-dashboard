I asked Gemini to do Deep Research on an IT stock which has low market cap. They specialize in mostly server hardware and some backup software. Gemini came back with results that the company has entered a contract with defense sector and has pivoted to making Ordnance in addition to server hardware. It told me defense is more stable and less cyclical like IT so overall it's a good thing. I was SHOCKED. I looked at what went wrong and was shocked again. It found a PDF of a guy who did research on 5 stocks, one of the stocks in the list was the IT company and the other was the ordnance maker. A completely different company with a different name. Yet gemini merged them and gave a combined summary. \n\nChatGPT research was basically perfect and found new info with links too. Don't believe the benchmarks. Believe your eyes.",

After about 20 prompts (suggesting my changes) the game had serious complexity, collisions, bosses, mini bosses, power ups, high scores, levels etc. \n\nI mean, as a mediocre html user, that probably woulda took me weeks or months.  \n\nI've also used it to analyze screenshots in Firefox (ctr+shift+S).\nWhich saves a ton of time trying to figure out where a menu button is hiding, or a setting, undeniably useful when dealing with complicated platforms like Google analytics. \n\nHonestly, it will replace coding as a profession.  That's a given.  And everything runs off code so...well...you get it.",

          "text": "I can't comment as to its coding abilities, but I just canceled Gemini to go back to GPT. Gemini is better than GPT in most respects but it sucks eggs at following instructions. I have pretty specific needs for formatting notes, flash cards, and summaries of lectures and such for my education, and have written clear step-by-step prompts on exactly what I need and how to do it. Gemini almost entirely disregards those instructions, and then when I point out the errors and remind of its prompt, giving further instruction on what I need and how to do it, it gets stuck in these loops where it just keeps making the same exact mistake over and over and over again. It got infuriating! GPT does not perform as well as Gemini in most things, but it is *miles* better at that, and that's the main thing I need it for right now.",

And now they’re gonna mess us up because they’ve decided to drop the limit and now the blind community who don’t have very much money to start off with are gonna struggle even more. If they wanted me to purchase the premium, could they not bring it down from $30 to maybe even $20? Do they think we’re made of money or something? And the worst thing is, all of these tools like viewpoint by nibble nerds community and Vision assistant pro which is a extension for the NVDA screen reader, they only use Gemini. Which means despite them being free, they’re going to start costing a great amount more. Just be aware guys that these tools allow us to do things like solve website captures and read inaccessible documents. Things we couldn’t do without the help of these tools. So maybe they should think about at least giving us some sort of exemption from the limits.",

For example, say, the full 32-bit model takes 160 GB of VRAM (probably more like 210). That means it requires upto a full H200 NVL to run at \\~8-10 tokens per second. According to distributed compute services like [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) or Bittensor (Chutes), the going rate for that is \\~$2.150/hour for a decent datacenter hosted GPU like that, after electricity and cooling costs. One node's capacity for generation at full capacity is \\~36,000 tokens of output an hour. Now, if that one node is serving like 10 users' for 60 requests in that hour, that's over 600 requests. Given the average 10th or 15th request in a conversation has \\~15k input tokens and \\~500 output tokens, nearly the entire node is occupied. In that hour, if the request is to be fulfilled for every user at a reasonable speed, say, 8 GPUs like that are needed. So, the per-hour cost is \\~$17.2/hour, and each individual request's cost is nearly (as the total tokens generated are 300,000 tokens and it costs $22), around, well... it's not pretty.  \nNot to mention the development costs which need to be recouped, which run into the billions.",

But it got flagged by a staff, lol?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mclh7b0yrfgg1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d269676303633be6e3761b7a565f3924f6204dd0\n\nWonder why lol. Smh, can't even dare mention the new rate limits\n\nEDIT: In terms of Logan being silent, it was more so in regards to the newest changes. Also on the forum primarily, considering the recent silence on that end.  \nAlso, I was saying that more as an addition or the reasoning for why I was checking the forums in the first place. A bit of resentment and all, coming across this thread and feeling like I should mention that, \"they're 10 now\".  \nIt being deleted is just what made it funny for me lol.

After a short wait it creates a thumbnail, then the world, and you can explore with basic controls (WASD, jump, camera keys). Each world is limited to 60 seconds, runs at about 720p and ~24fps.\n\n**The fun part:** Making bad Nintendo-like knockoffs. He generated Mario/Metroid/Zelda-style worlds and the results were funny and surprisingly recognizable. Though the tool was inconsistent about what it allowed, sometimes blocking prompts and later refusing certain Mario generations citing “third-party interests.”\n\n**Core experience / “game” quality:** As a game, it wasn’t great. There’s often nothing to do besides moving around. No objectives or goals, no scores, nothing to strive for. No sound. \n\n**Each world has a hard 60-second limit, and once that time runs out the session just ends. You can’t keep playing the same world or wander around indefinitely exploring. You get your minute and that’s it. This contributes to these being pretty poor interactive experiences.**\n\n**Performance and responsiveness:** Frustrating input lag, worse than what he sometimes gets in cloud gaming. The lag makes the worlds basically unplayable. He notes it could partly be bad office Wi-Fi, but he still experienced lag even closer to the router.\n\n**World consistency / memory problems:** In “Rollerball,” Genie forgot to show paint streaks where he had rolled before. Sometimes the ball randomly stopped laying down paint at all. This made him distrust the model’s ability to recall what he had already seen. In “Backyard Racetrack,” part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass near the end, hurting immersion. After these issues, he had a general feeling he couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent moment to moment.\n\n**Visual polish:** In the racetrack world, the wheel rims looked janky.\n\n**Controls reliability:** Occasionally he couldn’t control his character at all, only the camera.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even though it’s better than some AI-generated worlds he tried last year, it’s still much worse than a handcrafted game or interactive experience. He doesn’t think people will want to spend extended time jumping into these AI worlds anytime soon. He agrees it’s experimental, but says it needs substantial improvement before the “blurred line between media” vision feels real.",

I know what model I am using, I can edit whatever prompt I feel like, I can edit the response and have it work on that. It does not end every response with that stupid 'would you like' question and for the most part it listens to you when the wind blows east, and I take that as a win. I would pay for it, I just do not trust google with any pay as you go stuff at all, but if the normal web app was like that, it would really be nice. But they will not, since this is google, and they make the most coddling, bizarre, choices. And that is okay since I put my lot with them.

I was using it specifically because of the massive context window, and now I keep running into limits way too fast. It’s basically unusable for what I need.\n\nThe only reason I stuck with Gemini was the 1 million token context window. I work with huge documents and long conversations, and anything under that just doesn’t cut it.\n\nAre there any other LLMs out there right now that actually support something close to a 1M context window?\n\nIs Gemini literally the only game in town for this right now? Or is there some alternative I’m missing?\n\nWould love to hear what other people are using for large-context workloads because this change basically nuked my setup overnight.",

And I know it DID exist because AI Studio used to be very good, now it's not able to follow basic instructions (that worked perfectly before), constantly hallucinates and I constantly get \"content banned\" or the response is cut short on complete SFW request that I have no idea why they are triggering the filter at all. I kind of stopped using AI Studio after I reached my limit on 2.5 pro in under an hour and I didn't receive a single correct response from it, just utter nonsense. Good riddance I guess. Gemini outside the studio is absolutely useless and worse than GPT so I guess it's time to move on somewhere else. If you give me 7 RPD, at least make sure it listens, does what is asked to do, and doesn't throw content banned on harmless stuff.",
