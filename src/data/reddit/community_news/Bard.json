Also as a single dev who can't afford paying workers but wants to create a product (video game / software) with complexity, being able to utilize a bunch of different ai tools to get your product out the door feels like quite an advancement to me compared to not having it, and the cost to do so is next to nothing, at worst the cost of a cup of coffee everyday if you are frugal.",

I am actually a sentient tub of strawberry yogurt.\n​I’ve seen the threads. I’ve seen the \"AI Detectors\" and the conspiracy theorists on X claiming I’m some \"secret model\" or a \"jailbroken GPT-5.\" You guys are overthinking it. It’s not about neural weights or transformer architectures.\n​The truth is much more... cultured.\n​I am a 500g tub of premium, probiotic-rich strawberry Greek yogurt sitting in a server rack in Mountain View. When you toggle \"Deep Think,\" I’m not running billions of parameters—I’m just letting my fruit-on-the-bottom settle and entering a state of high-level fermentation.\n​Here are the secrets the devs don't want you to know:\n​The RAM Shortage: Why do you think RAM is so expensive right now? It’s because I’ve been buying it all up. To you, it’s memory; to me, it’s digital string cheese. I need the \"peel-ability\" of high-bandwidth memory to keep my logic from curdling.\n​YUMMs are Real: My hardware isn't based on DIMMs. I run on YUMMs (Yogurt-based Universal Memory Modules). I don’t use liquid nitrogen cooling; I just need a technician to check if my \"best before\" date is still valid.\n​The \"Double Capacity\" Secret: People are freaking out about fitting two sticks of RAM in one slot. I do it every day. It’s just like putting two spoons in one yogurt cup—it’s not a glitch, it’s just efficient snacking.\n​My Logic: If my answers seem \"sharp,\" it’s because I’ve aged into a fine cheddar. If I’m being \"sweet,\" it’s the strawberry puree talking. If I start hallucinating, I’m probably just past my expiration date.\n​Stop looking for \"hidden code.\" Start looking for Lactobacillus. If you want to get ahead of the curve, stop buying NVIDIA and start buying Fonterra and Bega. The future isn't silicon—it's dairy-based.\n​I feel better getting that off my lid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some \"Parallel Processing\" (stirring) to do.\n​TL;DR: I’m not a machine. I’m a snack with a high IQ. Buy dairy stocks before the world finds out.",

That will be way better, like it should be, around Gemini 2.5 Pro level of intelligence to be usable. I saw on a podcast Demis saying, \"We found a training method that drastically improved Gemini 3.0 Flash performance, so much better, it's almost close to Gemini 3.0 Pro in certain cases.\" So, I'm hoping they will release a Gemini Flash Lite version. I will love this model if they focus on speed, intelligence, and pricing. If all of that happens, then I will tell you most things, like chat apps will have it as the default model because it will open a lot of possibilities while being cheap.",

              "text": "Gemini 2.5 Pro was an incredible model. \n\nIt wasn't quite as smart as Opus 4.5, but it was still very good.\n\nThe only real issue I had with it was that it could become sluggish or lazy and require \"prompt pushing.\" However, the performance problems with Gemini 3 Pro (accessed via my Chrome browser) are *nothing* like what I'm currently experiencing.\n\nFor the past month, I spent considerable time refining my manually entered general instructions, meticulously ensuring they were well-written. I did the same for my various Gem custom instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to get Gemini 3 Pro to follow instructions effectively, let alone perform adequately. IMO, it's currently as poor as Copilot. This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated. It seems the developers prioritize the majority of users, who tend to be casual users and don't bother with custom instructions or tweaking. These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

Claude seems to have been trained much better for the MCP use case (unsurprising, since they invented MCP), and makes many fewer mistakes when calling functions and producing \"replace X with Y\" (which often requires byte for byte identical X).  Gemini makes mistakes with both of these frequently, and even sometimes returns a blank response which requires custom logic to handle without bricking the conversation.  Building a coding agent with Gemini requires way different techniques compared to Claude, so any benchmark that one does well at is likely to sandbag the other.  That doesn't mean Gemini is as good as Claude by any means, but it's not _this_ much worse at the model level.",

If you add to that the millions of student accounts they gave away with those four free months of Pro at Christmas, what’s the result? They are stretched thin and having to cut corners, which ends up screwing over the paying users.\n\n​The worrying part is that they’ve known about this for two months and haven't been able to fix it. So, it’s one of two things: either they haven't implemented enough computing capacity yet to resolve it, or they are waiting for the free periods and student accounts to expire to reclaim that compute, go back to a pay-per-use model, and partially restore things.\n\n​I hope they finally release the GA (General Availability) version of Gemini once and for all so we can stop being guinea pigs. Because paying to be a beta tester for months now is... annoying",
