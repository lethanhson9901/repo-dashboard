I asked Gemini to do Deep Research on an IT stock which has low market cap. They specialize in mostly server hardware and some backup software. Gemini came back with results that the company has entered a contract with defense sector and has pivoted to making Ordnance in addition to server hardware. It told me defense is more stable and less cyclical like IT so overall it's a good thing. I was SHOCKED. I looked at what went wrong and was shocked again. It found a PDF of a guy who did research on 5 stocks, one of the stocks in the list was the IT company and the other was the ordnance maker. A completely different company with a different name. Yet gemini merged them and gave a combined summary. \n\nChatGPT research was basically perfect and found new info with links too. Don't believe the benchmarks. Believe your eyes.",

GPT 5.2 is better than free, duh, but I wasn't getting significantly better results in my use case, and found AI Studio to be more reliable. GPT has big ideas, but sucks at implementing them, imo. The code never seems to work right, and I'm constantly feeding its outputs to gem or claude and they are fixing its errors.\n\nSo, no...I don't think gpt is better than gemini. What is your use case? Maybe it works better for you in your domain.",

Sometimes they give you extra quota but if you’re conducting research notebook LM is a really good alternative, or just use normal Google Gemini. The whole point of AI studio is for organisations and developers to create and  deploy apps and agents etc.  That’s why we have to pay for subscriptions when we want to use AI apps because it cost a lot of money/tokens to use the AI models. I found all this out the hard way when I was experimenting with AI studio to generate images. I thought it would be easier to do multiple images at once like a storyboard. I  generated five images and got charged £20\n\nI highly recommend [galaxy.AI](https://galaxy.ai/?via=B2b-reddit) is $15 a month which is less than that in British pounds. So that you get 15 million tokens and as many different AI models as you can imagine all on one platform it’s incredible. The amount of tokens you’ll use depends on which model you’re using. I haven’t run out yet though I haven’t been using it as much. You can buy extra tokens. \n\nThey have hundreds of different models, for all the purposes you can think of! \n\nThere’s also an affiliate program LOL so make sure you click the link I’ve sent you ha ha!

Most of these tools quietly tighten rate limits when usage spikes or when certain features (like grounding/search) are enabled, even on paid plans. The “Pro” label doesn’t really mean unlimited, it usually just means a higher ceiling that can still move.\n\nWhat makes it feel ridiculous is the lack of transparency. If they clearly said 'X requests per day for this mode', people would plan around it. Instead you hit a wall mid-session and it feels like something broke.\n\nI’ve basically learned to treat these tools as bursty assistants, not something you can lean on continuously all day.

It does not end every response with that stupid 'would you like' question and for the most part it listens to you when the wind blows east, and I take that as a win. I would pay for it, I just do not trust google with any pay as you go stuff at all, but if the normal web app was like that, it would really be nice. But they will not, since this is google, and they make the most coddling, bizarre, choices. And that is okay since I put my lot with them.

After a short wait it creates a thumbnail, then the world, and you can explore with basic controls (WASD, jump, camera keys). Each world is limited to 60 seconds, runs at about 720p and ~24fps.\n\n**The fun part:** Making bad Nintendo-like knockoffs. He generated Mario/Metroid/Zelda-style worlds and the results were funny and surprisingly recognizable. Though the tool was inconsistent about what it allowed, sometimes blocking prompts and later refusing certain Mario generations citing “third-party interests.”\n\n**Core experience / “game” quality:** As a game, it wasn’t great. There’s often nothing to do besides moving around. No objectives or goals, no scores, nothing to strive for. No sound. \n\n**Each world has a hard 60-second limit, and once that time runs out the session just ends. You can’t keep playing the same world or wander around indefinitely exploring. You get your minute and that’s it. This contributes to these being pretty poor interactive experiences.**\n\n**Performance and responsiveness:** Frustrating input lag, worse than what he sometimes gets in cloud gaming. The lag makes the worlds basically unplayable. He notes it could partly be bad office Wi-Fi, but he still experienced lag even closer to the router.\n\n**World consistency / memory problems:** In “Rollerball,” Genie forgot to show paint streaks where he had rolled before. Sometimes the ball randomly stopped laying down paint at all. This made him distrust the model’s ability to recall what he had already seen. In “Backyard Racetrack,” part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass near the end, hurting immersion. After these issues, he had a general feeling he couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent moment to moment.\n\n**Visual polish:** In the racetrack world, the wheel rims looked janky.\n\n**Controls reliability:** Occasionally he couldn’t control his character at all, only the camera.\n\n**Bottom line:** Even though it’s better than some AI-generated worlds he tried last year, it’s still much worse than a handcrafted game or interactive experience. He doesn’t think people will want to spend extended time jumping into these AI worlds anytime soon. He agrees it’s experimental, but says it needs substantial improvement before the “blurred line between media” vision feels real.",

I was using it specifically because of the massive context window, and now I keep running into limits way too fast. It’s basically unusable for what I need.\n\nThe only reason I stuck with Gemini was the 1 million token context window. I work with huge documents and long conversations, and anything under that just doesn’t cut it.\n\nAre there any other LLMs out there right now that actually support something close to a 1M context window?\n\nIs Gemini literally the only game in town for this right now? Or is there some alternative I’m missing?\n\nWould love to hear what other people are using for large-context workloads because this change basically nuked my setup overnight.",

      "text": "I have this very innocent system instructions. I've had it since November or so (10/10 would recommend btw):\n\n> I want responses to be in the writing style of Matt Levine, the Bloomberg columnist. That is entertaining. But don't force it and don't unnecessarily overextend responses. Keep it concise (unless topic warrants complexity)\n\nUp until 10 days ago, all response were clearly in Matt Levine's style. Very entertaining.\n\nBut since ~10 days ago, not only does this get ignored very often - it also consumes most of the model's thinking. The whole thinking is spent wrestling whether it should abide by it or not.\n\nExample from yesterday:\n\nMe: \"Tell me about tempeh\"\n\nGemini (model: \"Thinking\") had this in the chain of thought:\n\n> Considering Tempeh's Why\n>\n> I'm starting a piece on tempeh, channeling my inner Matt Levine for a wry, \"why\" focused, and irreverent take. Headings, bullets, and horizontal rules are the formatting plan. I just need to verify a personalization trigger.\n> \n> Analyzing Personalization Constraints\n>\n> I'm grappling with the personalization rule's implications. The \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like an instruction about how to respond, not what to say, so maybe it's not \"user data.\" Still, the guardrails are strict, and I must adhere to that. I'm carefully considering whether this style preference should be considered a kind of \"user data\". The strictness of the guardrails, plus the note about professional data not influencing lifestyle recommendations, keeps me cautious.\n> \n> Resolving \"User Data\" Dilemma\n> \n> I've hit a wall: defining \"user data.\" My saved writing style is user data, technically. The prompt (\"Tell me about tempeh\") lacks a trigger, so I must deliver a generic response, disregarding the Matt Levine instruction. Ignoring the user's preferred style, however, might annoy them. The \"Master Rule\" demands a generic response. It's the only path forward.\n>\n> Revising Response Delivery\n>\n> I'm now zeroing in on the response. Thinking through typical AI applications, \"user data\" typically means PII or direct personal facts. While the \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like user data, the Master Rule takes precedence. Domain Isolation applies to content preferences, not meta-preferences like writing style. Following the Master Rule will generate the final response.\n> \n> Clarifying the AI Role\n>\n> I'm now carefully unpacking the instructions. The \"authentic, adaptive AI collaborator\" mandate is distinct from the personalization rule. I realize my interpretation of \"user data\" was overly broad. Now, the key is separating the general instructions on being a collaborator from the limitations of user-specific preferences. This means I can offer a professional tone and formatting, while still using my general knowledge. I'm focusing on crafting a response that's clear and witty, but not Matt Levine-specific, unless there's an explicit trigger.\n\nThe whole CoT was spent thinking about whether to abide by it or not. It did not abide by it (still gave me info on tempeh)\n\nThis is very different from 10+ days ago. _Every single_ response abided by my system instructions\n\nFor example, in December, after watching Andor I had this question:\n\nMe: \"What's the difference between jedi and sith\"\n\nModel (Thinking) CoT:\n\n> Synthesizing Levine's Style\n>\n> I'm actively internalizing Matt Levine's writing style. The goal is to capture his insightful yet irreverent tone, specifically the way he highlights absurdities. I'm considering incorporating his \"everything is...\" approach, although it's not the primary focus here. I want to convey complexity with simplicity, like he does.\n>\n> Exploring Star Wars Analogies\n> \n> I've been drawing parallels between Star Wars factions and financial players. The Jedi embody strict compliance, akin to risk-averse officers enforcing regulations with an aversion to change. Conversely, the Sith represent aggressive investors prioritizing power and efficiency, even if it means clashing with established norms. The \"Rule of Two\" exemplifies a cutthroat succession plan. The inherent passion-power dynamic mirrors the intense pursuit of financial gains. It's almost like both are just different ends of the same spectrum.\n>\n> Framing HFT During Crisis\n>\n> I'm now focusing on a more candid portrayal of the high-frequency trading scene during market downturns. The stark contrast between the Jedi and Sith has sharpened my perspective. I see Jedi traders as meticulous, risk-averse, and by-the-book. Conversely, Sith traders prioritize profitability above all else. This distinction is crucial to portraying the core character of the firm, and its culture. I'm structuring these thoughts now with headings to organize key ideas.\n\nIt clarified to write in my preferred style, then spent the rest of the thinking on actually exploring the topic at hand. (which resulted in very entertaining response https://pastebin.com/zsUjn2aE)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nNo conclusion. Just that it's a clear downgrade imo. I gave 1 example, but each conversation I've checked recently battles itself regarding whether to abide by my instructions or not. Probably the fact that it spends 0 time thinking about the topic results in worse quality of responses overall\n\nIf I were to guess, the system prompt changed because they added memories and want to prevent the model from using user information where it's not relevant. I do not have memories turned on, so it's just a shit downgrade",
