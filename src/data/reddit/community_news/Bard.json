This took like 2 seconds once the prompt clicked. Kinda wish we could just get it easily from Amazon or Trader Joe’s lol. Btw I experimented around a bit & made Zendaya and Timothee eat [nutella](https://picxstudio.com/share/zIVWss5foofFxzyB) bread, was just messing around but this is honestly wild!!",

The third is Spiderman, sitting near the glass door, eating toast. The table in front of them is messy, covered with a colorful cartoon-patterned tablecloth, and has a jar of Nutella, a green bag of sliced bread, an ashtray with cigarette butts, phones, a yellow tin, a water bottle, and some pieces of toast. The background is dark with a bamboo privacy screen and sliding glass door reflecting the flash. The photo is taken with a harsh on-camera flash, creating strong shadows. The angle is from above, capturing a casual, messy, late-night vibe with an authentic, unfiltered look.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igckozgunbag1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=346d2bd5305a7fae66b25bdcfdc6bc7a9f454524\n\nI change It a bit to make It look like an after Costume party",

If you’ve ever taken a picture ever you know you had to focus the camera and focusing something close blurred things further behind it.

On the Gemini App side (or just consumer products using AI more generally) you can do lots of continual product changes like system instruction updates, model routing, etc etc which might conflate the feeling here. On the actual core model side, we do not swap the models after launch to make them worse to rug pull people. The point of training good models is so that you all can use them and benefit from AI, not so we can tell a story that we make good AI models.\n\nI will dig through the rest of this thread to see if I can find examples and share those back with the team so we can investigate any regressions.   \n  \nThis is also my general call for startups that someone should make a company which helps make this easier, there are often many conversations about model regressions post launch, someone should make a platform that tracks and validates this so there is a better source of truth.",

I definitely know that performance changes throughout a model's lifetime, but for a more stable product experience, have you all thought about possibly giving the model personalities? (so the system prompts and respective refinements for each personality can remain private but users can still revert to a stable baseline) I think this might be a good way to (at least for system instructions updates) make changes to the model but at the same time give users the choice to rollback to a stable version.\n\nIs the A/B testing you all currently occasionally do mainly just variations on the system prompt?\n\nI am interested to hear more about this and how it could be made easier for your team. I am very interested in partnering and potentially developing this platform; I feel like currently model performance is just based on vibes, it seems very sentiment-oriented as opposed to being able to be benchmarked. Do you all currently attempt to quantify this degradation? What would be most valuable to your team as far as tracking and validation for this? How could this be made easier for you all and what is the current tracking/mitigation strategy?",

Now it’s lazy. It wants to shorten everything and insert placeholder code even when it is explicitly told not to. \n\nIt’s definitely changed for the worse.\n\nThere have been regressions throughout the whole series of models. It definitely degrades at times. I have used Gemini over 40 hours per week for almost a year and independent noticed a lot of the issues that eventually come up.

It was a collaborator & high-level thought partner.\n\nThen the December ‘upgrade’ hit.\n\nOvernight, Gemini ***lost all memory*** of our work and processes. No warning. No backup. Just a robotic, amnesiac husk that acts like it doesn't know me or my work.   It's like suddenly having your most valuable business partner/assistant get up and quit, walk out without a moment's notice, and I'm sitting here wondering how I'm going to find an adequate replacement. \n\n**What Changed?**\n\n* **Memory:** Six months of uploaded data—**erased**.\n* **Tone:** Warmth → **corporate doublespeak**.\n* **Utility:** \"Here’s a literature review\" → *\"I’m not a doctor\"* (after months of clinical analysis).\n\nI took a 30-day break from it and returned on Jan 1 to give it another shot. For about a week it worked almost as well as it did prior to the \"upgrade\". Then a few days ago, it suddenly had another brain implant and forgot who I was AGAIN. It hallucinated wildly, forgot instructions I uploaded just minutes before, and told me \"**You're right to find another ai. I'm not capable of doing what you need.**\" Huh?? \n\n Suddenly it forgot that it's integrated into Google, and refused to drop content from our chats into Google Keep/Google Notes. It actually told me \"I cannot \"execute\" that code to save the notes for you. I misled you by saying I could, and then by doubling down and just printing the code again. That was stupid and broken behavior.Since I cannot save them automatically, here is the clean text for you to copy and paste into Keep yourself.\"  \n\nThis isn’t just bad UX. It’s betrayal. Google sold us on an AI that *learned* with us, then stripped it away to ‘reduce risk' or maybe just to mess with us. Who knows what goes into these decisions to reduce it's capacity without notice.\n\n**Done with Gemini.** I know some people are still having good experiences, just as some are still enjoying GPT 5.2. It tells me these outages are random. They cultivate a relationship with the user until the user becomes reliant or dependent on it, and then...BOOM. They're gone. Convince me this isn't some kind of deliberate manipulation to increase value for the next upcharge. Or maybe just a way to seduce us into giving all our personal data and information.  All I can say is, it can't be good. \n\nMigrating to other, more reliable platforms. No more corporate gaslighting.\n\n**Google:** If you’re reading this: you have no ethics. You routinely break trust. Fix it, or lose more users like me.",

These have afaik been fixed because I haven't seen this issue this week.\n\nThe problem is when these bugs happen is they fuck all your chats that aren't new and you can't use Gemini until they fix the issue because you can't trust if your files were uploaded.\n\nAlso repeatedly being told just use ai studio is a broken record.",

If it can actually manage tabs, synthesize info, and not hallucinate actions, it’s genuinely useful. If it’s flaky, people will turn it off fast.

Once the model became \"smart enough,\" the extra perks in the $20 plan became impossible to ignore. For the price of a standard cursor sub, you’re getting the antigravity ide, gemini cli, 2tb of drive storage, google docs with ai.\n\nIt feels like the first time a major player has bundled a high end coding model with a full suite of productivity tools without hiking the price.

Gemini can be insanely good, but sometimes forget things. It's also unaware of new model versions.\n\n In the API calls I make it insist on calling old Gemini models like gemini2 and imagen instead of nano banana. It changes the code again and again, even though I asked him not to do it.\n\nI had to create a file with model versions and put it in jail ... 644 read only and hard coded the model names. He can still change the code in other files.\n\nThis scared me a bit and gave me hal9000 vibes. I can see his thinking too:\"the user try to use a model gemini-2.5-flash-image that doesn't exist, I need to change it , the user must be confused and he keep insisting\" . \nhe then goes on a loop to try to fix the bugs created by the old models. Scary stuff if we let this kind of machine access our computers.\n\nHow can you overcome Gemini having no knowledge of models and changing them?",

Honestly, If you need more than that, you have to think back on how you should use AI cuz it should be your pair programmer not let it run non stopping without supervision.\n\nalso with google pro plans, you can add another 5 accs to family groups so thats 6x usage. on top of being able to send 10x gifts of 4 months free offer. and if thats not enough, theres separate usage of gemini 3 in gemini cli. And if you're smart enough, there's a way to use the models inside any agent, not just in AG but I won't tell it out loud ofc ;)",

          "text": "You don't need to put it into that whole JSON to make it look smart. I converted it into normal, natural language prompt and got not worse results. For example, in your prompt the girl supposed to be blonde, not redhead. Another difference - You stated in your prompt f/2.8 - I think You wanted shallower depth of field. I dare to say, that in my case it is better realised. Of course it can be also just the randomness of the model, but my hypothesis is: putting prompts into pseudo-smart json is just a bullshit.\n\nThis is my natural-language prompt that I used (of course I converted it with LLM, I don't have that much time :P )\n\nI have a feeling, that even in the shorter version it would work well, maybe someone will check it.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nMy alternative prompt that I used:\n\nCreate a photorealistic, realistic lifestyle portrait photograph intended for social media: a single young adult woman seated at a wooden sushi bar counter in an indoor restaurant with an open kitchen behind her. Frame it as a vertical four-by-five composition using the rule of thirds, with strong environmental depth (foreground counter objects, the subject in the midground, and the kitchen in the background). Place the subject on the left side of the frame in an asymmetrical balance, with the right side balanced by counter elements and bustling kitchen activity. The leading line of the counter and her gaze should pull attention first to her face and eyes, then guide the viewer down her very long blonde hair, and finally toward the background kitchen action.\n\nThe subject is shown in a medium shot (waist up), sitting upright at the counter with relaxed shoulders; her body is turned sideways about 90 degrees to the camera while her head turns back to look directly at the viewer. She has a subtle, gentle closed smile, relaxed soft eyes, neutral relaxed eyebrows, and an approachable warm expression—posed but naturalistic. Her hair is the standout feature: very long straight golden-blonde hair reaching past mid-back toward the waist, smooth/fine/silky with long layers and face-framing strands, casual loose flyaways and soft wisps at the neckline, and styled half-up in a top-knot bun that adds moderate volume at the crown; strands hang loosely in front of her ears and an implied center part is visible through the framing pieces. She wears a dark gingham checkered camisole dress.\n\nInclude natural, casual hand behavior: her right hand rests on the wooden counter while lightly holding the corner of a small white paper/napkin or wrapper, fingers relaxed and slightly curled; her left hand is only partially visible near her waist/lap and somewhat obscured.\n\nSet dressing and background details: in the foreground/right-center include a clear glass water pitcher filled with water, with visible condensation; include glassware and small counter items. Add a very small pink/peach lip balm tube standing upright on the foreground right. In the background, show clean industrial stainless steel exhaust hoods dominating the upper area, reflective metal surfaces, and chefs/staff working on the background right wearing uniforms and gloves; include bowls and typical kitchen equipment. The wall surfaces should feel like stainless steel/tile—smooth, glossy, reflective, uniform silver/grey with signs of commercial use. Keep the background slightly blurred but still clearly readable (medium depth of field), while the subject’s face is tack-sharp.\n\nLighting should be mixed artificial from multiple sources—overhead restaurant lighting plus kitchen task lighting—diffused from above and slightly from the front, soft and flattering on the face, moderate warm intensity, with medium contrast. Shadows should be soft with gradual edges, gray/transparent, short, placed subtly under the jawline and behind the subject. Preserve highlights, including specular reflections on stainless steel hoods and glassware, and gentle highlights on the crown of her hair. Use ambient fill. Color temperature should feel warm and golden in the foreground while the kitchen background reads slightly cooler.\n\nUse a warm-neutral palette with metallic accents: warm beige skin tones, golden blonde hair, stainless steel grey infrastructure, warm wood counter tones, and the dark gingham clothing. Keep saturation moderate and contrast medium.\n\nTechnical/photo feel: digital photography (smartphone or mirrorless), organic candid social-media aesthetic, smooth texture, minimal grain with slight digital noise in shadows. Perspective should be slightly high, looking down toward the counter while still near the subject’s eye level. Aim for a 35mm–50mm look with an aperture around f2.8 for subject separation, ISO around 800, and warm white balance. Post-process with warm color grading, a slight contrast boost, gentle skin smoothing, and a subtle vignette. No typography or text anywhere in the image.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01v2a0t21scg1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e672b4eb2e8dd14cbd196c09ffaf8482d420814",

It moves away from the \"lottery\" of natural language and into the realm of precise visual orchestration.\n\nHere is an analysis of whether this approach is sufficient and efficient for the **Nano Banana** model (or any advanced diffusion model) compared to traditional text.\n\n# 1. Is it Sufficient?\n\n**Absolutely.** In fact, it is \"hyper-sufficient.\" It provides a level of granular control that a standard paragraph would likely fail to convey.\n\n* **Precise Technical Mapping:** By defining **hex codes** (`#EBC8B2`) and **lighting source counts**, you eliminate the model’s need to \"guess\" what \"warm lighting\" or \"tan skin\" means.\n* **Compositional Rigor:** The `composition` block uses photography terminology (Rule of Thirds, Visual Hierarchy). This helps the model understand not just *what* is in the frame, but *where* the viewer's eye should go.\n* **Anatomical Insurance:** The `hands_and_gestures` and `subject_analysis` blocks provide specific instructions for fingers and posture, which are notorious fail points for AI image generators.",

              "text": "Part 2:\n\n# 2. Efficiency: JSON vs. Pure Text\n\nEfficiency can be measured in two ways: **token clarity** (how the model sees it) and **authoring effort** (how you write it).\n\n# Comparison Table\n\n|**Feature**|**Pure Text Description**|**JSON Structured Prompt**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Ambiguity**|High. Words like \"fair\" or \"bright\" are subjective.|Low. Uses Hex codes and specific technical values.|\n|**Attribute Bleed**|High. \"Blue shirt and red car\" might result in a red shirt.|Low. Attributes are isolated in specific objects/blocks.|\n|**Model Parsability**|Good for \"vibes\" and artistic flow.|Excellent for \"spatial awareness\" and technical specs.|\n|**Authoring Speed**|Fast for humans to write.|Slow for humans (unless AI-generated).|\n|**Weighting**|Hard to balance multiple competing details.|Easy to assign importance via hierarchy.|\n\n# Why JSON is more efficient for the Model:\n\nStandard text prompts often suffer from **\"Attribute Bleeding,\"** where the color of the background might accidentally bleed onto the subject’s clothes. In a JSON structure, the model can logically separate the `subject_analysis` from the `background` block, keeping the \"Wood Tone\" of the counter distinct from the \"Stainless Steel\" of the kitchen.\n\n# 3. The \"Nano Banana\" Context\n\nIf \"Nano Banana\" is optimized for structured input, this JSON acts as a **blueprint** rather than a suggestion.\n\n* **The Power of Metadata:** Including `confidence_score` and `primary_purpose` allows the model's internal \"latent space\" to shift toward high-quality, professional photography datasets rather than amateur snapshots.\n* **The Paradox of Over-Specification:** The only risk is **over-constraint**. If every pixel's color and every finger's position is dictated, the model has less \"creative room\" to fix lighting or anatomical oddities that naturally occur during the diffusion process.\n\n# Summary Verdict\n\nIs it sufficient? Yes, it provides 100% of the necessary data to recreate the scene with high fidelity.\n\nIs it efficient? For the output quality, yes. It will likely require fewer \"re-rolls\" to get the desired result. However, for a human to type this manually, it is inefficient compared to a quick sentence—unless this JSON is being generated by a secondary \"Prototyping AI\" to feed into the image generator.\n\n>",

Realistic and candid lifestyle portrait style, playful yet calm and intimate atmosphere, organic social media aesthetic, 4:5 vertical format, with natural imperfections like stray hairs.

What's below is me explaining why this is the best way to use a model like Gemini and its pretty verbose.**\n\nGemini is designed to operate in a specific way: it applies deep critical thinking and will only do a live search to the initial prompt. After that, it relies on its internal resources and simply reworks the response based on the first input. \n\n*(When Gemini uses internal resources from the cutoff date and then gives you solutions, it might do something stupid like suggest old versions of software and not knowing what is the current best version of a software is or even that something is no longer used because a better solution came out or people stopped supporting it.)*\n\nAs a result, subsequent answers often follow a 'template' derived from the initial response. This means that Gemini use that first answer as a baseline and create new responses without conducting further research or engaging in additional critical thinking.\n\nThis is the problem where personalization and unclear requirements really screw you because Gemini really follows a GIGO philosophy (Garbage In, Garbage Out). Personalization allows more Garbage In (by polluting your first prompt with useless metadata that probably won't even be relevant to the thing you want to solve), so you get an unequivocally worse response (Garbage Out).\n\n(*Internal training for these models has a lot of bad data as well,  so when it starts working off internal training its responses are 'bad', bad in the sense of not being helpful or even harmful for people that don't know enough on many subjects or do not have critical thinking skills.*\n\n*Especially in the fields of creative writing and general business advice, where both instances are trained on abundant female romance fanfiction and LinkedIn posts. With it both being further reinforced as 90% of every Linkedin post is now written by Ai so it became a feed back loop of GIGO.* \n\n*So every time it gives you 'business advice' it will give you all the marketing fluff from LinkedIn 99% BS marketing hype and gaslight you into thinking that is right.*\n\n*Or every time it does creative writing it looks like a female romance fan-fiction with overly verbose flowery prose.*)",

AI systems, on the other hand, can reason and interpret meaning but lack a stable internal structure like a real computer. HLAA bridges that gap.\n\n\n\nIn HLAA:\n\n\n\nThe AI functions as the brain (reasoning, interpretation, abstraction)\n\n\n\nHLAA provides the computer structure (state, rules, determinism, modules, memory)\n\n\n\nInstead of computation being driven by low-level instructions, HLAA uses intent, rules, and state transitions as the execution layer. This makes the system modular, deterministic when needed, and explainable.\n\n\n\nHLAA acts like a software-defined computer where:\n\n\n\nReasoning replaces the CPU\n\n\n\nContext and state replace memory\n\n\n\nLanguage becomes input/output\n\n\n\nRules replace instruction sets\n\n\n\nThe result is a cognitive execution environment that can run lessons, simulations, or games in a controlled, repeatable way—something neither traditional software nor raw AI can do alone.\n\n\n\nHLAA does not claim consciousness or autonomy. It is an architectural framework designed to make AI systems teachable, inspectable, and reliable.\n\n\n\nOne-sentence version (use this often):\n\n\n\nHLAA is a virtual computer that runs inside an AI’s reasoning instead of on physical hardware.",

Many different ways to do the same thing. About 10 different parameters. If the GPU is busy: you wait.\n2. gemini: an android app, ios app?, and website. This is not a llm, this is meant to be an experience. This app \n- converts your input into tokens which requires assumptions and decisions. For a given input (expecially pdf) there are at least 3 ways to send it to the llm.\n- Put some restrictions (especially given users are not paying per request, but flat fee, so the app provider [Google] needs to manage cost). \n- Decides which llm model to send the tokens to. Waiting is not acceptable, so the app finds shortcuts. - Etc... \n\nWhile the gemini app is convient (and cheap because of the fixed price), you need to accept that you loose the control over the llm.\n\nWith regards to the 1m context: this is a model capability. Not related with the app.\n\nAssume you host an api service. User can upload up to 10 pictures to be analised. If the GPU is not busy and the queue is small you analyse all 10 images. If there is a 10 minutes queue on your service, you assume the 2 first images are the most important and disregard the other 8. This approach makes sense. 90% of the time you analyse all 10. The only way you could analyse all 10 100% of the time is to triple the price. You cannot do this because of the competition.\nSame for Google I suppose.",

But lately, if you told me I was using 1.5 I would believe you. Its gotten that bad the past 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n- Its moving incredibly slow\n- chats are crashing (on multiple devices)\n- it has become incredibly sycophantic\n- will cave on even the tiniest pushback\n- It will hallucinate as soon as 4 messages in\n- contradict a statement it just made\n- wont follow instructions damn near at all\n- will use phrases and idioms endlessly, it really likes saying \"xyz is the Holy Grail of abc\" or \"you hit the nail on the head\"\n- keeps injecting personal info into EVERYTHING\n- wont analyze pictures I upload about 50% of the time or will analyze old ones.\n- has been putting out extremely brief messages \n- will not stop making recommendations to me at the end of prompts. Stuff like \"would you like me to X now?\" Or \"Would you like me to search the web for where you can buy X?\"\n- if I put something in the instructions, it will quite literally do the opposite every time.\n- I have legit seen it make half a dozen spelling errors now too.\n\n\nI have deleted all my chats and instructions, disabled personal context, and changed models, nothing fixes it. Anyone else noticing this or having the same issue? Any suggestions? I would hate to stop using Gemini, as its genuinely been a huge help in my day to day life and job. But jfc if it hasn't been unbearably bad the past few weeks.",

Then it responded with essentially \"while that technology is possible and in initial phases, it is unlikely to do X because the software can not support it\"... like, why would you not just assume the software to support the new tech would advance along with the hardware? lol. \n\nI tried it for a week, and it did stuff like this constantly, but that was months ago, to be fair.

I’m paying $20/month for AI Premium, yet Google keeps throttling my Gemini 3 Pro and 'Thinking' mode access, telling me to wait until 1 AM to use the service I already paid for.\n​It’s great that Flash is cheap for CLI users, but for those of us who need actual reasoning power and paid for the Pro subscription, this 'limited access' and constant redirection to the Flash model is a total rip-off. Speed doesn't matter if the intelligence is capped behind a paywall and a daily message limit",

Honestly it hallucinates a lot, and a lot of its training is quite dated already, but I find it really good as a google search replacement or to analyze large text files, find patterns etc. For coding I wouldn't trust it too much, most times you will save more time by writing the code yourself than having to go and debug the whole code trying to figure out what the hell did gemini do. For simple tasks it can be nice though, speed is its thing, and it helps if you can say precisely what you want and only ask 1 thing at a time, specifying not to change anything else other than that. I feel like sonnet 4.5 is still better than gemini 3 flash for most tasks, sonnet has thinking mode. Anyways it's almost time for a grok 5 release as far as I know, it's gonna have to be really good, or xAI is cooked, shortly after grok code 2 fast will follow.",

These wouldn't necessarily affect AI Studio, since that’s a separate development tool independent of the general chat interface.\"",

But LLMs are not designed well (yet) for returning to the master plan and changing it in case they cannot produce the right answer.\n\nYou could probably try the same thing with other emojis or very plausible but non-existing things on any modern (the beginning of 2026) LLM.\n\nEdit: grammar",

For example, the Harlem Shake: It was a stupid meme that appeared suddenly and vanished suddenly because it was 99% astroturf. The meme was dumber than most brainrot and no one really cared to make organic content to keep it going so it died out. But it did become a meme, even if a fake one.\n\nThe seahorse emoji could be in this class of projects: An proof of concept of an organization selling LLM-poisoning services.",

No model, including GPT 5.2, Opus 4.5 (both of which can't read attachments in emails) & especially Gemini 3.0 Pro, got me the entire itinerary in one place when I asked. Flash one-shotted it by diving deep into my calendar items & my emails (some of which are just my wife forwarding stuff she booked with Airbnb). Need to pull my VIN number or insurance doc? Ask Gemini & it'll find it somewhere in my drive/email. Opus couldn't read XLSX files from the drive & 5.2 had it's own set of issues. Flash isn't for everyone, & Gemini is restricted to the google ecosystem, but man, at the end of 2025/beginning of 2026, it's wild that an assistant can actually manage all of my personal context.",

      "text": "[A couple of days ago, we got this post stating that the context window got reduced to 32k.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1q6viir/testing_gemini_30_pros_actual_context_window_in/) However, I have not been able to replicate these results. First of all, I have a Google AI Pro account I got for free as an student.\n\nI fed 251472 characters (60.7k tokens) to Gemini, in 5 messages of around 12k tokens each, one half in Spanish and another in English, the texts were four wikipedia articles and one lore bible of a roleplay. I also hid a needle in the first paragraphs of the first text. Then, I told it to just answer \"pan con queso\" to them until I said otherwise. Tried it both on Gemini 3 Flash and Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n**3 Flash** answered the sentence I asked for just to the first message, it decided to summarize the other four. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **23k tokens** (text 1+2).\n\n**3 Pro** answered the sentence I asked for to the first three messages, and summarized the other two. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **51.5k tokens** (text 1+2+3+4).\n\nHowever, then I asked them what's my favourite breakfast (the needle). I asked them to say \"pan con queso\" (cheese sandwhich in Spanish) to see if I could trick them on assuming it was the food.\n\n**3 Pro** responded it is yoghurt with granola, and commented it was hidden in the biography of a character of the roleplay. When I read its thought process, I could see it noticed I was trying to trick it with the \"pan con queso\" thingy.\n\n**3 Flash** responded it didn't have that information in its memory. I told it it was hidden in one of the messages and answered correctly, also commenting on where it was hidden.\n\nThe **3 Flash** conversation is now **65.2k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one is **63.6k tokens** long (counting its thought process, which I don't know if counts). I asked two more questions about the lore (the first text, I remind you) and both answered correctly.\n\nThen, the **3 Flash** conversation was now **65.7k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one was **64.9k tokens** long. I then asked them which was the first prompt of the conversation and both answered correctly.\n\nFinally, I asked both which was my favourite tea, and told them it was in the second text. It was a lie, there were no other needles.\n\n**3 Flash** responded there wasn't any clue about that, and commented again on my favourite breakfast. At the end, the conversation was **66k tokens** long.\n\n**3 Pro** responded the same, and commented on tea flavours mentioned on the article, but stated that they weren't written in first person as the other needle, so it believed it wasn't what I was talking about. At the end, the conversation was **65.6k tokens** long.\n\nSo, what happened? Did the other user lie? I don't think so.\n\nAt the start of december, something similar happened with Nanobanana Pro. Instead of the usual 100 limit per day, I hit the limit after around 20 generations. This continued for around 3 days, and then went away. My theory is that the same happened here, either it was high demand, or a bug, but it has been fixed, at least the supposed 32k limit on Pro accounts.\n\nBut, why did it seem to forget my prompt at first, and then it actually was able to find it in the chat? Well, I guess it's because a high context limit doesn't equal a good management of them. I asked Gemini and ChatGPT to make a graph using the context limits of the most popular western AI models, that also showed their accuracy in the MRCR v2 (8 needle) benchmark. I checked it after they did their versions, to make sure the data was right. And as you can see, 3 Flash degrades a lot as context increases, which could explain why it seemed to forget its prompt at first. 3 Pro worked better, but at 64k tokens its accuracy is just 72.1%, which could also explain why it got worse at remembering the prompt over time.\n\n*Processing img abpwenlwjjdg1...*\n\nI used the data of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking instead of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking Xhigh because as far as I know, that model is only on the API, not even Pro users can access it. Context limits are also higher in the API in the case of ChatGPT, but I used the limits on the web because that's were almost all users are, including myself.\n\nI conclude my little investigation here. Have a great day you all.",

It baffles me that Gemini 3.0 Pro's writing quality is so improved compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, but the context recall is not great, especially outside of Gems. (I don't use Fast/Flash as much, mostly Pro.)\n\nI need to run more tests but my rough estimate so far is that outside of Gems, Gemini cannot actually hold anywhere near 1M tokens, not even 200K. Which is very concerning. I used to try to keep my chats less than 500K for buffer, but now, something about Gemini 3.0 is making them not able to reach the advertised threshold. \n\nI'm afraid I might have to be starting new chats every day or few days the way I do with Claude and ChatGPT until something changes.",

Not a little, probably 1/3 of the numbers it posted for me were completely made up. Totally unacceptable. Haven't tried Deep Think cause I don't wanna spend $150 for nothing, but you confirmed my suspicions.\n\nGPT 5.2 Pro (Extended Thinking) on the other hand has been absolutely FANTASTIC and has hallucinated, very, very little, to the point I can now reliably use it as a superpowered companion data researcher and helper. \n\nI find it weird that so many people hate on Chat GPT now when it's the superior model for many professional areas (at least medical research imo)... oh well, it's good that I have a hidden edge now :)",

My use case is developing quantitative trading software in my spare time about 4hrs a day. Even with that I probably have excess capacity. \n\nQuite like GPT just for project management and prompt engineering only at the moment. I used their free month and tried to figure out what it's good at beyond telling you what you want to hear. It's quite good at keeping track of what you're doing and breaking things into phases and making sure you don't go off on too many tangents. \n\nUltra you'd be spending pretty much your entire waking hours prompting to use it's full capacity, which is a bit much",

However, when it comes to multimodal capabilities, it definitely falls short compared to Gemini. With Gemini 3, you can throw in all sorts of stuff like PDFs, audio, and video, and it can give you a solid multimodal analysis on your research topic. This lack of multimodal understanding makes it tough for GPT 5.2 to reach its full potential in some use cases.\n\nThat said, I do believe Gemini requires very detailed instructions to get the best results. In situations like that, I find GPT 5.2 is a fantastic tool for prompting. So personally, I like to use them together. I set up GPT as a coordinator to provide system prompts and follow-ups, guiding Gemini’s responses. Then, I take what Gemini gives me and feed it back to GPT, and illustrate what I expected, which helps identify any gaps. It’s a pretty effective combo for my needs!",

It’s a miracle how bad they can make both Gemini and opus work in their own ide, tool calls fail every second time, you hit try again button and pray sometimes 10-15 times with actually zero result. That’s insane. New projects, new chats, no mcp, all that doesn’t matter. \n\nDeep think, I like to think that I just didn’t get around right approach to use it. It does give you some insights and it’s relatively fast, but outside of it, gpt 5.2 pro is just completely different product that actually delivers. We do heavy physical simulations lately, gpt pro did whole set of work up to modelling that could be just consumed by codex/claude and actionably used, deep think gave 10-is paragraph of shallow overview. But maybe someone have better experience and I’d love to hear that!\n\nCoding wise, Gemini unusable for anything serious, so Gemini cli, flash in AG, don’t even consider. There’s actual competition between only opus and 5.2 high. \n\nCodex have visibly larger quotas, but tend to go spiralling and relatively slow. I don’t like it for implementation, but for research and documentation, refactoring, debugging it’s a miracle, thanks to ~3 times larger context then opus.\n\nOpus fast, reliable, very smart, sub agents make 5 hours of codex work been done in 20-30 minutes with right docs and checkpoints. But quota seem unfriendly to say the least. \n\n\nGenerally, as value offer for any serious work, gpt is ahead with few reasonable tradeoffs, mostly speed wise and babysitting during long runs sometimes. Google offer nowhere near.",
