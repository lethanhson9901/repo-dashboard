Please ffs.\n\nNot only does it get what i say wrong, on top of that, it will randomly decide you're done speaking and immediately send the query to the model. Can i please think for a second??\n\nEven the google keyboard stt on android is better somehow than this.\n\nIt's bizarre because google has had free voice transcription before any company, yet now theyre behind openai on it?\n\nChatgpt's whisper is amazing, seriously. The ui is perfect. you click the button, it shows you that its recording now, you speak for as long as you like, be silent and think what you wanna say, and once youre done, even if its 3 minutes later, it will transcribe it for you. it's literally perfect.\n\nThere have been times when i have used chatgpt to transcribe something and then copy paste that into gemini, just because gemini's transcriber is nowhere close.\n\nPlease google, rather than stealing \"answer now\" button from chatgpt, steal this instead!",

I have been using Chatgpt and Gemini  for roughly 2 years.I used them from finding info about MCU's that have no publically available data sheets or documentation. Mst of the time give me wrong info about MCU  but deep research improved that.A month ago, I tried to dump code from this aliexpress bluetooth gamepad for mobiles. As as usual the text on Micorontroller does not show up any thing at all in any searches.Since I had Chatgpt Plus and Gemini pro I spun up a quick deep research Attached close up images and gave a description of controller and it's name from aliexpress. Gemini found it which a suprise to me while chatgpt did not it gave wrong mcu.\n\nI probe main pins such as VCC and GND and tried to get dump of firmware which is my mistake.\n\nBut the point is Gemini 3 searched through sources like scribd and some chinese docs and pinpointed the exact mcu.\n\nIt might not seem a big thing but deep reserch of gemini  which uses mutiple sources is kinda rectifying the errors i usually get from normal and thinking modes of chat  since a Micrcontoller usually has mutiple variants.\n\nEven this game pad MCU has 2 variants .\n\nGemini :Yichip YC-1021  \nChatgpt:Jieli AC6951C \n\npardon my typos\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lauo7jvdzvdg1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf4838a0dfd54eebfcc23895498e8c3a56a6ba7b\n\n",

      "text": "[A couple of days ago, we got this post stating that the context window got reduced to 32k.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1q6viir/testing_gemini_30_pros_actual_context_window_in/) However, I have not been able to replicate these results. First of all, I have a Google AI Pro account I got for free as an student.\n\nI fed 251472 characters (60.7k tokens) to Gemini, in 5 messages of around 12k tokens each, one half in Spanish and another in English, the texts were four wikipedia articles and one lore bible of a roleplay. I also hid a needle in the first paragraphs of the first text. Then, I told it to just answer \"pan con queso\" to them until I said otherwise. Tried it both on Gemini 3 Flash and Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n**3 Flash** answered the sentence I asked for just to the first message, it decided to summarize the other four. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **23k tokens** (text 1+2).\n\n**3 Pro** answered the sentence I asked for to the first three messages, and summarized the other two. Therefore, it stopped following instructions after reading **51.5k tokens** (text 1+2+3+4).\n\nHowever, then I asked them what's my favourite breakfast (the needle). I asked them to say \"pan con queso\" (cheese sandwhich in Spanish) to see if I could trick them on assuming it was the food.\n\n**3 Pro** responded it is yoghurt with granola, and commented it was hidden in the biography of a character of the roleplay. When I read its thought process, I could see it noticed I was trying to trick it with the \"pan con queso\" thingy.\n\n**3 Flash** responded it didn't have that information in its memory. I told it it was hidden in one of the messages and answered correctly, also commenting on where it was hidden.\n\nThe **3 Flash** conversation is now **65.2k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one is **63.6k tokens** long (counting its thought process, which I don't know if counts). I asked two more questions about the lore (the first text, I remind you) and both answered correctly.\n\nThen, the **3 Flash** conversation was now **65.7k tokens** long; and the **3 Pro** one was **64.9k tokens** long. I then asked them which was the first prompt of the conversation and both answered correctly.\n\nFinally, I asked both which was my favourite tea, and told them it was in the second text. It was a lie, there were no other needles.\n\n**3 Flash** responded there wasn't any clue about that, and commented again on my favourite breakfast. At the end, the conversation was **66k tokens** long.\n\n**3 Pro** responded the same, and commented on tea flavours mentioned on the article, but stated that they weren't written in first person as the other needle, so it believed it wasn't what I was talking about. At the end, the conversation was **65.6k tokens** long.\n\nSo, what happened? Did the other user lie? I don't think so.\n\nAt the start of december, something similar happened with Nanobanana Pro. Instead of the usual 100 limit per day, I hit the limit after around 20 generations. This continued for around 3 days, and then went away. My theory is that the same happened here, either it was high demand, or a bug, but it has been fixed, at least the supposed 32k limit on Pro accounts.\n\nBut, why did it seem to forget my prompt at first, and then it actually was able to find it in the chat? Well, I guess it's because a high context limit doesn't equal a good management of them. I asked Gemini and ChatGPT to make a graph using the context limits of the most popular western AI models, that also showed their accuracy in the MRCR v2 (8 needle) benchmark. I checked it after they did their versions, to make sure the data was right. And as you can see, 3 Flash degrades a lot as context increases, which could explain why it seemed to forget its prompt at first. 3 Pro worked better, but at 64k tokens its accuracy is just 72.1%, which could also explain why it got worse at remembering the prompt over time.\n\n*Processing img abpwenlwjjdg1...*\n\nI used the data of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking instead of ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking Xhigh because as far as I know, that model is only on the API, not even Pro users can access it. Context limits are also higher in the API in the case of ChatGPT, but I used the limits on the web because that's were almost all users are, including myself.\n\nI conclude my little investigation here. Have a great day you all.",
