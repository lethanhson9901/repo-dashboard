Not to mention, how are you gonna make an online game that is entirely AI generated. I think it's more realistic that game companies will combine AI with real game engines in the future.

It is so frustratingly bad that I legitimately don’t trust anyone to look anything up anymore. Google so aggressively limited its compute that it always messes up nuance, if not the entire thing. Every time I see someone start reading it I shudder and get ready to argue over reality.\n\nGoogle winning the AI war is dependent on them aggressively improving reasoning. One way is through better datasets (you seem to think more is always better, but in reality it’s often *worse*). But I think the design of Gemini itself (mixture-of-experts) fundamentally limits its reasoning capabilities in a way that can’t be fixed with data or fine-tuning. They only did it this way to reduce compute. They will need to accept higher compute if they ever want to lead in reasoning.",

              "text": "I did a series of thorough tests a month ago to compare the output length of 2026 Gemini 3 Pro vs release Gemini 3 Pro, and it was infuriating.. Had a few prompts which I ran 10-15 times in different chats each time at realease, then did the same recently again to compare. The difference was fucking staggering. In more than 80% of the cases, there was an up to 40-60% reduction in output tokens, using the exact same AI studio settings (default everything). Both the thinking length and reply length has been massively decreased compared to launch.\n\nJust look at this simple example prompt: `type 1 vs type 2 diabetes`\n\n2025 November average output tokens based on 10 runs: 2758 output tokens\n\n2026 January average output tokens based on 11 runs: 1135 output tokens\n- This coincided with the complaint post here mentioning Gemini 3 Pro degradation\n\n2026 February average output tokens based on 14 runs: 1918 output tokens\n\nDifferent prompt topics and complexities resulted in mostly the same findings. It's so infuriating building on Google's models, then having the rug pulled out from under you with these unannounced stealth changes. The benchmark companies need to run their benchmarks not only on release (when the model owners expect them to), but repeat it 2-3 months afterwards too. The results would shock everyone..",

This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated.

These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately.

Multiple insider sources claim imminent release of a model codenamed \"Fennec\" that would represent a significant leap forward in performance while simultaneously undercutting established pricing. This comprehensive analysis examines the key claims surrounding Claude Sonnet 5 against historical release patterns, pricing strategies, and technical capabilities demonstrated by Anthropic's previous model generations to assess the credibility and likelihood of verification for each rumored specification. The investigation reveals both plausible claims grounded in established development trajectories and more speculative assertions that diverge from Anthropic's demonstrated practices.\n\n## Historical Release Patterns and Timeline Analysis\n\n### Anthropic's Established Release Cadence\n\nAnthropic has demonstrated a distinctive approach to model releases that reveals important patterns for evaluating Claude Sonnet 5 rumors. The company's release schedule accelerated significantly throughout 2024 and 2025, moving from yearly major releases to quarterly or even more frequent iterations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched on June 20, 2024, representing a mid-cycle update to the Claude 3 family that outperformed the larger Claude 3 Opus despite being positioned as a mid-tier model[3]. This represents a critical historical precedent because it established that Anthropic would release major capability improvements in mid-tier models without waiting for full generation cycles. Following this pattern, Claude 3.7 Sonnet emerged on February 24, 2025, just eight months later, indicating that Anthropic continues to iterate rapidly on the Sonnet line between major Claude generation releases[5][7].",

              "text": "The release of Claude 4 models on May 22, 2025, introduced Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4 simultaneously[5][7]. This represents Anthropic's standard practice of releasing multiple tiers within a generation at the same time rather than staggering them significantly. However, this pattern shifted with the 4.5 releases. Claude Sonnet 4.5 arrived on September 29, 2025[2][5][7], followed by Claude Haiku 4.5 on October 15, 2025[5][7], and finally Claude Opus 4.5 on November 24, 2025[5][7]. This represents a staged release pattern within a generation, with approximately two weeks between Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5, and approximately two months between Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5. This telescoped schedule is crucial for evaluating timing claims about Claude Sonnet 5, as it suggests Anthropic is willing to release models at closer intervals than previously observed.\n\n### Evaluation of Release Timing Rumors\n\nThe primary leak claims that Claude Sonnet 5 could release as early as February 3, 2026, described as \"within a week\" from the leak date of February 1, 2026[1][9][18][27][29][31][51]. This timing claim warrants careful analysis. The actual time between Claude Opus 4.5's November 24, 2025 release and the rumored early-February 2026 Sonnet 5 release would be approximately two months, which aligns with the spacing Anthropic demonstrated between Sonnet 4.5 (September 29) and Opus 4.5 (November 24)[2][5]. This temporal window supports the plausibility of a February release from a historical cadence perspective.\n\nHowever, several factors complicate this assessment. First, Anthropic typically spaces major model releases to allow adequate evaluation and feedback from the developer community. The approximately two-month gap between Opus 4.5 and a hypothetical early-February Sonnet 5 is substantially shorter than many previous major releases, suggesting either accelerated development or that Claude Sonnet 5 represents an incremental update rather than a foundational new iteration. Second, insider claims reference a maximum two-week window from the leak date, which would place release at February 15, 2026 at the latest[1][9]. As of February 2, 2026, this window has already partially passed, and no official announcement has materialized from Anthropic, reducing confidence in this specific timeline.\n\nThe temporal analysis suggests: **Timing plausibility rating: 45 percent**. While the broader February 2026 window is consistent with historical spacing patterns, the specific claim of immediate release within days now appears unlikely given the current date. However, a February release window remains possible within Anthropic's demonstrated release cadence.",

                  "text": "## Performance Claims Analysis\n\n### Competitive Positioning Against Opus 4.5\n\nThe most significant performance claim surrounding Claude Sonnet 5 alleges that it will outperform Claude Opus 4.5 in coding tasks, with rumored SWE-bench Verified scores of 82 to 82.5 percent compared to Opus 4.5's verified 80.9 percent[1][4][9][27][31][54]. This represents a highly unusual claim in the context of Anthropic's product hierarchy. Historically, Anthropic positions Opus models as flagship offerings representing maximum capability across tasks, while Sonnet models occupy the middle tier optimized for speed and cost. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 80.9 percent on SWE-bench Verified, a comprehensive benchmark measuring real-world software engineering capabilities[2][6][11]. For a Sonnet model to exceed this performance contradicts Anthropic's established product positioning strategy, where each tier (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) maintains clear capability differentiation[6][11].\n\nThe historical record shows that when Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024, it outperformed the earlier Claude 3 Opus on several benchmarks[3][5], establishing a precedent for mid-tier models matching or exceeding older flagship capabilities. However, this occurred with a full generation change and represented a cumulative advancement across the entire Claude line. The rumored performance of Sonnet 5 allegedly surpassing current-generation Opus 4.5 in coding would represent something qualitatively different: a mid-tier model exceeding the contemporary flagship within the same generation. Anthropic's demonstrated marketing and product strategy strongly suggests they would position any model exceeding Opus 4.5 in capabilities as a new flagship rather than releasing it as a Sonnet variant.\n\nAdditionally, examination of the broader capability landscape reveals another complicating factor. Recent reports indicate that AI models more broadly are beginning to experience performance plateaus in some domains, with newer reasoning models occasionally demonstrating higher hallucination rates despite theoretical capability increases[48]. The claim that a Sonnet model would achieve 82-82.5 percent on SWE-bench Verified—a three-point improvement over Opus 4.5 in a constrained domain—would represent one of the largest single-generation improvements in AI benchmarking, yet rumors provide no technical explanation for how this capability jump would be achieved.\n\nThe analysis suggests: **Coding performance superiority claim plausibility: 25 percent**. While the benchmark score improvement aligns with Anthropic's demonstrated optimization trajectory, the contradiction with established product hierarchy positioning and the lack of technical justification substantially undermine confidence in this specific performance claim. A more plausible scenario would involve Claude Sonnet 5 achieving high but not exceeding performance on SWE-bench Verified.\n\n### Computer Use and Agentic Capabilities\n\nRumors regarding Claude Sonnet 5's agentic capabilities are more nuanced. The leaks describe \"developer team mode\" with specialized sub-agents working in parallel, allegedly demonstrating Anthropic's continued focus on agent orchestration[4][27][29][31]. This claim has substantially higher plausibility when compared against documented developments. Anthropic released Claude Code in February 2025 as an agentic command-line tool and continued enhancing it throughout 2025[5][7]. The Claude Agent SDK emerged alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5's September 2025 release, providing foundational tools for building capable agents[2][21][49]. By November 2025, Claude Code had expanded to include sub-agents—specialized AI assistants with independent contexts designed to prevent \"context pollution\" in complex workflows[30][31][34].\n\nThe leap from current sub-agent capabilities to alleged parallel \"developer team mode\" represents an incremental but logical evolution. Anthropic has demonstrated commitment to agentic infrastructure through documented releases of Claude Code updates, the Agent SDK, and Model Context Protocol integration[2][21][23]. The rumor of an \"Agent Mode\" feature was specifically leaked in December 2025, describing structured task delegation organized into buckets like research, analyze, write, and build[25]. This leak postdates Claude Opus 4.5's November release and demonstrates Anthropic was actively developing structured agentic capabilities. The consistency between this documented leak and Claude Sonnet 5 rumors about similar features suggests these developments are genuine, though their assignment to a specific model version remains uncertain.\n\nThe analysis suggests: **Agentic capability enhancements claim plausibility: 75 percent**. The alignment with documented Claude Code evolution, Agent SDK development, and the December 2025 Agent Mode leak provides substantial support for claims of enhanced agent orchestration in Claude Sonnet 5. However, confirmation that these features will debut specifically with Sonnet 5 rather than rolling out incrementally remains pending.",

I don't mind AI studio having limits but the paid version should have the same capability at very least.\n\nNot to mention Gemini web has gotten shockingly dumber recently. What's happening?",

The model maintains a windowed active context—probably around 32k tokens of recent conversation history that it processes directly in each forward pass. When you query about specific information like the breakfast needle, it performs semantic search across the full 66k+ token conversation to locate relevant passages, pulls those into what it calls \"extracts,\" and combines them with the recent context to generate the response. The active window processes directly; everything else is accessible only through retrieval.\n\nThis explains your results. The needle was found because your explicit question about breakfast semantically triggered retrieval of that passage, even though it was 60k+ tokens back. But the procedural instruction to say \"pan con queso\" to all messages degraded because that requires maintaining state across the entire conversation. Early messages fell outside the active window and weren't semantically relevant to later prompts, so the instruction was lost. The effect compounds over time because as the conversation lengthens, more content falls outside the window and becomes accessible only through search, which depends on semantic relevance to the current query.\n\nEffective context and retrieval range are not the same thing. If I asked the model to retrieve a certain detail in my long documents they could probably do it; but if I am asking the model to perform a task that operationalizes the entire long document beyond the effective context window (i.e synthesize doc A with doc B), it just spits out what it can via the extracts it generates (which almost always is incomplete). I only have this problem in the web app, never in AI Studio.",

It feels like the model is overwhelmingly governed by training, rather than use direction - the net outcome being that it feels like Gemini is the one calling the shots rather than the user. \n\n\nIn human terms, we'd call it \"ignorant\" ",

This is called **aggressive quantization** (compressing the model) to save on those TPUs/GPUs cycles. Essentially, they are trying to squeeze 10x more users onto the same hardware, which tanks the quality of the logic.",
