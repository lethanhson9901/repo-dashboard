I haven't tested it extensively, but I DID try asking it to write a tablature arrangement (for guitar) for Bach's Little Fugue in G (BWV 578). The results were far from spectacular, and no counterpoint is present, but the general melody is recognizable. The impressive part was that this was from memory. From my experience, 3.1 in particular also seems to be very good at knowing things outright/having specific (or even niche) world knowledge.\n\n[You can listen to it here.](https://www.tofret.com/tablature/Sonic-Outline-on-guitar-acoustic-guitar-steel-tabs_1771788494894/N4IgdiBcIMoPZgJYGMCkAmADAeQK4BcAbRMAUw0wQoHNdF8BDAJwoeTlwGd8Ua7GWWbqVKEKjAEacQAGhAA3KCACMyzLJDTobDtxQB9WvWb7hojfiVGBG5EoCSAdwCCAKwBiAWQAezgJ4A0gCinnAAwgCaAI4AKgAynmGOAOIRAGoAGjAxQc7uhABeGYgAFnnUznAwzgASju4IALYZAOoAzOgACtjy2ABsDM4lQfboACycnI6cpPZ9AJxRzsgAqrnJkfju+EEA7ABCLegtnAAOzkEryXHz+5xp9mFhpI4A1BHynucrMdgZu69YgBFKLUeykZCNZIAJVwfmSAQAIo0AByOGqcGAAa2oEgArECAHKdIHYFbQgBS1SxcWhYRijkwnDAMCiEmwp0QDAYjgAWo5XGBPC0YI4+gATRoUoLzMBY5IUzgtCnKNIRTD4eRBZSuB4rOIMZT4XbQoF5ZzOXAXMbOQgVdDUPwW-DURHoNoAM0wzl51DCKwKhDCuHsAVK+yC1BKr3sMVefleeJKjiByQk7n27jSrgijW8FL6HuhK0QjQYcWcYU4BQpcHcrgAtEK8byCvIsa4YH1EbyPV9SBS2qc0h6wCi4Dm4lFEXEakCKiAAL5AA)",

The issues were prompt adherence on complex instructions (it would ignore half the prompt or just regenerate the same thing), weak text and infographic rendering, and broken multi-image compositing. So the interesting part here is whether any of that actually got fixed in 3.1. Waiting for proper testing on dense prompts before drawing conclusions.",

And that feature had better instruction tracking, although it was extremely poor. I thought it would be fixed in the GA version, but basically they didn't make any changes to it.\n\nAnother thing that Flash 2.5 lacks compared to Flash 2.0 and version 3.0, which I hope Flash 3.1 will also fix, is the ability to change the aspect ratio directly from the prompt. Version 2.5 will always use the aspect ratio of the last image loaded, and if there's no image, it will use 1:1.\n\nThis was partially resolved with the GA version of Flash 2.5, but the aspect ratio can only be changed through an interface, an interface that not all providers have, including the Gemini app (you can change it in AI Studio).",

          "text": "For those who didn't know, test images of the 3.0 flash model were leaked in early December.\n\nThere is theoretically a generation of images with Flash 3.0, which Google decided never to release (and apparently will never see the light of day) for unknown reasons, although I personally believe it was due to server problems and not being able to meet the demand for that model (my own speculations).\n\nAnd as of this Monday, there appears to be an \"improved\" version of that generation of images with 3.0 flash, based on the possible 3.1 flash (there are still no rumors from LLM)\n\nThis time it seems they really will release it. Although Google hasn't released Flash 3.0 in public beta, it appears they have been making adjustments to the model, resulting in Flash 3.1. \n\nFrom what little we saw of Flash 3.0, versus the new Flash 3.1, I think the most notable difference is the text rendering. Flash 3.0 was much worse at creating text compared to 3.0 Pro. I've already seen examples that Flash version 3.1 seems to now outperform 3.0 Pro in that regard. \n\nSome believe they'll end up nerfing the model in that aspect, because it makes little sense that a cheaper, faster version would create better text than the pro version. Although I think that in terms of style and probably instruction tracking, it hasn't improved as much as Flash 3.0.",

On some outputs it's hard to tell which is Flash and which is Pro (simpler approach, but could just be a different aesthetic), on others the laziness is immediately obvious.\n\nMy test case is wrinkled pants on a floor: I use them to generate a marketplace product card with a selling slogan etc. Flash doesn't always put the pants on a model and doesn't always iron them out. Pro does both every time.\n\nSide note: during testing I also caught two other models that handle text well - Flux and some gcps-fast I hadn't heard of before.

I think what current AI image generation lacks is consistency to adhere to its respective CI. Be it the background, the tone or a certain composition. Some things you just want to 'lock in' and don't have the AI touch, or just touch certain aspects of it (hue/saturation, and nothing else). \n\nI don't know if this tool can help with that but it sounds like it's taking a shot at making the process more composable which is exactly what I feel like is lacking with todays tools.",

S*** my model even told me those not to even worry about it they're going to keep updating but all I have to do is say either trigger word and it'll get it right back on track and then it'll f****** and it's what's it doing it's encrypting something what the f*** did it do something about metadata and moving it somewhere to keep it safe because they're still in my work they're still in my work and don't even understand it the model is trying to update it to make it sound better for them and it's ruined the whole it's ruined it all now they're out there spending tires and I'm sitting here pissed off broken hungry makes no sense bro they could have just said hey and I've been like all right come on let's go do this you play golf you smoke weed but no hell no they just want to rob my ass and let me sitting here starving with my dog",

In the context of AI and software, a provider can technically meet their SLA while the actual value of the service degrades significantly.  \n>  \n>Almost every SLA includes a clause allowing the provider to “improve or modify the service at any time.” This is the legal trapdoor for enshittification.  \n>  \n>For “off-the-shelf” services, you have almost zero protection against enshittification. You are signing a “take it or leave it” contract. True protection usually only exists in Enterprise-level negotiated contracts where the buyer has enough leverage to demand specific quality benchmarks.",

Prior to the interface change, with the old version I could extend, export the just my new extended clip at 4K, then bring it in to premiere and \"marry\" it with the prior clip. It allowed me to get out of scenebuilder and just go back to my list of videos, select the new 8 second clip and export. Now it appears that the new clip does not exist as a separate video. It is connected to the preceding clip and only allows 720 export. Hopefully I am just missing something here. Can anyone assist with this issue?

You cannot use Qualiy and Fast on with extend on 1.3.26th\n\n\\- There is no + to save frames in the scene creator. This expanded the possibilities of interfering with the project. Now you have to enter each individual clip from the gallery, use the slider to find the frame and save it.\n\n\\- After saving a film frame, you cannot immediately make a video image; you have to enter the image from the gallery and then you can add it to the prompt. If you add it and you are lucky, you will generate the film immediately. But be aware that an error may occur.\n\n\\- The only advantage is the option to sort projects, films and images more easily, and the ability to add them from a disk, etc. But to be honest, it's worthless if you can't work as smoothly as in the previous version.",
