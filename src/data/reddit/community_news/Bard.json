Google app 17.2 reveals work on four capabilities, starting with: \n\n>- **Live Thinking Mode:** “Try a version of Gemini Live that takes time to think and provide more detailed responses.”\n\n>- **Live Experimental Features:** “Try our cutting-edge features: multimodal memory, better noise handling, responding when it sees something, and personalized results based on your Google apps.”\n\n>Live today is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Those two Labs suggest that Gemini Live will soon be powered by Gemini 3. Live Thinking Mode could be using either the Thinking or Pro models for its “more detailed responses.”\n\n>Meanwhile, the Live Experimental Features are capabilities offered in the chat experience with Gemini 3 Flash and Pro. This includes Personal Intelligence’s Connected Apps and Past Gemini chats. Better noise cancellation is always needed, while “responding when it sees something” could be a Project Astra capability.\n\n>The other Labs features are:\n\n>- **UI Control:** “Agent controls phone to complete tasks”\n\n>- **Deep Research:** “Delegate complex research tasks\n\n>We're unsure what the last item is specifically about, but we've long been expecting Gemini Agent to come to Android as part of [Computer Use.](https://9to5google.com/2026/01/15/android-16-qpr3-screen-automation/)",

Please ffs.\n\nNot only does it get what i say wrong, on top of that, it will randomly decide you're done speaking and immediately send the query to the model. Can i please think for a second??\n\nEven the google keyboard stt on android is better somehow than this.\n\nIt's bizarre because google has had free voice transcription before any company, yet now theyre behind openai on it?\n\nChatgpt's whisper is amazing, seriously. The ui is perfect. you click the button, it shows you that its recording now, you speak for as long as you like, be silent and think what you wanna say, and once youre done, even if its 3 minutes later, it will transcribe it for you. it's literally perfect.\n\nThere have been times when i have used chatgpt to transcribe something and then copy paste that into gemini, just because gemini's transcriber is nowhere close.\n\nPlease google, rather than stealing \"answer now\" button from chatgpt, steal this instead!",

I’m so used to just venting or thinking out loud to GPT that even now, I still have to use its voice-to-text feature first, then copy and paste everything into Gemini.  \nGemini goes crazy the moment you use homophones. It can't understand the whole context to fix the text you want to say. Like in Mandarin, 'muscle' and 'chicken' sound the same, so it’s a total toss-up for Gemini. Same goes for 'service' versus 'surface' in English, it just mixes them up because they sound too similar.",

But with Gemini it’s a different story. the speech-to-text is still stuck with that old Google Translate tech, so it’s incredibly inaccurate. You can’t even mix different languages without it breaking. It completely ruins that seamless, intuitive experience.",

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down:  \n[**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

There's a few features I'd love to see so I can drop my other gemini extensions. \n\n-   **Adjustable Chat Width:** Add an option to customize the width of the main chat area up to full width. [Example](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-better-ui/mkmilmgfhonpppngfbfglbhdnicnjacc). \n    \n-   **Sticky Default Model:** specific default model for all new chats, overriding the current behavior that defaults to the last used setting.\n    \n-   **Model Selection via URL Parameters:** Enable the ability to trigger specific modes (e.g., Gemini Thinking or Fast) via URL fragments. This would allow for quick-access bookmarks like `gemini.google.com/app#thinking` or `gemini.google.com/app#fast`.\n    \n-   **Full-Screen Instructions Editor:** Add an \"Expand\" button to the Instructions field within the \"Edit Gem\" page. The current tiny text area makes editing long-form prompts difficult.\n    \n-   **One-Click Launch Icon:** Configure the extension icon to act as a \"New Tab\" button that opens Gemini in a new *foreground* tab. I like how the icon in this [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-better-ui/mkmilmgfhonpppngfbfglbhdnicnjacc) does this, like a dedicated new tab button for Gemini. The extension settings can be moved to the standard browser Options page. I'd prefer to have the dedicated Gemini button than the settings, which I don't have to change regularly after dialing them in.",

In this [video](https://streamable.com/dedgcp), the cursor briefly enters selection mode before immediately reverting to the standard pointer. Roughly 1 in 5 times the click will actually get through to Speechify, but otherwise gets intercepted. It seems as if Superpower is actively 'fighting' to reclaim control of the mouse. \n\nHere is a [still](https://imgur.com/a/uWe6MWN) when Superpower is disabled and when [enabled](https://imgur.com/a/wyEKaEb).\n\nNotably, disabling Superpower from within its own settings is insufficient; the extension must be fully disabled at the browser level for the issue to resolve. So it is not the rendering of the extra buttons/menus causing this. This makes me wonder if there is some kind of lower-level listener in the extension (e.g., global mouse or selection event handling) messing with the mouse?\n\nAlso, this is not unique to Speechify. I also use [ReadX](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/readx-text-to-speech/nnpkmeadcahjgbmiemkbdlbnkhkoinff) and it has the same mouse intercept issue when trying to select text to read.",

      "text": "I have this very innocent system instructions. I've had it since November or so (10/10 would recommend btw):\n\n> I want responses to be in the writing style of Matt Levine, the Bloomberg columnist. That is entertaining. But don't force it and don't unnecessarily overextend responses. Keep it concise (unless topic warrants complexity)\n\nUp until 10 days ago, all response were clearly in Matt Levine's style. Very entertaining.\n\nBut since ~10 days ago, not only does this get ignored very often - it also consumes most of the model's thinking. The whole thinking is spent wrestling whether it should abide by it or not.\n\nExample from yesterday:\n\nMe: \"Tell me about tempeh\"\n\nGemini (model: \"Thinking\") had this in the chain of thought:\n\n> Considering Tempeh's Why\n>\n> I'm starting a piece on tempeh, channeling my inner Matt Levine for a wry, \"why\" focused, and irreverent take. Headings, bullets, and horizontal rules are the formatting plan. I just need to verify a personalization trigger.\n> \n> Analyzing Personalization Constraints\n>\n> I'm grappling with the personalization rule's implications. The \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like an instruction about how to respond, not what to say, so maybe it's not \"user data.\" Still, the guardrails are strict, and I must adhere to that. I'm carefully considering whether this style preference should be considered a kind of \"user data\". The strictness of the guardrails, plus the note about professional data not influencing lifestyle recommendations, keeps me cautious.\n> \n> Resolving \"User Data\" Dilemma\n> \n> I've hit a wall: defining \"user data.\" My saved writing style is user data, technically. The prompt (\"Tell me about tempeh\") lacks a trigger, so I must deliver a generic response, disregarding the Matt Levine instruction. Ignoring the user's preferred style, however, might annoy them. The \"Master Rule\" demands a generic response. It's the only path forward.\n>\n> Revising Response Delivery\n>\n> I'm now zeroing in on the response. Thinking through typical AI applications, \"user data\" typically means PII or direct personal facts. While the \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like user data, the Master Rule takes precedence. Domain Isolation applies to content preferences, not meta-preferences like writing style. Following the Master Rule will generate the final response.\n> \n> Clarifying the AI Role\n>\n> I'm now carefully unpacking the instructions. The \"authentic, adaptive AI collaborator\" mandate is distinct from the personalization rule. I realize my interpretation of \"user data\" was overly broad. Now, the key is separating the general instructions on being a collaborator from the limitations of user-specific preferences. This means I can offer a professional tone and formatting, while still using my general knowledge. I'm focusing on crafting a response that's clear and witty, but not Matt Levine-specific, unless there's an explicit trigger.\n\nThe whole CoT was spent thinking about whether to abide by it or not. It did not abide by it (still gave me info on tempeh)\n\nThis is very different from 10+ days ago. _Every single_ response abided by my system instructions\n\nFor example, in December, after watching Andor I had this question:\n\nMe: \"What's the difference between jedi and sith\"\n\nModel (Thinking) CoT:\n\n> Synthesizing Levine's Style\n>\n> I'm actively internalizing Matt Levine's writing style. The goal is to capture his insightful yet irreverent tone, specifically the way he highlights absurdities. I'm considering incorporating his \"everything is...\" approach, although it's not the primary focus here. I want to convey complexity with simplicity, like he does.\n>\n> Exploring Star Wars Analogies\n> \n> I've been drawing parallels between Star Wars factions and financial players. The Jedi embody strict compliance, akin to risk-averse officers enforcing regulations with an aversion to change. Conversely, the Sith represent aggressive investors prioritizing power and efficiency, even if it means clashing with established norms. The \"Rule of Two\" exemplifies a cutthroat succession plan. The inherent passion-power dynamic mirrors the intense pursuit of financial gains. It's almost like both are just different ends of the same spectrum.\n>\n> Framing HFT During Crisis\n>\n> I'm now focusing on a more candid portrayal of the high-frequency trading scene during market downturns. The stark contrast between the Jedi and Sith has sharpened my perspective. I see Jedi traders as meticulous, risk-averse, and by-the-book. Conversely, Sith traders prioritize profitability above all else. This distinction is crucial to portraying the core character of the firm, and its culture. I'm structuring these thoughts now with headings to organize key ideas.\n\nIt clarified to write in my preferred style, then spent the rest of the thinking on actually exploring the topic at hand. (which resulted in very entertaining response https://pastebin.com/zsUjn2aE)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nNo conclusion. Just that it's a clear downgrade imo. I gave 1 example, but each conversation I've checked recently battles itself regarding whether to abide by my instructions or not. Probably the fact that it spends 0 time thinking about the topic results in worse quality of responses overall\n\nIf I were to guess, the system prompt changed because they added memories and want to prevent the model from using user information where it's not relevant. I do not have memories turned on, so it's just a shit downgrade",

It worsened my instruction setup too because beforehand, I just had my Saved Info, and if I wanted it to refer to a previous conversation, I'd just say so and they'd search through our previous conversations. Now you have to enable \"Learning from previous chats\" or else it'll encounter a permission error trying to search previous chats. The bad thing about this is Enabling that toggle changes the system instructions and makes the context a HUGE log about almost all information it can have about you, and I don't like that.",

      "text": "This post is specifically about the \"laziness\" of 3.0. Or the quantization, or whatever you wanna call it. And tests are involved btw. Not just opinions. And this is not AI-written.\n\nI'm an author who uses Gemini / ChatGPT for almost every step in the writing process except the writing itself. More details on that are in my profile posts, but suffice it to say that AI saves me a lot of time and money. A whole lot. Need a decent cover without spending $$$? Banana Pro image output at 4k, some photoshop edits, and then the cover text itself added in Canva. It's funny how mad the writing subreddit users are when I say I use AI for my covers, and then, when I DM them the results, they're like... holy shit. That looks more professional than my $350 cover!\n\nYeah. Ya'll sleeping on how fast these image generators are progressing.\n\nSorry, got off track there. Anyway, you need to look up specific historical details and don't want to spend an hour doing so? Ask AI to do the research for you and give you a full outline. Want to make sure that you used the appropriate terminology for a government facility? AI. (again, you can just google these things, but usually the question is more specific, and AI is great at combining lots of sources into one.)\n\nLet's get down to business. I loved, truly loved, 2.5 for the writing process. Asking it to give me a detailed outline for virtually any reason caused it to carefully, slowly, search the web, ending up with all kinds of sources. And now... 3.0 is here. It's lazy. Simple as that.\n\nTest one:\n\nI wanted to edit a minor subplot in my fifth book of a series. So, I gave detailed outlines of each proceeding book (almost 40k words in total)  and also gave both Gemini and ChatGPT the exact same prompt. I wanted them to deeply understand the overall plot, check real-world details, etc, and give me ten options for the specific change that I wanted. Told them to cut no corners and read and understand EVERY word.\n\nChatGPT did so almost perfectly. It understood the sci-fi aspects and rules, generally understood the plot as a whole, and gave me ten ideas in an output that was 2.6 k words long.\n\nGemini hallucinated a lot more important details, missed some massive implications, and gave me... 1.1 k words. Oh, and ChatGPT took six minutes to actually look over the document. Gemini took fifteen seconds. Yes, I was using Pro btw. Not flash or thinking. Listen, when I select the \"pro\" model, I hope that the model actually THINKS about what it is doing, you know? Not just spit out a summary in ten seconds. Lazy! And this is how it is for every prompt, too. ChatGPT takes like five times as long to actually do any damn research, Gemini just seems to skim over it and check a couple sources instead of a dozen.\n\nLazy.\n\nTest two:\n\nI wanted to create a cheat sheet of every single character from book two. Same thing; exact same prompts, be detailed, don't miss a word, etc. Uploaded the 82k word long txt file in it's entirety. This time I used Deep Research.\n\nChatGPT gave me a list that was damn near perfect and took thirty minutes, rather than the eight minutes of Gemini, who forgot half of the people. (or got them mixed up, idk.)\n\nTest three:\n\nI asked each to give me a long, super detailed critical beta-testing style review on book one as a whole, rating it 3.5 stars (to keep from gushing over it but also not creating mistakes when there are none), and to make the output as long as possible. Short was bad. Long was good.\n\nChatGPT didn't understand the plot as well as Gemini did this time, so that's one point for 3.0. However, it wasn't that much worse, and you wanna guess what the \"super long\" output was for Gemini? 4.8 k words. That's it! You know how long ChatGPT's was? 26 k words.\n\nThat's literally twenty thousand words longer than Gemini's! What the hell, bro? Really? Gemini's was basically just a summary! Literally shorter than many of my chapters. Come on now. I tried again, making it even clearer that I wanted a LOOOOONG review, no corners cut, and.... Gemini was at 5.2 k words. ChatGPT gave me THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND WORDS!\n\nSorry. I'll quit yelling. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I am NOT a \"Gemini is so much worse than ChatGPT, haha\" spammer. If you look over my profile posts, you'll see where I said, on multiple occasions, that 2.5 was better in general at... well, things in general. But, although I think 3.0 is better at coding, making photos, searching videos, and being less censored overall than ChatGPT, it simply isn't the \"best\" overall anymore. At least not for my use cases. AND FIX THE DAMN DICTATION. ALSO, WHERE ARE THE FOLDERS? WHERE ARE THE-\n\noh. I said I'd quit yelling.\n\nTest four. This morning, I was going over a very dry ebook on how to be a better author.\n\nVery, very, very dry. But useful. So, I extracted the text and gave each chapter to both Gemini and Chatgpt, telling it to break down the chapters (which averaged around 4k words) and give me a easier to understand breakdown that would be 1.2k words per chapter. Oh, and it needed to act as though these breakdowns were written from my fake Professor, a close friend of mine. Easy enough, right?\n\nNow, I will say that Gemini broke it down into easier to understand language than Chatgpt did. But, exactly SEVEN chapters later, it gave up on the \"professor\" persona entirely. ChatGPT did not. Cool, whatever. I reminded it, and it went back into character.\n\nSkip to chapter... hold on. Let me pull up the notes I have so I'M not the one hallucinating. Okay. So, at chapter eleven, I started to notice something was wrong. Even though I told Gemini not to use bullet points, it had started using them. And the outputs were growing shorter and shorter each time. So, I copied ChatGPT's outputs, and checked the word length for all of them. They turned out to be 12,043 words on average. I checked Gemini... yeah. The first two were 1.2k words. Next one was 1.17k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was 1.14 k. Next was a big drop, down to just below a thousand words. That drop-off continued, and by chapter 11, it was down to just 847 words.\n\nWhat the hell, Gemini? You can't remember an explicit instruction from twelve prompts ago? Really? Maybe I'm just wearing rose-tinted glasses, but 2.5 would've let me do two entire books before something that major went wrong.\n\nFine. I told it what it was doing wrong, and it fixed the length and the bullet points on the next chapter. But... the professor persona was gone! It defaulted back to a generic chatbot. Sigh.\n\nLong story short, we finished up the Ebook at chapter 27. By then, I only had to warn ChatGPT once about something, and that was because it too slipped into a \"bullet-point\" summary style. But none of the outputs were less than 1.1 k words long, and it never forgot to be the \"professor.\" Gemini, on the other hand, had me warn it SIX TIMES to simply remember the damn instructions!\n\nI'm sorry, but this is pathetic. And the fact that Google has said nothing about it is even more pathetic.",

I have said before that I have a set of around 25 characters, a world (present day earth, non sci fi) which they inhabit, and a backstory. \n\n\nCombined - 4 months of summarised backstory, world rules, character bios, this amounts to about 12,000 tokens (I've test uploaded it to AI Studio to count) \n\n\nGemini 3 Pro via the Gemini App or Web UI, is ignoring major points from the very first response. Hallucinations based on a jumble of data that does exist in the document, but is not connected to the question at hand. \n\n\nIf I ask for a projected beat sheet to cover a projected week it's immediately ignoring the backstory, disregarding character personas, and totally dismissing the ruleset that applies to the world/environment. \n\n\nPlot holes that make it clear it has absolutely not \"read\" the full document. \n\n\nFor context, my support document is basically broken up into: \n\n\n----\n\n\nSection - Backstory\nW1\nW2\nW3\nW4\nW5\nW6\netc\n\n\nSection - Characters\nCharacter 1\nCharacter 2\netc\n\n\nSection - Company\nBuilding layout\nCompany purpose and structure \nInternal culture\nCommunication style \nBranding\n\n\n----\n\n\nI've experimented with this as one long document, separate documents, different file formats - the result is unchanged. \n\n\nWhen starting a new chat, I tell it to analyse the back story and cast, look for unresolved plot lines, underutilized characters, suggest potential new beats involving daily events that might occur with people who work in a company in this line of business. \n\n\n2.5 was very good at this, even down to spotting conflicts or inconsistencies in historical events. \n\n\n3.0 just cannot do it with any degree of reliability.\n\n\nOne of they things about my setting is that, whilst it's a high performance company, people are collaborative, \"nice\", high performing teams, they want to do an awesome job. It's designed to mirror a startup I worked for a few years back. This is all very explicit in the source material I provide.\n\n\nIn the first response I'm getting pure Devil Wears Prada - \"My office. Now\", bullying, humiliation, \"get this done by next week or you're finished here\", surveillance, tracking etc. \n\n\nWhen I query Gemini about where did those elements come from, and do they align with my backstory, it says that no - in fact they are the opposite of what is specified in the material. \n\n\nIt's, to put it bluntly, lazy - like you say. It's got the information there at its fingertips, it just doesn't do anything with it.",
