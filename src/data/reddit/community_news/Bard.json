After 3.0 Preview release, two things happened: It now never denies the request due to traffic, but all of the responses are so awful that even the normal model is producing better results. The time it takes to finish a task is now shorter.  You could argue optimization or better hardware but i believe they degraded the model by lowering the thinking time and parallel thinking to accommodate for the increase in users. \n\nI doubt that 3.0 GA would fix any of those issues, but i hope i am proven wrong.",

What’s strange is that the Pro model seems to be the most affected.\n\nMany people report that a gemini 3 flash (the weaker model supposedly) can produce better results on the exact same coding task. That inconsistency strongly suggests that the Pro version was deliberately limited.\n\nAnd that’s the wild part: instead of limiting free users, they seem to be limiting the users who are actually paying for quality.\n\nEven though Claude Code has stricter limits, it has now become my main agent because it feels more reliable.",

You can get Opus 4.5/4.6 in Antigravity right now on your Ultra subscription and it's quite close in overall usage compared to someone on Claude's similarly priced plan. I agree with you, u/Able-Line2683, elsewhere in this thread, that people should not give a company money until there's a commitment to quality of some kind, and will extend that with my own advice:\n\n\nDon't expect that giving a company money in one area (fixed use subscription) will automatically flow that money to the place where you want service. Instead, buy that exact set of services (API calls). I know it's more expensive. It's because the subscriptions are a taste, a subsidized price to get you in the door. It's also why they're deprioritized vs the API (you NEVER EVER EVERRR see people complaining about the API in here, even though it's used for FAR more mission critical things than any subscription is).\n\n\nI understand that they gave us all teasers, a taste of the good stuff. I understand that it's been enshittified. Let's recognize this AND also take responsibility for how we frame the reality: These companies are losing money hand over fist. That is not sustainable. So we either accept the low quality of service under the free/subscription model, with all of their missteps along the way in provisioning said services to those subscriptions in a coherent way. Or we can pay per use at the profitable run rate and expect extremely high quality.\n\n\nWhat more is there to say?",

              "text": "I did a series of thorough tests a month ago to compare the output length of 2026 Gemini 3 Pro vs release Gemini 3 Pro, and it was infuriating.. Had a few prompts which I ran 10-15 times in different chats each time at realease, then did the same recently again to compare. The difference was fucking staggering. In more than 80% of the cases, there was an up to 40-60% reduction in output tokens, using the exact same AI studio settings (default everything). Both the thinking length and reply length has been massively decreased compared to launch.\n\nJust look at this simple example prompt: `type 1 vs type 2 diabetes`\n\n2025 November average output tokens based on 10 runs: 2758 output tokens\n\n2026 January average output tokens based on 11 runs: 1135 output tokens\n- This coincided with the complaint post here mentioning Gemini 3 Pro degradation\n\n2026 February average output tokens based on 14 runs: 1918 output tokens\n\nDifferent prompt topics and complexities resulted in mostly the same findings. It's so infuriating building on Google's models, then having the rug pulled out from under you with these unannounced stealth changes. The benchmark companies need to run their benchmarks not only on release (when the model owners expect them to), but repeat it 2-3 months afterwards too. The results would shock everyone..",

I had a long chat and approximately half of all the input tokens came from the Chain of thought. If you get it deleted from the chat they will disappear.\n\nWith 3 it's different. They don't count the Chain of thought. At least 3 pro. 3 flash doesn't count them either for the first several messages, but after some time started to include them too. \n\nWeird thing, maybe they wanted to cut off the amount of tokens, by deleting the Chain of thought and leaving only those that are in the main chat.",

They can release all preview and experimental models they want but no one is going to use them since they are preview and not production models that are stable. 3 Pro preview still hallucinates, and skips instructions. This whole 3 series is crap and out of competition. If they can only give us a stable model and not another preview crap.

Also Im brazilian and English is a second language)  \n\n\nIn my work I constantly have to make pitch decks after meetings - until a year and a half ago, I had to take notes and do it by hand on powerpoint or whatever\n\nThen came apps to record and transcribe with absolute fidelity, then LLMs transforming all the talking in neat slides etc\n\nFor the actual design I had used paid versions of Gamma, [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai), Canva, and maybe 3 more\n\nResults varied a lot and I still had to always spend 30 min fixing by hand, had to learn Gamma's intricate editing UI (that works great, but it was a learning curve for me. their AI design editing was always a disaster for me).\n\nToday I decided to ask for Gemini with Canvas to transform a Word doc with a text heavy presentation into a pitch deck on a single HTML file \n\nBut I forgot to write \"HTML\" on the prompt\n\nA custom window poped up on Canvas and in 30 sec the slides were ready  \n  \nIt was inisde a frame with dedicated buttons review each  slide , to download it or send to Google Slides  \n  \nI also forgot to tell it not to paraphrase. So it condensed the text perfectly, better than I'd do in a hour of editing. 16 slides packed tight with objetctive info and a very tasteful design\n\nThen I felt bold and asked for 3 design alterations (switch the stock photos it linked to for icons, increase font size and kill one slide) and it did it perfectly\n\nThen I sent it to Google Slides and there is where the magic lives: full control in a simple visual UI to edit specific things\n\nWhat it gave me in 5 minutes would take me 2-3 hours yesterday WITH gamma, canva etc\n\n",

              "text": "Gemini 2.5 Pro was an incredible model. \n\nIt wasn't quite as smart as Opus 4.5, but it was still very good.\n\nThe only real issue I had with it was that it could become sluggish or lazy and require \"prompt pushing.\" However, the performance problems with Gemini 3 Pro (accessed via my Chrome browser) are *nothing* like what I'm currently experiencing.\n\nFor the past month, I spent considerable time refining my manually entered general instructions, meticulously ensuring they were well-written. I did the same for my various Gem custom instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to get Gemini 3 Pro to follow instructions effectively, let alone perform adequately. IMO, it's currently as poor as Copilot. This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated. It seems the developers prioritize the majority of users, who tend to be casual users and don't bother with custom instructions or tweaking. These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

As we get closer to AGI more and more people understand that this was never meant to generate profit but everyone that knows what is AI still had to pretend that this is about making money to make sure that enough investment was put into this tech from governments and rich people. And so as we get closer to AGI, focusing on customers instead of research seems like a waste from big corps. Google has infinite amount of money so they could just shutdown their service and focus entirely on AI if they were even slightly worried about not being the leading AI lab currently, or at least that's my guess on Google. The stakes are so high depending on how you believe an actual AI behave, meaning it's either autonomous and then it's a 50/50 between utopia and extinction, or we can keep it under control and that means extinction.\n\nGot sidetracked, about models just wait next months, every company implicitly agreed to downgrade their model as they get older and a newer model is to be released soon. Just wait for Gemini 3.5 which will obviously crush Claude Opus 4.6 by far and the cycle continues",
