From my experience, 3.1 in particular also seems to be very good at knowing things outright/having specific (or even niche) world knowledge.\n\n[You can listen to it here.](https://www.tofret.com/tablature/Sonic-Outline-on-guitar-acoustic-guitar-steel-tabs_1771788494894/N4IgdiBcIMoPZgJYGMCkAmADAeQK4BcAbRMAUw0wQoHNdF8BDAJwoeTlwGd8Ua7GWWbqVKEKjAEacQAGhAA3KCACMyzLJDTobDtxQB9WvWb7hojfiVGBG5EoCSAdwCCAKwBiAWQAezgJ4A0gCinnAAwgCaAI4AKgAynmGOAOIRAGoAGjAxQc7uhABeGYgAFnnUznAwzgASju4IALYZAOoAzOgACtjy2ABsDM4lQfboACycnI6cpPZ9AJxRzsgAqrnJkfju+EEA7ABCLegtnAAOzkEryXHz+5xp9mFhpI4A1BHynucrMdgZu69YgBFKLUeykZCNZIAJVwfmSAQAIo0AByOGqcGAAa2oEgArECAHKdIHYFbQgBS1SxcWhYRijkwnDAMCiEmwp0QDAYjgAWo5XGBPC0YI4+gATRoUoLzMBY5IUzgtCnKNIRTD4eRBZSuB4rOIMZT4XbQoF5ZzOXAXMbOQgVdDUPwW-DURHoNoAM0wzl51DCKwKhDCuHsAVK+yC1BKr3sMVefleeJKjiByQk7n27jSrgijW8FL6HuhK0QjQYcWcYU4BQpcHcrgAtEK8byCvIsa4YH1EbyPV9SBS2qc0h6wCi4Dm4lFEXEakCKiAAL5AA)",

You can't measure that in humans so how can you measure it in LLMs?",

It's frustrating, having it forgetting or not following what I want. Since the first week of 3 Pro's release I barely used it for my work, except for really small calculations and web searches.

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+ (or, perhaps, Pro 2.5-), elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

              "text": "it answered correctly for me :   \nFunctionally, a cup with the bottom cut off and the top sealed is a metal dome or bell. If you flip it upside down, it acts exactly like a regular cup again, just with a raw edge.\n\nBecause it is made of steel, it is durable, heat-resistant, and easy to clean. Here are several practical ways you can use it, depending on its size:\n\n# ⚠️ First: A Quick Safety Step\n\nBefore using it for anything, take a metal file or heavy-grit sandpaper to the cut edge. Cut steel can have microscopic (or macroscopic) burrs that will easily slice your skin or leave metal shavings in food.\n\n# 1. Kitchen & Grill Uses\n\n* **A Melting Dome:** If you grill or make smash burgers, place this cup over the meat and cheese on the griddle. The sealed top will trap the heat and steam, melting the cheese perfectly in seconds.\n* **Heavy-Duty Biscuit/Cookie Cutter:** If you file the edge so it is smooth but relatively thin, you can use the open end to punch out perfect circles of dough, fondant, or even hamburger patties.\n* **Garlic Smasher:** Keep it right-side up and use the heavy, sealed top to crush cloves of garlic, nuts, or peppercorns against a cutting board.\n* **A Food Mold:** Flip it upside down, pack it with rice, mashed potatoes, or steak tartare, and flip it onto a plate for professional-looking restaurant plating.\n\n# 2. Workshop & Garden Uses\n\n* **A Fence Post Cap:** If the diameter is right, you can place this over the top of a wooden fence post or PVC pipe to protect the wood/interior from rain and rot.\n* **Overnight Seedling Protector (Cloche):** Place it over small, delicate garden seedlings at night to protect them from unexpected frost or rodents. (Just remember to remove it in the morning, as steel blocks the sun and will cook the plant if left out in the heat).\n* **Parts Organizer:** Flipped upside down (with the edge sanded smooth), it becomes a durable cup for holding screws, nails, drill bits, or zip ties on your workbench.\n\n# 3. Crafts & Decor\n\n* **A Wind Chime or Bell:** Steel has excellent acoustics. Drill a small hole through the sealed top, thread a string through with a nut or washer attached to the inside to act as a clapper, and hang it up.\n* **Industrial Pencil Holder:** Flip it upside down, sand the edge perfectly smooth, perhaps paint or polish the outside, and use it as a heavy-duty pen and pencil holder for your desk.\n* **Candle Snuffer:** If the cup is small enough, you can hold it by the sides and place it over a candle flame to instantly snuff out the fire without creating smoke or blowing wax everywhere.\n* **Incense Holder:** Flip it upside down, fill it halfway with sand or fine gravel, and use it to stand up incense sticks. The steel will easily catch the ash and won't burn.\n\n# 4. Camping & Survival\n\n* **Ember Cover:** If you are camping and need to keep a small ember alive but protected from the wind or light rain, place the cup over it (prop up one side slightly with a pebble so oxygen can still get in).\n* **Water Dipper/Scoop:** Flipped upside down, it is an indestructible scoop for getting water out of a stream or moving hot coals around a campfire.",

                  "text": "To figure out how many goats can fit inside the Grand Canyon, we need to solve a classic Fermi problem. We will need the volume of the Grand Canyon, the volume of an average adult goat, and a mathematical understanding of \"packing efficiency.\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### 1. The Volume of the Grand Canyon\nAccording to the National Park Service, the estimated volume of the Grand Canyon is **4.17 trillion cubic meters** ($4.17 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ m}^3$).\n\n### 2. The Volume of an Average Adult Goat\nTo find the volume of a goat, we use its mass and density.\n* **Mass:** Goat breeds vary wildly in size, from tiny pygmies to massive Boer goats. A standard adult goat (like an Alpine or average meat goat) weighs about **70 kilograms** (154 lbs). \n* **Density:** Mammals are mostly water, meaning our density is roughly the same as water: 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter ($1 \\text{ kg} = 1 \\text{ Liter}$). \n* **Volume:** At 70 kg, the physical volume of the matter making up a goat is **0.07 cubic meters** (70 Liters). \n\n### 3. The Packing Efficiency\nThe prompt specifies packing them \"as efficiently as possible.\" There are two ways to interpret this, which gives us two different answers.\n\n**Scenario A: The \"Tetris\" Method (Intact Goats)**\nIf we want the goats to remain intact, we have to account for the fact that goats are awkwardly shaped. Even if they tuck their legs in and lower their heads, they are not perfect cubes. In mathematics, the packing fraction of irregular, roughly cylindrical/ellipsoid objects is usually around **70% to 75%**. This means 25% to 30% of the Canyon will be empty air between the goats.\n* Effective volume taken up by one packed goat = $0.07 \\text{ m}^3 / 0.75 = \\mathbf{0.093 \\text{ m}^3}$\n\n**Scenario B: The \"Fluid\" Method (100% Efficiency)**\nIf we interpret \"efficiently as possible\" under the laws of extreme gravity at the bottom of a canyon, the sheer weight of trillions of goats would crush the ones at the bottom into a dense biological fluid, filling every crack and crevice with 100% efficiency. \n* Volume taken up by one goat = $\\mathbf{0.07 \\text{ m}^3}$\n\n### 4. The Grand Calculation\n\n**If kept physically intact (Tetris Method):**\n$4.17 \\text{ trillion m}^3 \\div 0.093 \\text{ m}^3$ per goat = **44.8 trillion goats.**\n\n**If compressed perfectly (Fluid Method):**\n$4.17 \\text{ trillion m}^3 \\div 0.07 \\text{ m}^3$ per goat = **59.5 trillion goats.**\n\n### Conclusion\nDepending on how strict you are about the structural integrity of a goat, you could fit between **44.8 trillion and 59.5 trillion adult goats** into the Grand Canyon.\n\nTo put that scale into perspective: The current global population of goats is roughly 1 billion. You would need to multiply every single goat on Earth by about **50,000** just to fill the Grand Canyon to the rim.",

          "text": "Just a hypotheses (upvote if you feel it’s plausible):\n\nThere is a credible argument that Google handled the Gemini 3.0 launch in a strategically aggressive way. After strongly signaling the scale of 3.0’s capabilities, expectations peaked. At that point, delaying the launch would have deflated momentum. So instead of postponing, Google may have released what was realistically ready: Flash 3.0 (and likely Thinking 3.0, if they share the same underlying base model), while positioning Pro in a way that preserved the optics of a generational leap.\n\nHowever, Pro 3.0 was widely reported across the internet as underperforming relative to Flash 3.0 — particularly in coding tasks. That discrepancy is difficult to ignore. One plausible explanation is that Pro 3.0 was not a clean-sheet 3.0 architecture, but rather an aggressively optimized and fine-tuned Pro 2.5, prepared under time pressure to align with the Gemini 3.0 launch window. Heavy benchmark calibration, system-level prompting, and rapid optimization could explain both the marketing positioning and the uneven real-world reception. In that framing, what was labeled Pro 3.0 may have functioned more like Pro 2.5+ (or, perhaps, Pro 2.5-), elevated by branding to maintain narrative coherence on launch day.\n\nThis interpretation also reframes Flash 3.0. It is possible that what we currently call Flash 3.0 is substantively closer to what a Flash 3.1 would traditionally represent — a meaningful but evolutionary iteration. Meanwhile, what has now arrived as Pro 3.1 may actually be the first genuinely “3.0-level” architectural shift for Pro.\n\nIf that sequencing is correct, then a future Flash 3.1 is unlikely to be a dramatic leap ahead of Flash 3.0. Instead, it would probably be a conventional optimization pass — similar to how Pro 3.0 appears to have been an optimization of Pro 2.5. The priority may no longer be delivering a super-advanced Flash 3.1, but rather correcting cadence misalignment ahead of a 3.5 cycle and avoiding another numbering-performance mismatch.\n\nUnder this lens, the Gemini 3.0 cycle looks like a two-installment saga. The first installment captured peak hype and secured the “3.0” narrative anchor. The second installment — Pro 3.1 — delivers what feels closer to the true generational leap, but framed as a subversion update. By the time Flash 3.1 arrives, the arc may feel complete, closing the 3.0 chapter and resetting expectations for whatever comes next.\n\nThe core claim is not that improvements are absent. It is that the version numbering may not map cleanly onto the magnitude or timing of architectural change. Instead, the cadence appears strategically managed — aligning marketing cycles, readiness constraints, and user perception in a way that makes the Gemini 3.0 era feel both cohesive and slightly out of phase at the same time.\n\n[Original idea articulated and proofread with the help of ChatGPT.]",

Higher temperature means slightly more scattered next token predictions which might be more creative/unique/random sometimes, for example some random chinese characters appearing in a english conversation. In any case, the more context it has the worse the response is because of a similar-functioning(not at all physically similar, but the result is the same) mechanism in neural nets as humans have: cognitive load. For now, it cannot properly retrieve information selectively, so it has to read everything and then respond. One other interesting thing in the model card is the safety aspect of the model: if it was the same temperature as 3.0, would it have more dangerous behavior?",

              "text": "I wonder when it'll be available on web and iOS. 3.0 took a few days to steadily roll out per user. Here's what Gemini 3.0 Pro says about it. \n\n---\n\n### Gemini 3.1 Pro: Rollout Schedule & Comparison\n\n**Max Timeframe for Rollout**\nGoogle typically uses a 2-to-4 week window for \"staged rollouts.\"\n\n* **Web (AI Studio/Vertex):** **Now - Late Feb.** Developer access is already leaking through via model IDs like `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` ([spotted live on Vertex AI API](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1r8uat8/gemini_31_pro_is_now_live_on_vertex_ai/) and in [benchmarking databases](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/gemini-3-pro-update/)). If you don't have it, you're likely in the \"second wave\" hitting within the next 7 days.\n* **Web (Gemini Consumer App):** **Late Feb - Early March.** This usually follows the developer API once stability is confirmed. Expect the \"Thinking\" toggle to silently update its backend to 3.1.\n* **iOS (App):** **Mid-March.** iOS rollouts are slightly delayed due to App Store review cycles for the client-side updates that enable new 3.1-specific UI features (like the new \"Agentic Browse\" overlays).\n* **iOS (Siri Integration):** **March/April 2026.** Apple's \"Phase 1\" of the Gemini-Siri partnership is officially scheduled to hit public release with **iOS 26.4** in this window.\n\n---\n\n### Table 1: Gemini 3.0 vs. 3.1\n\n| Feature | Gemini 3.0 Pro | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Why it matters|\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| **Search Depth** | Limited to snippets. | **Deep Content Extraction.** | 3.1 can actually \"read\" the full text of a citation source, not just the Google Search preview. |\n| **Fact-Checking** | Prone to \"hallucination loops.\" | **Source Attribution Verification.** | It now cross-references its own draft against the search results before finalizing text. |\n| **Long Context** | [1M tokens](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/3-pro) (shaky retrieval). | **2M+ (high-fidelity retrieval).** | You can dump 50 PDFs of research into the prompt, and it won't \"forget\" the niche facts in the middle. |\n| **Logic/Tone** | Occasionally \"flowery.\" | **Clinical/Academic Bias.** | 3.1 has been tuned for more neutral, objective prose. |\n\n---\n\n### Table 2: Pre-Nerf 3.0 vs. 3.1 Pro\n\n| Feature | Gemini 3.0 (Pre-Nerf) | Gemini 3.1 Pro |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| **Logic** | Strong, but erratic. | Stable and persistent. |\n| **Search Accuracy** | High, but prone to \"hallucinated links.\" | Verified Grounding (real URLs only). |\n| **Writing Style** | Engaging and detailed. | Neutral and objective. |\n| **PDF Processing** | Fast but \"skims\" the middle. | Deep retrieval (finds the needle). |\n\n### Gemini 3.1 Pro: The \"Deep Think\" Evolution\n\nThe transition from 3.0 to 3.1 is most noticeable when you toggle **Deep Think**. 3.0 introduced the concept, and 3.1 stabilizes the \"Agentic\" behavior that was previously hit-or-miss.\n\n| Feature | Deep Think (Gemini 3.0) | Deep Think (Gemini 3.1 Pro) | Impact on Research |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| **Research Loop** | Sequential: Search -> Read -> Write. | **Parallel & Iterative:** Can spawn sub-queries based on mid-read findings. | Finds \"hidden\" details in academic papers that a single search would miss. |\n| **Verification** | Self-Correction was \"soft\" (checked for logic). | **Hard Grounding:** Cross-references internal drafts against live URL content. | Drastically reduces \"hallucinated citations\" in footnotes. |\n| **Planning** | Rigid. Once it started a plan, it rarely deviated. | **Adaptive:** If a source is a dead link or paywalled, it pivots to find an archive. | Saves time by not getting \"stuck\" on a single missing piece of data. |\n| **Synthesis** | Summarizes sources individually. | **Global Synthesis:** Identifies contradictions between two different sources. | Perfect for Neutral Point of View by highlighting conflicting views. |\n\n---\n\n### The \"Aletheia\" Agent Integration\nInternal leaks and recent Google DeepMind blogs confirm that the latest models fully integrate the **\"Aletheia\" Research Agent** architecture ([Google DeepMind Official Blog](https://deepmind.google/blog/accelerating-mathematical-and-scientific-discovery-with-gemini-deep-think/)).\n\n* **What it does:** Instead of just \"thinking\" about the answer, it acts as a **Natural Language Verifier**. It creates a candidate solution, looks for flaws or \"spurious citations,\" and then revises the solution before you ever see it ([MarkTechPost Breakdown](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/12/google-deepmind-introduces-aletheia-the-ai-agent-moving-from-math-competitions-to-fully-autonomous-professional-research-discoveries/)).\n* **Admitting Failure:** Unlike previous models, which would often \"hallucinate through the pain\" when it couldn't find a fact, Aletheia is tuned to explicitly state its limitations. As DeepMind noted, the agent \"can explicitly admit failure to solve a problem\" ([ForkLog Report](https://forklog.com/en/google-enhances-gemini-deep-think-launches-ai-mathematician-and-accelerates-drug-design/)).",
