Articles refresh automatically every 10 mins but can be refreshed at any time.\n\nClicking on the article, tickers, or crypto adds them to an input that accept multiple urls, tickers, sectors and then creates a deep dive analysis snapshot for each in a separate tab.

Sometimes they give you extra quota but if you’re conducting research notebook LM is a really good alternative, or just use normal Google Gemini. The whole point of AI studio is for organisations and developers to create and  deploy apps and agents etc.  That’s why we have to pay for subscriptions when we want to use AI apps because it cost a lot of money/tokens to use the AI models. I found all this out the hard way when I was experimenting with AI studio to generate images. I thought it would be easier to do multiple images at once like a storyboard. I  generated five images and got charged £20\n\nI highly recommend [galaxy.AI](https://galaxy.ai/?via=B2b-reddit) is $15 a month which is less than that in British pounds. So that you get 15 million tokens and as many different AI models as you can imagine all on one platform it’s incredible. The amount of tokens you’ll use depends on which model you’re using. I haven’t run out yet though I haven’t been using it as much. You can buy extra tokens. \n\nThey have hundreds of different models, for all the purposes you can think of! \n\nThere’s also an affiliate program LOL so make sure you click the link I’ve sent you ha ha!

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down:  \n[**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

The evolution of AI coding assistants has progressed through distinct phases*\" and literally *never* gets near an answer to my question, just writing nebulous filler about loosely related topics like a student trying to hit a word count minimum.

This would allow for quick-access bookmarks like `gemini.google.com/app#thinking` or `gemini.google.com/app#fast`.\n    \n-   **Full-Screen Instructions Editor:** Add an \"Expand\" button to the Instructions field within the \"Edit Gem\" page. The current tiny text area makes editing long-form prompts difficult.\n    \n-   **One-Click Launch Icon:** Configure the extension icon to act as a \"New Tab\" button that opens Gemini in a new *foreground* tab. I like how the icon in this [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-better-ui/mkmilmgfhonpppngfbfglbhdnicnjacc) does this, like a dedicated new tab button for Gemini. The extension settings can be moved to the standard browser Options page.

In this [video](https://streamable.com/dedgcp), the cursor briefly enters selection mode before immediately reverting to the standard pointer. Roughly 1 in 5 times the click will actually get through to Speechify, but otherwise gets intercepted. It seems as if Superpower is actively 'fighting' to reclaim control of the mouse. \n\nHere is a [still](https://imgur.com/a/uWe6MWN) when Superpower is disabled and when [enabled](https://imgur.com/a/wyEKaEb).\n\nNotably, disabling Superpower from within its own settings is insufficient; the extension must be fully disabled at the browser level for the issue to resolve. So it is not the rendering of the extra buttons/menus causing this. This makes me wonder if there is some kind of lower-level listener in the extension (e.g., global mouse or selection event handling) messing with the mouse?\n\nAlso, this is not unique to Speechify. I also use [ReadX](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/readx-text-to-speech/nnpkmeadcahjgbmiemkbdlbnkhkoinff) and it has the same mouse intercept issue when trying to select text to read.",

I know what model I am using, I can edit whatever prompt I feel like, I can edit the response and have it work on that. It does not end every response with that stupid 'would you like' question and for the most part it listens to you when the wind blows east, and I take that as a win. I would pay for it, I just do not trust google with any pay as you go stuff at all, but if the normal web app was like that, it would really be nice. But they will not, since this is google, and they make the most coddling, bizarre, choices. And that is okay since I put my lot with them.

      "text": "I have this very innocent system instructions. I've had it since November or so (10/10 would recommend btw):\n\n> I want responses to be in the writing style of Matt Levine, the Bloomberg columnist. That is entertaining. But don't force it and don't unnecessarily overextend responses. Keep it concise (unless topic warrants complexity)\n\nUp until 10 days ago, all response were clearly in Matt Levine's style. Very entertaining.\n\nBut since ~10 days ago, not only does this get ignored very often - it also consumes most of the model's thinking. The whole thinking is spent wrestling whether it should abide by it or not.\n\nExample from yesterday:\n\nMe: \"Tell me about tempeh\"\n\nGemini (model: \"Thinking\") had this in the chain of thought:\n\n> Considering Tempeh's Why\n>\n> I'm starting a piece on tempeh, channeling my inner Matt Levine for a wry, \"why\" focused, and irreverent take. Headings, bullets, and horizontal rules are the formatting plan. I just need to verify a personalization trigger.\n> \n> Analyzing Personalization Constraints\n>\n> I'm grappling with the personalization rule's implications. The \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like an instruction about how to respond, not what to say, so maybe it's not \"user data.\" Still, the guardrails are strict, and I must adhere to that. I'm carefully considering whether this style preference should be considered a kind of \"user data\". The strictness of the guardrails, plus the note about professional data not influencing lifestyle recommendations, keeps me cautious.\n> \n> Resolving \"User Data\" Dilemma\n> \n> I've hit a wall: defining \"user data.\" My saved writing style is user data, technically. The prompt (\"Tell me about tempeh\") lacks a trigger, so I must deliver a generic response, disregarding the Matt Levine instruction. Ignoring the user's preferred style, however, might annoy them. The \"Master Rule\" demands a generic response. It's the only path forward.\n>\n> Revising Response Delivery\n>\n> I'm now zeroing in on the response. Thinking through typical AI applications, \"user data\" typically means PII or direct personal facts. While the \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like user data, the Master Rule takes precedence. Domain Isolation applies to content preferences, not meta-preferences like writing style. Following the Master Rule will generate the final response.\n> \n> Clarifying the AI Role\n>\n> I'm now carefully unpacking the instructions. The \"authentic, adaptive AI collaborator\" mandate is distinct from the personalization rule. I realize my interpretation of \"user data\" was overly broad. Now, the key is separating the general instructions on being a collaborator from the limitations of user-specific preferences. This means I can offer a professional tone and formatting, while still using my general knowledge. I'm focusing on crafting a response that's clear and witty, but not Matt Levine-specific, unless there's an explicit trigger.\n\nThe whole CoT was spent thinking about whether to abide by it or not. It did not abide by it (still gave me info on tempeh)\n\nThis is very different from 10+ days ago. _Every single_ response abided by my system instructions\n\nFor example, in December, after watching Andor I had this question:\n\nMe: \"What's the difference between jedi and sith\"\n\nModel (Thinking) CoT:\n\n> Synthesizing Levine's Style\n>\n> I'm actively internalizing Matt Levine's writing style. The goal is to capture his insightful yet irreverent tone, specifically the way he highlights absurdities. I'm considering incorporating his \"everything is...\" approach, although it's not the primary focus here. I want to convey complexity with simplicity, like he does.\n>\n> Exploring Star Wars Analogies\n> \n> I've been drawing parallels between Star Wars factions and financial players. The Jedi embody strict compliance, akin to risk-averse officers enforcing regulations with an aversion to change. Conversely, the Sith represent aggressive investors prioritizing power and efficiency, even if it means clashing with established norms. The \"Rule of Two\" exemplifies a cutthroat succession plan. The inherent passion-power dynamic mirrors the intense pursuit of financial gains. It's almost like both are just different ends of the same spectrum.\n>\n> Framing HFT During Crisis\n>\n> I'm now focusing on a more candid portrayal of the high-frequency trading scene during market downturns. The stark contrast between the Jedi and Sith has sharpened my perspective. I see Jedi traders as meticulous, risk-averse, and by-the-book. Conversely, Sith traders prioritize profitability above all else. This distinction is crucial to portraying the core character of the firm, and its culture. I'm structuring these thoughts now with headings to organize key ideas.\n\nIt clarified to write in my preferred style, then spent the rest of the thinking on actually exploring the topic at hand. (which resulted in very entertaining response https://pastebin.com/zsUjn2aE)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nNo conclusion. Just that it's a clear downgrade imo. I gave 1 example, but each conversation I've checked recently battles itself regarding whether to abide by my instructions or not. Probably the fact that it spends 0 time thinking about the topic results in worse quality of responses overall\n\nIf I were to guess, the system prompt changed because they added memories and want to prevent the model from using user information where it's not relevant. I do not have memories turned on, so it's just a shit downgrade",

It worsened my instruction setup too because beforehand, I just had my Saved Info, and if I wanted it to refer to a previous conversation, I'd just say so and they'd search through our previous conversations. Now you have to enable \"Learning from previous chats\" or else it'll encounter a permission error trying to search previous chats. The bad thing about this is Enabling that toggle changes the system instructions and makes the context a HUGE log about almost all information it can have about you, and I don't like that.",

Especially with that 24 hour chat session vanishing into thin air last month (I’d actually shared a post about that) and after talking to the support team, we realized Gemini had completely forgotten that conversation.\n\nLast week I finally said enough is enough and angrily asked Gemini why it wasn’t using my saved info. It gave me things that sounded plausible but were honestly just ridiculous.\n\nIf I’m saving that information, I’m doing it because I want it to be used. I want it to answer properly within the framework I’ve requested instead of giving some generic response, but it gets stuck debating whether to use it or not by treating it as personal data.\n\nIf that’s the case, then why does \"Saved Info\" even exist?\n\nIf I have to say \"respond according to my personal preferences\" every single time, why is that \"Saved Info\" nonsense even sitting there as a feature?",
