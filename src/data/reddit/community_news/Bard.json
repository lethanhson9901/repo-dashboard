GPT 5.2 is better than free, duh, but I wasn't getting significantly better results in my use case, and found AI Studio to be more reliable. GPT has big ideas, but sucks at implementing them, imo. The code never seems to work right, and I'm constantly feeding its outputs to gem or claude and they are fixing its errors.\n\nSo, no...I don't think gpt is better than gemini. What is your use case? Maybe it works better for you in your domain.",

Am I supposed to buy Plus or Ultra plan, knowing that it's borderline fraud (maybe I'm using not the right English word, but in the best case they're failing to deliver their promises to users)? We're talking about a massive rescinding of the deal with the same price.\n\nLet's just fucking hope that they get a new version of 3 Pro up in running soon and it all gets to mormal state of things again.",

AI Studio is built for developers, not for average users looking for a handout. That free tier was *never* intended to replace a paid subscription or a real API key. They were generous at first when they had the scale and they wanted to draw people in. \n\nThe free ride is over and honestly it's about time.

Sometimes they give you extra quota but if you’re conducting research notebook LM is a really good alternative, or just use normal Google Gemini. The whole point of AI studio is for organisations and developers to create and  deploy apps and agents etc.  That’s why we have to pay for subscriptions when we want to use AI apps because it cost a lot of money/tokens to use the AI models. I found all this out the hard way when I was experimenting with AI studio to generate images. I thought it would be easier to do multiple images at once like a storyboard. I  generated five images and got charged £20\n\nI highly recommend [galaxy.AI](https://galaxy.ai/?via=B2b-reddit) is $15 a month which is less than that in British pounds. So that you get 15 million tokens and as many different AI models as you can imagine all on one platform it’s incredible. The amount of tokens you’ll use depends on which model you’re using. I haven’t run out yet though I haven’t been using it as much. You can buy extra tokens. \n\nThey have hundreds of different models, for all the purposes you can think of! \n\nThere’s also an affiliate program LOL so make sure you click the link I’ve sent you ha ha!

Most of these tools quietly tighten rate limits when usage spikes or when certain features (like grounding/search) are enabled, even on paid plans. The “Pro” label doesn’t really mean unlimited, it usually just means a higher ceiling that can still move.\n\nWhat makes it feel ridiculous is the lack of transparency. If they clearly said 'X requests per day for this mode', people would plan around it. Instead you hit a wall mid-session and it feels like something broke.\n\nI’ve basically learned to treat these tools as bursty assistants, not something you can lean on continuously all day. Still frustrating though, especially when you’re paying.",

I know what model I am using, I can edit whatever prompt I feel like, I can edit the response and have it work on that. It does not end every response with that stupid 'would you like' question and for the most part it listens to you when the wind blows east, and I take that as a win. I would pay for it, I just do not trust google with any pay as you go stuff at all, but if the normal web app was like that, it would really be nice. But they will not, since this is google, and they make the most coddling, bizarre, choices. And that is okay since I put my lot with them.

I dumped all 15 PDFs into the prompt at once.\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Analyze these documents. Create a table comparing the 'Q3 Project Spend' figures across all files. Highlight any document where the numbers contradict the Master Budget in 'File\\_A.pdf'.\"*\n3. **Result:** It not only found the 3 specific contradictions but cited the exact page numbers for me to verify.\n\nOne reason Gemini shines here is that it’s built for developer and knowledge-worker workflows, not just chat. If you’re curious why features like large context handling, Workspace-native analysis, and structured document comparison work so well, this course breaks it down:  \n[**Introduction to Developer Efficiency with Gemini on Google Cloud**](https://www.netcomlearning.com/course/introduction-to-developer-efficiency-with-Gemini-on-google-cloud)\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"Workflow\" where Gemini completely destroys the competition?",

      "text": "I have this very innocent system instructions. I've had it since November or so (10/10 would recommend btw):\n\n> I want responses to be in the writing style of Matt Levine, the Bloomberg columnist. That is entertaining. But don't force it and don't unnecessarily overextend responses. Keep it concise (unless topic warrants complexity)\n\nUp until 10 days ago, all response were clearly in Matt Levine's style. Very entertaining.\n\nBut since ~10 days ago, not only does this get ignored very often - it also consumes most of the model's thinking. The whole thinking is spent wrestling whether it should abide by it or not.\n\nExample from yesterday:\n\nMe: \"Tell me about tempeh\"\n\nGemini (model: \"Thinking\") had this in the chain of thought:\n\n> Considering Tempeh's Why\n>\n> I'm starting a piece on tempeh, channeling my inner Matt Levine for a wry, \"why\" focused, and irreverent take. Headings, bullets, and horizontal rules are the formatting plan. I just need to verify a personalization trigger.\n> \n> Analyzing Personalization Constraints\n>\n> I'm grappling with the personalization rule's implications. The \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like an instruction about how to respond, not what to say, so maybe it's not \"user data.\" Still, the guardrails are strict, and I must adhere to that. I'm carefully considering whether this style preference should be considered a kind of \"user data\". The strictness of the guardrails, plus the note about professional data not influencing lifestyle recommendations, keeps me cautious.\n> \n> Resolving \"User Data\" Dilemma\n> \n> I've hit a wall: defining \"user data.\" My saved writing style is user data, technically. The prompt (\"Tell me about tempeh\") lacks a trigger, so I must deliver a generic response, disregarding the Matt Levine instruction. Ignoring the user's preferred style, however, might annoy them. The \"Master Rule\" demands a generic response. It's the only path forward.\n>\n> Revising Response Delivery\n>\n> I'm now zeroing in on the response. Thinking through typical AI applications, \"user data\" typically means PII or direct personal facts. While the \"Matt Levine style\" request feels like user data, the Master Rule takes precedence. Domain Isolation applies to content preferences, not meta-preferences like writing style. Following the Master Rule will generate the final response.\n> \n> Clarifying the AI Role\n>\n> I'm now carefully unpacking the instructions. The \"authentic, adaptive AI collaborator\" mandate is distinct from the personalization rule. I realize my interpretation of \"user data\" was overly broad. Now, the key is separating the general instructions on being a collaborator from the limitations of user-specific preferences. This means I can offer a professional tone and formatting, while still using my general knowledge. I'm focusing on crafting a response that's clear and witty, but not Matt Levine-specific, unless there's an explicit trigger.\n\nThe whole CoT was spent thinking about whether to abide by it or not. It did not abide by it (still gave me info on tempeh)\n\nThis is very different from 10+ days ago. _Every single_ response abided by my system instructions\n\nFor example, in December, after watching Andor I had this question:\n\nMe: \"What's the difference between jedi and sith\"\n\nModel (Thinking) CoT:\n\n> Synthesizing Levine's Style\n>\n> I'm actively internalizing Matt Levine's writing style. The goal is to capture his insightful yet irreverent tone, specifically the way he highlights absurdities. I'm considering incorporating his \"everything is...\" approach, although it's not the primary focus here. I want to convey complexity with simplicity, like he does.\n>\n> Exploring Star Wars Analogies\n> \n> I've been drawing parallels between Star Wars factions and financial players. The Jedi embody strict compliance, akin to risk-averse officers enforcing regulations with an aversion to change. Conversely, the Sith represent aggressive investors prioritizing power and efficiency, even if it means clashing with established norms. The \"Rule of Two\" exemplifies a cutthroat succession plan. The inherent passion-power dynamic mirrors the intense pursuit of financial gains. It's almost like both are just different ends of the same spectrum.\n>\n> Framing HFT During Crisis\n>\n> I'm now focusing on a more candid portrayal of the high-frequency trading scene during market downturns. The stark contrast between the Jedi and Sith has sharpened my perspective. I see Jedi traders as meticulous, risk-averse, and by-the-book. Conversely, Sith traders prioritize profitability above all else. This distinction is crucial to portraying the core character of the firm, and its culture. I'm structuring these thoughts now with headings to organize key ideas.\n\nIt clarified to write in my preferred style, then spent the rest of the thinking on actually exploring the topic at hand. (which resulted in very entertaining response https://pastebin.com/zsUjn2aE)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nNo conclusion. Just that it's a clear downgrade imo. I gave 1 example, but each conversation I've checked recently battles itself regarding whether to abide by my instructions or not. Probably the fact that it spends 0 time thinking about the topic results in worse quality of responses overall\n\nIf I were to guess, the system prompt changed because they added memories and want to prevent the model from using user information where it's not relevant. I do not have memories turned on, so it's just a shit downgrade",

I need to manage my conversation history efficiently.\n\n\n\nConversation branching - Being able to create branches from conversations is crucial for my work process.\n\n\n\nI've really enjoyed using Gemini and would prefer to stay in the ecosystem, but the recent restrictions are making it difficult to maintain my productivity.

The problem I am not sure they recognize is how bad the usual Pro subscription UI AND usability is. Temperature setting these models especially 3, makes all the difference between Opus grade code and GPT 2.5. And you can not do that in the subscription version. Also the subscription version freezes, slows down and gets unusable much faster then the AI studio one. This is why I used AI studio. Now they are expecting us to use the \"API to keep the conversation going\" :D that means on average a 2 dollar cost PER PROMPT and the longer your chat gets the more this will cost. \n\nSo this is the problem, hope they recognize this and implement the Pro subscription limits into AI studio soon !",
