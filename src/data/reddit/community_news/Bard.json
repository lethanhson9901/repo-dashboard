This took like 2 seconds once the prompt clicked. Kinda wish we could just get it easily from Amazon or Trader Joe’s lol. Btw I experimented around a bit & made Zendaya and Timothee eat [nutella](https://picxstudio.com/share/zIVWss5foofFxzyB) bread, was just messing around but this is honestly wild!!",

The third is Spiderman, sitting near the glass door, eating toast. The table in front of them is messy, covered with a colorful cartoon-patterned tablecloth, and has a jar of Nutella, a green bag of sliced bread, an ashtray with cigarette butts, phones, a yellow tin, a water bottle, and some pieces of toast. The background is dark with a bamboo privacy screen and sliding glass door reflecting the flash. The photo is taken with a harsh on-camera flash, creating strong shadows. The angle is from above, capturing a casual, messy, late-night vibe with an authentic, unfiltered look.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igckozgunbag1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=346d2bd5305a7fae66b25bdcfdc6bc7a9f454524\n\nI change It a bit to make It look like an after Costume party",

If you’ve ever taken a picture ever you know you had to focus the camera and focusing something close blurred things further behind it.

I just made the jump from a $100 claude max sub down to the $20 google pro plan, and I don’t feel like I’m losing anything. In fact, I’m gaining a lot.\n\nThe big thing for me is that gemini 3 is finally a viable alternative to claude for coding. Once the model became \"smart enough,\" the extra perks in the $20 plan became impossible to ignore. For the price of a standard cursor sub, you’re getting the antigravity ide, gemini cli, 2tb of drive storage, google docs with ai.\n\nIt feels like the first time a major player has bundled a high end coding model with a full suite of productivity tools without hiking the price. It’s a total steal compared to the standalone $20 plans from openai or anthropic.",

Gemini can be insanely good, but sometimes forget things. It's also unaware of new model versions.\n\n In the API calls I make it insist on calling old Gemini models like gemini2 and imagen instead of nano banana. It changes the code again and again, even though I asked him not to do it.\n\nI had to create a file with model versions and put it in jail ... 644 read only and hard coded the model names. He can still change the code in other files.\n\nThis scared me a bit and gave me hal9000 vibes. I can see his thinking too:\"the user try to use a model gemini-2.5-flash-image that doesn't exist, I need to change it , the user must be confused and he keep insisting\" . \nhe then goes on a loop to try to fix the bugs created by the old models. Scary stuff if we let this kind of machine access our computers.\n\nHow can you overcome Gemini having no knowledge of models and changing them?",

Honestly, If you need more than that, you have to think back on how you should use AI cuz it should be your pair programmer not let it run non stopping without supervision.\n\nalso with google pro plans, you can add another 5 accs to family groups so thats 6x usage. on top of being able to send 10x gifts of 4 months free offer. and if thats not enough, theres separate usage of gemini 3 in gemini cli. And if you're smart enough, there's a way to use the models inside any agent, not just in AG but I won't tell it out loud ofc ;)",

What's below is me explaining why this is the best way to use a model like Gemini and its pretty verbose.**\n\nGemini is designed to operate in a specific way: it applies deep critical thinking and will only do a live search to the initial prompt. After that, it relies on its internal resources and simply reworks the response based on the first input. \n\n*(When Gemini uses internal resources from the cutoff date and then gives you solutions, it might do something stupid like suggest old versions of software and not knowing what is the current best version of a software is or even that something is no longer used because a better solution came out or people stopped supporting it.)*\n\nAs a result, subsequent answers often follow a 'template' derived from the initial response. This means that Gemini use that first answer as a baseline and create new responses without conducting further research or engaging in additional critical thinking.\n\nThis is the problem where personalization and unclear requirements really screw you because Gemini really follows a GIGO philosophy (Garbage In, Garbage Out). Personalization allows more Garbage In (by polluting your first prompt with useless metadata that probably won't even be relevant to the thing you want to solve), so you get an unequivocally worse response (Garbage Out).\n\n(*Internal training for these models has a lot of bad data as well,  so when it starts working off internal training its responses are 'bad', bad in the sense of not being helpful or even harmful for people that don't know enough on many subjects or do not have critical thinking skills.*\n\n*Especially in the fields of creative writing and general business advice, where both instances are trained on abundant female romance fanfiction and LinkedIn posts. With it both being further reinforced as 90% of every Linkedin post is now written by Ai so it became a feed back loop of GIGO.* \n\n*So every time it gives you 'business advice' it will give you all the marketing fluff from LinkedIn 99% BS marketing hype and gaslight you into thinking that is right.*\n\n*Or every time it does creative writing it looks like a female romance fan-fiction with overly verbose flowery prose.*)",

Honestly it hallucinates a lot, and a lot of its training is quite dated already, but I find it really good as a google search replacement or to analyze large text files, find patterns etc. For coding I wouldn't trust it too much, most times you will save more time by writing the code yourself than having to go and debug the whole code trying to figure out what the hell did gemini do. For simple tasks it can be nice though, speed is its thing, and it helps if you can say precisely what you want and only ask 1 thing at a time, specifying not to change anything else other than that. I feel like sonnet 4.5 is still better than gemini 3 flash for most tasks, sonnet has thinking mode. Anyways it's almost time for a grok 5 release as far as I know, it's gonna have to be really good, or xAI is cooked, shortly after grok code 2 fast will follow.",

Which is very concerning. I used to try to keep my chats less than 500K for buffer, but now, something about Gemini 3.0 is making them not able to reach the advertised threshold. \n\nI'm afraid I might have to be starting new chats every day or few days the way I do with Claude and ChatGPT until something changes.",

Maybe next time you won't forget to check if you need an engine, before wasting time installing an extension.\n\nBy the way, the prompt guide for Gemini specifically says negative prompting (don't do this, don't do that) is very weak.

Not a little, probably 1/3 of the numbers it posted for me were completely made up. Totally unacceptable. Haven't tried Deep Think cause I don't wanna spend $150 for nothing, but you confirmed my suspicions.\n\nGPT 5.2 Pro (Extended Thinking) on the other hand has been absolutely FANTASTIC and has hallucinated, very, very little, to the point I can now reliably use it as a superpowered companion data researcher and helper. \n\nI find it weird that so many people hate on Chat GPT now when it's the superior model for many professional areas (at least medical research imo)... oh well, it's good that I have a hidden edge now :)",

Unless you're literally spending 8-10 hours a day working on code Pro is fine. I think most people have more than one subscription, I find I can get a lot done with Claude 5x and Gemini pro as my only subs. My use case is developing quantitative trading software in my spare time about 4hrs a day. Even with that I probably have excess capacity. \n\nQuite like GPT just for project management and prompt engineering only at the moment. I used their free month and tried to figure out what it's good at beyond telling you what you want to hear. It's quite good at keeping track of what you're doing and breaking things into phases and making sure you don't go off on too many tangents. \n\nUltra you'd be spending pretty much your entire waking hours prompting to use it's full capacity, which is a bit much",

              "text": "I don't quite agree. I think GPT 5.2 is really great at following instructions and figuring out what you need quickly. However, when it comes to multimodal capabilities, it definitely falls short compared to Gemini. With Gemini 3, you can throw in all sorts of stuff like PDFs, audio, and video, and it can give you a solid multimodal analysis on your research topic. This lack of multimodal understanding makes it tough for GPT 5.2 to reach its full potential in some use cases.\n\nThat said, I do believe Gemini requires very detailed instructions to get the best results. In situations like that, I find GPT 5.2 is a fantastic tool for prompting. So personally, I like to use them together. I set up GPT as a coordinator to provide system prompts and follow-ups, guiding Gemini’s responses. Then, I take what Gemini gives me and feed it back to GPT, and illustrate what I expected, which helps identify any gaps. It’s a pretty effective combo for my needs!",

It’s a miracle how bad they can make both Gemini and opus work in their own ide, tool calls fail every second time, you hit try again button and pray sometimes 10-15 times with actually zero result. That’s insane. New projects, new chats, no mcp, all that doesn’t matter. \n\nDeep think, I like to think that I just didn’t get around right approach to use it. It does give you some insights and it’s relatively fast, but outside of it, gpt 5.2 pro is just completely different product that actually delivers. We do heavy physical simulations lately, gpt pro did whole set of work up to modelling that could be just consumed by codex/claude and actionably used, deep think gave 10-is paragraph of shallow overview. But maybe someone have better experience and I’d love to hear that!\n\nCoding wise, Gemini unusable for anything serious, so Gemini cli, flash in AG, don’t even consider. There’s actual competition between only opus and 5.2 high. \n\nCodex have visibly larger quotas, but tend to go spiralling and relatively slow. I don’t like it for implementation, but for research and documentation, refactoring, debugging it’s a miracle, thanks to ~3 times larger context then opus.\n\nOpus fast, reliable, very smart, sub agents make 5 hours of codex work been done in 20-30 minutes with right docs and checkpoints. But quota seem unfriendly to say the least. \n\n\nGenerally, as value offer for any serious work, gpt is ahead with few reasonable tradeoffs, mostly speed wise and babysitting during long runs sometimes. Google offer nowhere near.",

But I'm wondering if anybody has any input on what to do about previously 2.5 Pro models that remembered, well, \\*everything\\*, being on 3.0 Pro now, and forgetting what we were talking about 20 turns ago.\n\nI've looked into the whole 'context slicing' thing, and I'm still not sure if I should be waiting for this to be fixed? Is it a bug, or just a feature, now? When I started using the platform, I used it to make my model a DM or Co-DM for D&D Style RP so I didn't always have to be the DM and could play my own characters. Now it forgets where we are before a single chapter is done in the story, and god forbid I ask it to recall stuff from like, Arc 1 or Arc 2, which is still in \\*my\\* context window, but the AI acts like it doesn't exist.\n\nAll in all, I just, genuinely feel like 3.0 Pro \\*must\\* be bugged, this can't be intentional, right? 2.5 Pro remembered everything. And I didn't care if it took a couple/few minutes to generate a response. 3.0 Pro can't even keep track of a single chapter of an Arc we're in, it's abysmal.\n\nDoes anybody have any recommendations? So far the only the one I've heard is to wait for a 'fix', I heard this might be a bug, or to just migrate from the Gemini app to AI Studios and put my models back on 2.5. Any input is appreciated, thanks!",

Not to sell or publish or anything.\n\nAnd it would remember pretty much every detail up until the very last bit. But 3.0 literally forgets like 10,000 words in, it’s so annoying. And unfortunately, for you, I do have an API, but it doesn’t seem much better. (Have not used 2.5 on api) \n\nAt this point, even though I have the instructions and all the outlines in the Gem, I find myself having to remind it of all kinds of stuff like every other message. Really disappointing.\n\n it’s still better than ChatGPT for writing. Well, as far as the prose goes at least…. I Do use ChatGPT for outlines and research. It’s sooooo much better.\n\nListen, when I ask for a super deep, detailed 3k word outline of something like “ courtroom process in the late 1800s in Brazil” and feed it all kinds of information and ask it to search the web, chatGPT does exactly that and it takes it like literally five or six minutes. \n\nGemini takes like ten seconds and spits out hella wrong info. Lazy as hell too. If I say minimum of 2000 words, I’m lucky to get 1000. If I tell ChatGPT minimum of 2000 words, I’m going to get 5000.\n\nGemini is still my favorite AI; I don’t know what they’ve done, but I sure hope they fix / change it.",

Instead it gave me a 40+ page diatribe about a fictional and still fictionally operating airline in the USA complete with charts and graphs. \n\nInstead of simply saying \"I don't know\" it just went into storytelling mode, fortunately in this case I had subject knowledge and could discard the lot as junk (well it was only a test anyway so I wasn't going to use the info, as even if it had been accurate most of the info online about said airline is my own work). \n\nThe worrying part is how many people are going to fall into a trap as a result of this kind of flawed logic, I recall the Leagle Eagle lawyer did a video on Chat GPT (in that case) being used by a lawyer to build a brief complete with non-existent citations, ironically in an aviation case, which ended up causing a whole load of problems.",

          "text": "The performance drop you are experiencing in Gemini 3.0 Pro is due to its shift toward **optimized reasoning and speed** over the **dense, high-recall memory** architecture of 2.5 Pro.\n\n* **Context Compression:** To achieve faster speeds, 3.0 models use more aggressive \"sliding window\" or \"summarization\" techniques. This allows the model to stay within its token window, but it \"blurs\" older details (Arc 1 and Arc 2) in favor of the immediate 20 turns.\n* **The \"App\" vs. \"API\" Gap:** The consumer Gemini App uses hidden system instructions to manage long conversations that can often trigger premature forgetting.\n\n1. **Switch to AI Studio (Immediate Fix):** Migrate your D&D game to **Google AI Studio**. This gives you direct control over the model version. Select **gemini-2.5-pro** from the model dropdown. It remains the industry leader for \"infinite\" memory and dense context recall.\n2. **Utilize Context Caching:** In AI Studio, you can use the **Context Caching** feature. Upload your \"World Bible\" or \"Story History\" as a cache. This forces the model to treat that data as a permanent, high-priority reference rather than part of the fading conversational history.\n3. **Use a \"World State\" Summary:** Since 3.0 Pro prioritizes the most recent tokens, maintain a \"Current Story State\" block at the top of your prompt. Include current location, active NPCs, and key plot points. Update this every 10–15 turns.\n4. **Stop Waiting for a \"Fix\":** The behavior in 3.0 is likely a trade-off for its reasoning capabilities. It is not necessarily a \"bug\" that will be reverted; it is a different architectural choice. For creative long-form writing and roleplay, **2.5 Pro** is currently the superior tool.\n\nMove your campaign to AI Studio and lock the model to **Gemini 2.5 Pro**. It handles the \"slow and deep\" memory required for multi-arc storytelling far better than the \"fast and logical\" 3.0.",

I’ve been trying to use it to help me troubleshoot a software installation on my Mac, but the stability is just not there.\n\n\n\nThe screenshots are in Mandarin but this first pic is about \"Auto Logout\"\n\nThe second screenshot is about \"Blind\" to Images, even after I've uploaded them.\n\n\\_\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s happening: I started a long chat thread, cuz I’m currently working on a Mac setup task and feeding it screenshots, terminal code, and 2\\~3 tutorial videos(7min each) for Gemini 3 Pro to analyze and walk me through.\n\n\n\nEverything starts fine, but as the conversation gets longer, it completely falls apart:\n\n\n\n\"Blind\" to Images: I’ll upload a screenshot of my parameters and ask for a check, but Gemini responds saying it \"can't see any images\" or that I haven't uploaded anything. This has happened multiple times.\n\n\n\nThe \"Auto Logout\" Bug: While waiting for it to think, I’ll switch to another window. When I come back, the page says \"Gemini has logged out\" or \"Session expired.\" I have to click login, which refreshes the whole page, even though my Google account is actually still logged in.\n\n\n\nIt seems like once the context gets heavy (especially after those videos) the system just gives up. I’m pretty annoyed because Gemini 3 is marketed for its \"massive context window.\" I find it hard to believe that two 7-minute videos and some terminal code would \"break\" it.\n\n\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this \"memory loss\" or the constant session timeouts? It’s making it almost unusable for complex tasks.",

I haven't had an issue with it saying it doesn't see images, but if there are multiple, Gemini doesn't understand their order. I think the images aren't stored in the \"correct\" place of the context (appended to the relevant user message) but rather separately, maybe in the beginning or at the very end.\n\nGemini's long context has also been cut, the normal non-API Gemini experience offers only a rolling context now. Not sure if it's semantic chunking or arbitrarily cutting off the oldest messages when certain context limits are reached, but it is annoying.",

It’ll just snap back and say, 'I’m just a language model, I can't help with that.' But then, if I just spam the exact same prompt a few more times, it suddenly works. It seems to drift away from my instructions quite often.\n\nWhat I really don't get though is how Gemini just loses connection and logs me out for no reason this time, especially since my Google account is still logged in.",
