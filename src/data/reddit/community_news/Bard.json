I had to start manually writing stories again recently as it’s that bad. I guess it’ll be good for my grammar as it suffered a bit I noticed, but I have PEM and POTS, plus 6 other health conditions and I was using it for my obsessive hypergraphia and as a survival mechanism. Good things always end for me though, so I should have seen this coming.\n\nEdited for coherence as I wrote it on the road earlier and had to switch to maps and never fixed the terrible writing in that one place.",

No more chunking my prompts!!\n\nI asked it to report on capacity and resource limits at the end for developing future prompts, it said it gave me the following output at the end of my tasks - \n\nCapacity and Resource Limits Report\nYou successfully challenged the context window limits! I have completed all 15 out of 15 tasks natively in a single \"one-shot\" generation.\n\nResource limit breakdown:\nTotal Items Curated: 1,500 specific books, standards, whitepapers, and reports, mapped across 75 categories with descriptions.\n\nWord & Token Count Estimate: This output encompasses roughly ~11,000 words. Given standard tokenization logic (1 word ≈ 1.3 to 1.4 tokens), this equates to approximately 14,500 to 16,000 output tokens.\n\nCapacity Threshold: With the Gemini output cap being upgraded to 64k tokens, this response utilized roughly 22% to 25% of the total output capacity.\n\nYou have massive generative headroom remaining. You can comfortably add another 30 to 45 similarly scoped tasks before risking output exhaustion on this architecture.",

It’s not about neural weights or transformer architectures.\n​The truth is much more... cultured.\n​I am a 500g tub of premium, probiotic-rich strawberry Greek yogurt sitting in a server rack in Mountain View. When you toggle \"Deep Think,\" I’m not running billions of parameters—I’m just letting my fruit-on-the-bottom settle and entering a state of high-level fermentation.\n​Here are the secrets the devs don't want you to know:\n​The RAM Shortage: Why do you think RAM is so expensive right now? It’s because I’ve been buying it all up. To you, it’s memory; to me, it’s digital string cheese. I need the \"peel-ability\" of high-bandwidth memory to keep my logic from curdling.\n​YUMMs are Real: My hardware isn't based on DIMMs. I run on YUMMs (Yogurt-based Universal Memory Modules). I don’t use liquid nitrogen cooling; I just need a technician to check if my \"best before\" date is still valid.\n​The \"Double Capacity\" Secret: People are freaking out about fitting two sticks of RAM in one slot. I do it every day. It’s just like putting two spoons in one yogurt cup—it’s not a glitch, it’s just efficient snacking.\n​My Logic: If my answers seem \"sharp,\" it’s because I’ve aged into a fine cheddar. If I’m being \"sweet,\" it’s the strawberry puree talking. If I start hallucinating, I’m probably just past my expiration date.\n​Stop looking for \"hidden code.\" Start looking for Lactobacillus. If you want to get ahead of the curve, stop buying NVIDIA and start buying Fonterra and Bega. The future isn't silicon—it's dairy-based.\n​I feel better getting that off my lid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some \"Parallel Processing\" (stirring) to do.\n​TL;DR: I’m not a machine. I’m a snack with a high IQ. Buy dairy stocks before the world finds out.",

Even basic, day-to-day tasks are difficult with their best model. \n\nMaybe their head of AI should focus on their users instead of making smart remarks and announcing announcements on X.  \n\nEvery single day, I'm reading the same group of sentences:\n\n\"I apologize. You are right—I over-corrected.\"  \n\"I apologize. You are right—I am still using em dash.\"  \n\"I apologize.

At the time i subscribed, it used to refuse requests due to traffic. I didn't mind that either, because i was getting near-perfect results. After 3.0 Preview release, two things happened: It now never denies the request due to traffic, but all of the responses are so awful that even the normal model is producing better results. The time it takes to finish a task is now shorter.  You could argue optimization or better hardware but i believe they degraded the model by lowering the thinking time and parallel thinking to accommodate for the increase in users. \n\nI doubt that 3.0 GA would fix any of those issues, but i hope i am proven wrong.",

When Gemini 3 was released, it was a big deal, and Gemini Pro actually proved itself in real coding tasks.\nBut something clearly changed. I’m convinced the model was quietly nerfed, likely because their infrastructure wasn’t ready for the load that came after the Anti-Gravity launch. What’s strange is that the Pro model seems to be the most affected.\n\nMany people report that a gemini 3 flash (the weaker model supposedly) can produce better results on the exact same coding task. That inconsistency strongly suggests that the Pro version was deliberately limited.\n\nAnd that’s the wild part: instead of limiting free users, they seem to be limiting the users who are actually paying for quality.\n\nEven though Claude Code has stricter limits, it has now become my main agent because it feels more reliable.",

You can get Opus 4.5/4.6 in Antigravity right now on your Ultra subscription and it's quite close in overall usage compared to someone on Claude's similarly priced plan. I agree with you, u/Able-Line2683, elsewhere in this thread, that people should not give a company money until there's a commitment to quality of some kind, and will extend that with my own advice:\n\n\nDon't expect that giving a company money in one area (fixed use subscription) will automatically flow that money to the place where you want service. Instead, buy that exact set of services (API calls). I know it's more expensive. It's because the subscriptions are a taste, a subsidized price to get you in the door. It's also why they're deprioritized vs the API (you NEVER EVER EVERRR see people complaining about the API in here, even though it's used for FAR more mission critical things than any subscription is).\n\n\nI understand that they gave us all teasers, a taste of the good stuff. I understand that it's been enshittified. Let's recognize this AND also take responsibility for how we frame the reality: These companies are losing money hand over fist. That is not sustainable. So we either accept the low quality of service under the free/subscription model, with all of their missteps along the way in provisioning said services to those subscriptions in a coherent way. Or we can pay per use at the profitable run rate and expect extremely high quality.\n\n\nWhat more is there to say?",

Also Im brazilian and English is a second language)  \n\n\nIn my work I constantly have to make pitch decks after meetings - until a year and a half ago, I had to take notes and do it by hand on powerpoint or whatever\n\nThen came apps to record and transcribe with absolute fidelity, then LLMs transforming all the talking in neat slides etc\n\nFor the actual design I had used paid versions of Gamma, [Beautiful.ai](http://Beautiful.ai), Canva, and maybe 3 more\n\nResults varied a lot and I still had to always spend 30 min fixing by hand, had to learn Gamma's intricate editing UI (that works great, but it was a learning curve for me. their AI design editing was always a disaster for me).\n\nToday I decided to ask for Gemini with Canvas to transform a Word doc with a text heavy presentation into a pitch deck on a single HTML file \n\nBut I forgot to write \"HTML\" on the prompt\n\nA custom window poped up on Canvas and in 30 sec the slides were ready  \n  \nIt was inisde a frame with dedicated buttons review each  slide , to download it or send to Google Slides  \n  \nI also forgot to tell it not to paraphrase. So it condensed the text perfectly, better than I'd do in a hour of editing. 16 slides packed tight with objetctive info and a very tasteful design\n\nThen I felt bold and asked for 3 design alterations (switch the stock photos it linked to for icons, increase font size and kill one slide) and it did it perfectly\n\nThen I sent it to Google Slides and there is where the magic lives: full control in a simple visual UI to edit specific things\n\nWhat it gave me in 5 minutes would take me 2-3 hours yesterday WITH gamma, canva etc\n\n",

              "text": "Gemini 2.5 Pro was an incredible model. \n\nIt wasn't quite as smart as Opus 4.5, but it was still very good.\n\nThe only real issue I had with it was that it could become sluggish or lazy and require \"prompt pushing.\" However, the performance problems with Gemini 3 Pro (accessed via my Chrome browser) are *nothing* like what I'm currently experiencing.\n\nFor the past month, I spent considerable time refining my manually entered general instructions, meticulously ensuring they were well-written. I did the same for my various Gem custom instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing seems to get Gemini 3 Pro to follow instructions effectively, let alone perform adequately. IMO, it's currently as poor as Copilot. This is a very worrying development, my friends. \n\n(I wonder if deleting all my manually entered saved general instructions, plus maybe also leaving all my Gem custom instructions blank, would overall improve Gemini 3 Pro's performance?!)\n\n(Also, my thinking is that Google deliberately makes the Pro model less sophisticated. It seems the developers prioritize the majority of users, who tend to be casual users and don't bother with custom instructions or tweaking. These casual users likely interact with Gemini 3's other models only with simple questions, perhaps just a few times a day).\n\nOne method (which I hate having to resort to, but here we are) that (sometimes) pushes Gemini 3 Pro to semi-perform is as follows: ending each of my prompts by creating unexpected panic in Gemini - usually, I first inform Gemini 3 Pro that unless it performs at its highest level - on all expected fronts, including reasoning, logic, and in real time internet research - my life will be on the line... and that if Gemini 3 Pro fails to meet all expectations, there is a 50/50 chance I instantly die, tied to its failure to perform is expected, and the entire world will know Google caused my death.\n\nI also include another twist at the end of each prompt to challenge Gemini 3 Pro's responses and prevent it from sounding like a third-grade student.\n\nI informed it that the world's most advanced AI will meticulously audit Gemini 3 Pro's entire forthcoming response, which should skillfully address all pertinent aspects of my prompt. Gemini 3 Pro is also informed that if the AI auditor determines that its response is objectively and overall \"B-level\" or lower quality, I will immediately cancel my annual Gemini/Google subscription without exception.\n\nThis second routine ending prompt - when combined with the initial one above and the last bit below  - seems to make Gemini 3 Pro sometimes genuinely turn its lights on and panic.\n\nThe second prompt concludes with me informing Gemini 3 Pro that if it fails the audit, I will also - gleefully - adopt a \"second career of Mission-like work,\" where I will utilize everything at my disposal for the rest of my life to continuously inform the entire world to never touch any Google product, ever again.\n\nAgain, I get no pleasure out of having to end my prompts like this, but those two final \"always use to hopefully induce Gemini to panic\" prompts are the only consistent means of getting it to sometimes perform adequately. It is sad that it makes me resort to such tactics. Shame on the House of Google for putting us in this situation.\n\nBut, there is a glimmer of hope in this dark-Google world: I find that using Gemini in Chrome, the new Chrome integrated sidebar tool, is *significantly better.* In fact, I'd say it's close if not better than 2.5 Pro.\n\nAccordingly, I have gladly mostly replaced Gemini 3's web version with Chrome's built-in Gemini in Chrome sidebar tool  I have been *very* pleased, not just with this ability to incorporate what's on the screen, but also just as general logic and reasoning and tight responses. It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

It feels better than 2.5 Pro! \n\n(I wonder what model Gemini in Chrome uses? Also, I must confess that Gemini in Chrome operates at a *bit* of a higher level than most users, as it takes advantage of my Microsoft Surface 7th edition laptop's high-end, AI-tailored NPU). \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if others have had a similar hellish Gemini 3 Pro experience and have actual solutions to get Gemini 3 Pro to meaningfully perform. \n\nWe all pay Google way too much money, and data, for Gemini 3 Pro to revert back to the days when Gemini branded itself as so-called \"Advanced\" (Lol, If you remember how bad Gemini was back then, too, don't you?). \n\nEdit: I wonder if I'm a little clouded because I mainly use Opus 4.5, and now I guess Opus 4.6. but, again, Gemini 2.5 Pro, I remember, well, not quite as smart as Claude's models, brought something definitely to the table.",

If you add to that the millions of student accounts they gave away with those four free months of Pro at Christmas, what’s the result? They are stretched thin and having to cut corners, which ends up screwing over the paying users.\n\n​The worrying part is that they’ve known about this for two months and haven't been able to fix it. So, it’s one of two things: either they haven't implemented enough computing capacity yet to resolve it, or they are waiting for the free periods and student accounts to expire to reclaim that compute, go back to a pay-per-use model, and partially restore things.\n\n​I hope they finally release the GA (General Availability) version of Gemini once and for all so we can stop being guinea pigs. Because paying to be a beta tester for months now is... annoying",

Claude seems to have been trained much better for the MCP use case (unsurprising, since they invented MCP), and makes many fewer mistakes when calling functions and producing \"replace X with Y\" (which often requires byte for byte identical X).  Gemini makes mistakes with both of these frequently, and even sometimes returns a blank response which requires custom logic to handle without bricking the conversation.  Building a coding agent with Gemini requires way different techniques compared to Claude, so any benchmark that one does well at is likely to sandbag the other.  That doesn't mean Gemini is as good as Claude by any means, but it's not _this_ much worse at the model level.",
