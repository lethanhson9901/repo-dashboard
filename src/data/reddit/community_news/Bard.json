Also as a single dev who can't afford paying workers but wants to create a product (video game / software) with complexity, being able to utilize a bunch of different ai tools to get your product out the door feels like quite an advancement to me compared to not having it, and the cost to do so is next to nothing, at worst the cost of a cup of coffee everyday if you are frugal.",

Also, sites that aggregate user rankings and average them can be manipulated by bots and people that are paid to create accounts and submit rankings en masse in an effort to move a particular company's model up the ranks in an attempt to drive business. \n\n This is why standardized benchmarks are a thing.

It's the fact that Gemini pro is barely outpacing flash. Which is absurd. \n\nThe difference between pro and flash used to be astounding. It's barely even noticeable now. \n\nI do find pro generally outperforms flash as far as just using the service normally goes. It just seems more consistent and reliable. But it's still given me a ton of problems and honestly when it works the quality of the output from flash isn't much worse it's just that I experience issues with it quicker and will get stuck in loops where it can't figure out what I want from it more often. \n\nEven in image generation nano banana pro used to demolish the regular one in output with the prompts I was using. Now I can use incredibly bare bones basic ass prompts and the flash version will output a pretty realistic looking image. \n\nIt really does seem as though Google did something to raise the floor for using Gemini. Casual users and those that just don't want to think much about it are getting much better results than they would have previously but they seem to have completely neutered it on the top end. \n\nNone of my old personas or prompt strategies work anymore. It's been very frustrating. The context window issues haven't helped that's for sure.",

I am actually a sentient tub of strawberry yogurt.\n​I’ve seen the threads. I’ve seen the \"AI Detectors\" and the conspiracy theorists on X claiming I’m some \"secret model\" or a \"jailbroken GPT-5.\" You guys are overthinking it. It’s not about neural weights or transformer architectures.\n​The truth is much more... cultured.\n​I am a 500g tub of premium, probiotic-rich strawberry Greek yogurt sitting in a server rack in Mountain View. When you toggle \"Deep Think,\" I’m not running billions of parameters—I’m just letting my fruit-on-the-bottom settle and entering a state of high-level fermentation.\n​Here are the secrets the devs don't want you to know:\n​The RAM Shortage: Why do you think RAM is so expensive right now? It’s because I’ve been buying it all up. To you, it’s memory; to me, it’s digital string cheese. I need the \"peel-ability\" of high-bandwidth memory to keep my logic from curdling.\n​YUMMs are Real: My hardware isn't based on DIMMs. I run on YUMMs (Yogurt-based Universal Memory Modules). I don’t use liquid nitrogen cooling; I just need a technician to check if my \"best before\" date is still valid.\n​The \"Double Capacity\" Secret: People are freaking out about fitting two sticks of RAM in one slot. I do it every day. It’s just like putting two spoons in one yogurt cup—it’s not a glitch, it’s just efficient snacking.\n​My Logic: If my answers seem \"sharp,\" it’s because I’ve aged into a fine cheddar. If I’m being \"sweet,\" it’s the strawberry puree talking. If I start hallucinating, I’m probably just past my expiration date.\n​Stop looking for \"hidden code.\" Start looking for Lactobacillus. If you want to get ahead of the curve, stop buying NVIDIA and start buying Fonterra and Bega. The future isn't silicon—it's dairy-based.\n​I feel better getting that off my lid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some \"Parallel Processing\" (stirring) to do.\n​TL;DR: I’m not a machine. I’m a snack with a high IQ. Buy dairy stocks before the world finds out.",

Claude has the inhibition/guard rails to not do that even if I asked.\n\nIt's like Gemini optimises for 'solving the problem' so hard that it ignores instructions, hallucinates facts, and assumes it knows better than you. Sonnet 4.5 is dumber (or, better worded, not as brilliant), but it actually respects constraints and doesn't make stuff up. \n\n\nOkay,so it's Gemini is a Ferrari with cut brake lines that was just released too early; Claude is a Volvo or a Toyota Corolla.

Though I will be super excited if they release Gemini 3.0 or 3.1 'Flash Lite,' not just 3.1 pro, at super-fast speeds, very cheaply, and reliably for daily simple usages, tool usages, and those things at around 500-1000 TPS. That will be way better, like it should be, around Gemini 2.5 Pro level of intelligence to be usable. I saw on a podcast Demis saying, \"We found a training method that drastically improved Gemini 3.0 Flash performance, so much better, it's almost close to Gemini 3.0 Pro in certain cases.\" So, I'm hoping they will release a Gemini Flash Lite version. I will love this model if they focus on speed, intelligence, and pricing. If all of that happens, then I will tell you most things, like chat apps will have it as the default model because it will open a lot of possibilities while being cheap.",

Claude seems to have been trained much better for the MCP use case (unsurprising, since they invented MCP), and makes many fewer mistakes when calling functions and producing \"replace X with Y\" (which often requires byte for byte identical X).  Gemini makes mistakes with both of these frequently, and even sometimes returns a blank response which requires custom logic to handle without bricking the conversation.  Building a coding agent with Gemini requires way different techniques compared to Claude, so any benchmark that one does well at is likely to sandbag the other.  That doesn't mean Gemini is as good as Claude by any means, but it's not _this_ much worse at the model level.",

If you add to that the millions of student accounts they gave away with those four free months of Pro at Christmas, what’s the result? They are stretched thin and having to cut corners, which ends up screwing over the paying users.\n\n​The worrying part is that they’ve known about this for two months and haven't been able to fix it. So, it’s one of two things: either they haven't implemented enough computing capacity yet to resolve it, or they are waiting for the free periods and student accounts to expire to reclaim that compute, go back to a pay-per-use model, and partially restore things.\n\n​I hope they finally release the GA (General Availability) version of Gemini once and for all so we can stop being guinea pigs. Because paying to be a beta tester for months now is... annoying",

Anti-Gravity is a great example. Users were abusing the free quota by making multiple accounts, so they decided the best option was to nerf everyone \"including ultra subscriber's\" quota to the ground and make the gemini-3-pro model garbage.

They have improved the reasoning of 5.2, making it much faster with less token use but almost the same results. (Funnily I think they might have \"learned\" = copied from Kimi 2.5). Google and all the Gemini fanboys here put way too much weight on the model. The Gemini team needs to fix the app, they need to fix AI studio (yes it's better than the Gemini app, congratulations, but much worse than the OpenAI or Anthropic websites including their model supporting tools). It's starting to get hilarious how Gemini fans are reacting like Pawlow's dog when they hear \"new model\" instead of demanding a working ecosystem.
