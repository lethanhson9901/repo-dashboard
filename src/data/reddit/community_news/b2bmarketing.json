      "text": "Hey everyone, I've spent the last few years running Reddit campaigns for clients across different industries, and I keep seeing the same mistakes over and over. Most brands either treat Reddit like Twitter (big mistake) or ignore it completely because they think it's just memes and arguments.\n\nHere's what actually drives results:\n\n**1. Reddit SEO is Evergreen (and Most People Are Sleeping on It)**\n\nUnlike every other social platform where your post dies in 24 hours, Reddit content lives forever and keeps bringing traffic.\n\nReddit posts rank insanely well on Google. A huge chunk of Reddit threads land in the top 5 search results, especially for product searches and review queries.\n\nTraffic compounds over time. A well-placed post from 6 months ago can still drive clicks daily if you targeted the right keywords.\n\nBoth broad and hyper-specific keywords work. The key is knowing which subreddits your audience actually hangs out in.\n\nHow to find opportunities:\n\nUse Ahrefs Keyword Explorer to find high-volume keywords that are trending up\n\nLook at your competitors' blog posts that rank well—then create Reddit discussions around similar topics with broader angles and similar keywords\n\nYour Reddit post will often rank right next to (or above) those blog posts if you do it right\n\n**2. Brand Protection on Reddit Isn't Optional Anymore**\n\nHere's something that caught a lot of companies off guard: ChatGPT and other AI tools now pull from Reddit threads to answer questions about products and companies.\n\nYour potential customers are asking AI \"what do people think about \\[your company\\]?\" and getting answers based on Reddit discussions\n\nSome competitors have figured this out and actively use Reddit to trash-talk other brands\n\nIf you're selling high-ticket products/services, your buyers are 100% reading Reddit threads about you during their research\n\nThe shift is real: Reddit used to be niche, but it's becoming more mainstream. More people = more conversations about brands = bigger impact on your reputation.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nUse F5Bot (free tool) to monitor mentions of your brand name across Reddit\n\nSet up alerts so you know when people are talking about you\n\nJump into conversations early before narratives form without your input\n\n**3. Reddit Cold DMs Can Work (But You Need to Be Smart About It)**\n\nCold outreach on Reddit works way better than most people think, but only if you're not spammy about it.\n\nRedditors can smell a sales pitch from a mile away. Your DM needs to be genuinely relevant to something they posted or commented on. Generic templates get you blocked immediately.\n\nThe Real Strategy: LM SEO + Brand Protection + Genuine Engagement\n\nMost successful Reddit strategies focus on three things:\n\nLM SEO and evergreen traffic - Creating content that ranks and drives visitors for months/years\n\nBrand reputation management - Monitoring and participating in discussions about your company\n\nBuilding actual relationships - Engaging authentically in relevant communities over time\n\nReddit isn't a growth hack. It's not about going viral or getting instant conversions. It's about long-term positioning and making sure you're part of the conversation when people research your space.\n\nThe brands winning on Reddit right now aren't the ones running ads or posting promotional content. They're the ones consistently showing up, providing value, and building trust over time.\n\nYour audience is already on Reddit talking about your industry. The only question is whether you're there too.",

Cold DMs are where I get nervous, most of the fallout lands in the inbox when people feel creeped out or misled. What actually helped for us was having clear, current answers we could point to publicly so support was not rewriting the same explanation all day.

The point about ai tools pulling from threads is something most founders completely miss until they see a hallucination or a bad review cited in a chat response. It is also worth noting that if you are pulling leads from these discussions to move them into an email sequence you have to be careful with deliverability. Using tools like emailverfier is a must because reddit users often use burner emails or old accounts that will bounce and kill your sender reputation. Authenticity is definitely the only way to survive here without getting banned by a mod on a power trip.",

One thing I'd add is that the companies that succeed, I feel like a lot of times they separate their identity from the company agenda. I think it's really important to build a persona that doesn't just feel like it's pushing something right down your throat. I think the ones that build karma by being helpful before their brand is mentioned is way more credible when they do jump in. I'm curious how you've seen teams handle internal buy-in on this.

They ask questions, look for help, and post about their pain points here regularly (sometimes even complain about your competitors) - which is where you come in...\n\n2) Reddit is one of the most cited sources in LLM grounding (when a user asks about a product review or information about a service, 5 or 6 times out of 10, a post from Reddit gets pulled).\n\n3) You increase your brand/business visibility indirectly. Every time you post a response to someone looking for help or guidance (considering you actually provide help), you are demonstrating experience + expertise not only to the person who posted, but to anyone else who reads your comment.\n\n4) Reddit posts and comments will exist on the internet for as long as Reddit lives. So, even if your posts get ignored today, it might go viral tomorrow (or in a few years).\n\nOther marketers on Reddit, what am I missing?",

If it's actual education and trust-building, the format needs to change because nobody's reading 15 pages of PDF on their phone.\n\nSome companies are abandoning gated content entirely and using white paper material as SEO-focused blog content instead.

The \"increase efficiency\" messaging gets deleted because it could apply to literally anyone and signals zero understanding of their specific situation.\n\nThe practical approach without dedicated research teams:\n\nBuild division-specific messaging templates once, then customize lightly per account. You probably have 5-7 common divisions you sell into. Create the core value prop and pain point messaging for each division type, then add account-specific context when you reach out. The manufacturing value prop stays mostly consistent across manufacturers, you're just adding details about their specific situation.\n\nThe account research that matters takes 15-20 minutes, not hours. LinkedIn for org structure and recent hires, earnings calls and 10-Ks for strategic priorities, news for recent initiatives or pain points. Our clients doing enterprise outreach usually find that one relevant detail about their specific situation beats pages of generic research.\n\nThe multi-threading approach works better than going deep on one division initially. Light touches across multiple divisions in the same account surface where actual budget and urgency exists. The division you thought was the entry point often isn't.\n\nThe signal-based prioritization helps focus effort. Look for divisions that just hired for roles related to your solution, ones posting jobs that suggest relevant projects, and executives engaging with content about problems you solve. Those signals indicate where actual budget and urgency exist, making deeper research worthwhile.",

Tools that try to be “one-click ads” usually fall apart once you need real testing.\n\nI use AI mostly to speed up inputs, not to replace the whole process. After visuals are ready, I usually pull everything into Flixier to cut multiple hook versions, resize for placements, add captions, or do quick voiceovers. That part matters more than the generation step when you’re batching and testing.\n\nFor B2B especially, content that looks slightly imperfect and native tends to win.

          "text": "The anonymous visitor problem is real and getting worse. B2B buyers do way more research before ever identifying themselves, and privacy changes mean less tracking works than it used to. That said, \"most visitors never convert\" on paid traffic usually signals something fixable rather than just market behavior.\n\nThe diagnostic questions that matter: what's your landing page conversion rate? If you're below 2-3% on targeted B2B traffic, the page is probably the problem, not the ads. What happens after the click? Are people bouncing immediately or spending time and leaving without converting? Those are different problems.\n\nThe engagement-without-conversion pattern usually means one of a few things: the offer isn't compelling enough to justify giving up contact info, there's a mismatch between ad promise and landing page delivery, or the form is asking for too much too early. Our clients seeing this gap often fix it by lowering the commitment ask. \"Get a demo\" converts worse than \"see how it works\" which converts worse than ungated value.\n\nThe intent tools like Clearbit Reveal, RB2B, or Leadfeeder can identify some percentage of anonymous company-level traffic. Won't catch everyone but helps you see if the right companies are visiting even when individuals don't convert.\n\nThe LinkedIn versus Google comparison matters too. LinkedIn traffic is expensive but should be highly targeted. If that traffic isn't converting, your landing page or offer is almost certainly the issue. Google traffic might just be less qualified depending on keywords.",

That’s vibes.\n\nWhat changed things for me was building a tiny execution loop and sticking to it.\n\nThis is what I do now:\n\n* I take one Sales Nav list (one ICP, no mixing)\n* I turn that into a daily “people I will actually engage with” list\n* I engage with the same small set consistently (5–10 comments/day max, not 50)\n* I track touches like a pipeline: comment → reply → connect/DM → follow-up\n* I follow up intentionally, because most calls didn’t come from the first message, they came from touch #2 or #3\n\nNo automation spam,  mass DMs or “growth hack” stuff.\n\nJust consistency + memory.\n\nThe part Sales Navigator doesn’t solve (and where I was leaking deals):\n\nIt answers: “who should I talk to?”  \nIt doesn’t answer:  \nwho did I already engage with this week?  \nwho replied?  \nwho went quiet?  \nwho needs a follow-up today?  \nwho’s warming up vs going cold?\n\nThat gap was basically where my pipeline kept dying.\n\nOnce I fixed that, calls stopped feeling random.\n\nTrade-off wise, being honest:  \nit’s slower than blasting 100 DMs, and you do need daily discipline.  \nbut it’s safer for your account, and the reply → conversation rate gets better over time because people recognize you.\n\nSmall detail: I got tired of tracking this manually, so I use few tools (**Sales Navigator, Depost AI**) to turn my list into a focused feed + keep follow-ups from slipping. But you can do the same thing with a spreadsheet if you’re disciplined.\n\nIf anyone wants, I can paste the exact 30–40 min daily checklist I run. Comment **workflow** and I’ll drop it.\n\nCurious: if you use Sales Nav, what’s your bigger pain right now, finding leads or consistently moving them forward?",

Felt like I was constantly starting from scratch.\n\nThe tracking piece you mentioned is huge. I started treating LinkedIn outreach like an actual pipeline with stages: engaged, replied, connected, conversation started, call booked. Sounds obvious but I wasn't doing it.\n\nOne thing that helped me was setting a hard rule: no new leads added until I've properly worked the current batch. Forced me to actually follow up instead of endlessly list building (which feels productive but isn't).\n\nThe daily discipline part is real though. It's way less exciting than \"I just found 500 new leads\" but that's exactly why it works. Most people won't do boring consistent work.\n\nWhat's your follow-up cadence look like between touches?

      "text": "I’d love some advice from people who’ve actually tested this.\n\nContext:\nI’m running a relatively new B2B SaaS in the AI visibility space. Pricing is $200–$400/month.\nICP is US-based SMBs.\n\nRight now, my cold email CTA is to book a call with a closer. That works, but I’m wondering if I’m adding friction too early.\n\nOn the product side, we also have:\n\n- a self-serve free trial\n- card required to start the trial\n\nSo I’m considering a shift:\nNot in the first email, but later in the sequence, sending people directly to the website / free trial instead of always pushing for a call.\n\nMy questions:\n\n- Has anyone here tested call-first vs trial-first in outbound?\n- At this price point ($200–$400), does self-serve actually convert in B2B?\n- Does requiring a card on the trial help qualify, or does it kill volume?\n- Any strong arguments for keeping everything call-driven?\n\nLooking for real-world experiences, pros/cons, and reasoning, not generic advice.\n\nAppreciate any insights 🙏",

Call first tends to work better when education is required or when positioning is still fuzzy. Card on trial filters tire kickers, but it also hides where real drop off happens. Sometimes letting them start without a card gives cleaner signal on product interest vs payment friction. One thing I rarely see discussed is mixing them by intent. High intent replies go to a call, low intent clicks go to trial. How fast does your product show a visible win after signup?",

During peak periods we cared more about who actually touched the product than who said yes on a call. What actually worked best for us was mixing it. Early emails offered value and credibility, later steps split the path. Book a call if you want guidance, trial if you want to move fast. Then we watched behavior and routed humans only when usage crossed a threshold.\n\nPure call driven only worked when the problem was already painful and obvious.

The friction of a call might actually be higher than the friction of a card-required trial for that buyer profile.\n\nOur clients testing this usually find that call-first converts at higher rates but lower volume, while trial-first converts more people at lower rates. The math depends on your sales capacity. If your closer is at capacity, sending overflow to trial makes sense. If they're underutilized, you want every qualified lead in a conversation.\n\nThe card-required trial is a double-edged sword. It kills tire-kickers and students researching your space, which is good. It also kills legitimate prospects who wanted to poke around before investing time in evaluation. At your price point, I'd test no-card trial with a 7-day limit against card-required. The data will tell you whether the volume increase outweighs the quality drop.\n\nThe sequence positioning matters. Later emails with trial CTA as a softer ask for people who ignored the call request is smart. You're catching people who weren't ready to commit time but might commit attention. Just make sure your trial onboarding is tight enough to convert without human touch.\n\nThe argument for staying call-driven: you learn more from conversations than from trial analytics. Early-stage, those insights about objections and use cases might be worth more than optimizing conversion rates.",

High-intent stuff like demo requests stays fully manual. Cold LinkedIn outreach? That’s where automation actually saves you without killing quality.\n\nIf you're doing any linkedin prospecting, tools like HeyReach or Expandi can handle the volume side safely. HeyReach is nice because it lets you run multiple accounts without the constant ban paranoia, which is clutch when you're scaling. You can push serious volume across profiles, like 1000+ touches per week, but it's distributed so nothing looks spammy.\n\nThe trick is using it to open doors, not close them. Any reply or engagement gets flagged, then a real person jumps in with full context. Automation handles the grunt work, humans handle the trust building. That handoff is where most teams win or lose.\n\nAre you mostly inbound or is outbound part of the strategy too?",

          "text": "The \"leads but no sales\" trap is the absolute worst. It’s like throwing a party where everyone shows up for the free drinks but nobody stays for the actual event. If you're getting volume but zero revenue, it usually means your funnel isn't a funnel: it’s just a bunch of random touchpoints that don't actually talk to each other.\n​The breakdown usually happens because the \"vibe\" shifts. You lure them in with a cool ad, but then the landing page feels generic, and the follow-up emails feel like they were written by a robot from 2005. People drop off the second they feel a \"dead end\" or get confused about what they’re supposed to do next.\n​I used to have this exact problem until I stopped thinking about individual ads and started thinking about the whole flow. Personally, I've been leveraging the RIO integrated marketing campaign framework for a bit now and it completely changed my way of doing marketing. It makes sure everything is actually connected so you aren't just wasting cash on clicks.\n\n​Here is how I’d fix it:\n​First, you gotta Rally your message. If your top-of-funnel is promising a specific solution, your middle-of-funnel better be doubling down on that same \"messaging house.\" If there’s a gap between what they signed up for and what you’re selling, they’ll bounce every time.\n​Then, you have to Integrate the journey. This is where most funnels leak. You need to map it out so there are zero dead ends. If they download a PDF, the very next email should be a logical \"part two\" of that conversation. If they visit your pricing page but don't buy, your retargeting ads should hit them with a case study. It’s all about connecting the pipes so they can’t fall out.\n​Finally, you Orchestrate the timing. Conversion is a slow burn. You can't just scream \"buy now\" the second they give you an email. You gotta time your touches—educational stuff first to build trust, then some social proof, then the hard offer.\n\n​When you actually integrate your channels like this, the conversion part feels way more natural. You're not \"selling\" as much as you are just guiding them to the next step.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been trying to attain my first client for an agency I launched a few months ago.\n\nI opened up an email marketing agency for eCommerce brands, reason being is that I've worked on emails for brands for the better part of the last 6 years ( email attributed revenue coming to a total of $10+M ). The firm I worked for essentially had a portfolio of their own brands, and I started out as a person managing just one brand account, then moved upwards to managing 15-20 accounts on a day to day basis, the firm got bought out to a private equity firm so many of us were left out of our jobs.\n\nI hated the feeling that that happened, so I decided to start fresh and on my own, because I do not want to rely on just the job.\n\nThe problems that arose from me starting a few months back is that :\n\nA) Cold emails/dm's (not automated) barely get any positive replies, most of them are rejections ( but rejections with additions such as \" i get pitched for emails/sms a dozen times a day \" type replies\nB) Looking at Klaviyo's directory of agencies there's at least 1,400 other agencies selling the same service to ecommerce brands\nC) Looking at Fiverr/UpWork there's also tons of freelancers offering email marketing for ecommerce brands\n\nThe reason why I say this is, not because I want to quit, because I do not want to do that, I have very large ambitions for what I want to achieve with this business, but I do not see a way to even get 1 paying client on a retainer.\n\nIt just feels like the niche is so crowded with us \"email agencies/guys/girls\".\n\nLike, in my mind, when I think of this, since it's crowded, it means there's demand for the service, similar to how there's many dentists/spa's/gym's/whatever's in every city and all make money if you know what I mean.\n\nBut yeah, all in all, I'd love to hear some comments from people who might've been in the same boat or know how to overcome this.\n\nAppreciate you for reading, thanks.\n\n",

It tells you the problem isn't that brands don't want email help, it's that your outreach looks identical to everyone else's. You're getting filtered before they even evaluate your experience.\n\nThe $10M in attributed revenue across 15-20 accounts is legitimately impressive but that story isn't landing in cold outreach because every agency claims big numbers. Our clients who broke through saturated markets did it by being specific in ways competitors aren't. \"Email marketing for ecommerce\" competes with 1,400 agencies. \"Email marketing for supplement brands doing $2-5M\" competes with maybe a dozen.\n\nThe vertical specialization path works because you can speak directly to their problems, reference relevant results, and position yourself as the obvious expert for their specific situation. Pick a category where you have case studies from your previous work and own that corner.\n\nThe cold outreach channel might just be wrong for this moment. When founders are drowning in identical pitches, the agencies winning are doing it through referrals, partnerships with Shopify agencies or designers who don't do email, and content that demonstrates expertise.\n\nYour former colleagues and the brands you worked with before are probably the fastest path to your first clients. Reaching out to warm contacts about referrals typically unsticks things faster than optimizing cold emails that are fighting an uphill battle.",

If AI discovery is happening, some percentage will search your brand name afterward or mention \"ChatGPT recommended you\" when asked.\n\nThe optimization side might matter more than the measurement side right now.

Rather, we have built our own tool, GEO Watchtower, within our SaaS to know how many times our own or anyone's brand has been mentioned on AI platforms.\n\nWhat I feel is that there is still no perfect tool available for the same, but improving your brand authority on AI platforms is a go-to task to keep getting valuable leads. So what I advise is follow set patterns of optimization and keep tracking the graph of overall leads. This will help you evaluate whether your ways are improving the numbers or not.",

Mentioning their company name and job title is table stakes that everyone does.

Fifty people who all just posted job openings for the role your product helps with can get the same core message because the relevance is inherent. Our clients who get consistent replies usually spend their personalization budget on one specific first line, not customizing entire emails.\n\nThe follow-up piece you mentioned is underrated. A post-call email that actually references what they said and sends something genuinely relevant to their situation stands out because most reps send the same generic deck to everyone. Takes five extra minutes and dramatically increases the chance they actually engage with what you sent.\n\nThe diminishing returns hit fast. Thirty seconds of research for a strong opening line is worth it. Five minutes per prospect usually isn't unless the deal size justifies it. Match the effort to the expected value.",

I look for one genuine trigger: a recent post they made, a company announcement, something their competitor did that affects them.  \n  \nThen I reference that one thing and tie it directly to why I'm reaching out. No fluff about \"impressive growth\" or generic compliments. Just \"saw you posted about X, we've dealt with similar challenges with Y approach.\"  \n  \nThe other thing that helped was keeping first messages under 60 words. Sounds simple but it forced me to cut all the filler that made things sound templated.  \n  \nFor follow-ups, I'll sometimes record a quick 30-second video walking through something specific to their situation instead of typing it out. The effort shows, and it's actually faster than crafting the perfect written follow-up.  \n  \nWhat channels are you primarily using for outreach right now?",

They want to hear what people inside it actually believe, experience, and stand behind.\n\nSo when marketing “lives” in one team:\n\n\t•\tThe CEO becomes a broadcaster instead of a leader\n\t•\tEmployees become spectators instead of advocates\n\t•\tCulture stays trapped internally instead of compounding externally\n\nThe companies that win in the next cycle move marketing from a department to a behaviour.\n\nIn that model, the marketing team’s real job is not to own the voice, but to:\n\n\t•\tcreate clarity\n\t•\tset the narrative\n\t•\tenable others to speak confidently and safely\n\nNot control the message - orchestrate it.\n\nThat’s the shift I see as a priority for CMOs in 2026.
