      "text": "I came across this breakdown and it completely flipped how I thought about YouTube. Figured it might be valuable for you as well.\n\nMost founders assume YouTube only works if you go big. Massive subscriber counts, viral videos, influencer-level reach. But this case study proves that's wrong, well at least for B2B.\n\nThere's a small company in immigration + tax optimization. Nothing sexy. Their average client pays around $2,000 though. Their YouTube channel has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 subscribers. And from that channel alone, they've booked 500+ sales calls. That's easily seven figures in revenue from what most people would call a \"dead\" channel.\n\nBut it gets crazier… They get only around 350 to 400 views per day. About 30 videos total. But they close roughly half their calls. They even spun up a second channel in another language with under 30 subscribers, and it already brought in multiple paying clients.\n\nThis is why B2B YouTube is a completely different game.\n\nSubscriber count is a vanity metric. What actually matters:\n\n* Who's watching: are they decision-makers or random browsers?\n* Why they're watching: are they actively looking for a solution?\n* How much one customer is worth: if a client pays $2k, $10k, or more, you don't need scale\n\nThe videos that drive revenue on this channel aren't flashy. They're boring, high-intent, search-driven stuff: \"how to get residency in X,\" \"best tax residency for digital nomads,\" country comparisons etc. These aren't entertainment videos. They're decision-stage videos, which means the viewer is already problem-aware and actively searching for a solution. That's why they convert.\n\nIf you're selling something where one customer is worth a few thousand dollars or more, obsessing over subscriber count makes no sense. A small channel with the right topics can outperform a larger audience watching for entertainment. The leverage comes from intent, not scale.\n\nI’d love to hear form other founders to see if you’ve had similar results? Have any of you tried YouTube as an acquisition channel? What results did you see?",

The infrastructure management becomes a full-time job.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add to your approach is using video messages after you've engaged on their post. So you comment on their LinkedIn content, wait a day or two, then send a short personalised video referencing what they posted about. I've found it bridges that gap between \"random commenter\" and \"actual conversation\" really well.  \n  \nThe combination of social listening plus video has been way more effective than either alone. Someone already knows who you are from the comment, and the video feels like a natural follow-up rather than cold outreach.  \n  \nYour 12% reply rate is solid. I'm curious though, are you finding certain types of posts convert better than others? Like are pain point posts getting you better responses than announcement posts?",

I have many clients whose trust has been eroded by scammy marketing agency and I tell them, why did you let this happen? Their answer is always the same. They were oblivious. So, here are a few of my tips that everyone should use if they think their marketing agency is not doing their job.\n\n1. The \"Platform Trap\"Google and Meta are designed to make you spend. Their \"Auto-Apply\" recommendations are often biased toward their revenue, not your ROI. A great agency acts as a filter, knowing when to lean into the machine and when to take back the wheel\n\n.2. Creative is the New Targeting-As privacy laws and \"cookie-less\" tracking have leveled the playing field, your creative is what does the heavy lifting. If your agency isn't using data-backed storytelling, they’re just guessing.\n\n3. The Shift to \"Agentic\" Execution-The best agencies have stopped doing manual, repetitive \"button-clicking.\" They are now leveraging autonomous AI tools to handle the grunt work. By integrating stacks like Blobr AI or Ryze AI, agencies can run 24/7 audits and creative swaps that a human simply can’t keep up with.\n\nNext time, ask the important questions. It pains me to see us marketing agencies get a horrible reputation just because of a few sour apples.",

I would also suggest to communicate results and data via email and use meetings for strategy and in the early stages 4un through lists and basic stuff.\n\nAlso get everyone from the agency who you are working with involved. Often companies deal directly with a project manager but equally important to get feedback from the staff who manage your campaign on a day to day basis. \n\nSet realistic goals from both sides. Often companies want x amount of closes in 3 months but their sales cycle takes 4 months. Then they get frustrated, say it doesn't work and try another agency or strategy with the same result. \n\nAsk agencies for help. If they request something to be completed that impacts their sales but not getting done, ask the agency to do it or take the lead. If it's not a huge project and effects the results they will often just get it done. Otherwise the same conversation takes place every week and becomes a negative point.",

          "text": "I totally get the frustration, and you are absolutely right. It’s kind of difficult to trust one agency to handle your branding efforts and another agency to handle your demand gen or lead gen efforts. These three elements should flow naturally, and not having one agency manage the entire thing is the best way to make sure the experience is broken, not to mention that you’re probably going to pay more than you should.\n\nThat being said, why this happens actually makes sense. There are a couple of reasons. First, it’s not the same skill set. Some of the agencies you’re describing are very creative. They hire the right talent to make your brand stand out, create a message that resonates, define your identity, and distribute it so this identity is visible to everyone.\n\nThe other type of agency you’re describing hires teams laser-focused on optimizing and generating business.\nAnother element is that most agencies really want clarity on your goals. When your goal is “do everything,” agencies often anticipate trouble. You might end up saying, “Yes, but I expected more leads,” and they are forced to shift focus from awareness to lead gen. Or you might say, “My brand isn’t as visible as I wanted,” and they pivot back to awareness, reducing leads. Basically, agencies are used to clients being unclear about what they want, and trying to do too much in one shot ends up causing constant changes in direction until things break, or worse, until the agency gets fired.\nThat may explain what you’re seeing. That being said, I’m totally with you. I’m a huge believer that campaigns should be properly integrated: start with awareness and go all the way down to lead gen.\n\nMy recommendation would be to first work with an agency to define your brand: what it should look like, what you stand for, and what your values are. Once that’s clear, work with a dimensional agency to build truly integrated campaigns that cover the entire customer journey, properly integrating all channels, not just making branding consistent, but ensuring the right message reaches the right audience with a perfect flow, so no customer is mishandled.\n\nOnce you have this in place, you can have the same agency manage distribution for your brand awareness elements. This part is actually easy. Be explicit with them: the goal of this brand awareness campaign is purely impressions and visibility for the right audience. You’re not trying to generate leads from this campaign; other campaigns will handle lead gen.\n\nIf you have the resources, it’s even better to do this in-house. If you lack experience, there are plenty of frameworks available. If you type “integrated campaign framework” into Google, you’ll find many that are easy to use. My favorite one is the RIO framework, but there are many others.\n\nIf you rely on an agency, make sure they integrate everything properly and don’t go rogue: building a patchwork of random activities that may generate some short-term leads but will be a disaster to manage in the long run.",

It’s that most of them were built with one core DNA, and that bias shows up in how they operate.\n\nBrand-led agencies tend to come from creative or comms backgrounds, so they think in terms of storytelling, positioning, and visibility. Demand-led agencies usually come from performance marketing or RevOps, so everything gets reduced to leads, CPL, and pipeline math.\n\nBoth are optimizing for what they know how to measure.\n\nThe problem is structural. Brand teams get judged on perception. Demand teams get judged on revenue. So agencies mirror that split and pick a lane.\n\nBut for a $20M ARR SaaS company, those two can’t really be separated anymore.\n\nBrand creates trust and familiarity, which lowers CAC and improves conversion.  \nDemand captures that trust and turns it into pipeline.\n\nIf you only run brand, you look great but struggle to prove ROI.  \nIf you only run demand, you burn budget chasing cold buyers forever.\n\nThe companies that scale well usually treat brand as demand infrastructure, not a separate function. Things like category POV, strong messaging, customer proof, and thought leadership directly improve ad performance, outbound response rates, and sales conversations.\n\nSo it’s less “brand vs demand” and more “brand feeding demand.”\n\nYou’re not looking in the wrong places. It’s just that many agencies are specialized silos. You probably want a team that thinks in terms of full-funnel or revenue marketing rather than either creative or performance alone.",

      "text": "I run lead gen mostly through cold email, boring b2b stuff like lending, transportation, manufacturing, insurance, and marketing agencies. Over the last few months we pushed just over **500,000 emails** to business owners and execs and I want to share what *really* happened, not twitter math or tool affiliate takes.\n\nFirst thing people get wrong is thinking volume fixes bad targeting. It doesn’t. We split those 500k across very specific slices. For lending we only emailed owners doing 1M–25M rev, mostly service businesses, titles like owner, founder, managing partner. For transportation we avoided owner operators completely and only went after fleet owners with at least 10 trucks. Manufacturing was plant managers + ops directors, not CEOs. Insurance was agency owners only, never brokers. Marketing was founders who already had 3–10 clients and were hiring.\n\nSame inboxes, same infra, different outcomes.\n\nOverall numbers across all verticals  \nOpen rate hovered around low 40s most weeks, sometimes dipped to high 30s when a domain got tired.  \nReply rate averaged **3.6–3.9 percent** depending on the vertical.  \n“Interested” replies ended up roughly **1 per 250–300 emails**, which sounds low until you realize that’s normal if you’re not lying to yourself.\n\nSome specifics that surprised me.\n\n**Lending**  \nThis was the weirdest one. Lowest reply rate overall, but the *fastest* replies. If someone was interested they replied within 12 hours, usually short messages like “how much” or “send details”. Long emails here killed performance. Anything over 65 words dropped replies hard. Also a trick people don’t mention: subject lines that looked internal worked better than curiosity. Think “RE: review for {{company}}” not “quick question”.\n\n**Transportation**  \nMost sensitive to sender reputation. One bad domain and it nukes the whole batch. Also these guys read emails on phones at 5–6am. We tested send times heavily and early mornings crushed afternoons. A line like “saw you’re running routes out of Dallas” beat any fancy personalization. Fake hyper personalization got ignored instantly.\n\n**Manufacturing**  \nLowest opens, highest quality replies. These people don’t reply unless it’s real. We once sent a batch with a small data mistake in employee count and replies literally called it out. But when it hit, it hit hard. One email sequence here generated 11 demos from 2,800 sends which is insane for manufacturing. Key thing nobody says: they hate marketing language, even soft marketing. Write like an engineer, not a sales rep.\n\n**Insurance**  \nThis one shocked me. Agency owners reply a lot but half of it is negative if you’re sloppy. We learned to put a soft exit line like “if this isn’t relevant just say no and I’ll close the loop”. That single sentence reduced angry replies by more than half and didn’t hurt positive replies at all. Also never email them on Mondays. Just don’t.\n\n**Marketing agencies**  \nHighest reply rate, lowest close rate. Tons of “sounds interesting” ghosts. You need to qualify in the first reply or you’ll waste your life. Asking one blunt question like “how are you getting clients right now” filtered serious people fast. Also founders respond more to slightly messy emails, perfect grammar actually hurt us here.\n\nUnknown stuff people never mention.\n\nEmail verification isn’t binary. “Valid” emails still bounce differently depending on provider. Google accepts garbage longer than Outlook. Outlook punishes patterns faster.  \nRotating inboxes isn’t enough, you need to rotate *intent*. Same offer phrased slightly differently kept domains alive longer.  \nFollow ups matter less than people think. Email 1 + Email 2 drove almost all results. Email 4 and 5 mostly just create spam complaints.  \nYour CRM tagging matters. We tagged replies by tone and used that to rewrite copy. Polite no’s teach you more than yes’s.\n\nBiggest takeaway after 500k sends: cold email still works, but only if you treat it like operations not hacks. Most people fail because they copy scripts without copying the thinking behind them.\n\nNot selling anything here, just sharing numbers because I wish someone did this before I burned a few domains learning it the hard way. If you’re doing cold email at scale I’m curious what vertical surprised you the most.",

      "text": "alright posting this because i keep seeing the same recycled advice everywhere and it honestly doesnt match what happens in real businesses, we run a b2b operation and cold email alone brings us **200 to 300 plus inbound leads every single month**, real companies in lending saas transportation manufacturing and marketing, not course buyers not wanna be founders, actual decision makers with budgets.\n\nthe first mistake people make is thinking cold email starts with copy, **it starts with who you target**, and for us that is always **c suite and executives only**, ceo founder co founder managing partner cfo head of growth director level minimum, anything below that just slows deals down and kills reply quality.\n\n**how we actually pull leads**  \nwe use **Apollo and RocketReach together**, never just one, inside apollo we go very specific, united states only, employee count usually **10 to 200**, industry filtered tight depending on the offer, then we layer titles like **CEO, Founder, Co Founder, Managing Partner, CFO, Head of Growth, Director**, then comes the most important part which most people skip, manual exclusions, we remove banks, credit unions, nonprofits, trucking associations, churches, foundations, anything that cant buy or needs a board vote.\n\nexample from last month, we targeted lending companies and pulled **12,400 contacts** initially, sounds great right, after exclusions and cross checking with rocketreach that list dropped to **6,100**, then after verification it dropped again to **3,900**, that smaller list outperformed every bigger list weve ever sent.\n\n**email verification is not optional**  \nwe dont trust one verifier ever, we run the list through our verifier then we break it down by provider, **gmail outlook yahoo corporate**, if gmail bounces even smell risky we kill the batch, we literally deleted **8,400 manufacturing leads** last month because early testing bounced too much, rebuilt a tighter list of **3,100 execs**, that list alone generated **47 replies and 11 booked calls**, this is where most people lose before they even send.\n\n**inboxes matter more than copy**  \nwe use **Puzzle Inbox, Slicey, and Premium Inboxes**, typical setup is **3 inboxes per domain** sending **15 to 20 emails per inbox per day**, so one domain does around **45 to 60 emails daily**, when we want to scale we dont touch volume we add domains, one saas campaign ran on **18 domains with 54 inboxes**, sending just under **900 emails per day**, deliverability stayed clean for weeks.\n\nif youre sending 100 emails from one inbox youre already done you just havent felt it yet.\n\n**sending tools**  \nwe rotate between **Instantly and Smartlead**, instantly when we want speed and simplicity, smartlead when reply routing matters more, no links no images no tracking pixels, plain text only, first email is intentionally simple and slightly confusing.\n\nexample first email that still works insanely well  \nhey john quick question are you the right person for partnerships at company name\n\nthats it.\n\n**copy that actually gets replies**  \nwe write like humans not marketers, structure is always **relevance credibility low pressure question**, one of our highest performing emails for a transportation company had a typo in the first line and still booked **9 calls in two weeks**, people reply to intent not perfection.\n\nexample  \nhey mike saw you run operations at a mid sized freight company and figured id ask  \nwe help transportation teams book inbound demos without hiring more sales people  \nopen to me sending over how it works or should i disappear\n\nno pitch deck no calendar link no pressure.\n\n**crm and reply handling**  \nwe keep it boring on purpose, **HubSpot or GoHighLevel**, every reply is tagged manually at first, positive neutral negative out of office unsubscribe, this is how patterns show up, last month we noticed **lending CEOs reply between 6am and 8am eastern**, while **saas founders reply late night around 9 to 11pm**, we adjusted send windows and reply volume jumped without changing copy at all.\n\n**real numbers so this doesnt sound like fluff**  \nmarketing agency campaign  \n**22,400 emails sent**  \n**312 total replies**  \n**84 positive replies**  \n**19 booked calls**  \n**4 closed deals**  \naverage deal size **7k monthly**\n\nfunding company campaign  \n**15,000 emails sent**  \n**61 replies**  \n**14 asked directly for options**\n\nall cold email.\n\nlast thing ill say is this, cold email is not dead and its not about tricks, **its about clean data slow sending boring copy and respecting the inbox**, if youre getting zero replies its not because the channel is broken its because something upstream is.\n\nhappy to answer questions but if your inbox setup is trash templates wont save you.",

When someone replies saying \"yeah tell me more\" or asks a question, instead of another text email we send a quick personalised video walking through exactly what we mentioned. It's maybe 45 seconds, references their company specifically, and the conversion from interested reply to booked call went from around 30% to nearly 60% for us.  \n  \nThe reason it works is the same as your boring copy approach. It's human, low friction, and doesn't feel like you're being pushed through a sales machine.  \n  \nCurious though, when you get those positive replies back, are you jumping straight on a call or do you nurture them a bit first with more context?",

We spent months on a creative LinkedIn campaign with custom graphics, clever hooks, and trendy formats. It got decent engagement but generated maybe 3 qualified leads.\n\nMeanwhile, our boring weekly email with a simple case study breakdown and one actionable takeaway has driven 40+ demos in the same timeframe. Same thing with our plain LinkedIn posts that just share a customer problem and how we solved it. Zero creativity, just consistent value.\n\nI'm starting to think B2B marketers chase creativity because it's more fun, not because it works better. The fundamentals are boring but they actually move pipeline.\n\nOur best performing content is the stuff that feels too simple or repetitive. Our buyers don't care about creative, they care about whether we understand their problem.\n\nThe creative campaigns get more internal praise and look better in portfolio decks. The boring stuff actually closes deals. That gap is wild tbh.\n\nWhat boring tactics are driving results for you?",

The \"creative\" sequence with GIFs and clever subject lines got opened more but converted terribly. The plain text emails that looked like they came from a real person and referenced a specific problem we noticed at their company converted at nearly 4x the rate.  \n  \nI think the issue is that creativity in B2B often becomes about us (look how clever we are) instead of them (here's your problem and a solution). Your case study emails work because they're showing proof, not personality.  \n  \nThe repetition point you mentioned is interesting too. I used to worry about sending similar content too often, but our buyers aren't reading everything we publish. They need to see the same core message multiple times before it clicks, especially for high ticket stuff where the buying cycle is long.  \n  \nWhat's the typical time from first email open to booked demo for you?

What you need for proactive situations is to use the right methodology when creating the queries and the correct framework, and it helps if the tool alerts you when you reach a certain threshold (being impressions, interactions, volume of mentions, or sensibilty). But from my PoV, the key is to create correctly those parameters for the alerts, so you dont need to be checking a dashboard or jumping when it's too late.

But when I look back at the week, it’s hard to pinpoint  anything concrete that actually moved.\n\nWhat messed with me was watching how different people experienced the same event. Some reps looked fried by day two sprinting booth to booth. Others were oddly calm, ducking out for coffees not stressing at all.\n\nI keep wondering if that calm comes from experience or if they just did the work before hopping on the plane.

      "text": "Look, I need to vent about something that nearly killed our outbound program last year. Everyone in B2B keeps saying it's a numbers game and just scale your lists. I bought into that completely and it almost got our entire domain infrastructure blacklisted.\n\nWe were working with the usual suspects for data. Apollo, ZoomInfo, the works. Paying premium rates for those verified badges next to every contact. Our dashboards looked immaculate. Bounce rates under 2%, deliverability scores in the high 90s, everything tracking green. We scaled up to about 18,000 to 20,000 touchpoints monthly across our sequences. I was genuinely expecting our pipeline to finally match the effort we were putting in.\n\nInstead we flatlined at a 0.4% reply rate. And most of those replies were variants of unsubscribe or how did you get my info. Our AE team was getting maybe two qualified conversations per week from thousands of sends. I spent entire evenings convinced it was a messaging problem. Rewrote subject lines, tested different value props, even brought in a contractor to rebuild our sequences from scratch. Nothing moved.\n\nThe wake up call came when I started manually checking who was actually opening our emails. Turns out a huge chunk of our verified contacts were people who'd left their companies four to six months ago, or whose email accounts were just auto forwarding to a black hole. The mailboxes existed so they passed the basic validation checks, but there was no human on the other end. We were burning sender reputation on what were essentially abandoned accounts.\n\nI finally admitted we needed to stop throwing volume at the problem and completely rethink our data hygiene approach. The issue wasn't our copy or our offer. It was that we were optimizing for the wrong metric. Deliverability doesn't mean anything if the recipient hasn't logged in since Q2 of last year.\n\nSo we shifted the entire workflow. Instead of just verifying that an email exists we started screening for actual activity signals. Things like mobile number status, recent job changes, social engagement patterns. We moved to a batch filtering process using TNTwuyou before any contacts even touched our CRM. The goal was to prioritize signal over scale.\n\nA few things became obvious pretty fast. First, phone number validation turned out to be a surprisingly strong proxy for active engagement. If someone's mobile line is dead or disconnected their email's probably not much better. Second, recency matters more than anything else. A contact that was valid three months ago is often worthless today in fast moving industries. Third, this approach adds friction to your workflow and your team will push back on smaller lists. You have to be willing to defend lower volume if it means higher quality.\n\nOnce we started filtering out the noise our effective reply rates climbed back up to the 5% to 7% range. We're running at maybe 20% of our previous monthly volume but our AEs are actually having real conversations again instead of just logging rejection after rejection. Using the TNTwuyou Data Filtering and Validation Tool as a pre outreach gate basically saved us from getting our domains torched.\n\nThat said, this level of filtering probably isn't worth the operational overhead if you're selling low ticket transactional stuff where volume really is the only lever. It makes sense for us because we're in high ticket enterprise sales where every bad touch costs us credibility we can't afford to lose.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has completely abandoned the big database model lately. Or are we just in a particularly stale vertical where contact decay happens faster than usual.",

We were chasing volume metrics that looked great on paper but meant nothing for actual pipeline.  \n  \nThe phone number validation insight is spot on. We started doing something similar but added LinkedIn activity as another layer. If someone hasn't posted, commented, or even changed their profile in 6+ months, they're probably not actively checking anything work related. Saved us from wasting touches on what were basically dormant accounts.  \n  \nOne thing that helped us beyond just filtering was timing our outreach around actual engagement signals. So instead of batch blasting a cleaned list, we'd wait for a LinkedIn post, company announcement, or funding news, then reach out within 48 hours while they're actually paying attention. Reply rates jumped even higher because we weren't just reaching active contacts, we were catching them at moments when they were already engaged.  \n  \nThe pushback from your team on smaller lists is real though. Took me weeks to convince our sales director that 500 highly qualified contacts beat 5,000 stale ones.  \n  \nWhat's your current approach for keeping the filtered lists fresh? Are you re validating on a schedule or just filtering once at the point of upload?",

They'll tell you someone visited a competitor's site or searched a keyword, but that doesn't mean they're ready to buy your specific solution. Look for agencies that layer multiple signals together like recent funding, hiring patterns, tech stack changes, plus intent data.

However, we have to confirm and execute about 10 to 15 orders each month just to cover our monthly overheads.\n\nI want to start targeting bigger customers like clothing brands from Europe, Australia, etc. to grow the order volume significantly.\n\nI'm sure the decision makers of these brands aren't actively searching for manufacturers in Google so Google Ads and SEO might not be the right channel for us.\n\nI've read quite a lot on how cold emails work starting from data gathering and enrichment through Clay or other data sources followed by sending using platforms like Instantly. I can personally try it out myself and learn and improve and go ahead but I'm not too keen on that. I would rather prefer paying an agency who know what they are doing.\n\nWill cold emails work for our scenario?  \nWhat are the things I should look for when hiring an agency to handle cold emails for our business?\n\nIf not, should I look at LinkedIn marketing or other channels?   \n  \nI know I have everything in my business primed for success, and proper marketing seems to be the last missing piece of the puzzle that I really want to crack.",

Like, is there *anyone* in your current customer base who could hook you up with a bigger player? Or maybe someone in your network who can make an intro? That first customer is always the hardest to land, but once you’ve got one, you can ride that word-of-mouth wave and use their success story to open doors with others.\n\nHonestly, at this stage, I’d lean more into a sales approach than a full-blown marketing one. Like, just get that first win however you can, and then you can build from there. It’s way easier to sell when you’ve got a happy customer singing your praises. Just my two cents, still figuring this out myself, so grain of salt and all that!",

Cold email works best when you're solving an active problem, but most brands aren't actively looking to change manufacturers unless something's gone wrong.  \n  \nWhat I've seen work better is a two-step approach. First, identify brands that are actually in buying mode like new sustainable fashion labels, brands expanding into new product lines, or companies posting jobs for production managers. These are real signals they might need new manufacturing partners.  \n  \nSecond, instead of just email, try sending a short personalised video showing your factory floor, quality control process, or a similar product you've made. It builds trust way faster than text when you're asking someone to trust you with their entire production. Brands need to see your capabilities, especially when you're overseas.  \n  \nLinkedIn could work too, but I'd focus on building relationships with production managers and supply chain people rather than just cold pitching founders.  \n  \nHave you got any case studies or samples from your existing brand work that you could showcase?",

It’s like comparing apples with pears. I would even go one step further and say that not all channels are revenue-generating channels from a tracking perspective. Some channels will always look more expensive because their influence is harder to track than others.\nHowever, to me, this is not even how the discussion should be framed.\nThe discussion should not be about comparing channels in front of a CFO or a CEO. If you are in charge of marketing, you should define the plan and be judged on the total outcome. The CFO has no business being involved in how each individual channel is performing, especially when they don’t have the context of what is expected from a specific channel.\nLooking at each channel purely in terms of direct impact on revenue is insanely short-sighted, and that’s typically what a CFO with no knowledge of marketing would do.\nWhat I’m saying is that the discussion should be happening on a completely different turf. The discussion should be about how your campaign as a whole, including channel A, channel B, and channel C, has spent X dollars of budget for Y dollars of revenue, with whatever ROI is attached to it.\nThen, as a marketer, with the full context, your expertise, and the metrics you are tracking, you should be the one deciding where to invest more money.\nIf your CEO and CFO are making those calls on your behalf, you’re not a CMO. You’re a marketing executive who has been hired to execute a strategy you’re not even deciding yourself.\nTo me, you have to take one step back, think in terms of integrated campaigns, and look at campaign ROI, not channel ROI, at least not in discussions with your executive team.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the past year building a B2B SaaS platform (AI-enabled scripting tool) but I’m facing the classic mistake: I built first, validated later (not entirely true, I did a bunch of early validation interviews and have kept that up recently). Now I’m stuck with what feels like three different products under one roof, and I need help finding the right positioning and acquisition channel.\n\n**What the platform does:** It’s a scripting tool that lets users create mini-apps with simple code. These apps guide users through multi-step AI workflows (think: structured SOPs, not automation/agents). The LLM follows your script, asks questions, processes inputs, and returns results at each step. Think custom GPTs on steriods.\n\n**The three “products” I could sell:**\n\n1. **DIY Platform** \\- Advanced users script their own workflow apps (small audience, high expertise required)\n2. **Done-for-you Service** \\- I interview clients about their SOPs and build custom apps for them (consultative, doesn’t scale well, but could be good in the beginning)\n3. **Ready-made Apps** \\- I build and distribute vertical-specific apps (e.g., “SoMe Commenter” for LinkedIn/Reddit engagement, “Long Text Editor” for working around LLM output limits), \"Content Repurposing\" app etc etc.\n\n**What I’ve tried so far:**\n\n* Marketed as a content creation tool to LinkedIn thought leaders (limited traction at the time)\n* Pitched custom workflow solutions to in-house content teams and agencies (slow sales cycle, and hard to get a foot in among the solutions they already use)\n* Positioned it as a dev tool with open-source apps on GitHub (minimal uptake)\n* Currently experimenting with marketing individual apps (SoMe Commenter, Long Text Editor) *without* mentioning the platform\n\n**Where I’m at:** Right now, I need to find my first paying customers to validate an ICP that’s actually willing to pay for this to get a beach head to operate from. I have hundreds of users registered but haven’t cracked the retention or monetization piece yet.\n\n**Channels I’m considering:**\n\n* Cold email campaigns to targeted ICPs\n* Google Ads (Search/Display)\n* Social media ads (LinkedIn/Facebook)\n* Organic social media content marketing (doing)\n* Direct LinkedIn outreach to book demos with ideal customers (doing)\n* Community engagement (Reddit, niche forums, etc.) (doing)\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Which of these three product approaches would you double down on to get initial traction and paying customers?\n2. Which acquisition channels would you prioritize given my situation? (Limited budget, B2B focus, workflow/productivity tool, need to validate willingness to pay)\n3. Should I continue decoupling the apps from the platform, or is there a way to leverage the platform story?\n4. For those who’ve tested these channels for similar products in super early days, what worked fastest for getting your first 5-10 paying customers?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s navigated similar positioning challenges!  \n",

I tried most common B2B channels (ads, LinkedIn, content, communities), but with a limited budget they were slow and noisy. What finally worked was focusing on cold email as the core channel and using everything else as support.\n\nMy current flow is pretty simple: identify a very narrow ICP → look for real buying signals → enrich and verify leads → run short, relevant cold email sequences → follow up consistently → only then bring in LinkedIn or calls if there’s engagement. That gave me faster feedback on who’s actually willing to pay.\n\nCold email to very specific roles with a clear problem beats ads early on. Once patterns emerge, you can package that into ready-made apps later.\n\nThis setup works for me because it’s credit-based, budget-friendly, and cuts a lot of manual work.   \n  \nCurious which ICP has shown any buying signal so far, even weak ones?",

Here's what helped me narrow down:  \n  \nStop trying to validate three products simultaneously. Pick the path with the shortest distance to money right now. From what you described, the done-for-you service is probably your fastest route to revenue, even if it doesn't scale yet. You learn exactly what clients need, you get paid to build case studies, and you can productise later based on patterns you see.  \n  \nFor channels, cold email and direct LinkedIn outreach can work but they're slow when you don't have a tight ICP yet. I'd focus harder on the community engagement you're already doing. Find 3-5 specific communities where your potential users are actively complaining about workflow problems your tool solves. Reddit, Slack groups, niche forums. Answer questions, share insights, build trust over a few weeks, then DM the most engaged people offering to build them a custom workflow for free in exchange for feedback.  \n  \nThe decoupling question is interesting. I'd test both, honestly. Some people will want the specific app, others will want the platform flexibility once they see what's possible.  \n  \nWhat type of SOPs or workflows are your current registered users actually trying to build most often?",

      "text": "I’m looking to get my feet wet in the local lead generation space and could really use some guidance from people who’ve actually been in the trenches.\n\nRight now, I’m not a business owner yet. I’m at the very beginning stages and trying to learn the right way before jumping in. My long-term goal is to build something that lets me work from home while my wife works full time, so I can be there for our kids and help care for our special needs daughter.\n\nHaving flexibility and stability is extremely important to my family. It’s very difficult trying to work around each other’s schedules to provide adequate supervision and care around the clock for our daughter. We don’t have outside help or government assistance. It’s just my wife and I.\n\nI’m also not working at the moment. I left my previous employer so my wife could work full time while I job hunt and watch the kids.\n\nA little about me:\n\n1.) I already have experience with scripting\n\n2.) I’m comfortable with prospecting\n\n3.) I have some cold calling skills\n\n4.) I’m not afraid of outreach or rejection\n\nWhat I’m hoping to learn from you all:\n\n1.) What’s the best way to get started in local lead generation with little to no experience?\n\n2.) I’m mainly interested in service-based lead gen for local companies in my area.\n\n3.) How did you land your first client?\n\n4.) What beginner mistakes should I watch out for?\n\n5.) What would you recommend learning first?\n\n6.) What niches would you recommend looking into?\n\n7.) What tools are best to start out with (preferably free or cheap)?\n\nRight now, I’m seriously considering targeting epoxy flooring companies as my main niche. Part of the reason is because I’ve worked with epoxy before and have done flooring in the past, so I already understand the product, the process, and what customers usually care about. I’ve checked with Google Maps and have seen there are plenty of companies in my area with little to no reviews and plenty more with no online presence. \n\nThat said, I’m still not 100% sure if epoxy will pan out long-term or scale well, so I’m very open to hearing other niche ideas too.\n\nI’m motivated, willing to put in the work, and in this for the long haul. I’m not looking for shortcuts. I just want to avoid wasting time going down the wrong paths.\n\nAny advice, resources, or personal experiences would mean a lot.\n\nAND PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO SELL ME ON YOUR AI PRODUCT. NOT INTERESTED. \n\nTIA y’all!",

          "text": "I worked in local service business marketing for a while, and epoxy flooring is actually a solid pick. The margins are high enough that they can afford to pay for leads, and you're right that most are invisible online.  \n  \nSince you're comfortable with cold calling, here's what I'd do first. Ring 10 epoxy companies in your area and ask them straight up how they currently get customers. You'll learn more in those conversations than any course will teach you. Most will actually tell you because they're not used to people asking smart questions.  \n  \nFor your first client, don't sell lead gen as a service yet. Offer to run a small test campaign for just the cost of ad spend (if you go that route) or do it purely on commission per lead. This removes all their risk and gets you a case study fast.  \n  \nTools to start: Google Business Profile optimisation costs nothing and actually works for local. If you want to run ads later, Google Local Services Ads convert well for home services.  \n  \nOne thing I'd caution against is building sites you don't own yet. Some people do the \"rank and rent\" model but it takes months to see results, and you need cash flow now.  \n  \nWhat's your plan for actually generating the leads once you land a client?",

          "text": "sounds like you've got a solid foundation with your scripting and cold calling background, that'll serve you well in lead gen. For finding those local service businesses to target (like your epoxy flooring idea), I came across SMB Sales Boost recently and it looks like it could be useful for building out prospect lists. It's basically a database that shows you newly registered businesses in your area so you can reach out to them early before they're getting hit by everyone else.\n\nOne thing I'd add about epoxy flooring as a niche - it's pretty seasonal in some areas and the market can be saturated depending on where you are. Might be worth also looking at HVAC, plumbing, or electrical companies since they tend to have more consistent year-round demand and higher customer lifetime value. The fact that you have hands-on experince with epoxy is definitely valuable though, maybe use that as your starting point to land the first client and build proof of concept before branching out.",

Epoxy flooring sounds good since you know the product, but also check out plumbers or landscapers since they always need leads.

          "text": "Epoxy flooring is actually a damn solid niche pick, especially since you already know the industry. That knowledge alone puts you ahead of 90% of people starting out because you can actually speak the language when talking to these business owners. Don't overthink the niche selection, just commit and go.\n\nYour scripting and cold calling background is honestly the perfect skill set for this. With our clients who sell lead gen services to local businesses, the ones who crush it early all started the same way. They picked up the phone, called local companies with crappy online presence, and offered to bring them leads. No fancy pitch deck, no website needed, just \"hey I can get your phone ringing, want to try it out.\" Landing that first client is always the hardest part so consider doing the first one free or on a pay per lead basis just to get proof that your system works.\n\nFor tools on a budget, grab Apollo for prospecting and building contact lists of local business owners. Use Google My Business to identify companies with weak online presence like you're already doing. For the actual lead gen delivery, start with a simple landing page through Carrd or a free WordPress setup paired with Google Local Service Ads. Those convert like crazy for home services and the barrier to entry is low.\n\nBiggest mistake I see beginners make is trying to offer everything to everyone. Stick with epoxy flooring, learn exactly what works to generate those leads, document your results obsessively, then use that proof to sign paying clients in the same niche. Rinse and repeat until you've got a system that runs predictably before even thinking about adding another niche.",
