Our clients who get ROI from conferences always do outreach 2-3 weeks before the event to book specific meetings with target accounts who'll be there.\n\nThe attendee list thing isn't really gatekept, it's just that most people don't think strategically about conferences. They treat it like a networking lottery instead of a targeted sales opportunity. You can also scrape LinkedIn for people posting about attending specific events, or use intent data to find companies registering attendees, though buying verified lists is obviously faster.\n\nThe real trick is your outreach messaging. Don't just say \"hey wanna meet at the conference?\" That's lazy as hell. Reference why you want to meet them specifically, what problem you solve, and make it easy to book a 15-minute coffee slot at the event. Our clients booking 10-15 meetings per conference usually have 40-50% show rates, which beats random booth conversations by a mile.\n\nConferences are expensive so if you're gonna spend the money, treat it like a targeted campaign not a branding exercise.",

Booked 8 meetings before we even got on the plane.  \n  \nThe key was being really specific about why meeting at the conference made sense, not just \"let's grab coffee\". Like referencing a talk they were probably attending or a product they'd see on the floor that related to their challenge.  \n  \nCold emails to conference attendees still feel spammy if they're generic.

Once your messaging is solidified and your foundation is set up, start testing paid channels (have a demand gen or paid consultant run an audit to determine where your audience exists and what your competitors are doing - and start running ads there if budget permits)  \n9.

We work with financial service firms, marketing companies, recruitment firms, manufacturing firms, saas companies, 3pl (transportation firms) etc.\n\n**Cold email is not easy but I will give some insights.**\n\n1. Dont send any links at all in the first email. People say this but they dont know the reason behind. Blacklist providers like Spamhouse ZEN and Braccuda actually look at the spam reports and a link is associated with spam - even if you are not spamming. \n2. Leads currently we target are smtp and google. Sometimes we blend office 365. If you buy an old domain and do an office 365 setup and have a non sales script you can actually get 1-2% reply rates. We have done a lot of testing and if anyone has any questions regarding office 365 deliverability I am happy to answer.\n3. Include and test with gmail leads. These are 50-50 sometimes good sometimes bad. They are not approached as much as Google Apollo leads. This works well especially if you are targeting small local businesses and when you have a narrow tam.\n4. Have a diversified setup. Never rely fully on google or outlook always balance out. Always have a 60-40 or 50-50 split. Deliverability is fragile sometimes outlook is good and sometimes google make sure you balance it out.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions.",

We've tested adding a quick reference to something specific about their company (recent LinkedIn post, news mention, funding round) in the opening line. It bumps replies noticeably compared to generic openers, even when the rest of the email is templated.  \n  \nAlso curious about your take on multichannel. We've seen cold email work better when it's not the only touchpoint. For example, engaging with their content on LinkedIn first, then following up with email a few days later. The email becomes a continuation rather than cold outreach.  \n  \nWhat's your approach when a prospect opens multiple times but doesn't reply? Do you change the follow-up strategy or keep the same cadence?",

I spent the last 2 weeks running a split-test on Reddit outreach for my SaaS.\n\nThe Stats:\n\n* Duration: 15 Days\n* Volume: \\~100+ DMs sent (highly targeted)\n* Replies: 43 (>65% Reply Rate)\n* Booked Calls: 7\n\nThe \"Old\" Way (That failed): Finding a user, sending a generic \"Hey, I saw you like marketing. I have a tool...\" Result: Ghosted.\n\nThe \"New\" Way (The Secret): I realized that Redditors post because they want validation or help. They don't want to be sold to. So I stopped selling.\n\nThe Strategy Breakdown:\n\n**1. Context is King (The Search)** \n\nYou cannot DM random people. You need people who are active right now and talking about your specific problem.\n\nI stopped manually browsing. It's a waste of life.\n\nI set up monitors using SleepLeads (filters out the noise nicely and sends dms for me)\n\nI tracked keywords like: \"struggling with X\", \"alternative to Y\", \"how do I Z\".\n\nThe moment someone posted, I got a ping.\n\n**2. The \"Ego-First\" DM** \n\nI did not pitch my tool. I pitched their post back to them.\n\n* Script Structure: \"Saw your post about \\[X\\]. Totally agree with your point on \\[Y\\]. I actually tried \\[Z\\] and it worked. Curious how you're handling \\[A\\]?\"\n* Why it works: It positions me as a peer/expert, not a salesman. It strokes their ego (\"You agree with me? I like you.\").\n\n**3. The Pivot** \n\nOnce they reply (and they usually do, within a few mins), then we start a conversation. \"Yeah, manual tracking is a pain. I actually built a specific tool to automate that part if you want to test it out?\" Reply: \"Sure, link?\"\n\nTakeaway: You can't automate the human connection, but you absolutely should automate the finding part. Stop scrolling. Start listening. Pitch the problem, not the product.\n\nTL;DR: Be human. Validate their post first. Use tools to find high-intent posts instantly.\n\n",

Once they've replied and shown interest, a 30-second personalised video explaining the tool (showing your face, maybe a quick screen recording) converts way better than another text message with a link. It keeps that human connection going rather than suddenly switching to \"here's my product page.\"  \n  \nWe saw our demo booking rate jump from around 15% to 40% just by swapping out text for video at that exact pivot point you mentioned. Plus it filters out tyre kickers since only genuinely interested people will watch.  \n  \nThe monitoring approach you described sounds solid. How are you qualifying which posts are actually worth engaging with beyond just keyword matches?",

For finding actual clients to pitch, I'd focus on warm outreach first - hit up former colleagues, people you've worked with at agencies or past companies, and LinkedIn connections in your niche. Most freelancers I know get their first few clients from their existing network before needing to do any cold outreach.\n\n\nWhen you do need to expand beyond warm leads, I came across SMB Sales Boost recently and it looks like a solid option for building prospect lists. It's basically a database of newly registered businesses, so you can find companies that might need demand gen help before they're already locked into other vendors. Seems especially useful for your niche since new SMBs are usually activley looking for help with paid ads and lead gen.\n\n\nAlso worth setting up a simple case study page showing specific results from your previous roles (even anonymized ones). Metrics like CPA improvements or pipeline growth make a huge differece when pitching.",

      "text": "Started this project back in May 2025 when our CEO asked me to explore video content without putting anyone from the team on camera. We're a 12 person company selling workflow automation software to mid market operations teams, and nobody wanted to be the face of the brand. Fair enough.\n\nThe goal was simple: create educational content about operations workflows, process documentation, and automation best practices. Target audience is ops managers and directors at companies doing $10M to $50M revenue. We figured YouTube could be a long term play for inbound since our blog was already ranking decently.\n\nMonth 1 and 2 were rough. I tried the classic stock footage plus voiceover approach. Hired a freelancer on Upwork for $400 per video to edit together B roll with our scripts. The videos looked... fine? But retention was terrible. Average view duration was under 40 seconds on 6 minute videos. Comments were mostly spam bots.\n\nThe problem was obvious in hindsight. B2B buyers want to see a person. They want to feel like someone is teaching them, not watching a corporate explainer with generic office footage. But again, nobody on our team wanted to be on camera, and hiring a spokesperson felt weird for a small company.\n\nMonth 3 I started experimenting with AI generated presenters. Tested a bunch of tools over about 6 weeks. Synthesia was the first one I tried since they're the most well known. Quality was decent but the pricing didn't work for us at our volume, and the avatar movements felt a bit stiff for longer educational content. Tried HeyGen next which had better pricing tiers but I ran into some consistency issues when I needed the same presenter across multiple videos with different outfits and backgrounds. Also looked at D-ID and Colossyan. Each had tradeoffs.\n\nEventually landed on a workflow using APOB for generating the presenter visuals and combining that with ElevenLabs for voice. Took me a solid week to figure out the lighting settings though because the default outputs kept looking overexposed when I tried to match our brand's cooler color palette. Had to regenerate a bunch of images before I got the hang of it. The key thing that worked for our use case was being able to maintain the same face across dozens of videos while changing everything else. Our fictional presenter Sarah now has appeared in 34 videos wearing different outfits in different virtual office settings, and she looks like the same person in all of them. That consistency matters more than I initially thought because returning viewers actually recognize her now.\n\nMonth 4 through 6 was pure iteration. We posted twice a week, tested different video lengths, thumbnails, titles. What actually moved the needle:\n\nSwitching from 6 to 8 minute videos down to 3 to 4 minute focused tutorials. Retention jumped from 38% to 52% average.\n\nAdding chapters and timestamps. Sounds basic but our audience skips around a lot.\n\nMaking thumbnails that show Sarah's face plus a specific problem statement. CTR went from 2.1% to 4.8% on average.\n\nPosting at 7am EST Tuesday and Thursday. Our audience is US operations managers who apparently watch YouTube before their morning meetings.\n\nMonth 7 and 8 is where things got interesting. We hit 2,400 subscribers which isn't huge but the quality of those subscribers matters more. Started getting comments from actual ops managers asking specific questions. More importantly, we can now trace 11 demo requests directly to YouTube in our attribution. We use HubSpot with UTM tracking on all our video description links, plus we added a \"how did you hear about us\" field to our demo form. 8 of those 11 explicitly mentioned YouTube or referenced specific video topics. The other 3 came through tracked links. At our ACV of $18k, if even half of those convert at our typical 35% demo to close rate, we're looking at around $70k in actual revenue from this channel. The $198k pipeline number is all 11 at full ACV which is optimistic but that's how we report it internally.\n\nTotal cost breakdown for the 8 months:\n\nAI tools and subscriptions: roughly $2,100\n\nElevenLabs voice generation: $660\n\nVideo editing software and stock music: $340\n\nFreelancer for thumbnail design: $850\n\nMy time: approximately 6 hours per week which I'm not counting since this was part of my role anyway\n\nSo under $4k in hard costs. Compare that to what a video production agency quoted us initially which was $3,500 per video. We would have spent $119k on 34 videos.\n\nThe weird part is that I don't think anyone watching knows or cares that Sarah isn't real. We've never tried to hide it but we've also never announced it. One commenter asked if she was AI generated and I just replied honestly. Nobody seemed to care, the conversation moved on to the actual content topic.\n\nBiggest lessons from this whole thing:\n\nConsistency of the presenter matters way more than I expected. Random stock footage people in every video kills any sense of relationship with the audience.\n\nB2B audiences on YouTube are more forgiving of production quality than I assumed. They care about the information being useful, not cinematic lighting.\n\nThe compounding effect is real but slow. Month 1 through 4 felt like shouting into the void. Month 5 onward the algorithm started actually pushing our content.\n\nHaving a face, even a synthetic one, makes a massive difference versus pure screen recordings or stock footage compilations.\n\nStill early days and I have no idea if this scales to 10k or 50k subscribers. But for now it's working as a supplement to our other demand gen efforts.",

B2b buyers are researching for weeks or months before they even fill out a form, they want substance not entertainment.\n\nI tested probably 30 different creative concepts in the first 3 months and the patterns were surprising. The polished, professional looking ads that would've flopped in dtc actually perform best. The decision makers don't want messy ugc style content, they want to feel like they're dealing with a legitimate company.\n\nAlso the messaging has to be way more specific, can't just say we help you grow or we make things easier. The need to call out the exact problem they're dealing with and show you understand their world. Generic value props get ignored immediately.\n\nThe creative that works best for us now is case study focused. Showing real results from real companies in their vertical, with actual data not just testimonials. It takes way longer to produce because you need to work with customers to get permission and pull the numbers but the performance makes it worth it.\n\nStill figuring this out but the learning curve has been steep.",

The client says they want to move forward. And then… nothing. No PO. No urgency. No decision. Even though they came to us with the problem and clearly need what we offer.\n\nIt feels like deals stall not because of objections, but because the buyer just isn’t prioritizing the decision. I’ve tried following up, checking timelines, and even hinting at things like pricing changes or limited availability, but I don’t want to rely on fake urgency or pressure tactics that damage trust.\n\nOne recent example really sums it up. Client wanted to move ahead during the summer. Quote delivered. Follow-ups done. They started debating sourcing some equipment themselves to lower cost, then went quiet. When we finally met again, the answer was that the budget for this year was gone and the project got pushed to next year. No hard “no,” just drift.\n\nI’m realizing I’m not losing these deals to competitors. I’m losing them to indecision and lack of momentum.\n\nI’m starting to think the issue isn’t the pitch or the pricing, but how I’m guiding the buyer once they say yes in principle. I’ve seen some teams use tools like Trumpet to keep everything in one place. Quote, scope, timelines, next steps, and decision checkpoints all visible so the buyer doesn’t mentally reset after every conversation.\n\nFor those of you in higher-end B2B sales, how do you handle this stage?  \n How do you create real urgency without pressure?  \n How do you help buyers actually commit when they agree but don’t act?\n\nAny practical tactics, frameworks, or lessons learned would be hugely appreciated.\n\n",

The combination of consistency with proof through case studies and examples will achieve better results than any single \"hack\" method.",

Cold email still works when you anchor on real buying signals (hiring, growth, role changes) and narrow targeting before scaling.\n\nWhat made a difference for us was treating outreach as a system: define ICP → enrich the right accounts → email-first outreach → LinkedIn as support → consistent follow-ups → track replies, not opens. That aligns with solid B2B best practices  relevance beats surface-level personalization, and timing beats brute force.\n\nOnce we focused on conversations instead of pitches and avoided over-automation, reply quality improved a lot. Curious how others are spotting intent before launching campaigns?",

          "text": "There’s a lot to unpack here because B2B marketing is difficult and they don’t teach this in school. So it’s imperative that you have a good strategy first and a mechanism to test if your strategy could work. In terms of leads, it’s the responsibility of the sales teams to ensure that they are converting the right prospects from your ICP. Marketing should typically focus on making sure that your prospects are not only knowledgable about your product but can also flag when there is an interest. Effectively, both sales and marketing need to be two sides of a strategy to convert a lead to a buying customer.\n\nI read somewhere in this thread that paid is the only way to generate leads, and I disagree with that. There are far too many factors to consider before you jump in with a paid strategy.\n\nI also see a lot of good advice in here about who your lead is and why they should care about what you have to offer. This is good advice because it helps you understand at what point in your funnel your prospects are willing to learn more and share their email with you. This is what should drive your overall strategy to help nurture, engage with more focused content or actually move towards a demo. Please remember, LinkedIn is not the only place where you can reach your ICP. Meaning you need a multi channel strategy that is based on data to show where your prospects are engaging with your content at the least possible price, with meaningful content.\n\nI help clients with B2B strategy and I have this conversation every single day, and I dont get bored. And the truth is, just because the strategy worked with someone else doesn’t mean it will work for you as well. Your product and your services are different from the others and require focussed attention to the funnel strategy.\n\nNo easy way out!",

Instead of a templated email, I'd record a 30-second video referencing something specific about their company and explaining why I thought we could help. Response rates jumped from about 3% to over 20%.  \n  \nThe quality improved massively because we were catching people at the right moment, and the video format meant they could see we'd actually done our homework rather than just adding them to a spray-and-pray list.  \n  \nWhat signals are you currently using to qualify leads before reaching out?",

In most places I've worked that used Wordpress the engineering team would pitch in whenever we needed dev support - another advantage of WP is that it's very well documented and there's a huge community around it, so any decent developer will be able to pick it up quite quickly.\n\nThe best way, tbh, is to hire a marketing person who knows their way around Wordpress.\n\nAnd yes, probably custom theme is the way to go. Start with the built-in themes (Twenty Twenty Five or whatever) and add what you need. Don't be tempted by things like Elementor, they add huge bloat and they're impossible to get rid of once you start building with them.",

You're at 1 client total, so the issue isn't finding more prospects, it's probably your messaging or offer positioning.  \n  \nSales Nav is great for filtering and finding the right people, but if your cold outreach isn't converting now, paying for a bigger list won't fix it. Reddit DMs that get interest but no contracts usually means one of two things: either you're attracting the wrong fit, or there's a disconnect between initial interest and actually closing.  \n  \nBefore spending money on tools, I'd test your offer more directly. Find 20 B2B SaaS companies with outdated sites (you can spot these manually on LinkedIn or Google). Send each founder or marketing lead a quick loom video showing 2-3 specific things broken on their site and how you'd fix it. Make it about them, not your process.  \n  \nIf that converts even 1-2 clients, then yeah, Sales Nav makes sense to scale up the prospecting bit. But right now you need to prove the messaging works before paying to reach more people.  \n  \nWhat's your typical cold message look like when you reach out?",

YouTube takes ages to build momentum and the ROI is tough to track early on.  \n  \nReddit worked surprisingly well for us because you can answer real questions in communities like this one, r/sales, r/startups. The key is being genuinely helpful without pitching. I spent 30 mins a day for 3 months just sharing what actually worked in outreach, and it brought in about 8-10 qualified leads that turned into customers.  \n  \nYouTube is great long term but needs serious commitment. You're looking at 6-12 months before meaningful traction unless you're already comfortable on camera and have a content system sorted.  \n  \nAnother thing to consider is partnering with complementary agencies (like email deliverability consultants or data providers). We got a decent chunk of referrals that way because you're reaching people who already need what you offer.  \n  \nWhat's your average deal size? That'll probably determine whether YouTube's effort is worth it vs more direct channels.",

          "text": "Congrats on trusting your gut! You just discovered what a lot of B2B SaaS founders learn the hard way: GTM advice is rarely one-size-fits-all.\n\n\n\nThe \"free plans don't work for B2B\" advice comes from traditional sales-led SaaS thinking. But if your product has a quick time-to-value and doesn't need heavy hand-holding, a free tier can be your best sales tool.\n\n\n\nHere's what makes free plans work:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Lower friction = faster feedback loop\\*\\*. You went from 3 months of slow growth to your best signup month. That's not just numbers—that's real people testing your product and giving you signal on what works.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Product-qualified leads beat cold leads\\*\\*. Someone who's used your product for free and hit a limit is 10x easier to convert than a cold prospect. They already understand the value.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Free users become your product team\\*\\*. The feedback you're getting now is worth way more than the revenue you might've gotten from forcing everyone into trials.\n\n\n\nThe key now is tracking activation metrics—what % of free users actually complete a meaningful action in their first session? That'll tell you if your onboarding needs work or if you're on the right track.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, set up automated nudges when free users approach limits (like \"You've tracked 80 of your 100 free documents—upgrade to unlimited?\"). That's where free-to-paid conversion happens.\n\n\n\nWhat's your conversion goal for free → paid? Even 2-3% is solid for early stage.",
