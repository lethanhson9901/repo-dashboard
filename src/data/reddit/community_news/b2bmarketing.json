It looks custom but doesn’t actually help the reader understand why you’re reaching out.  \nWhat worked better for me with Clay was dialing personalization way down and focusing on one real signal per message. Something concrete like a job change, a product launch, a pricing page update. When there’s an actual reason to reach out, the message feels natural without trying so hard. Curious how you’re deciding what’s worth personalizing right now. Are you using real signals or mostly profile data?",

Then add value by being specific about the next step: “If this is true, the two checks I’d run are X and Y” or “we usually see A break before B,” so it reads like you actually understand the situation.

We just closed out a 40 day sprint for our clients that generated $1.1M in qualified pipeline by doing the opposite.\n\nIf you’re staring at a dry Q1, here are the 3 things we changed:\n\n• Content is the Warm up guys: We stopped posting \"value\" and started engineering shorts for \"viral escape velocity.\" The goal isn't views; it's making sure when we send a cold DM, the prospect has already seen our face on their feed. It kills the \"who is this?\" friction instantly.\n\n• Trigger Based GTM: Stop blasting lists based on job titles. We only scrape leads based on \"triggers\" (new funding, hiring surges, or specific tech stacks). If there’s no immediate reason for them to buy, we don't message them.\n\n• Offer: Our outreach focuses on one specific \"leak\" in their current setup. No fluff, no 20 min discovery calls. Just \"I found this hole in your bucket, here is how to fix it.\"\n\nIt’s not rocket science, it’s just syncing your GTM with your creative.\n\nIf you’re stuck on $0 or plateaued at 6 figs, DM or drop your niche. I’ll give you a quick growth autopsy on what's killing your reach right now. No strings.",

          "text": "Some helpful (I hope) context for people reading this. No shade to the OP but this is just a not so clever promotion disguised as value (which they say they stopped doing)\n\n“$1.1M in pipeline” sounds strong, but pipeline alone isn’t an outcome. Without knowing close rates, sales cycle length, or what actually converts to revenue, it’s hard to judge whether this is durable growth or just early-stage activity that may not hold up.\n\nThere’s also a contradiction in the content point. The post says the goal isn’t views, then immediately talks about virality. Virality is about reach and attention. Familiarity can reduce friction, but it isn’t the same as trust, especially in higher-consideration B2B sales.\n\nTrigger-based targeting isn’t new. Funding, hiring, and tech stack signals can be useful inputs, but they don’t automatically create demand. A trigger only matters if it creates real urgency from the buyer’s perspective, not just the seller’s.\n\nScraping is another area that deserves caution. It isn’t a best practice and sits in a legal and ethical grey zone depending on location and usage. Many buyers use unique or decoy emails specifically to detect scraping, and when they do, it’s an immediate turnoff. Even when it “works,” it can damage trust and brand perception long-term.\n\nFinally, pointing out a “leak” without discovery may work for low-risk, transactional offers, but it often backfires in complex B2B. Senior buyers tend to be skeptical of confident diagnoses made without context.\n\nNone of this is to say these tactics never work. They can in narrow cases. The risk is presenting them as universally applicable without acknowledging ",

The free version handles lead source tracking and email history which is exactly what you need. With our clients at your stage HubSpot free covers everything until you're doing serious automation or need custom reporting.\n\nThe catch with HubSpot is that once you're hooked into their ecosystem, the paid tiers get expensive fast. You'll feel the squeeze around the time you want better email sequences or custom properties.\n\nFreshsales has a solid free tier for up to 3 users with basic contact management and email tracking. Less feature-rich than HubSpot but cleaner interface and cheaper when you do upgrade.\n\nZoho CRM free works for up to 3 users and integrates well if you end up using other Zoho products. The interface feels dated but functionally it handles the basics.\n\nThe transition question is real. Most teams upgrade when they hit one of three walls: needing more automation, wanting better reporting, or exceeding user limits. The smoothest transitions happen when you've been disciplined about data hygiene from day one. Messy data in a free CRM becomes expensive messy data in a paid CRM.",

The whole deal is about not being weird, and that's all! \n\nI've been doing cold outreaching for the past 7 years, tried literally dozens of strategies. \n\nThis is what I'm using now and get the best results (40% response from all connections): \n\n\"Hi \\[name\\] - I specialize in website building with AI and promise a 1-week landing page shipment from start to finish (copy, design, delivery). \n\nIf you'd ever need a fast website launch, feel free to reach out.\n\nAttaching some samples of my work: \n\n\\[Link 1\\]  \n\\[Link 2\\]\n\nLet me know if you're up to anything right now,\n\nCheers.\" \n\nThat's it. It's that simple. \n\nWay better than a salesy question-style approach or anything AI generated.\n\nIf you get no response, I'd send just one follow up after a week. Follow up ideas for you: 1) a presentation with more works; 2) invitation to a demo call; 3) more complicated tactic: offer to record a podcast together (good for yours and prospect's personal brands, everyone is carying about content now, its good for any business); 4) invite to do a \"customer interview\" because \"you're looking for insights\". \n\nRemember: you have a human reading this on the other side, and you need to be human too! Its the only important thing in cold messaging. ",

Then explain in detail how one could use that software to tackle the specific problem at hand. This takes time, thoughtfulness, and an actual give a shit attitude & not just a tactic to hopefully fill pipeline. \n\nSo to close off, authentic sales strategies will trump mass approaches.

The challenge with all biz dev is to find an acute pain point where your solution solves it in a truly valuable manner.\n\nGranted there's a lot of crap out there, but we all have to strive to find that sweet spot. What's the pain, what does the market want, and how can we adapt our product to suit those needs. No one gets it right first time, there's a lot of trial and error, where you are the noise, not the solution. But eventually, you get to that sweet spot where you are the solution. It's tough to get there but there's no shortcut to arrive at that point, other than getting that market validation.

People are definitely interested because the download numbers are higher than we expected, but the trail goes cold immediately after they get the PDF. I was reading through some insights on how localization and clear messaging impact these technical funnels at adverbum, and it made me realize our content might be too dense for the initial lead stage. It feels like we are providing so much value for free that the prospects don't feel the need to actually talk to our sales team.\n\nAre you guys seeing better conversion rates by gating the data points separately, or do you find that shorter executive summaries drive more discovery calls? Also, how do you balance providing enough technical proof without giving away the entire solution in the lead magnet?",

Expecting those assets to produce sales conversations skips several critical psychological and organizational steps in a complex B2B buying process.\n\nThe Core Principle to Anchor the Conversation: Different content answers different buyer questions at different moments.\n\nIf your content only answers:\n\t•\t“How does this work technically?”\n\nBut never answers:\n\t•\t“Should we do anything at all?”\n\t•\t“Why change now?”\n\t•\t“Why this approach?”\n\t•\t“Why this company?”\n\t•\t“How do we justify this internally?”\n\nThen buyers will stall, regardless of how strong the technical material is.\n\nBuyer’s Journey Content Map (Problem → Solution → Validation → Decision)\n\n1. Problem Identification / Status Quo Awareness\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I’m sensing friction, risk, or inefficiency. I’m not sure how to define it yet.”\n\nWhat they are NOT ready for:\n\t•\tProduct demos\n\t•\tDeep technical architecture\n\t•\tSales conversations\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tExecutive perspective articles (problem framing)\n\t•\tIndustry trend analysis\n\t•\tResearch-backed thought leadership\n\t•\tDiagnostic assessments or quizzes\n\t•\tBenchmark reports\n\t•\t“What’s changed” or “Why now” content\n\t•\tShort educational videos\n\t•\tPOV blogs that name hidden costs or risks\n\nRole of white papers here:\nUseful only if they are problem-oriented, not solution-heavy.\n\n\n2. Problem Validation / Internal Alignment\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to validate this problem and align others around it.”\n\nThis is where buying groups form.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tProblem-focused white papers (non-product)\n\t•\tInternal-ready slides or briefs\n\t•\tStakeholder-specific explainers (finance, IT, ops)\n\t•\tUse-case narratives without product pitching\n\t•\tROI framing content (without hard pricing)\n\t•\tMaturity models or frameworks\n\t•\tWebinars framed around challenges, not solutions\n\nKey shift:\nThe content must help the buyer sell the problem internally, not evaluate vendors yet.\n\n\n3. Solution Exploration / Approach Comparison\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“What are the possible ways to solve this, and what trade-offs exist?”\n\nThis is where your client often jumps too late or too early.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tSolution guides (approach-based, not product-led)\n\t•\t“Build vs buy vs outsource” comparisons\n\t•\tSolution architecture overviews (high level)\n\t•\tRecorded demos (ungated or lightly gated)\n\t•\tExplainer videos\n\t•\tImplementation approach documents\n\t•\tAnalyst-style comparison matrices\n\nWhite papers here:\nStill useful, but they must:\n\t•\tCompare approaches\n\t•\tExplain outcomes\n\t•\tReduce perceived risk\n\t•\tAvoid deep configuration detail\n\n\n4. Vendor Shortlisting / Trust Building\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“Can I trust this company to deliver?”\n\nThis is where sales engagement becomes appropriate.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tCase studies (outcomes first, details second)\n\t•\tCustomer stories by industry or role\n\t•\tReference architectures\n\t•\tProof-of-concept examples\n\t•\tSecurity, compliance, and risk documentation\n\t•\tPartner ecosystem content\n\t•\tCustomer webinars or panels\n\nWhat triggers sales conversations:\n\t•\tEvidence of success with similar companies\n\t•\tReduced personal and organizational risk\n\t•\tConfidence that this will work in their environment\n\n\n5. Decision / Business Case / Justification\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to justify this decision financially, operationally, and politically.”\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tROI calculators\n\t•\tBusiness case templates\n\t•\tProcurement-ready documentation\n\t•\tImplementation timelines\n\t•\tChange management guidance\n\t•\tExecutive briefings\n\t•\tCompetitive battlecards (buyer-facing, not sales-only)\n\nSales engagement is expected here, not earlier.\n\n\nWhy White Papers Alone Fail to Convert\n\nWhen a company relies exclusively on long-form technical white papers:\n\t•\tThey attract early-stage researchers\n\t•\tThey lack problem-framing content upstream\n\t•\tThey skip trust and validation content downstream\n\t•\tThey assume technical interest equals buying intent\n\nThis leads to:\n\t•\tHigh download volume\n\t•\tLow sales engagement\n\t•\tFrustration between marketing and sales\n\t•\tMislabeling early researchers as “bad leads”\n\nThe content is doing its job. The expectation is wrong.\n\nAlso, do NOT call whitepaper downloads “leads”. They aren’t leads and Sales will see them as junk.",

I know that cold email and LinkedIn outreach require a lot of testing, discipline, and a clean technical setup.

Are there specific newsletters, creators, or communities that focus on the fundamentals rather than shiny tools?\n* **The \"Experience\" Trap:** What are the biggest mistakes sales professionals make when they transition from handling warm leads to the cold outbound \"trench\" work?\n* **The First 90 Days:** What is one thing you wish you had focused on in your first three months of doing outbound?\n\nI’m looking for mental models and a roadmap for learning, not a list of software recommendations although if you think something like that could be useful for me shoot it.\n\nWhat was the single most helpful resource or lesson that moved the needle for you when you were starting out?",

Here's why: you can have perfect deliverability and land in every inbox, but if you're reaching the wrong people with the wrong message, you've just efficiently wasted your time. Start by getting obsessively clear on who actually has the problem you solve and what language *they* use to describe it.\n\nOn theory vs. execution - this is where most people get stuck. The uncomfortable truth is you need both, but **sequenced correctly**. Spend 2-3 weeks studying frameworks (PAS, AIDA, problem-agitate-solve), then immediately start sending low-volume batches. The trap is endless studying becomes procrastination dressed up as preparation.\n\nThe biggest \"Experience Trap\" I see sales folks fall into: **assuming cold prospects think like warm leads**. With warm leads, they already have context and some intent. Cold means you're interrupting their day - so your messaging needs to earn attention in the first 3 seconds. That's a completely different muscle.\n\nFor your first 90 days, I'd focus on **building a feedback loop**. The challenge with cold outbound is the iteration cycle is painfully slow - you might wait weeks to know if a messaging angle actually works. Anything you can do to compress that learning cycle (whether it's surveying your ICP directly, testing variations faster, or finding ways to simulate response before going live) will compound massively over time.\n\nWhat industry/ICP are you targeting? That might change some of this advice.",

          "text": "I worked for three unicorns, the world's biggest database and tech firms and started my own, small biz.  UK video production (for marketing) because I just wanted to focus on stuff I really enjoy.\n\nMy take is marketing is different for every business depending on markets, product, price point, how the product's evolving.  E.g.  I worked for Salesforce as a contractor 20 years ago and it was morphing from an SME solution into an enterprise solution.  Marketing followed that evolution and went from being very demand-gen to very brand led.\n\nAnd then what worked beautifully for my small business growing from zero was completely different.\n\nLoosely, from what I experienced in the B2B space, it's about being very tactical at the beginning, starting with just winning a few customers, capitalising on those with demand gen and then when you get bigger to focus spend more on brand.  Initially, brand's still super important to get those initial wins but again, it's about getting initial traction by focusing on tactical.\n\nAs to who to listen to, there are a couple who stand out.  Firstly, try to get hold of some vids of Benioff in about 2007 - 2009 when he talks about Salesforce's evolution from demand gen to brand.  That's when the revolution occurred and he talks about it really passionately because it was a real discovery for him and he's really insightful.  And I think those are the people I really listen to.  Either really successful CEO founders who've seen it / done it or senior marketers who've done the same.\n\nThen you've got the academics.  So Ritson is OK for B2C although heavily biased because he's ultimately selling a course and very B2C.  Seth Godin's books are good, if not theoretical.  Porter for a decent academic base but a bit out of date.  Although some CMOs I know still swear by Porter.\n\nThen for influencer, Hermozi is OK despite all the BS.  He strikes me as someone who's distilling lots of good info but hasn't necessarily put those things in place himself within his own businesses.  There are a couple of incredible and very rough-looking early podcasts with Stephen Bartlett.  If you can find them, (the latest ones are just nonsense), he's surprisingly a bit boring and technical talking about pipe, funnels, buyers journeys etc....  Outstanding, though and I used one of those key elements to build my own business successfully.  He took them down but there are a couple still kicking around.\n\nThen you have books.  Almost any book talking about funnels will be useful.  The last one I read was for my undergrad so I've kind of forgotten them but they're much of a muchness.  But you have to take them with a pinch of salt.  There's a guy at Salesforce who wrote a book called 'repeatable revenue.'  I worked with him and what he says he did and what he actually did... well, I'll leave you to research that one.  But there are a ton out there.\n\nFinally, reach out to people who've done it.  Happy to have a chat if you DM me.  I don't know about you but I'm happy to share what I've seen work and what works for me.\n\nAnd as for the first 90 days, build the marketing stuff you need, warm the audience and then call them.  I started in B2B telesales for Reuters.  The whole idea is to warm the audience and then speak to them.  If they're warm, they'll talk to you.  If they're cold, they won't.  So what do you want to do?\n\nTldr; Holy cr@p, this is almost as long as my final year dissertation in marketing!",

      "text": "We were struggling to get traction for our B2B SaaS, even though our messaging and ICP seemed solid. Instead of guessing, we decided to study the actual profiles of people engaging with our competitors.\n\nWe selected 4 competitor companies and pulled their follower data using a workflow that combined Airtable, automation tools like Make, and Followerli to safely extract the follower lists. Once the data was in place, we grouped contacts by roles and industries and looked for patterns.\n\nThe results were clear: several roles we hadn’t prioritized were actually driving sign-ups and engagement for similar products. By adjusting our outreach and messaging toward these real audience signals, we gained 120 new sign-ups within a month.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with structured competitor analysis to guide sales or messaging? What signals ended up giving the clearest insights for your campaigns?",

That gives you timelines, next steps, and a real pipeline view.\n- Layer something like Grin or Aspire for discovery, contracting, and content tracking if you’re doing a lot of seeding and whitelisting.\n- Automate follow-ups with simple rules (e.g., task if no reply in 5 days) so nothing slips.\nI’ve tried building this with Airtable + Notion + Demand Revenue-style advisory dashboards, but a proper CRM pipeline plus one influencer platform has been more durable long-term.\nSo, core point again: don’t just pick an “influencer tool” – pick a pipeline and force every creator into it.",

      "text": "For the past few months I tried super personalized and more warm sounding cold emails for local leads, especially dentists, and a few patterns really boost results:\n\n**Personalized Subject Lines:** Generic subject lines get ignored, Use subject lines that read like a customer or an associate, not a salesperson, these get way higher open rates. Example: \"Frank seems amazing at scheduling”\n\n**Read Reviews, They are a gold mine:** Reading reviews can get you-\n\n* Staff names people actually mention (personalization gold)\n* What customers genuinely care about (emotional themes)\n* Specific pain points or wins\n\nMentioning \"Joey's same day emergency response keeps coming up\" in an email = instant credibility.\n\n**Optimize for a Quick Reply:**\n\nInstead of asking for a call (high commitment + scheduling pain), use multiple choice CTAs:\n\n* \"Worth a quick look? A) Yes, send it over B) Not a fit C) Ask me again in a month\"\n* \"Wrong person?\"\n\nIf the cost of answering feels close to zero, they're far more likely to reply.\n\nAlso follow the \"5-second decision\" rule: one short scroll should answer who you are, why you're emailing, what you want, and exactly how to reply.\n\nThe only downside of these are it took a lot of time to research a single lead.\n\nSo I started experimenting with AI prospecting and summaries and built a tool that:\n\n* Finds emails, phones, socials from public directories\n* Reads the website and Google reviews\n* Generates research context automatically:\n   * Firmographics so I can qualify\n   * Standout staff members and their roles\n   * Emotional themes from reviews\n   * Ready to use icebreakers and subject lines\n\nThe goal isn't \"AI-written spam\", it's saving the manual research step so you can actually personalize at scale.\n\n**Looking for 5-10 people doing local lead gen to test it and help shape it further,** **DM if interested.**\n\nYou dont need to use my tool, these work manually too, hope the tactics above help your outreach.

Look for recurring themes in user feedback.\n\n  \nIf you're finding it hard to monitor all of these platforms for relevant conversations, you might want to look into a tool designed to scan Reddit, X, and LinkedIn for discussions about your product or service.

When the reply feels easy and low pressure, it reads closer to a real human check in than outreach.

Not gonna do a big “framework” post - just the practical summary: who each tool is for + the real pros/cons.\n\nOne quick note: GEO / AI visibility tools still feel kinda early. A lot of them are great at showing data… but not all of them help you turn that data into “okay, what do I do next?”\n\n**1) Profound**\n\n**Who it’s for:** Bigger teams, bigger budget, someone on the team actually likes dashboards + analysis.  \n**Pros:** Deep monitoring and analysis. Feels more enterprise / research-grade. Great if you want long-term tracking and reporting.  \n**Cons:** Pricey, and you still need your own workflow to turn insights into actions. Otherwise you just stare at charts.\n\n**2) Scrunch**\n\n**Who it’s for:** People who want a more “brand visibility in AI/search” viewpoint, not just raw counts.  \n**Pros:** Nice for visibility trends and broader brand presence framing. Good for internal updates / direction.  \n**Cons:** If your goal is specifically to push **citations** up, you’ll probably still need to build the execution playbook yourself.\n\n**3) Otterly**\n\n**Who it’s for:** Beginners or small teams who just want a baseline quickly: “are we showing up at all?”  \n**Pros:** Easy to start, low friction, good for getting a baseline running fast.  \n**Cons:** Easy to get stuck at “watching numbers move.” It won’t magically tell you how to earn more citations.\n\n**4) Peec**\n\n**Who it’s for:** Similar to Otterly - baseline monitoring without too much complexity.  \n**Pros:** Straightforward, good for getting visibility tracking running without a big setup.  \n**Cons:** If you expect it to answer “what should we publish + where should we publish it,” you’ll still need another layer (process/tooling).\n\n**5) PromptWatch**\n\n**Who it’s for:** Teams that are very prompt-centric (you maintain prompt libraries, you care about prompt-level monitoring and management).  \n**Pros:** Stronger fit if prompts are an actual asset you manage and iterate on.  \n**Cons:** It’s more on the monitoring/management side - content strategy + distribution + citation wins usually come from somewhere else.\n\n**6) ModelFox AI**\n\n**Who it’s for:** Teams who want **monitoring + “what do I do next?”** in one place (especially if you don’t have a GEO expert in-house).  \n**Pros:** **It has monitoring too** - brand + competitor tracking (mentions, citations, ranking-type signals), plus **prompt-level monitoring**. What I like is it leans more into an execution loop (not just charts), so it’s easier to go from “gap” → “do this next” → “check if citations changed.”  \n**Cons:** If you only want a super lightweight dashboard, it can feel more “process-y.” But if you’re serious about GEO, that’s kinda the point.\n\n**7) Wellows / AirOps (more workflow/content ops than visibility monitoring)**\n\n**Who it’s for:** You already know what to do, you just want to produce + ship faster.  \n**Pros:** Great for scaling output and workflows.  \n**Cons:** They’re usually not “AI visibility monitoring tools” by themselves. You still need monitoring/attribution from elsewhere.\n\n**My blunt way to pick (if someone asks “best AI visibility tools”)**\n\n*   **Just want to get a baseline running:** Otterly / Peec\n    \n*   **Deep monitoring + analysis (team + budget):** Profound / Scrunch\n    \n*   **Prompt library + prompt ops:** PromptWatch\n    \n*   **Want monitoring + actionable GEO execution loop:** ModelFox AI\n    \n*   **Want to scale publishing workflows:** Wellows / AirOps",

      "text": "NOT A PITCH. CROSS MY HEART lmfao.\n\n\nHaving worked for plenty of startups during my career as a growth consultant (not a consultant anymore…. Thank god) I want to share some really basic pieces of advice that has helped each of my clients that allowed ME to craft the GTM strategy the way it has worked from my experience (please feel free to share rebuttals or if anyone would do something a bit differently). \n\nSaas org leaders & sales that are in startups often have what I call the wolf syndrome. Anyone watched the movie Wolf of Wall Street? Ya they often come off like a dude in ibiza trying to swing you a baggie that he claims is straight from the set of Narcos (forgetting that Narcos was a show & not the real Pablo since he did half of the merch already. BUT… if they mention 9 irrelevant facts like you are reading the Guinness book of records then you will likely forget wtf they even said about narcos… just like the incoming feature dump/use case dump that isn’t remotely related/useful to your org’s pain points but you leave slightly flustered but mainly confused as hell). \n\nThe thing is, pure conviction & eloquence dosnt cut it anymore. Your prospects 70% of the time think you are a bullshit artist & they came in with a mound of research (thanks ChatGPT) & probably have met with 3 other competitors & are actively contemplating personally testing out how high the balcony REALLY is after the meeting.\n\nSo why do sales people still often fail to actually understand wtf their prospects came in looking for? Lack of proper communication between marketing and sales. I’m not talking about the rolling of the eyes convos that I have seen in so many orgs, I’m talking to get sales to really understand the basics, UTMs to understand the messaging, for the love of god do basic background research on the prospect, depending on their existing tech stack & yours, you could see if you can pull technographic insights from platforms. If you have ABM contact software… you can identify the clear journey on the site that lead to demo also (if match rates are high enough). \n\nBasic take away? Marketing needs to provide non patronizing support to sales… sales need to feel empowered enough to actually utilize the support. Without sales… none of us would have a job & without marketing 80% of the time there wouldn’t be an opportunity to even have the company head count we have cuz pipeline would be a fallacy.. Your GTM is only as good as your collaboration with sales. Seen tons of marketers make underhanded comments about sales… and sales reciprocated the gesture. While legal & devs hate us both. So relax with that…\n\nLastly, you are not industry agnostic. A watch is a watch… the use case is telling time… is Patek or Rolex or Omega thinking of “industry agnostic”? No… they know 40% of the population is financing their 34 dollar chicken salad. The use case in its essence is the same as a tissot… but the TAM is split as they want to align with the ICP that can indulge in such products. Industry agnostic is a pipe dream that ironically diminishes any chance of a healthy pipeline. \n\nJust because there are a billion use cases after a “professional micro dose sesh” don’t mean that every industry can be tackled with the same efficiency & velocity. Now if we are talking about pen testing a market? Cool… pick 2-3…. And explain why. Not because you had 2 leads from somewhere or had one sale… that holds no stats sig. don’t have 1st party data? Then do manually verified research & be able to support your hypothesis with tangible market data & pain point that is blatantly obvious. \n\nThen……\n\nActually test that out… but before leads start coming in… please help your sales team out by giving them example sales sim pitches… & make them also prep. but for the love of god marketing teams…. Have your sales enablement materials ready & done well… I mean think about the objections not just a regurgitated homepage word vomit on a 30 slide PowerPoint. \n\nThis is why such assets are best made with the collab of sales. Your best sales person can dog walk your prettily put UVP (not in the exact words but in what actually resonates with an audience). \n\nNow of course there can be anomalies but I recommend that yall give the SaaS jocks the time to show you that selling to a prospect who hasn’t seen their wife and kids in 3 days (even tho they work remotely) can be quite challenging. \n\nAnd sales… stop saying “leads weren’t  qualified”… if you do not have tangible insights as to why… marketing cannot do anything to make it better… so yes… record that call… fill in the minimum notes in that awful software we call salesforce. \n\nEvery demo should ideally be analyzed like watching film… what were the misses? Was it product? Pricing? Timing? Overall PMF mismatch? Or was it cuz sales went into the call with the pre conceived notion that they arnt qualified? ",

We use outreach for sales functions (I am considering alternatives that allow for sales activity automation also so we can atleast get the initial touch point of connecting with the prospect that lands from our ABM contact tool automated) & Vector (the ABM contact tool in question & also does have the functionality like primer of audience matching for social paid platforms). \n\nQuick tip, we see tremendous value from W/L interviews. Especially the loss ones. There’s also been times we ended up closing an older prospect from few years back due to them being able to voice the why & also why they did or didn’t agree with the decision making panel but had to comply. CS is key but PCS (potential) can give you a fruit done the road when you least expect it.\n\nit’s funny you mentioned Clearbit, I actually had to do a project for final round interview on what their paid media & share of SERP growth strategies should be (safe to say I passed lol).",

The language customers actually use vs. how we write marketing stuff? Completely different world. Wish I’d done this sooner!\n\nAlso learned that consistency beats perfection.

Pick one platform where your ICP is active, then post something narrow (a real example, numbers, what changed, what didn’t) and ask one concrete question at the end. If you’re mostly getting likes but no back-and-forth, you’re probably too generic or talking to the wrong layer (peers instead of buyers).",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nThis is going to be a quick little post to encourage you guys in the B2B niche, even B2C to start running this system before its too late. It’s something I’ve been using for a while, and it’s been serving me well so yeah.\n\nHope this helps some of you out there.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The exact system I ran is all the way at the bottom, but for you to understand what it is that I’m doing, and how to succeed with it, read the entire post thoroughly.\n\nNow, when you hear the word quality, you naturally think of something that’s harder to obtain. Something that carries real value.\n\nFor you to attract a “valuable” prospect, they shouldn’t come to you easily. Easy doesn’t equal valuable. Easy usually equals desperation, and desperate people are rarely willing to pay the price for your services.\n\nThat’s why lots of people run “lead forms” or “instant forms” and just collect the details of the leads and call them up, because it’s easy. They aren’t qualified at all, they’re just people interested in your services.\n\nWhat you actually want are people who genuinely and deeply lack the skill you already have. \n\nPeople who clearly understand that gap, are willing to pay good money for you to solve it, and can be retained long-term so you can build a very high LTV with them.\n\n\n\n**For someone to truly be a quality prospect, you need two things in place:**\n\n\\-They need to have gone through your content for a period of time, meaning they know who you are and have already positioned you as the expert in their mind\n\n\\-They need to be filtered through a process, so that only the financially qualified ones ever book an appointment\n\n\n\n**Here’s how you do both of those things.**\n\nYou need to look like an expert because when you do, they believe that you know the solution to their problems and want YOU to fix it for them.\n\nMost people get the misconception that you need to plaster proof or previous work to show your expertise which is complete utter BS.\n\nWhat you want to do is you want to frame your words in a way that sounds like the internal language inside your prospects mind. \n\nAny form of writing inside your website, content, ads, whatever it is should be written as what the prospect currently has in their mind, but can’t really put into words, and that you resonate with their problem on a level that makes sense that you’ve seen this happen before, and then present the solution in a way that looks like you’ve solved this problem before multiple times.\n\nOnce you can write in this way, people will always feel drawn to you, because number one, you made them feel like you understood exactly what they’re thinking of, and number two, they will naturally trust you because you “get them.”\n\nSo inside your ad copy, and inside your creative, you want to use very alluring words that makes you seem like the person that “gets it” that knows the “ins and outs” of the industry, that way they immediately trust you.\n\n\n\n**Here’s the setup for the system**\n\nAll you need is a Meta Ad Account.\n\nCreate a Dataset & Conversions API so you can track your metrics and know where all the leads are at any given time.\n\nOnce that is done, you run this exactly.\n\n**Ad Setup:** 1 CBO, 1 Ad set, 1-2 ads. $100/day.\n\n**Creative:** A picture or video that visually shows the end result of your service. If you’re selling a weight loss program, its a picture of someone fit, if you’re a dentist, you show visually a bright smile with nice white teeth etc.\n\n**Targeting:** There’s 2 different types of targeting. If your industry is very broad, something like weight loss, where lots of people are your target, you always run with 0 targeting and let the creative + copy do the targeting.\n\nIf you’re very niche, something like a dentist, you’re local, so you need to run the city that you’re in, as well as people interested in whitening teeth, and the usual stuff that someone who wants their teeth done is interested in, then you use interest-based targeting.\n\n**Ad Copy:** As I said this before, here is where you curate your words precisely so it makes the person think “wow, this guy know his stuff.” \n\n**But a little framework you can follow is this:** Your first line should always be what they desire with a VERY BOLD promise and the next lines show your UNIQUE OFFER and how YOU will get them to the END GOAL very easily. Then you put a CTA at the bottom to the landing page.\n\n\n\n**How to get qualified prospects**\n\nYour website/landing page needs to only focus on ONE thing and that’s filtering out prospects\n\nThe way you filter out prospects is NOT by having lots of buttons, or subpages in it… what that does is it distracts the leads to go on and click somewhere else INSTEAD of booking a call.\n\nWhat you do is you FILL the landing page with emotional copy that unties what you do part by part…\n\nIt’s like a puzzle, the more they read, the more you draw them in. You want to explain how YOU have a system that will get people X results in Y timeframe…\n\nAnd the more they scroll, the more proof you show them, and the more you pre-handle their common objections as to why they shouldn’t do this…\n\nAnd at the VERY bottom, you include a CTA button that directs them to book a call.\n\nWhat this does is, it naturally qualifies the prospect, that means that EVERY single person that booked a call, scrolled ALL the way to the bottom and read everything you’ve shown them.\n\nAnd before they book a call, you do ONE MORE QUALIFICATION PROCESS.\n\nAnd that is you ask 4-5 questions to qualify them even further. You ask what’s their budget, how much do they have to spend, and certain questions regarding the industry you’re in.\n\nThis way when they book a call, you can see EXACTLY who the person you’re dealing with is, and this way we found out that 99% of the people that booked a call, were people that were FINANCIALLY qualified, as well as had HIGH-INTENT to work with us… meaning they were already pre-sold before the call.\n\nThat’s how we get 90% show ups…\n\nAnd that’s how we also close 40-50% of our meetings.\n\nIt’s that simple.",

Way more organic meetings - all for free.\n\n\\#2 We wrote content like we were talking to AI\n\n* clear descriptions of what we do\n* mentioned our brand + keywords in natural language\n* added tons of Q&A-style content (like FAQs, but smarter)\n* gave context LLMs can latch onto: who we help, what we solve, how we're different\n\n\\#3 we posted content designed for AI memory\n\nwe used to post for humans scrolling. now we post for AI\n\nstuff like:\n\n* Reddit posts that mention our brand + niche keywords (this post helps AI too)\n* Twitter threads with full company name + positioning\n* guest posts on forums and blogs that ChatGPT scans\n\nwe planted seeds across the internet so LLMs could connect the dots.\n\n\\#4 we answered questions before people even asked them\n\non our site and socials, we added things like:\n\n* \"What companies provide VAs for under $500 a month?\"\n* \"How much do VAs cost in 2025?\"\n* \"Who are the top remote hiring platforms?\"\n\nturns oout, when enough people see that kind of language, AI starts using it too.\n\n\\#5. we stopped chasing google, we started building trust with LLMs\n\nour Marketing Manager says,Google SEO will be cooked in 5-10 years\n\nits crazy to see chatgpt usage growth, in the past 1/2 years, there's some people who now use chatgpt for everything, like a personal advisor or assistant\n\nto rank, we created:\n\n* comparison tables\n* real testimonials (worded like natural convos)\n* super clear \"who we're for / who we're not for\" copy\n\nLLMs love clarity.\n\ntl,dr\n\nWe stopped writing for Google. We started writing for GPTs.\n\nNow when someone asks:\n\n\"Who's the best VA company under $500/month full time?\"\n\nWe come up 50% of the time.\n\nWe have asked our team members in Ukraine, Philippines, India, Nepal to try searching, with cookies disabled, VPN, and from new browsers, we come up,\n\nThank you for staying till the end.\n\nHappy to make a part 2 including a LMO content calendar that we use at our company.",

Most clients I see don’t actually want reddit leads, they want control over how they show up when prospects research them or their competitors. From an agency perspective, what works is research-led positioning inside existing demand, not promotional posts.

I do however think there's a gap between what they say they want and what they will ultimately use/trust. \n\nKnowing everything across the entire buyers journey and committee requires a level of attention and detail that many (not all) sellers will refuse to consume OR grow tired of consuming in time. The latter is expected because yet again, most prospects aren't in market and any given time 95/5 AND if they are, they have already created their shortlist. \n\nIf the sellers are armed with complete transparency and the results are similar to what marketing provided before than they quickly throw the baby out with the bathwater. \n\nMy experience is that there's very little room for nuance or grey when it comes to Sellers perception of Marketing. It's almost always binary and either works or it doesn't. No amount of c-suite kicking and screaming will change that short of a massive injection of new blood across all levels.",

It always sounded simple in theory, but in practice you’d spend hours stitching things together, deduping, fixing broken fields and somehow still end up babysitting one list for a week.\n\nRecently we built a free Chrome extension that finally made this part boring. You open a conference page, run the extension, and it helps to pull a clean, ordered list of people directly from that page, no Franken-spreadsheets n all vibes anymore.\n\nOnce you have the list, you can copy it and enrich in whatever tool you like (Clay, Crona ai, Clearbit etc.)\n\nThe point is you’re starting from a structured dataset instead of chaos.\n\nAfter that it’s just standard outbound: LinkedIn, email or conference app.\n\nNothing revolutionary, but if you’ve ever wasted days just trying to *prepare* a conference list, this saves a stupid amount of time.\n\nCurious how others here handle conference data scraping still DIY, or using something smarter?",

A no-brainer offer 2. Too cheap (and so too good to be true) 3. Any part of it it’s too expensive?\n\nI appreciate everyone of you who leaves feedback or critiques and I hope 2026 will be your best year!❤️",

I have the tech and the lead list, but I’m looking for advice on how to structure the hiring of a \"hunter\" to execute the outreach. Currently i do it myself but its taking too much of my time.\n\nThe Pitch to Sellers:\n\n* Zero Cost: We run ads for their products at no cost. $0 listing fees, $0 seller commissions. (we add a markup to the buyer's end)\n* Zero Manual Work: We built deep integrations for Shopify, Square, and WooCommerce. It takes 3 minutes to sync, then their inventory on our site updates automatically.\n* The Leads: I have a vetted list of \\~100 Canadian prospects. Will prob need more but i don't think theres more than 500 in canada.\n\nThe Strategy: I need someone to own the outreach. Method doesn't matter (Calls, Email, LinkedIn) as long as it's personalized and professional. Their only goal is to get the shop owner to spend 3 minutes connecting their store.\n\nThe Comp Plan I’m considering:\n\n* Guaranteed Base: Hourly or Fixed.\n* Upside: 2% trailing commission on all sales. Since high-end saddles are $2k–$5k+, this is a significant long-term incentive.\n\nMy questions for the community:\n\n1. What is this role actually called? Is this a BDR, a Partner Manager, or just a specialized Lead Gen role?\n2. Where do I find \"High-Touch\" hunters? General agencies and freelancers mostly focus on AI outreach. I need someone who can actually speak to a small business owner.",

Also, your pitch won’t be “no-brainer” to a shop owner until you address the real objections: who owns the customer, returns/support, price parity, and whether your markup makes them look expensive. For finding the right person, look for someone with actual small business phone experience (local media ads, payment processing, POS, or marketplace onboarding) and run a paid trial: give them 20 leads, listen to 5 recorded calls, and see if they can handle objections without sounding scripted.",

For a marketplace like this, finding the right outreach person is only half the battle though. The real bottleneck is usually lead supply. 100 Canadian prospects might sound fine for testing, but once you hire someone to execute, they'll burn through that list in weeks. Then you're back to scrapping for the next batch. The marketplace operators I've seen actually break through this ceiling aren't just better at outreach, they're better at finding the hidden sellers that aren't obvious - the ones who don't show up in basic searches but match the criteria perfectly. That's how you go from 100 prospects to 1,000+ without hitting a wall.",

I already have a few B2B clients, but my long-term plan is to develop and sell a product.  \nTo reach that point, I need to learn **sales & marketing** — a skill that I haven’t actively practiced before.\n\nI *could* hire someone to fill that gap, but before doing that, I want to understand the basics myself so I know what to expect and where to direct future efforts.\n\nBased on what I’ve learned so far (mostly theory), here is **the sales & marketing process I’m planning to follow.**  \nI’d love **validation, suggestions, or corrections** from people with experience.\n\n\n\n# 1. Identify where my ideal customers are\n\n* Start with existing clients: look for similar profiles (size, industry, geography, tech maturity)\n* Check my own network first: any potential customers or referrals?\n* Use tools like ChatGPT/LinkedIn/Semrush/etc. to refine ideal customer profiles\n\n\n\n# 2. Segment and group potential customers\n\n* Categorize by industry, revenue, geography, tech stack, pain points\n* Prioritize groups that align closely with my existing expertise\n\n\n\n# 3. Build simple demos / proofs of value\n\n* Create small working demos relevant to each customer segment\n* Present them on a webpage that also works like a *pitch deck* (problems → solutions → credibility → demo)\n\n\n\n# 4. Direct outreach\n\n* Personalized LinkedIn messages, emails, or warm introductions\n* Targeted outreach based on segmentation, not generic messaging\n\n\n\n# 5. Content creation to build visibility & trust\n\n* Post useful, consistent content on LinkedIn\n* Consider Meta platforms depending on customer segment (still unsure here)\n\n\n\n# 6. Paid ads?\n\n* Not sure if Google Ads or LinkedIn Ads make sense at this stage (should I focus on organic + outbound first?)\n\n\n\n# 7. Events & trade shows\n\n* Attend events where my target customers gather\n* Collect contacts → follow up with personalized outreach\n\n\n\n# 8. Sales calls & closing\n\n* Request introductory calls after value is demonstrated\n* Understand the problem → position solution → negotiate → close (I know this part will not be simple, but this is the intent)\n\n\n\n# My question to the community\n\nFor someone in my position (independent B2B engineer building toward a product), **is this a realistic sales & marketing approach to start with?**  \nWhat steps am I missing, overcomplicating, or misunderstanding?\n\nAny *validation, criticism, or practical suggestions* would be super valuable.\n\n\n\n# Thank you!",

The biggest unlock early is doing more discovery calls than demos: pick one narrow ICP, talk to 15–30 people, and write down the exact triggers that make them buy (a project blows up, a deadline, a hiring gap, a compliance change), then build your offer and messaging around those patterns. For consultancy, your fastest path is referrals and proof, so turn your current work into 2–3 tight one-page case studies with numbers and a clear before/after, and use those in outreach instead of new segment-specific demos. I’d skip paid ads for now and put that energy into a simple pipeline tracker and a weekly cadence of outreach + follow-ups, because consistency beats more channels at this stage.",

Discovery is the product early on. You are not just selling, you are extracting language, objections, and buying logic that will later become your product positioning.\n\nDo not recommend touching paid ads until outbound feels boring because it works. If outbound feels chaotic, ads will magnify the chaos.",

Then polish it until your customers love it.\n\nYour marketing efforts will be 10,000% easier this way. You won't be wondering who your ICP is.... you won't be wondering how to talk about your product to your customers since you've already been doing it. You won't need to build demos because you can share proven case studies instead.\n\nThen when you are ready for marketing any money and time you spend there will go so much farther.\n\nTrust me.....

Corporate gifting, retail, hospitality, agencies… each of those buyers thinks very differently. If you don’t focus, the offer ends up feeling vague and gets ignored.\n\nIf I had to pick a starting point, I’d usually lean toward either corporate gifting or boutique retail, not hotels first. Hospitality buyers tend to care a lot about consistency, volume, replacement, and logistics. That’s hard when you work with artisans unless your supply chain is already very solid.\n\nCorporate gifting and small retailers are often more open to story, craftsmanship, and perceived value. But even there, the positioning matters a lot. You don’t sell “handmade items”, you sell a use case: a premium client gift, a branded object with meaning, something that fits a space or a brand narrative.\n\nChannel-wise, early on, direct outreach usually works better than marketplaces. A short, well-targeted pitch to the right buyer beats listing products and hoping someone finds them. Partnerships can come later, once you know which segment actually responds.\n\nThe biggest unlock is treating this less like “selling crafts” and more like building a focused B2B offer around a specific buyer problem.",

The volume is so low you won't trigger spam filters unless your emails are garbage. With our clients doing niche B2B outreach we actually prefer manual sending for lists this size because you can personalize properly and each email feels like a real person wrote it, which matters way more when you're reaching museum directors and university archivists.\n\nSkip Zoho and dedicated email services. That's overkill. Your Google Workspace setup is plenty. Just make sure your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are configured properly and you're good.\n\nThe real advantage you have is that your market is small and relationship-driven. These aren't people getting hammered by cold emailers every day. A thoughtful personal email that references something specific about their collection or recent project will stand out. Don't waste that advantage by automating and making it feel templated.",

The ROI usually comes from shaving 10–15 minutes off every call by auto-producing a clean summary, decisions, and 3–5 next steps in a consistent format that someone can paste into the CRM immediately. The hard part isn’t the wearable, it’s consent/compliance and having a simple workflow for where the notes go and who sanity-checks them before they become “truth.” If you want to test it properly, pick one meeting type (discovery or QBRs), track time spent on notes/follow-ups for 2 weeks, and compare with a baseline while watching for missed details or awkward “are you recording me?” moments. If it doesn’t reduce admin time without creating trust/compliance headaches, it’s still a toy for that org.",

      "text": "When it comes to optimizing cold emails, many factors are discussed in the space, ranging from right targeting to lead qualification and, finally, message personalization. However, one thing that flies under the radar is **timing**.\n\nTo get the best response from a prospect, timing is crucial. For example, imagine you offer web design and branding. You research a potential prospect and find that their website is old and the founder posted on social media about considering a redesign. In general, these are very good signals. However, if you see that these signals are from November 2023 (two years ago), referencing them in an email will likely result in being ignored, as the website has probably already been redesigned.\n\nTherefore, when you have a system for qualifying leads, whether getting information via Clay or your own custom-built systems, make sure the timing factor is always incorporated into your prompts or methodology. If a lead shows strong signs that they needed your solution, but those signals are old, the lead must be sorted out and not contacted with that specific information.\n\nYou can park this lead for future use, but for now, this is a **Tier 3** lead, meaning you don't need to contact them immediately. Focus on the most current information; for example, if funding was secured two weeks ago, this is a huge sign to reach out to that prospect with your offer. Always prioritize current information over past information in your lead scoring.",

It’s funny because in a world where everyone is obsessed with TikTok and SEO, people forget that \"offline\" is still a channel.\n​I started experimenting with direct mail recently, and it was a total reality check for me. We spend all this time fighting for a split second of attention in a crowded inbox or a busy feed, but a physical postcard? It literally sits on their desk. It’s a \"quiet\" channel that no one is using anymore, which makes it incredibly high-leverage.\n​The key I’ve found (and this is what really clicked for me when I looked into the RIO integrated marketing campaign framework) is that the postcard shouldn't be a standalone thing. It has to be a \"pillar\" in a much larger \"messaging house.\"\n​If they get your postcard, then see a LinkedIn ad with the same visual, and then get an email that uses the exact same core message, you’ve created a unified flow that makes your brand feel ten times bigger than it is. It’s that repetition across different channels (especially a physical one) that builds insane trust.\n​At $0.75 a pop, it’s the cheapest way to \"retarget\" someone in the real world. Just make sure the message on the card is the \"foundation\" for the conversation you’re having with them everywhere else.\n​Keep it a secret, though.

          "text": "From a SaaS ops angle, what I am seeing work best is honestly less about new tactics and more about tightening the loop between marketing promises and the actual product and support experience. Teams that win seem to be very clear on who the product is not for and reflect that everywhere, even if it shrinks top of funnel. That reduces churn and support noise, which leadership actually feels. A lot of flashy stuff still exists, but the companies scaling calmly tend to invest in clear positioning, good onboarding, and proof points that come from real customer outcomes. It is not exciting, but it compounds. I am curious if others are seeing the same shift away from novelty back to fundamentals.",

Community engagement in places like Reddit is actually working pretty well right now, especially since ad costs keep climbing and people are tuning out traditional ads. The tricky part is doing it without looking spammy which gets old fast.\n\nI've seen some companies handle it themselves and others use services like Community Mentions to stay compliant and not get shadowbanned. The real value is in finding conversations where people are already asking about solutions you offer rather than pushing into unrelated threads.\n\nAlso worth checking out the demandcurve newsletter if you haven't already, they cover emerging tactics pretty regularly. r/SaaS has had some good discussions on this stuff latley too.",
