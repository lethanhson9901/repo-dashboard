Some say Reddit marketing is great for leads, others say it’s a waste and no real buyers are here.\n\nI started with SEO and traditional B2B marketing, but progress was slow and ads got expensive. Then I noticed how often Reddit threads rank on Google, which made me rethink it as part of an SEO and demand discovery play.\n\nCurious what others have seen. Has Reddit marketing actually brought you leads, esp for B2B? If so, what types of posts or communities worked for you?",

Your \"pitch\" is not a pitch anymore, it's about the reputation/involvement you have in a community.

Show up early, stay helpful, and let interest build. Some teams track high-intent threads so they don’t miss chances. odd angles media works in that low-key lane.

Every time you post a response to someone looking for help or guidance (considering you actually provide help), you are demonstrating experience + expertise not only to the person who posted, but to anyone else who reads your comment.\n\n4) Reddit posts and comments will exist on the internet for as long as Reddit lives.

The \"increase efficiency\" messaging gets deleted because it could apply to literally anyone and signals zero understanding of their specific situation.\n\nThe practical approach without dedicated research teams:\n\nBuild division-specific messaging templates once, then customize lightly per account. You probably have 5-7 common divisions you sell into. Create the core value prop and pain point messaging for each division type, then add account-specific context when you reach out. The manufacturing value prop stays mostly consistent across manufacturers, you're just adding details about their specific situation.\n\nThe account research that matters takes 15-20 minutes, not hours. LinkedIn for org structure and recent hires, earnings calls and 10-Ks for strategic priorities, news for recent initiatives or pain points. Our clients doing enterprise outreach usually find that one relevant detail about their specific situation beats pages of generic research.\n\nThe multi-threading approach works better than going deep on one division initially. Light touches across multiple divisions in the same account surface where actual budget and urgency exists. The division you thought was the entry point often isn't.\n\nThe signal-based prioritization helps focus effort. Look for divisions that just hired for roles related to your solution, ones posting jobs that suggest relevant projects, and executives engaging with content about problems you solve. Those signals indicate where actual budget and urgency exist, making deeper research worthwhile.",

B2B buyers do way more research before ever identifying themselves, and privacy changes mean less tracking works than it used to. That said, \"most visitors never convert\" on paid traffic usually signals something fixable rather than just market behavior.\n\nThe diagnostic questions that matter: what's your landing page conversion rate? If you're below 2-3% on targeted B2B traffic, the page is probably the problem, not the ads. What happens after the click? Are people bouncing immediately or spending time and leaving without converting? Those are different problems.\n\nThe engagement-without-conversion pattern usually means one of a few things: the offer isn't compelling enough to justify giving up contact info, there's a mismatch between ad promise and landing page delivery, or the form is asking for too much too early. Our clients seeing this gap often fix it by lowering the commitment ask. \"Get a demo\" converts worse than \"see how it works\" which converts worse than ungated value.\n\nThe intent tools like Clearbit Reveal, RB2B, or Leadfeeder can identify some percentage of anonymous company-level traffic. Won't catch everyone but helps you see if the right companies are visiting even when individuals don't convert.\n\nThe LinkedIn versus Google comparison matters too. LinkedIn traffic is expensive but should be highly targeted. If that traffic isn't converting, your landing page or offer is almost certainly the issue. Google traffic might just be less qualified depending on keywords.",

When conversions are low I’d judge paid traffic by quality signals instead of forms like time on page, scroll depth, repeat visits, page paths and whether people come back later via branded or direct. Light intent actions like pricing views or case studies help too and company level intent or IP data can show if the right accounts are visiting. If engagement is solid from the right industries, the ads are probably working. The gap is usually timing or mid funnel not traffic quality",

We automate the unopinionated stuff like routing, reminders, basic follow-ups, and nudges based on inactivity  but anything that needs context or judgment stays manual. This improves trust factor.\n\nUsing intent and behavior signals instead of generic timelines made a big difference for us. Follow-ups based on what someone actually did (or didn’t do) feel far more genuine than canned sequences.\n\nThe sweet spot is letting automation decide who to engage and when, while humans focus on how to engage.",

High-intent stuff like demo requests stays fully manual. Cold LinkedIn outreach? That’s where automation actually saves you without killing quality.\n\nIf you're doing any linkedin prospecting, tools like HeyReach or Expandi can handle the volume side safely. HeyReach is nice because it lets you run multiple accounts without the constant ban paranoia, which is clutch when you're scaling. You can push serious volume across profiles, like 1000+ touches per week, but it's distributed so nothing looks spammy.\n\nThe trick is using it to open doors, not close them. Any reply or engagement gets flagged, then a real person jumps in with full context. Automation handles the grunt work, humans handle the trust building. That handoff is where most teams win or lose.\n\nAre you mostly inbound or is outbound part of the strategy too?",

          "text": "The \"leads but no sales\" trap is the absolute worst. It’s like throwing a party where everyone shows up for the free drinks but nobody stays for the actual event. If you're getting volume but zero revenue, it usually means your funnel isn't a funnel: it’s just a bunch of random touchpoints that don't actually talk to each other.\n​The breakdown usually happens because the \"vibe\" shifts. You lure them in with a cool ad, but then the landing page feels generic, and the follow-up emails feel like they were written by a robot from 2005. People drop off the second they feel a \"dead end\" or get confused about what they’re supposed to do next.\n​I used to have this exact problem until I stopped thinking about individual ads and started thinking about the whole flow. Personally, I've been leveraging the RIO integrated marketing campaign framework for a bit now and it completely changed my way of doing marketing. It makes sure everything is actually connected so you aren't just wasting cash on clicks.\n\n​Here is how I’d fix it:\n​First, you gotta Rally your message. If your top-of-funnel is promising a specific solution, your middle-of-funnel better be doubling down on that same \"messaging house.\" If there’s a gap between what they signed up for and what you’re selling, they’ll bounce every time.\n​Then, you have to Integrate the journey. This is where most funnels leak. You need to map it out so there are zero dead ends. If they download a PDF, the very next email should be a logical \"part two\" of that conversation. If they visit your pricing page but don't buy, your retargeting ads should hit them with a case study. It’s all about connecting the pipes so they can’t fall out.\n​Finally, you Orchestrate the timing. Conversion is a slow burn. You can't just scream \"buy now\" the second they give you an email. You gotta time your touches—educational stuff first to build trust, then some social proof, then the hard offer.\n\n​When you actually integrate your channels like this, the conversion part feels way more natural. You're not \"selling\" as much as you are just guiding them to the next step.",

One thing I’ve learned is that a funnel that just drives lead volume often misses the deeper connection that moves prospects to convert. It’s crucial to build a clear narrative throughout your funnel that aligns with your positioning and resonates with your target audience’s pain points.\n\nYou want your messaging and website story to guide leads seamlessly toward a decision, supported by sales enablement materials that address objections and reinforce value. Consistent conversions come from treating leads as people, not just numbers, and creating a funnel that builds trust at every touchpoint.

Then boom - overnight my CAC went from $38 to $142. I literally threw up in my mouth a little.\n\n**The \"Oh Shit\" Moment**\n\nI had 6 weeks of runway left\n\nTurned off all ads.

I said fuck that.\n\nI built custom software (okay fine, I paid a developer on Upwork $800, but I PROJECT MANAGED IT so basically I built it).\n\nThe scraper:\n\n* Pulls company websites from my ICP search\n* Scrapes their actual website copy, tech stack, recent blog posts\n* Hits LinkedIn to grab decision-maker info\n* Feeds it all into a prompt that writes personalized first lines\n\nPeople open emails that feel like you actually visited their website. Wild concept, I know.\n\n**Week 5-8: Scaling to 1,500 Emails/Day Without Losing My Mind**\n\nThis is where it got real.\n\nFrom 300 emails/day to 1,500/day.\n\nThe math: 1,500 emails/day × 21 working days = 31,500 emails per month.\n\nAt a 3% reply rate (industry average is 1%, but personalization is magic), that's 945 replies.\n\nAt a 15% meeting booking rate from replies, that's 141 meetings.\n\nAt a 25% close rate... you see where this is going.\n\nMy CAC went from $142 on Meta to $47 with cold email. And it kept dropping as I optimized.\n\nI shut down Meta ads entirely. Haven't looked back.\n\nNow I run a cold outreach agency helping other B2B companies do the same thing. Turns out when you figure out how to print money, people want to pay you to teach them.\n\n**The Shit No One Tells You**\n\n* Week 1 was fucking BRUTAL. 6% inbox rate because I didn't warm properly\n* I got my first domain blacklisted on day 4\n* Gmail's spam filters updated in week 5 and tanked my inbox rate overnight.

Search your brand, your product category, competitor comparisons, and common buying queries in ChatGPT and Perplexity periodically. Screenshot results, track changes over time. Not scalable but currently the most accurate method.\n\nThe tools claiming to track AI mentions are mostly overselling their capabilities. Our clients who've tried them usually find the data is directional at best and the methodology is opaque. Some are literally just running the same manual queries you could do yourself and charging monthly for it.\n\nThe signals that actually tell you something: branded search volume trends, direct traffic patterns, and asking new customers how they found you. If AI discovery is happening, some percentage will search your brand name afterward or mention \"ChatGPT recommended you\" when asked.\n\nThe optimization side might matter more than the measurement side right now. Creating content that answers specific questions clearly, building citations and mentions across authoritative sources, and having consistent product information that AI can pull from. You can't track recommendations perfectly, but you can influence whether they happen.",

I know enough about lead gen to fake it in a pitch but we can't really activate well against it.\n\nOur primary model with bigger clients is to work with partner agencies in order to leverage scale when possible.  We have a proven partner for the brand space.  We need one for demand/lead gen.  Right now we are relying on a (somewhat flakey) freelancer to run our Google Ads accounts.  I run LinkedIn and other socials with the one junior on my team.\n\nI'm looking for either an agency or a rock solid freelancer that we can white label and bring on when necessary.  Definitely need to see some solid DG/LG case studies in addition to standard creds. We've lost pitches because we don't have this capability.\n\nFor case studies, I'm not sure exactly what we're looking for but maybe something that talks about lead quality (% that converted to SALs for example) or direct ties to closed /won $$$.\n\nI've been challenged by our CEO to come up with a short list of agencies to RFP.  Trying to Google this topic is a hellscape so I figured I'd start here.  Feel free to comment or hit my Reddit DMs.\n\nedit:\nSomeone sent me DM about cold emails and I fat fingered it and hit \"ignore\". Apologies for that.

          "text": "The white-label demand gen partner search is tricky because the agencies good enough to produce SAL conversion data and closed-won attribution usually have their own client roster and aren't hungry for white-label arrangements. The ones actively seeking white-label work are often the B-tier players who couldn't build their own book.\n\nThe exception is smaller shops or senior freelancers who prefer the referral model over business development. They exist but they're not advertising \"white label demand gen\" because their pipeline comes from relationships exactly like what you're describing.\n\nThe case study red flags to watch for: agencies showing MQL volume without downstream metrics are hiding poor lead quality. Anyone who can't speak to sales feedback loops or lead-to-opportunity conversion probably isn't measuring what matters. Our clients evaluating demand gen partners usually find that the willingness to discuss what didn't work is more telling than polished success stories.\n\nThe RFP criteria worth emphasizing: ask specifically about their process for feedback loops with sales teams, how they define and measure lead quality beyond form fills, and what their approach is when a campaign produces volume but sales says the leads are garbage. The good partners have answers because they've navigated this tension before.\n\nThe sourcing approach since Google is useless: LinkedIn posts from demand gen practitioners you respect, asking peers at non-competing agencies who they've partnered with, and honestly the HubSpot and 6sense partner directories sometimes surface capable smaller shops.\n\nThe freelancer versus agency question: a senior freelancer with 10+ years of B2B demand gen experience might outperform a mid-tier agency and be more flexible on white-label terms.",

      "text": "No intro needed, I’ll skip the fluff and go straight to what actually worked for us and for other B2B/SaaS teams I’ve seen do it well:\n\n# 1. Make sure you’re ready\n\nAffiliate programs amplify what’s already working. If you don’t have product–market fit, happy customers, or predictable conversions, affiliates won’t fix that. What they will do is bring you more of what’s already converting.\n\nRule of thumb: wait until you can confidently say, “If I drive 100 visitors to my site, X will become paying customers.”\n\n# 2. Decide on commission structure\n\nThis is where SaaS differs from e-commerce. Most SaaS affiliate programs use recurring commissions, because affiliates love predictable income streams.\n\n* Typical range: 20–30% of subscription revenue\n* Duration: 12–24 months (some even go lifetime if margins allow)\n* Hybrid model: one-time signup bonus + recurring percentage\n\nMake it attractive enough that affiliates feel long-term upside, but sustainable for you.\n\n# 3. Recruit the right affiliates\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is thinking affiliates equal influencers. In SaaS/B2B, the best partners are usually:\n\n* Agencies/consultants serving your ICP\n* Freelancers/contractors who recommend tools daily\n* Community leaders (Slack groups, LinkedIn, Reddit mods)\n* Content creators who write reviews, tutorials, or comparison posts\n\nStart with people who already trust your brand or work with your customers.\n\n# 4. Onboard and activate them\n\nSigning someone up isn’t enough. Affiliates succeed when you make promotion frictionless. That means:\n\n* Clear onboarding (walkthrough of your product and program basics)\n* Access to promo resources (banners, swipe copy, FAQs, case studies)\n* Education (what messaging works best, who your ICP is)\n* A point of contact for questions (affiliates love human support)\n\n# 5. Track properly\n\nNothing kills a program faster than bad tracking. Affiliates need to trust that you’ll track their referrals accurately and pay them fairly.\n\n# 6. Start small and then scale (don't rush!)\n\nStart with a hand-picked group of affiliates. Work closely with them, optimize messaging, fix tracking issues, and learn what converts.\n\nOnce you’ve nailed these, you can scale recruitment with:\n\n* Affiliate directories\n* Outreach campaigns\n* Community partnerships\n* Even running paid ads to “recruit affiliates”\n\nIn a nutshell you need to remember that affiliate marketing in SaaS isn't just about sharing links. It takes time and effort so you need to know this before kicking it off.",

They think your marketing is great. But sometimes the pain is not acute enough for them to act. They don't want to be \"that person\" who buys \"that solution\" that is never used or is a flop or results in reputations getting burned. That's normal. In B2B context, most people who buy are trying to protect their own reputations. Half the battle is getting a second person within the target organisation onboard. \n\nThis is why B2B selling becomes easier when you know how to leverage that social dynamic withing organisations to your advantage. Because once you get more than one person involved in the buying process, the personal \"reputational\" risk for the buyer is now hedged. Listening in on sales calls is great way to find out how people more experienced than you turn prospect into a \"champion\" or find a champion for your product within the organisation. Check out a book called The Challenger Customer - it helps explain this dynamic in a bit more detail.",

      "text": "  \nMeta is working better for B2B services than most people assume. It's cheaper than Linkedin and it’s good at finding your audience once you give it the right inputs.\n\n* For our own agency offer, “we help you book 2–3 calls per week with your ICP,” we’ve booked calls as low as $19 per call\n* For high-ticket B2B service clients (mostly software dev, $50k+ ACV), booked call cost typically lands in the $150–250 range when the system is built correctly\n* We’ve successfully targeted niches that are hard to target via interests, for example Web3 startup founders, where Meta has almost no clean targeting criteria. We still got leads who were clearly building crypto products and startups, because the creative and conversion signals did the work.\n\nThat last point matters. People overestimate targeting and underestimate the creative. Meta is now good at finding the right B2B audience even with broad targeting, if your ads are clearly written for a specific persona and you feed it the right conversion signals.\n\n# The playbook\n\n# 1) Start with persona clarity, not targeting tricks\n\nThe single most important variable is whether the ad speaks to a very specific person.\n\nA real persona in a real context:\n\n* CTO at a scale-up SaaS company\n* Founder of an early-stage startup\n* CIO of a medical clinic network\n* CMO at a services firm\n\nIf the first line doesn’t make that person think “this is exactly my situation,” you’ll get junk leads regardless of your funnel.\n\nWhat we define upfront:\n\n* Persona and buying role\n* Trigger moment (what changed that makes them act now)\n* One expensive pain\n* One credible outcome\n* Proof that you can deliver it\n\n# 2) Services can work directly, but strong offers increase conversions\n\nDirect service ads can work well if they’re persona-specific and credible.\n\nIrresistible offers work because they create a mechanism and set expectations. Examples:\n\n* “Book 2–3 ICP-qualified calls per week”\n* “Cloud cost audit, find 15–25% savings”\n* “Delivery bottleneck scan in 24 hours”\n* “MVP scope and delivery plan”\n\nOne caution: audit/consultation offers attract “pick your brain” leads. That’s fine, but you must build filtering into the funnel so your calendar doesn’t get hijacked by free-advice seekers.\n\n# 3) Credibility is not optional in B2B\n\nMost Meta lead quality problems are really trust problems.\n\nHigh-ACV buyers need reasons to believe you, fast. Proof points are not decoration, they’re the conversion engine:\n\n* One strong metric\n* Logos, if allowed\n* Short, specific testimonials\n* Clear “what happens on the call”\n* Proof of a repeatable process\n\nIf you can’t show proof, you’ll still get leads. They just won’t be the ones you want.\n\n# 4) Funnel architecture: optimize for bookings, not form submits\n\nTwo flows work:\n\nInstant Form funnel (fast, mobile-first)\n\n* Ad → Instant Form → Thank You screen → Calendar booking → CRM → follow-up\n\nLanding page funnel (more context, higher intent)\n\n* Ad → Landing Page → Form → TY page with embedded calendar → CRM → follow-up\n\nEither way, the rule is the same: the conversion is the booked call, not the form.\n\nYour Thank You step should push scheduling hard:\n\n* Calendar button or embed\n* Clear instruction to book now\n* Backup email/SMS with booking link for non-bookers\n\n# 5) Qualification: filter without killing volume\n\nThis is where most teams break things.\n\nWe define QualifiedLead as strict rules and mirror it in the form:\n\n* Role/seniority\n* Company size\n* Industry or business model\n* Budget band (if needed)\n* Timeline/urgency\n\nThen we route:\n\n* Qualified → show calendar immediately\n* Not qualified → no calendar, lighter nurture path\n\nThis protects sales time and keeps CPL sane.\n\n# 6) Creative system: unpolished, specific, and diverse\n\nWhat works right now looks less like advertising and more like a relevant message.\n\nFormats that consistently perform:\n\n* Statics with simple “Twitter-style” text\n* Carousels (pain → mechanism → proof → CTA)\n* Founder videos (unpolished, direct, truthful)\n* iPhone Notes style, plain background text\n\nCreative rules we follow:\n\n* Call out the persona in the first line\n* One pain only\n* One outcome only\n* One proof point\n* One CTA\n\n# 7) The real edge: CRM + CAPI feedback loop (optimize for QualifiedLead)\n\nIf you optimize Meta for raw leads, it will find you the cheapest form-fillers on earth. So optimizing for MQLs or SQLs (depending on the client budget and the volume of SQLs) is the golden rule at my agency XQL Group.\n\nThe biggest unlock is sending back quality signals via Conversions API:\n\n* Lead captured in CRM (with UTMs and ad IDs)\n* Lead qualifies based on your rules\n* Send QualifiedLead event back to Meta\n* Send BookedCall event when they schedule\n* Optional: Showed, Deal Won later\n\nThis trains Meta to find people who look like your real buyers, not people who like filling forms.\n\n# 8) Follow-up is part of the funnel\n\nA lot of qualified people won’t book instantly.\n\nWe run:\n\n* Non-booker sequence (immediate, then daily for a week, then weekly)\n* Booked reminders (instant confirmation, 24h, 1h)\n* No-show recovery (same-day reschedule, 48h follow-up)\n\nThis is where a meaningful percentage of extra bookings come from.\n\n# The takeaway\n\nMeta is currently very capable at finding B2B audiences, even when targeting options are limited, if:\n\n* you speak clearly to a specific persona\n* you make trust easy through proof\n* you route and filter properly\n* you train the algorithm with QualifiedLead signals via CRM + CAPI\n\nIf you’ve tried Meta before and it “didn’t work,” the failure mode is usually one of these: vague persona, weak proof, wrong conversion signal, or no feedback loop.",

The part most teams miss is upstream signal quality if your audience seed is weak or generic, even great creative struggles. When ads are fed from people already showing intent elsewhere (content engagement, competitor awareness, problem aware behavior), Meta converges way faster and CPL stabilizes. Creative gets the credit, but audience definition quietly does most of the work.",
