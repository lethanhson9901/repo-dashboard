                  "text": "If you are sending hundreds of emails and getting little to no response, that is the first issue to address. Pull back from the spray and pray approach before trying to scale. Volume is irrelevant if no one is replying. At that point, you are likely overwhelming prospects and hurting your own results. Tighten your messaging and test it with smaller segments before expanding your list. Make sure the positioning is clear and compelling before increasing output.\n\nAlso consider the platform you are using for outbound. Deliverability continues to get more challenging. You need confidence that your emails are reaching inboxes rather than spam or junk folders. If they are not being seen, you cannot expect replies. Poor deliverability can also damage your domain reputation over time.\n\nIf you have current customers, interview them. That is often where the strongest messaging originates. Understand their original pain points, what they are accountable for, the metrics they are measured against, why they began evaluating solutions, and what ultimately led them to choose yours. Their language and motivations should shape your outreach. If needed, offer a small incentive such as a gift card to secure their time.\n\nYour emails also come across as highly sales focused. That is common with cold outreach, but recipients are not interested in your company background or product features at first glance. They want to know how you can make their work easier and why it matters to them. Shift the focus away from who you are and toward what you can concretely do for them, explained in simple terms.\n\nAsking if someone is interested in the first email can also be premature. How I phrase it to my team - you don’t want to ask them to get married before you have the first date. You need to give them a compelling reason to respond. Consider offering a relevant case study or useful resource as a way to measure engagement instead of ending with a generic question. Test subject lines, body copy, and calls to action to gather data on what resonates. That experimentation takes effort, which is another reason to limit your list size initially. Refine what works before scaling, so you do not exhaust your entire target audience while still figuring out your approach.",

Learn how they buy, who the decision makers are, what triggers a supplier switch, and what objections come up.

You'll have a core proposition per customer group or per product (ideally the former) your proposition is a compelling offer that resonates. It's something that your organisation does better than the competition in delivering a valued outcome to your client.\n\nIts not easy to get clarity on your proposition but there are fairly formulaic steps you can follow to get there. The first is taking a step back from tactics and trying to really understand your target customer. Not understand what needs they have for your product but truly understand what makes them tick. This can be a little desk research (googling or gpt) but really needs to include calls with clients. No-sales research interviews. It can feel hard to run these when all you wanna do is pitch but it helps things in the long run.\n\nCustomer is most important, doing that and then layering competitor and your product capability should through up some ideas for what your core value proposition is.\n\nIf helpful to lay it out a bit more let me know and I'll write something up.",

Way easier to build momentum when you're not switching contexts every call.\n\nAlso, consistent follow-ups matter more than you think. We thought people were ignoring us, too but turns out B2B cycles are just long and people need like 5-7 touchpoints before they even respond. Set up a simple system to track who you've talked to and when to follow up again.\n\nAnd honestly, trade shows and LinkedIn might not be your best channels. What's worked better for us is finding where your buyers actually hang out: industry groups, forums, even niche Slack communities. Cold outreach from those places converts way better than generic LinkedIn messages.\n\nDon't give up yet. Four months is nothing in B2B.

Recently, I decided to leave my full time job and, with a bit of runway, start my own SaaS instead of working a regular 9-5.\n\nAnyway, it’s gone pretty well and I’ve hit approx 2k per month with a pretty decent profit margin.\n\nI’ve got to this point by product hunt launches and launching on other similar sites.\n\nI’ve got a super low churn rate, which is helpful! However, I don’t feel as though I have enough money to start doing paid ads.\n\nI’ve got approx $900 to work with each month. My question is this: how do I get to 10k per month without doing paid ads?\n\nIt’s a bit of a catch-22. I can’t scale without ads and I can’t get ads without scaling.\n\nMy tool is a SaaS that identifies visitors on your website and turns them into pipeline for you to sell to. See: Clickmodus.com\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.",

We've found a lot of success by focusing on super-targeted engagement within niche communities, like you mentioned. The key is finding relevant conversations happening in real-time. For us, that's been across Reddit, X, and LinkedIn. The challenge we faced was the sheer volume of posts and comments. Just searching for keywords wasnt cutting it – too much irrelevant stuff. We ended up building a tool to solve this. It helps us filter out the noise and only notifies us when theres a genuine opportunity to contribute to a relevant discussion or connect with a potential customer. It’s been a game-changer for finding warm leads through organic outreach, because we can catch people actively discussing problems our product solves. Plus, having some suggested replies ready to go saves a ton of time. To answer your question directly, communities have been the biggest driver of real opportunities for us. Its about being helpful, adding value to the conversation, and building relationships. Outbound still has its place, but its gotta be warm and informed by insights gathered from those community interactions.",

Your list is basically the symptom list.What’s worked best for us lately is boring but reliable: pick a tight ICP, pick one problem they already admit they have, and build one path that goes from “I saw this” to “I want to talk” without switching voices 5 times. If LinkedIn posts don’t lead to DMs, the post is usually too generic, or the CTA is weird. If emails get no replies, they’re written for the sender, not the buyer.Also agree with the commenter calling out “activity cosplay.” If you’re not getting real convos, shrink the target list and go deeper. 20–50 accounts with real angles beats blasting 2,000 people with “quick question.”If you’re trying to fix the whole system (not just tweak copy), having someone come in and force alignment on ICP, offer, and what counts as a qualified opportunity can save months. I’ve seen Demand Revenue be solid for that kind of “make the machine actually connect” work without turning it into a million random tactics.",

Send a connection note only after they recognize my name from those comments.\n\n4. Track every reply and set a reminder to follow up three days later if they go quiet.\n\nI use Depost AI to manage this entire workflow.

Pick a problem, not a feature**\n\nYour audience doesn't care about your feature set.\n\nThey care about their problem.\n\nBuild the workshop around solving that problem live.\n\nAsk yourself: \"If I removed my product name from the title, would people still want to attend?\"\n\nIf yes, you've got a good topic.\n\n**2. Make it hands-on**\n\n\"Webinar\" = passive. Someone talks, you watch. \"Workshop\" = active. You follow along and build something.\n\nWorkshops convert 3-5x better because attendees experience the product while learning.\n\nThey don't need a separate trial, they already used it.\n\nGive attendees a temporary account or free access during the session.\n\nLet them follow along in real-time.\n\nBy the end, they've already built something with your tool.\n\nThe switching cost is now in YOUR favor.\n\n**3. Keep it short (45 min max)**\n\nNobody has 90 minutes for your webinar.\n\nRespect their time.\n\n* 5 min: quick intro, set expectations\n* 30 min: hands-on workshop (the meat)\n* 5 min: Q&A\n* 5 min: \"here's how to keep going\" (your soft CTA)\n\n**4. The soft CTA (not a pitch)**\n\nAt the end, don't do a 10-minute sales pitch. Instead:\n\n>\n\nThat's it.\n\nThey already experienced the value.\n\nThe CTA is just \"keep going.\" No \"buy now,\" no \"limited time offer.\"\n\n**5. Record and repurpose**\n\nThe live workshop is one event.\n\nThe recording is an evergreen asset.\n\n* Post the recording on YouTube (SEO value)\n* Clip highlights for LinkedIn and Twitter\n* Use the transcript as a blog post\n* Gate the recording behind an email capture for ongoing leads\n\nOne 45-minute workshop can generate content and leads for months.\n\n# Where to find attendees (without spending $5k on ads):\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. \"I'll run a great workshop... but who's coming?\"\n\n**1. Reddit threads** People posting \"how do I do X?\" in your niche subreddits are your workshop audience.\n\nDrop a helpful comment and mention you're running a live workshop on exactly that topic.\n\n**2. LinkedIn posts** Post about the problem your workshop solves. End with \"I'm running a free workshop on this - drop a 🔥 if you want the link.\"\n\n**3. Your existing email list** Even if it's 200 people. An email with \"Free live workshop: \\[Skill\\]\" outperforms any newsletter you'll ever write.\n\n**4. Partner with someone in an adjacent space** Find someone who serves the same audience but isn't a competitor.\n\nCo-host the workshop.\n\nYou both promote to your lists.\n\nDouble the attendance.\n\n# The numbers that matter:\n\n|**Metric**|**Good**|**Great**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Registration → attendance rate|30-40%|50%+|\n|Attendee → trial signup|15-20%|30%+|\n|Attendee → paid conversion|5-10%|15%+|\n|Cost per attendee|$30-50|Under $20|\n\nCompare that to cold outreach where you're paying $80-150 per lead who may or may not even have the problem you solve.\n\n# Common mistakes:\n\n**1. Making it a demo in disguise.** People can smell this. If your \"workshop\" is just your sales engineer clicking through the product, attendance drops to zero by minute 10.\n\n**2. Running it once and giving up.** The first webinar always has low attendance. The third one is where you find your groove. The tenth one is where it becomes a machine.\n\n**3. Not following up.** Someone attended your workshop but didn't convert? Follow up with the recording, a summary of what they built, and an offer to continue. This alone can double your conversion rate.\n\n**4. Overcomplicating the tech.** You don't need a $500/month webinar platform. Zoom + a landing page + an email reminder sequence. That's it.\n\n**5. Gating the workshop behind too much info.** Name and email. That's all you need to register. Every additional field drops registration by 10-15%.\n\n# The bottom line:\n\nWebinars-as-demos are dead. Workshops-as-education are the best-kept growth secret in SaaS.\n\nYou teach something valuable. You use your product as the tool. Attendees experience value before they ever see a pricing page. And the content lives forever as recordings, clips, and blog posts.\n\nIf you're spending $3k/month on ads and getting lukewarm leads, try running one free workshop per month instead. The leads are warmer, the conversion is higher, and the cost is basically your time.\n\nAnyone here running workshops for their SaaS? What's working?",

Rankings and backlinks still matter, obviously, but I keep hearing people say they found brands through ChatGPT or Google AI Overviews instead of clicking search results. That kind of made me pause. It feels like LLM visibility and AI search optimization are becoming their own thing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to wrap my head around is what actually moves the needle here. Is it still mostly the traditional SEO stuff like topical authority and strong internal linking? Or is AI visibility more about clear positioning, solid comparison pages, tight FAQs, structured content, and consistent brand mentions across trusted sites? It’s a bit confusing tbh.\n\nFor anyone actively working on GEO or AEO, what has genuinely helped you get cited in AI answers? Are you tracking LLM mentions separately from normal rankings? And honestly, what mistakes have you made that others should avoid when trying to build long-term AI search visibility?",

Clear positioning, strong comparison pages, direct answers, tight FAQs, and consistent mentions across the web. LLMs need to clearly understand what you are and when to recommend you.\n\nThe teams doing well treat GEO as a second layer. They still optimize for Google, but they also track a set of non-branded prompts in ChatGPT or Perplexity, log citations, and adjust content based on gaps. Some use tools like Meridian to make that tracking easier over time.\n\nBig mistake I see? Adding more content instead of making existing content clearer and more citable.

But let's cut the bullshit: it's **not** \"its own thing\" separate from SEO.\n\nI've run AEO for SaaS clients since 2024 one fintech jumped 7x in citations in 90 days by adding original benchmarks + advertorials on authority pubs, plus tracking via tools like Profound or Semrush AI Visibility. Zero magic; just consistent, citable content + off-site authority signals.\n\nMistakes killing most people: keyword stuffing (AI hates it), ignoring conversational/long-tail intent, stagnant content (freshness matters), or chasing \"simplified\" fluff that tanks real SEO.\n\nTrack LLM mentions separately yes, use visibility tools (Semrush, Conductor benchmarks show it's now a core KPI).\n\nIf you're still treating this as \"classic SEO + some FAQs,\" you're getting eaten alive. Build real authority with data no one else has, get mentioned everywhere trusted, and structure like AI wants to quote you. That's it no shortcuts.\n\nAI visibility isn't new tricks; it's traditional SEO on steroids with citation hunger.\n\nDo that, or watch your traffic evaporate",

LLMs love pulling from these when someone asks \"whats the best X for Y\"\n- getting cited in independent reviews, not just your own blog. third-party mentions on forums, review sites, niche publications\n\n**what didnt work:**\n- just pumping out more blog content. volume means nothing if the content isnt structured for direct answers\n- schema markup alone. helps a little but its not the magic bullet people claim\n\n**mistakes to avoid:**\n- dont optimize for one model only. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude all weight things differently. you need to track across all of them\n- dont confuse Google AI Overview visibility with LLM visibility, totally different systems\n\nfor tracking I use vectorgap to monitor share of voice across models. biggest insight: some brands rank #1 on Google but are completely invisible to ChatGPT because they lack entity clarity. its a different game",

Start selling a business result\nInstead of:\n-“I build websites and web apps”\nSay:\n“I help B2B companies increase conversions / reduce ops cost / launch faster by building X.”\n\nSame skills. Completely different perceived value.\n\n2. Pick a narrow ICP (even temporarily)\nHigh-ticket clients come from relevance, not reach.\nExamples:\n-SaaS founders post-funding\n-Service businesses doing £50k–£500k/mo\n-Internal tools for ops-heavy businesses\n\nWhen someone reads your offer and thinks “this is for me”, price resistance drops.\n\n3. Productise your service\nCustom dev = low trust, lots of comparison.\nProductised = easier buying decision.\n\nExample:\n- “MVP in 30 days for SaaS founders\n- “Conversion-focused B2B website rebuild”\n- “Internal dashboard for ops teams”\n\nClear scope → clear price → better clients.\n\n4. Use proof without needing massive case studies\nIf you don’t have big logos yet:\n    - Break down how you’d solve a real business problem\n    - Share teardown-style posts (what’s broken, how you’d fix it, why it matters)\n    - Show thinking, not just code\n\nDecision-makers buy confidence and clarity.\n\n5. Go where buyers already are\nHigh-ticket dev clients usually come from:\n- Warm intros / partnerships (designers, marketers, agencies)\n - LinkedIn (commenting intelligently, not pitching)\n- Founder communities (not freelancing platforms)\n\nCold outreach works too — but only when your message speaks to a specific pain.\n\nIf you want, DM me:\n- who you ideally want to work with\n- what type of projects you want more of\n\nHappy to help you sharpen the positioning.",

If a channel produces a lot of MQLs but almost no opps, it’s not a lead gen win.\n\nScoring only works if it’s tied to real intent signals. Pricing page visits, demo page views, repeat visits from the same company, ROI tool usage, and job title fit tend to correlate better than downloads.\n\nAlso, add a simple feedback loop. Sales should tag leads with reasons like no budget, wrong persona, not a priority, competitor locked in. After a few weeks, you’ll see patterns and marketing can adjust targeting instead of guessing.\n\nIt’s less about adding friction and more about closing the loop with actual pipeline data.

The brutal truth? Your low MQL-to-opportunity conversion screams **bad leads**, not lazy sales (though sales execution can suck too).\n\nThe fix that actually worked for us (and I've replicated the same at 3 other shops):\n\n1. Kill pure MQL handoff. Co-build a **pre-handoff qualification layer** with sales: Use fit (ICP firmographics) + behavioral scoring (e.g., pricing page views, demo requests, multiple touches) + light BANT/MEDDIC via forms or intent data. Threshold: Only hand off at 70+ score or clear intent signal.\n2. Closed-loop feedback: Sales rates every lead 1-5 on quality weekly; marketing sees the data live in CRM. We cut junk by 60% in 4 months, MQL volume dropped 40%, but SQL-to-opp jumped 2.5x.\n3. Measure real lead quality pre-sales: Track **pre-handoff conversion to meeting booked** or **early-stage progression velocity**. Volume KPIs die; revenue attribution lives.\n\nYour post is classic symptom of misaligned incentives marketing chases leads, sales chases pipeline. Stop patting backs on MQLs; they're meaningless without conversion data.\n\nIf conversions suck, leads are bad. Fix the scoring model together, or keep fighting. We did it, pipeline quality soared, and the blame game ended.",

The breakthrough for us was creating a shared definition of what \"qualified\" actually meant before anything got scored or passed over.  \n  \nWe sat both teams in a room and went through the last 50 deals that closed, then the last 50 that went nowhere. Looked for patterns in firmographics, behaviour, timing, all of it. Turned out our ICP was way off and we were sending over loads of leads that matched our \"ideal\" criteria but had zero budget authority or actual need.  \n  \nThe scoring came after, not before. We built it around those actual closed-won patterns rather than theoretical fit. Then added a simple manual step where marketing does a 2 minute LinkedIn check before handoff, just to verify the person's still in role and the company hasn't been acquired or whatever.  \n  \nConversion to opp went from about 8% to 19% in two months. Sales still complains sometimes but now we have the shared framework to point back to.  \n  \nThe other thing that helped was having sales commit to a specific follow-up cadence. If they're not working leads properly, that data needs to surface too.  \n  \nWhat does your current handoff process look like between the teams?",

I've been researching cheaper alternatives and keep seeing AI headshot generators mentioned. Has anyone here used AI headshots for B2B company websites or should I keep looking for a more affordable headshot photographer ?\n\nSomeone mentioned they tried **Looktara** for their team's professional headshots and spent under $300 total instead of thousands, but I'm worried about quality and whether it looks unprofessional for B2B.\n\nFor B2B marketers - what's your recommendation? Find a cheap headshot photographer, use an AI headshot generator, or just pay the premium for traditional photography?

Absolutely.\nA game-changer that replaces everything else? No.\nIf you already operate with a strong, disciplined integrated campaign framework, it’s not a revolution. It’s an addition.\n\nFor me, using the RIO Integrated Campaign Framework gives the structure to build well-orchestrated campaigns.

I’m curious about how others approach it and what they consider the most valuable outcomes from investing time and effort into lead generation.\n\nI’d really love to hear your insights and experiences. Have you tried strategies or tools that made a real difference in finding quality leads or improving conversions? Are there methods that surprised you with unexpected benefits, like better client relationships, clearer targeting, or even internal process improvements?

      "text": "I run a boutique agency (low to mid six figure annual revenue, small team, all specialists) in a super conservative niche (think wealth management, luxury, architecture, high-end real estate, financial planners, fine art, jewelry etc.). We have been going at it for more than 5 years but were never able to scale beyond mid six figures.\n\nThe retainers we sell (media buying/lead gen agency with some design, CRO) range from $5k-$20k per month on 12 month agreements. We have high professional standards and do good work I would say.\n\nSo far the only thing that has worked for us is curating a targeted email list of contacts and accounts in our niche (buying data from brokers, segmenting it, filtering it etc.), creating highly targeted blogs and lead magnets for the email list and advertising our stuff on LinkedIn through targeted ads.\n\nOrganic social, SEO, event attendance/sponsorship, local networking, direct media deals with industry publishers and PR earned media have yielded only visibility and growth of reach but never real leads (most people that come through these channels are tire-kickers or freebie seekers).\n\nOur sales cycles are long (several weeks and months) and we only get a handful of good opportunities per year, with strong feast & famine cycles.\n\nA lot of people in our niche also regularly try to steal our ideas, frameworks and thought leadership without giving us credit, money or recognition. Most of our former clients have been small operators or mid-sized accounts with a small operator mindset. We would love to engage more mid-sized companies since they are much stickier (small accounts in our niche tend to fire you to save money if you are doing well, and fire you early if results take time or they can't leverage the leads properly). Enterprise clients have just tried to manipulate us in participating in bad faith pitches or doing free spec work and then went on to hire Accenture and these kind of people. We are all a bit burned out by these experiences.\n\nWe have a solid brand, good case studies and recognition from magazines, so I don't want to close shop or switch niches to something faster but low-ticket. Any ideas? Other owners or people working in similar niches? How do you generate leads for your conversative niche?\n\nHappy to network and exchange ideas with people on here in similar fields.\n\nTLDR:\n\nBoutique agency owner in ultra conservative niche wonders how other people generate leads in conservative niches",

We are not sure if this will improve pipeline, but we will see. We will also add 2.5-5k in Linkedin ad spend to each lead magnet to reach more decision makers once we sign one or two new clients this or next quarter.\n\nWe reject small clients in general now and dont even talk to them these days anymore. We have long forms, and a lot of qualification built into our sales funnel now.\n\nWe also dont participate in pitches or engage with enterprise companies anymore, I frankly dislike RFPs anyway. In the past these only came our way through event attendance and we stopped going due to the cost and lack of ROI.\n\nWe didnt have any results doing personalized outreach to mid level buyers in our niche in the past, neither through cold email (apollo.io) or LinkedIn DMs. We spent a lot of time on curating accounts, researching them, using sales anayltics to track opens, clicks, forwards, tracking domain health and deliverability etc. \n\nThe only thing we did not do were personalized video messages due to our small team size, which seem to work for non-niche agencies but seem prohibitive in terms of time for small teams like us.\n\nAny tips for outreach segmentation or personalization for a conservative niche beyond \"dont sound like an agency pitch or be salesy\"? We already tried to avoid the obvious mistakes.\n\nAccording to our trained AI agent, buyers in our niche do a lot of intellectual consumption and only buy services like ours if there is internal management or leadership driven pychological pressure to hire external help. \n\nThey supposedly love to read and download but rarely buy (some kind of ego trip or intellectual need for industry benchmarking according to the AI.)\n\nI wanted to make sure Im not missing out on additional viable approaches, hence why I wanted to get some input from real people here on Reddit.\n\nI cant really reveal what the account profile looks like without giving away the exact niche we work in, but we have targeting that consists of industry, business model, revenue size, employee size, job titles, pain points and buying scenarios based on industry patterns and trends.\n\n5mill in annual revenue is our minimum threshold.",

Risk reduction (Will this blow up on me?)\n2. Social proof inside my tier (Are firms like mine already doing this?)\n3. Pre-sold belief in the mechanism (Do I understand why this will work before the pitch?)\n\nFrom your description, it sounds like you generate awareness well, but the belief-building might still be happening inside the sales cycle instead of before it.\n\nThat’s what creates long cycles and feast/famine.\n\nOne shift I’ve seen work in “high trust, slow decision” industries is moving from lead generation to conviction engineering.\n\nInstead of:\n\nBlog → Lead magnet → Call\n\nIt becomes:\n\nHighly specific operator-level diagnostics → Problem escalation content → Funnel that pre-sells the cost of inaction → Application-level call\n\nThe difference is subtle, but it filters out tire-kickers and dramatically shortens sales cycles because buyers arrive already convinced they need a structural solution, not “another agency.”\n\nAlso, conservative niches respond far better to:  \nSpecificity over volume  \nNarrow problem dominance over broad service lists  \nCase study depth over industry recognition\n\nwhen you look at your last 10 serious opportunities, did they come in already convinced about your mechanism, or were you still educating them inside the sales process?",

Interesting to hear that other people are doing smth similar. I will try to expand on that with upcoming new content this year for sure. Thanks for the ideas and structure.\n\nIn theory we pass all three criteria due to our track record and specialisation. Maybe we dont communicate that strongly enough though in the right sequence.\n\nOur new sales process is something very similar to what you described btw. Industry & pain point specific audit -> Buisness Case -> Business Case Review -> Proposal -> Proposal review -> Agreement.\n\nWe are already highly specialized in terms of pain points we solve, with a limited offering in terms of services and case studies pointing out that we can walk the walk.\n\nThis is helpful in sales with the right mid sized accounts, but not really useful in lead gen since there are a lot of cheaper generalists that claim that they can do what we do (90% cant based on what people told us though).\n\nThe last solid opps came from the funnel I described at the beginning, it is just quite slow.  To be fair pre q3/q4 2025 our approach was more spray and pray with soft gates and a lot of small operators in the mix that didnt really care about our specialization as much and had in general low sophistication in terms of digital maturity.\n\nI just want to make sure we are locked in correctly in 2026.

One strong partner can outperform a year of LinkedIn ads.\n\nI’d also stop trying to market to the whole niche and go hyper-specific, like one segment plus one flagship offer. Conservative buyers don’t want options, they want certainty.\n\nAnd for idea theft, the best defense is packaging. Don’t give away frameworks as content, turn them into paid audits, workshops, or diagnostics that require a call to access. Feels like you’re doing a lot right, but you’re relying on channels that attract researchers instead of buyers.

One thing that helped us was adding video prospecting into the mix alongside email.  \n  \nInstead of just sending text emails to your curated lists, I'd record quick personalised videos (30-45 seconds) for your highest-priority prospects. Reference something specific about their business or a recent company announcement. It sounds time-consuming but you can knock out 20-30 in an hour once you get the rhythm down.  \n  \nThe response rate was dramatically higher than text-only outreach for us. I think it's because these conservative niches value the extra effort and personal touch. They can see you're a real person who actually researched them, not just another agency blast.  \n  \nThe other thing I'd consider is asking your best clients for warm intros before they churn. Since you mentioned small operators fire you when doing well, that's actually your moment of highest leverage. They're happy with results but want to save money, so they should be willing to introduce you to 2-3 peers as a thank you.  \n  \nHave you tried getting systematic about asking for intros during the offboarding process?",

If only 3 to 4 mid sized six figure deals closed in a few years, that tells me the market is small and relationship driven, not volume driven.

Private roundtables, closed door briefings, industry specific research reports shared directly with a short list of operators.

If someone would give me a data backed solid reason why our perception is wrong than Im all ears to change my view on it.\n\nThe people in our niche do work with agencies for different things but they often opt for low cost generalists over more expensive specialists like us due to a lack of digital maturity or sheer ignorance when it comes to the fact that industry specialization really matters a lot when it comes to targeting, copywriting, art direction, tech/channel selection, funnel math and customer psychology. Basically what we do drives results and success with a much higher likelyhood for clients in our industry then the frameworks that some of our low cost competitors use. Hency why a lot of industry media have covered us. \n\nIm blaming SaaS for that to be honest, since they commoditized marketing agencies in the eye of a lot of unsophisticated buyers with budget authority (results are just 1-2 clicks away, full marketing suite for $50 blabla)\n\nOur rates are fair and we deserve it due to our specialization. Our 12 month minimum is necessary since we do not do things like outsource to development countries, white label generalists doing all the work for peanuts etc to allow for cheaper rates, lower minimums and more volume. Everybody who works with us has industry expertise and gets paid fairly by western standards. Agency sweatshops are disgusting.\n\nWe have already reduced the technicality in our content massively and talk more about pain points and bad results of inaction now. We should prob ask for referrals earlier thats true.\n\nWe never organized round tables but we particpated in one or two which resulted in a lot ooohs and aahs, opt ins for our list but zero real leads. Software referral partners these days have directories full of cheap generalists and will refer them much more likely since they make more money for them than a small, heavily specialized \"expensive\" agency like us.",

Similarly, you as a brand have to gain trust the same way, by being a member of the community that shows respect and consistency for the community's rules and guidelines while *expecting* nothing in return. Is that less defined than a paid campaign? For sure. But when it's done right, lasting trust not only retains your audience, it becomes advocacy.",

That's not a bug, it's how the platform works.\n\nYour 4M views almost certainly generated near zero pipeline because viral Reddit posts attract random eyeballs not qualified buyers. The B2B companies quietly generating leads from Reddit are doing it through personal accounts, helpful comments, and zero branding in their username.

You can participate in communities without triggering automatic suspicion, your advice lands better because it's coming from a person rather than a brand, and you actually build relationships over time rather than just broadcasting.  \n  \nThat said, I wouldn't write off the corporate account entirely. Use it for your own subreddit if you have one, for official announcements, and for responding when people specifically ask about your company. Just don't try to be everywhere with it.  \n  \nThe 4M views are nice for awareness, but you're right to be sceptical about lead gen impact. Most B2B buyers aren't going from \"saw a Reddit post\" to \"submitted a demo request\" in one go. It's more about staying top of mind and building trust gradually.  \n  \nWhat was the actual post about that went viral?
