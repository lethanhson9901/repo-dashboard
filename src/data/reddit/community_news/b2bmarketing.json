The strongest teams are very intentional about where human effort goes. They don’t try to deeply analyze everything. They use systems to handle the background work and save their thinking time for positioning, messaging, and decisions that actually move the needle.\n\nOn a lot of accounts, the messy part isn’t creativity, it’s the in-between work. Research, list cleanup, checking whether accounts are still relevant, keeping data in sync. When that layer is handled cleanly, clients are able to spend more time on strategy instead of maintenance. I’ve seen teams use tools like Clay for research and signals, HubSpot as the source of truth, and Notion to keep plans visible. The exact stack varies, but the mindset stays the same.\n\nThe pattern that keeps showing up is this: the better the focus, the less the team feels the need to overbuild process. They automate the boring parts, stay thoughtful about the rest, and move faster without feeling rushed.",

The teams that seem to have their act together aren't doing more, they're doing less but with way more intention.  \n  \nOne thing that helped us was splitting work into \"decide once\" and \"decide often\" buckets. Decide once means automating it or documenting the process so tightly that nobody has to think about it again. List hygiene, signal tracking, basic qualification criteria, that stuff shouldn't need a meeting every week.  \n  \nThe decide often bucket is where the actual brain power goes. Messaging angles, which accounts to prioritise this quarter, what content to create. That's where the differentiation happens.  \n  \nWe used to spend hours manually researching accounts and prepping outreach. Now we've automated most of the research layer, which frees up time to actually personalise the message in a way that matters. The hard part was trusting the system enough to let go of the manual checks.  \n  \nWhat's been the biggest time sink for your clients before they get this sorted?",

This is not a channel problem yet. If Google ads brought junk traffic and LinkedIn feels easier, the real issue is probably messaging and ICP clarity, not the platform. Paid just amplifies what already works.\n2. Thought leader ads = learning, not pipeline. With $1.5k over a week, expect signals, not demos. You are testing awareness and message resonance, not demand. Judge success by comments, profile visits, and DMs, not conversions.\n3. Ads only work after messaging is proven. The best LinkedIn ads come from posts and DMs that already get replies organically. If you have not validated that yet, ads will feel random.\n4. This is where fractional makes sense. You are too early to hire a paid ads specialist, but too far along to guess. A fractional growth setup focuses on ICP, messaging, organic validation, then turns on paid as a multiplier, not a gamble. That is exactly how I work with bootstrapped B2B SaaS teams.\n\nIf you want a quick sanity check, share your ICP and deal size and I can tell you if this test is worth running or better paused.",

Document ads are great on LinkedIn, but you really need to know who your customer is by title and industry. The document also needs to be compelling for the user to want to download. For Google ads, you need to give the system a lot of information, for example, are your conversion pixels setup properly? Are you passing information for offline conversions back to Google? You can get help with setting this up via AI. Claude is a great option and can walk you through it. Google needs to have about 7-14 days to learn, so if you are strapped for cash, try running one campaign at $40/day. Be very tight with your keywords and don't touch the system for at least a couple of days. You can check out the search terms report and block irrelevant searches.

Remember, pipeline is irrelevant if you're really doing it for awareness - which may sound nice but remember in the end someone will be asking where is the revenue right quick so be ready for awareness vs. pipeline chat.\n2. Immediately turn off any Week 1 ads with some decent impression count compared to the rest, but are below 1% CTR\n3. Keep in mind depending on your spend, timing (weekends turned off or on? That's another thread entirely) geo targeting, titles, etc, even your best ads will fatigue within 10 days or so. You'll start to notice because last week's CTR winner is this week's not so much, especially when impressions per unique tap out at 5+. The catch 22 is the best clicked ads get shown more by the algorithm until people see them 3+ more repeated times and they ignore.\n4. You may be able to turn the best ones back on a few weeks later - or of course with a different targeting set - but know they will decay.\n5. Yes as stated before definitely turn OFF audience expansion no matter what pablum messaging is in the interface encouraging you to do so.\n6. I assume this Phillipines thing is sending you targeting emails that you are uploading as Audiences in Linkedin for specific targeting?\n7. The titles field is powerful for segmentation - know your vertical and understand if Managers have budget or does it start with Director and above.\n8. Again, if it's awareness, any broad targeted clicks by whatever title may work but be ready to push back when asked about ROI and \"where is the Pipeline from all this  spend?\" And in the end it always comes down to it so I'd put the awareness spend at no more than 20% effort.\n9. North star is CTR above 3% - and keep in mid it's all about the visuals as you want people to stop scrolling, especially on their phones.\n10. That said, white papers are great for thought leadership and positioning but depending on your vertical, they attract researchers, students, interns, data analysts, who are all great people but likely don't have huge budget or need to buy your full product, or the internal pull to make it happen. Again, awareness vs. ROI. Case studies work.\n11. And the same whitepaper can be positioned differently for those budget-conscious personas to get their attention.\n12. Pro tip: Mention  \"career,\" \"job,\", \"Your team\", \"falling behind\", \"becoming irrelevant,\" \"getting ahead,\" \"stay updated,\" etc because in the end it's a career preservation social platform. Good luck and keep us posted.\n\n(Edited for numbering)",

What makes sense is that he will need less validation and more likely to get to the next step faster whether to book a call or to subscribe. \n\nBased on my experience with an AI b2b startup, companies like these needs to deploy itself somewhere and build a strong presence utilizing content and communication with its target audience to get a better chance communicating with the same audience else where …. So choosing LinkedIn could be a better solution at your stage for sure. \n\nBut you won’t be able to get ROI from sales focused ads right now, what you need to focus on is choosing a specific segment of audience (an industry or a specific job title) and start boosting content that delivers your message to them, raise their awareness about your existence and raise the brand recognition. This is called top of the funnel (TOFU) \n\nAfterwards, you can create sales ads for this segment, but when you do you will be sure that you have built your presence and that your target audience are recognizing you, so you get a better chance in communication with them (middle of the funnel), and then you close them through sales efforts. \n\nI hope my comment was helpful, and if you need any further information from me or have any questions feel free to message me directly.",

What actually worked for me was turning LinkedIn into a daily system.\n\nHere’s what I do:\n\n\\- Prospect List: Build a list of 50 to 150 ideal customer profile accounts.\n\n\\- Mini Feed: Focus only on posts from that list.\n\n\\- Real Comments: Leave 10 to 20 comments daily, adding insights or questions.\n\n\\- Warm Connections:  Send requests only after a few touchpoints.\n\n\\- Contextual DMs:  Keep them short, specific, and relevant.\n\n\\- Follow Ups: Track replies and follow ups daily.\n\nTo keep a targeted feed of prospects and draft comments, personlized DM, Follwoup reminders I use Depost AI. It also helps me track follow ups so I don't miss anyone.",

If you overdo it people will catch on and downvote you into oblivion, but guess what, since Google loves displaying reddit in the SERP, it's a no brainer to own BOFU keywords with reddit convos.\n\nThe more advanced/long term play is to start a reddit community that you moderate, either around the problem space or your solution itself, but this is very niche dependent - it mostly works for broad user-base PLG companies.",

That's it. Everything else is fluff. Our clients doing B2B sales see way better conversion when their one-pagers focus on a single use case instead of trying to be a complete company overview.\n\nIf you're struggling to fit everything, you're probably trying to make one one-pager do too much work. Create different versions for different buyer personas or use cases. A CFO cares about cost savings, a VP Ops cares about efficiency, so make separate one-pagers targeting each with relevant messaging and proof points.\n\nReal talk, if your company is bugging you for more one-pagers but can't tell you who they're for or what problem they solve, that's the actual issue.

As a B2B copywriter, I feel your pain at having to fit it all into a small space! \n\nIt may help you to prioritize the information in this order: Value Proposition, Benefits, Features. So your header and subhead promise a big outcome your ICP really wants. Your subheads throughout the piece promise more specific benefits. And then the paragraphs under those subheads prove you can deliver those benefits by mentioning the specific features that will give the ICP superpowers. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that each one-pager is just one step in the marketing cycle. Has anyone ever made a B2B purchase based solely on a one-pager? Probably not. So, decide what's the next action you want the ICP to take after reading the one-pager (book a demo, visit your website, call Sales). Then you'll be free to write the one-pager with the goal of getting them to take just that action, rather than feeling like you have to convince them to purchase right now.",

Then boom - overnight my CAC went from $38 to $142. I literally threw up in my mouth a little.\n\n**The \"Oh Shit\" Moment**\n\nI had 6 weeks of runway left\n\nTurned off all ads. Pipeline dropped 89% overnight.\n\nBut then I remembered this random ass comment from a Reddit thread about some guy who scaled to $2M ARR entirely on cold email. Figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nStarted with 3 mailboxes and zero idea what I was doing.\n\n12 weeks later: $107K in closed revenue from cold email alone.\n\nHere's exactly what I did.\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\nI started with 3 domains.\n\nThe math: 3 mailboxes × 33 emails per day = 100 emails/day to start.\n\nNot sexy. Not scalable yet. But it worked\n\nBy week 2, I was at 300 emails/day. Inbox rate? 73%. Not amazing, but not in the spam dungeon either.\n\nThe setup:\n\n* Bought aged domains (6+ months old) from expired domain marketplaces\n* Set up proper DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n* Warmed with Instantly's built-in warmup for 14 days before sending a single cold email\n\n**Week 3-4: The Lead Scraping System That Actually Works**\n\nHere's where I got weird.\n\nEveryone's out here buying Apollo lists and wondering why their emails sound like everyone else's. I said fuck that.\n\nI built custom software (okay fine, I paid a developer on Upwork $800, but I PROJECT MANAGED IT so basically I built it).\n\nThe scraper:\n\n* Pulls company websites from my ICP search\n* Scrapes their actual website copy, tech stack, recent blog posts\n* Hits LinkedIn to grab decision-maker info\n* Feeds it all into a prompt that writes personalized first lines\n\nPeople open emails that feel like you actually visited their website. Wild concept, I know.\n\n**Week 5-8: Scaling to 1,500 Emails/Day Without Losing My Mind**\n\nThis is where it got real.\n\nFrom 300 emails/day to 1,500/day.\n\nThe math: 1,500 emails/day × 21 working days = 31,500 emails per month.\n\nAt a 3% reply rate (industry average is 1%, but personalization is magic), that's 945 replies.\n\nAt a 15% meeting booking rate from replies, that's 141 meetings.\n\nAt a 25% close rate... you see where this is going.\n\nMy CAC went from $142 on Meta to $47 with cold email. And it kept dropping as I optimized.\n\nI shut down Meta ads entirely. Haven't looked back.\n\nNow I run a cold outreach agency helping other B2B companies do the same thing. Turns out when you figure out how to print money, people want to pay you to teach them.\n\n**The Shit No One Tells You**\n\n* Week 1 was fucking BRUTAL. 6% inbox rate because I didn't warm properly\n* I got my first domain blacklisted on day 4\n* Gmail's spam filters updated in week 5 and tanked my inbox rate overnight. Had to pivot my entire sending strategy\n\nAnyone wants my templates/sequences/scraper setup, drop a comment.\n\nI'll put everything together in a Google Doc (might take me a few days, I need to clean up my shamefully disorganized Notion workspace first).\n\nNo courses, no coaching, no bullshit. Just paying it forward because this sub saved my ass multiple times.",

To add a real example from our work how email has helped:\n\nOne MSP we partnered with struggled to consistently generate **qualified leads**. Most prospects were outside their ideal client profile, and even with a strong sales team, poor lead quality and lack of ongoing engagement made it hard to close deals. Traditional channels like events, ads, and referrals were expensive and delivered inconsistent, hard-to-measure results.\n\nAfter shifting to a targeted email-led outreach strategy, we built a predictable pipeline. The MSP now receives **3–4 high-quality leads per month**, achieved **\\~$10K in new MRR directly from booked appointments**, and has a **repeatable, scalable system** for ongoing lead generation and deal closures, without relying on paid ads.",

Used those videos in cold outreach sequences.  \n  \nResponse rates jumped significantly compared to text-only emails. People are so used to automated text that a face in their inbox actually stands out.  \n  \nOne thing I'm curious about though - at 1,500 emails/day, how are you handling the reply volume?

Pick one ICP slice and one use case Most teams at this stage are still too broad. “Mid-market B2B” is not a strategy.\n2. Prove messaging before scaling channels Paid, content, and outbound all fail when messaging is fuzzy.\n3. Use outbound as a learning engine, not just a sales engine\n4. Content should support sales, not wait for SEO\n5. Stop running channels in silos The biggest waste I see is teams treating paid, content, outbound, and LinkedIn as separate things. What works is one clear message, reused everywhere:\n\n* Outbound tests it\n* LinkedIn amplifies it\n* Paid scales it\n* Content supports it\n\nThat is how you move faster with fewer resources.\n\nThis is also why many teams at this stage move to a fractional model instead of hiring specialists or agencies. One owner across channels usually beats three disconnected tactics.",

The look and feel of your website and brand design is so important.\n2. Organic social content: Again undervalued, but important to keep somewhat consistent.\n3. Paid ads (the key): Easy to understand messaging that solves your customer problem paired with **great** video, motion and graphic content is a winning formula. This takes some experimenting with various messages, method of delivery and channels. From experience, targeting particular roles within an org through video ads - motion and short testimonials has been most successful.\n\nHaving someone within your company in control of brand & content strategy, supported by a content creation agency may be your best best for scaling.",

Your own network \n\nIf I was in your shoes I would hyper focus on people in your network already. Go into LinkedIn to start sending messages to your 1st degree connections and text people that you know about your offer. This is your low hanging fruit which I always look to focus on first. Also, you don't have to sell all these people...go to people in your network that are willing to do a referral for you because that would be the way to stand out. Then once you start getting results with those people, amp up your cold emailing with the proof from those people. I would suggest doing LinkedIn messaging since you already know email works well. LI messages is just punchy copy.\n\n  \nHope this helps.",

Email inboxes are so crowded now that even good emails get buried.  \n  \nA few things that worked for us beyond the standard Apollo/LinkedIn scraping:  \n  \nCold calling still converts surprisingly well if you've got a good hook. People aren't expecting it anymore, so if you're helpful rather than pushy, you can actually have real conversations.  \n  \nVideo messages on LinkedIn have been huge for us. Recording a quick 30-second personalised video referencing something specific about their company (recent post, job opening, company news) gets way higher response rates than text. We've seen it jump from around 3% with text to 18-20% with video.  \n  \nAlso, engaging with prospects' content before reaching out makes a massive difference. Comment on their LinkedIn posts genuinely for a week or two, then send your outreach. They recognise your name and you're not just another cold message.  \n  \nThe biggest shift for me was focusing on quality over quantity. 50 highly researched, perfectly timed outreaches beat 500 spray-and-pray messages every time.  \n  \nWhat type of clients are you planning to target with your service?",

When it’s the first touch and there’s zero context, it’s brutal now.\nWhat’s worked better for us:\nBe visible before you reach out.\nPosting useful stuff (not pitchy) on LinkedIn, commenting thoughtfully on other people’s posts, being active in communities like this one. When someone later gets an email from you, there’s at least some “oh, I’ve seen this name before.”\nProblem-first targeting instead of tool-first scraping.\nApollo/LinkedIn are fine, but lists perform way better when they’re built around a specific trigger (hiring, new funding, tech change, recent post, etc.). Fewer leads, much higher reply rates.\nWarm intros > cold volume.\nPast clients, ex-coworkers, partners, even “hey do you know anyone who…” messages. Not scalable on paper, but they compound fast when you’re early.\nSmall events / niche meetups.\nNot big conferences. Local or industry-specific stuff where you can actually talk to people. Those conversations turn into deals later even if nothing happens immediately.\nContent as trust, not demand gen.\nWe’ve seen more success when people understand how we think before sales ever comes up. By the time outreach happens, it doesn’t feel cold anymore.\nTL;DR: cold outreach isn’t dead, but using it as the first impression is. Lead gen works better when sales shows up after familiarity, not before.\nHope that helps, happy to answer follow-ups.",

Once your messaging is solidified and your foundation is set up, start testing paid channels (have a demand gen or paid consultant run an audit to determine where your audience exists and what your competitors are doing - and start running ads there if budget permits)  \n9.

      "text": "**This is gonna be completely helpful if you are an early stage founder doing everything by yourself.** \n\nI talk to a lot of founders who are trying to scale their ARR but get stuck in \"tool hell\"—buying random subscriptions without a cohesive system.\n\nOver the last few months, I’ve been refining a growth engine specifically for B2B SaaS. The goal was to maximize volume while keeping costs predictable. I wanted to share the current stack, the monthly burn, and the daily activity targets we hit.\n\nIf you are trying to build an internal growth team, feel free to steal this setup.\n\n# The Outbound Stack (Cold Outreach)\n\nThis is the heavy lifting. The goal here is direct contact with decision-makers.\n\n**Email Infrastructure** We run a hybrid setup to balance deliverability with volume.\n\n* **Data & enrichment:** Apollo io + Leadmagic\n* **Sending Infra:** Smartlead (for volume) + Lemlist (for high-touch/personalized sequences)\n* **Inbox Management:** Maildoso (essential for domain rotation)\n* **Verification:** Listkit\n* **Estimated Cost:** \\~$700 - $900/month depending on seat count.\n\n**LinkedIn Automation**\n\n* **Targeting:** Sales Navigator (Non-negotiable for B2B)\n* **Automation:** Expandi (Safe limits) + Waalaxy\n* **Daily Volume Target:** \\~40 Connection requests/day + 20 targeted DMs.\n\n**Twitter & Reddit (Guerrilla Outbound)** We use native web interfaces here to avoid API bans. It’s manual but effective.\n\n* **Twitter:** \\~100 DMs/day (requires warmed accounts).\n* **Reddit:** Up to \\~250 DMs/day (split across multiple accounts/niches).\n* **Cost:** $0 (Time-intensive).\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Inbound Stack (Content & Nurture)\n\nOutbound captures attention; Inbound builds trust so they actually reply. We aim for high-frequency \"sweat equity\" over paid ads.\n\n**Newsletter & Long-form**\n\n* **Tools:** Beehiiv (Newsletter) + Medium (SEO/Syndication)\n* **Cadence:** 3 emails/week. We treat the newsletter as a product, not just a notification channel.\n\n**Social Content Engine** This is where most founders burn out. The key is batching.\n\n* **LinkedIn:** 1 Post/day (Carousels work best here) + 5 strategic comments on big accounts (using Buffer).\n* **Instagram:** Meta Business Suite. Target: 6 Reels/day (repurposed short-form clips).\n* **Reddit:** 10 posts/day across 10 different relevant subreddits.\n* **Tools:** Canva (Visuals) + Buffer (Scheduling).\n* **Cost:** Mostly $0 for software, high cost in labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Summary\n\n* **Total Monthly Tech Cost:** \\~$1,000 - $1,200 (varies by seat count)\n* **Total Daily Touchpoints:** 500+ across all channels.\n\n**My takeaway:** The tools are the easy part. The hard part is the consistency. Sending 100 emails is easy; sending emails every day for 90 days while managing replies, fixing broken domains, and producing 6 reels a day is where the scaling actually happens.\n\nI’m currently running this full engine for a few SaaS partners. It’s a beast to manage, but the pipeline looks healthy.\n\n**Question for the group:** For those scaling past $10k MRR, are you finding better ROI on high-volume email or high-effort LinkedIn content right now? I'm seeing a shift back to LinkedIn lately.\n\n",

The difference was adding a 20-second personalised video to each LinkedIn DM and top-tier email prospect. It's more labour-intensive, but our reply rate went from about 4% to 18%.  \n  \nThe video doesn't need to be fancy. Just screen record their website or LinkedIn profile and talk through one specific observation about their business. Takes maybe 2 minutes per prospect once you get the rhythm down.  \n  \nI think the real unlock isn't more touchpoints, it's making each one feel less like spam. Especially on LinkedIn where everyone's running the same Expandi sequences now.  \n  \nWhat's your current reply rate across channels with this setup?",

      "text": "Ran outbound for 50+ B2B clients, shipped hundreds of thousands of emails, tested stuff every month like unhinged lab rats. Most advice online is either outdated or written by people who sent 3 campaigns and declared themselves gurus. So here’s the short list of what really worked.\n\n**1/spray & pray is dead. Like fax machines dead**\n\nIf you’re still blasting ‘20–500 employees’ and calling it targeting, congrats, you’re just burning enrichment credits faster, but once you know why this company is interesting, the copy basically writes itself.\n\n**2/your first email does all the work, the rest are emotional support**\n\nEmail #1 gets the replies\n\nEmail #2 sometimes\n\nEmail #3 is already on thin ice\n\nEmail #4+ is just you refusing to let go\n\nInstead of adding follow-ups like it’s a breakup text, rework the offer and relaunch the sequence in 2 months. They won’t remember you, cuz you’re not that special (sorry).\n\n**3/stop running 7–9 step sequences, nobody wants that**\n\nOur best campaigns are 3-4 emails max:\n\na/clear pitch\n\nb/context / why you\n\nc/frictionless CTA (’want a quick audit?’ / ‘want the resource?’)\n\nAfter that - pause, rethink, fix the offer.\n\n**4/inbox volume matters more than your clever copy**\n\nWe cap at 40-50 emails per inbox per day, never more, if replies <1%, something’s broken (usually deliverability)\n\nDon’t waste time playing seed-list bingo, just rotate domains and rewrite the copy.\n\n**5/timing > leads being ‘used once’**\n\nPeople treat TAM lists like one-shot Pokemon cards.\n\nReality: timing changes, budgets change, fires appear.\n\nWe recycle TAM every 6 month with new angles. A ‘no’ six months ago is often just ‘not right now’ moment\n\n**6/test offers, not button colors**\n\nEveryone A/B tests subject lines like it’s 2016.\n\nWe test what we’re offering like:\n\n\\-save time vs make money\n\n\\-case study first vs pain first\n\n\\-which persona responds to which angle\n\nThat’s where real lifts come from.\n\n! One extra tip - **less poetry, more receipts**\n\nAnalogies rarely land, real signals do (hiring pages, tech stack changes, Series A, Intercom rollout, recent posts)\n\nCall out something they actually care about and you sound human without trying too hard.",

We had a segment that went completely cold in Q1, then ran them again in Q3 with a different hook (focused on a new pain point their industry was facing) and got 4x the response rate.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add to your timing point is video seems to cut through better when you're hitting people the second or third time round. First touch they ignored the text email, but a 30-second personalised video referencing something specific about their company gets attention. It's harder to ignore a face talking directly to you than another wall of text.  \n  \nThe offer testing bit is spot on. We wasted weeks testing subject lines that moved the needle maybe 1-2%, then tested \"free audit\" vs \"here's what we found about your site\" and replies jumped 18%.  \n  \nWhen you're recycling your TAM every 6 months, are you changing up the channel at all or staying purely email?",

We work with financial service firms, marketing companies, recruitment firms, manufacturing firms, saas companies, 3pl (transportation firms) etc.\n\n**Cold email is not easy but I will give some insights.**\n\n1. Dont send any links at all in the first email. People say this but they dont know the reason behind. Blacklist providers like Spamhouse ZEN and Braccuda actually look at the spam reports and a link is associated with spam - even if you are not spamming. \n2. Leads currently we target are smtp and google. Sometimes we blend office 365. If you buy an old domain and do an office 365 setup and have a non sales script you can actually get 1-2% reply rates. We have done a lot of testing and if anyone has any questions regarding office 365 deliverability I am happy to answer.\n3. Include and test with gmail leads. These are 50-50 sometimes good sometimes bad. They are not approached as much as Google Apollo leads. This works well especially if you are targeting small local businesses and when you have a narrow tam.\n4. Have a diversified setup. Never rely fully on google or outlook always balance out. Always have a 60-40 or 50-50 split. Deliverability is fragile sometimes outlook is good and sometimes google make sure you balance it out.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions.",

Our clients in consulting see the best results when they lead outreach with specific client wins like \"helped X company reduce costs by 40%\" versus talking about their methodology. Nobody cares about your process until they trust you can deliver results. Also founder-led sales matters way more for services because buyers want to meet the actual people doing the work, not just a sales rep.\n\nWhat works best is targeted cold outreach to companies showing signals they need your help, content that demonstrates deep expertise in your niche, and partnership referrals with complementary firms. LinkedIn presence helps but it's slow. Cold email to decision-makers with personalized insights about their business converts way better when done properly. The key is positioning as an expert who understands their specific challenges, not a vendor selling generic consulting hours.",

Our clients doing real volume see similar numbers and still generate solid pipeline because they're sending to qualified lists, not random blasts.\n\n\"Show up where your audience talks\" means actually participating in communities without pitching. Like if you sell to e-commerce brands, join their Facebook groups, answer questions on Reddit, comment on relevant LinkedIn posts. Build credibility first, then people DM you asking what you do. It's slower but the leads are way warmer than cold outreach.\n\nFor finding people ready to buy, track intent signals. Companies hiring for roles your product supports, recent funding announcements, tech stack changes, competitor review sites showing frustration. These indicate actual pain happening now versus \"might need this someday.\" Use Sales Navigator job alerts or set up Google alerts for your target keywords plus funding/hiring news.\n\nYour workflow should be multi-touch. Email, LinkedIn connection, engage with their posts, email again in 5 days, call if you have their number. One touchpoint doesn't cut it anymore. Most deals take 7 to 12 touches before someone even responds, let alone buys. If you're giving up after one email, that's your problem right there.",

What is dying is trying to sell before there’s any context or trust.\nFor us, it’s worked much better when people already “know” us before sales ever shows up. That usually happens through organic content, community participation, or just being visible in the right places. By the time someone reaches out or replies, the conversation doesn’t feel cold anymore.\nIn-person events have also been surprisingly effective again, but not big flashy ones. Smaller meetups, dinners, or industry events where you can actually talk. They don’t always turn into leads right away, but they speed up trust a lot.\nI don’t see it as events vs digital. Digital still matters, but impressions alone don’t do much. What helps is repeated exposure to how you think, not what you sell.\nSales works best when it comes later, once interest already exists. Cold messages with no context still get ignored. Messages that land after someone’s seen your content or met you once feel completely different.",

Volume-based outbound feels completely dead unless there’s a real reason for you to exist in someone’s inbox that week.

When buyers realize you’re reacting to *current* conditions instead of running recycled plays, it immediately lowers skepticism. Even strong content gets ignored if it feels like it was written “for everyone.”\n\nAlso agree on interactive > static. Anything that answers “what will this realistically look like for *me*?” beats polished thought leadership right now.\n\nCurious if others are seeing the same drop-off once something feels even slightly templated.

Whats your thoughts on this?",

It was turning LinkedIn into a boring daily system instead of a place I randomly post and pray.\n\nHere’s the loop I run now that consistently books B2B calls:\n\n\\-   Start with a hand built prospect list (not the feed) 50–150 ICP accounts + people in each.\n\n\\-  Create a “mini feed” just for those people. Each day I only look at posts from that list.\n\n\\-   Warm them with 5–10 real comments per day.\n\n\\-   Send connection requests only once they’re warm.\n\n\\-   First DM = context + one easy question.\n\n\\-   Treat follow ups like a pipeline, not an afterthought.\n\nWhat was a waste of time: Mass cold DMs, InMails without prior interaction, Posting more content hoping “leads will come”.\n\nThe system above still takes \\~30–45 minutes a day, but it made results predictable. To keep a targeted feed of prospects and run this system, I use Depost AI. It helps me build targeted feeds, draft comments and DMs and tracks follow ups so I don't miss anyone.",

If your sales cycle is already 6-12 months, and you're investing in building this infrastructure now, you're realistically looking at 12-18+ months before you can clearly attribute pipeline to those efforts.\n\nHow are you justifying that investment when leadership is still pushing for near-term pipeline? Are you running it parallel to shorter-cycle tactics, or have you found ways to show leading indicators earlier (engagement quality, sales using content in cycles, etc.)?\n\nThe compounding value is real, but the \"trust us, this will pay off in 2027\" pitch is brutal when you need results in Q2.",

Sending decks and hoping for replies. What changed things for us was switching to short personalised videos (under 3 minutes) where we'd reference something specific about their use case or a signal we caught (like a recent compliance hire or a migration they mentioned publicly).  \n  \nThe reply rate jumped quite a bit because it felt human and showed we'd actually done the work to understand their situation. It also helped us stand out from the generic sequences everyone else was running.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add to your signal-based targeting point is combining LinkedIn activity with those intent signals. If someone from the target account is engaging with content around vendor migration or posting about fraud losses, that's when we'd send a video DM rather than just an email. It feels timelier and less intrusive.  \n  \nWhat's been your experience with timing on those signals? Do you wait for multiple triggers or jump on the first one?",
