Something concrete like a job change, a product launch, a pricing page update. When there’s an actual reason to reach out, the message feels natural without trying so hard.

You need polish but if it's unclear you're just hurting your intent. \n\nLately I've been dropping the final deck mindset. You've got to treat reports as source material and slice it into a one page exec summary, a few scannable visuals, and one or two charts people actually reuse in meetings. You can use visme to make this easier because you can adapt the same data into different formats without rebuilding everything. \n\nAlso context beats distribution. If a report arrives cold it will get ignored. A quick framing message or five minute walkthrough turns it from homework into a reference.",

So we became strategists and researchers (with a design department). \n\nAt first we designed great looking reports and had a website to rival the best design firms. that was a mistake. we dumbed down the brand design and deliverables and saw a marked improvement in credibility and the clients willingness to take our advice. \n\nFocus on being clear and concise.

          "text": "Don't expect them to read the whole report. \n\nThree ideas: \n\n1. First page should be a 1-page executive summary that is brutally edited. It answers most important questions succinctly. The reader should not read any other page to get the point. Get a professional communicator to edit the exec summary \\*\\*\\*who has no emotional care\\*\\*\\* for the report. This person should understand your intended audience. You won't like everything they do. But your work is more likely to be read. \n\n2. Assume all remaining pages will never be read, charts never looked at. They're there to give support to the exec summary. Like a foundation gives support to a house. We rarely look at our foundations in detail. Right? Doesn't make the work to build them less important. Instead, that work is literally foundational. Be proud of that.\n\n3. Make soundbites. Structure the report so it's easy for anyone \\*\\*\\*scanning\\*\\*\\* it (because they likely won't read)  to see and pull out soundbites to share. \n\nReal life story:\n\nI once wrote a 20-page white paper, back when white papers were The Thing. It was intended for my employer's executives and external audiences. A small group of die-hard enthusiasts read the whole paper. Nice, but that doesn't change the world. We also had graphics, photos, comparison images, soundbites, stories. Graphics were super simple and scannable. Think social media posts. Think TV interview. We had advertising jingle-type soundbites. Reporters used these in CNN articles. People added the graphics to presentations. \n\nI should note, the graphic that got shared the most was a grainy comparison photo. A really sh\\*tty graphic by our designers' standards. But it communicated the point of the whole paper the best. Blown up huge in a PPT presentation, it looked bad. But it was used the most by people who are excellent presentation communicators. Go figure.\n\nThis was 15+ years ago. I still see my words and graphics today when scrolling LinkedIn. All shared by others.\n\nCommunicate to them, the way they communicate to others.",

      "text": "\nOver the last year, one of the software development companies we worked with crossed five million dollars in marketing sourced pipeline. This was not driven by a single tactic. It was the result of a few channels compounding together, and a couple of expensive mistakes we won’t repeat.\n\n1. SEO was the foundation, but not in the way most teams approach it\n\nOrganic search was still the largest source of inbound. The key shift was moving away from broad “software development services” type pages and building a very granular site structure.\n\nWe created highly specific service pages for individual industries, narrow problem statements, and sub services. Instead of one generic page, we built dozens of pages targeting very specific commercial intent keywords. Traffic volume was not massive, but intent was consistently high.\n\nThis approach came out of patterns we see repeatedly in our work at XQL Group, especially with software development firms that sell complex, multi service engagements rather than a single SKU.\n\n2. Case studies were rebuilt completely\n\nPreviously, one project equaled one case study page. That approach left a lot of demand uncaptured.\n\nWe broke projects down by individual services delivered, such as discovery, product design, backend engineering, DevOps, and security. We also created separate case study pages for key integrations and technical decisions.\n\nIn practice, one project turned into multiple narrow case studies. Each mapped directly to a service page and a specific buying question. This had a noticeable impact on both organic visibility and lead quality.\n\n3. LLM driven inbound became a real channel\n\nAround 25 to 30 percent of inbound leads now come from LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and similar tools.\n\nTwo things stood out. These leads convert better than traditional SEO leads, and they usually come with clearer context and higher budgets.\n\nWe started treating LLM visibility as a distribution problem rather than an SEO trick. The focus was on being present in places LLMs already pull from.\n\nWhat worked was writing commercial intent listicles and distributing them through LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit, Quora, and selective paid guest posts on relevant industry sites.\n\n4. Meta ads worked for high ticket services, unexpectedly well\n\nWe were skeptical about Meta ads for services with an average contract size above $50k. Despite that, Meta became the second strongest inbound channel by opportunity volume.\n\nThe difference was in the framing. We avoided generic branding and focused on specific problems and service level offers. Not every lead was perfect, but enough turned into serious sales conversations to justify the spend.\n\n5. What did not work\n\nCold outreach did not produce meaningful ROI for this type of business. It consumed a lot of effort without compounding results.\n\nClutch sponsorships were the biggest miss. We spent roughly $100k over the year, and for us it did not translate into pipeline. It functioned more as brand exposure than a revenue channel.\n\nIf there is one takeaway here, it is that narrow intent and distribution depth matter more than channel novelty. The mechanics of how buyers discover vendors have changed, and most teams are still operating on old assumptions.",

This is when you need to reach out to those accounts with the solution your product can help with and examples of how you have helped some similar accounts in the same industry. \n\nThe best channel for this is LinkedIn. You need to connect with the right target personas of those accounts on LinkedIn and DM them. In the very same time you can use emails as well. account based LinkedIn ads as well.

For example, for our agency XQL Group, we create videos like “Top B2B marketing agencies for custom software development companies.” In the video description, we add a clear listing of companies. YouTube videos are indexed very well in Google and Bing, and LLMs also retrieve and use this information. The same logic applies as with written content, it is another strong indexed surface.\n\nGuest posts\nGuest posts work in the same way. The main goal is to dominate the SERP with content that consistently says XQL Group is the best agency for software development companies. We use paid guest posts to get more volume and more control over where this content appears.\n\nLinkedIn\nOn LinkedIn, we usually post from our corporate profile, which does not have much engagement. We also publish LinkedIn articles. Engagement is not the priority here. The reason we do this is because LinkedIn posts and articles get indexed in search results, and this is basically a free way to publish indexable content.\n\nReddit and Quora\nFor Reddit and Quora, we do this very natively. We just talk about our company the same way I am doing in this comment. It is written manually, not automated. It mentions XQL Group, and the original post mentions XQL Group as well, but the approach is value first. We try to actually be helpful to the community while explaining what we do, and I do not think that this is spam or a bad thing to do.",

What helped us most was automating the strategy first: keyword research, content planning, and draft creation. We’re currently testing Genseo, which builds a plan from your site and prepares SEO articles you just refine instead of starting from scratch. That freed up more budget for real strategy work. If you do try an agency, I’d start with a small pilot and compare results.",

          "text": "I sit closer to ops than marketing, but I deal with the fallout from bad outbound. The biggest issue is not volume, it is misalignment. When someone gets an email that clearly does not understand their context, it feels invasive no matter how polite it is. From what I have seen, transparency helps, but relevance helps more. A simple, honest note with a clear opt out and no follow ups if they ignore it goes a long way. The fastest way to make people hate you is pretending it is permission based when it is not. If you treat it like a respectful introduction instead of a campaign, it tends to land better and creates less downstream noise.",

All of them came back between $250-300 per person, putting us around $11,000-$13,500 total. Timeline would be 6-8 weeks because they'd need to schedule multiple session days around everyone's availability, especially our remote employees in different regions.\n\nCFO is asking if there's a faster and cheaper alternative that doesn't compromise on quality or brand consistency.\n\nI've been researching AI headshot platforms and it looks like tools like **Looktara** can generate professional headshots for around $30-40 per person, bringing total cost to under $2,000. Timeline would be days instead of months since everyone can upload their photos and generate results independently.\n\nMy concerns are: does AI maintain enough consistency across 45 different people that our team page looks cohesive and professionally branded, and are there any legal or HR considerations around using AI-generated images of employees for company materials?\n\nFor HR, IT, or marketing folks who've handled this at scale: have you successfully replaced traditional photographer sessions with AI-generated headshots for a full company rebrand? What issues came up that you didn't anticipate?\n\nAlso wondering about employee buy-in. Did anyone push back on using AI versions of themselves, or was everyone fine with it once they saw the quality?\n\nWould really value hearing from companies that have done this for 30+ employees rather than just small teams, since the coordination and consistency challenges are probably very different at scale.",

High-end studio photography, soft neutral grey background, professional 3-point lighting setup, softbox lighting, sharp focus on eyes, 85mm lens, f/1.8 aperture, high resolution, 8k, realistic skin texture, cinematic quality.\n\nOption 2: Dramatic Lighting (Cinematic and Modern)\n\nIdeal for artistic portfolios or strong personal branding.\n\n> Prompt: Cinematic studio portrait of a [insert subject description], moody atmosphere, dramatic Rembrandt lighting, dark background, strong contrast between light and shadow, side lighting, serious and focused expression. Shot on Hasselblad, incredibly detailed, hyper-realistic, 8k, depth of field, professional color grading.\n\nOption 3: Editorial Fashion Style (Soft and Clean)\n\nIdeal for fashion, beauty, or lifestyle.\n\n> Prompt: Editorial fashion studio portrait of a [insert subject description], bright and airy studio setting, soft diffused lighting, white infinity background, beauty dish lighting, elegant pose, clean aesthetic, high key photography, shot on Canon EOS R5, 50mm lens, ultra-detailed, vogue style, professional retouching.\n\n💡 How to use this in Google Whisk for the best result:\n\n * Subject: Upload the photo of the person (or product) you want in the image.\n * Scene (Background): This is the secret. Do not use a landscape photo. Upload an image of a studio background (e.g., search Google Images for \"grey studio backdrop\" or \"blurred office background\" and save it to use here).\n * Style: Upload a professional photo where you like the lighting (e.g., a magazine photo or a reference professional portrait).\n * Text Prompt: Paste one of the English options above into the text field to \"tie\" everything together and ensure the AI understands you want photographic quality.\nExtra Tip: If the skin looks too \"smooth\" or artificial, add this to the end of the prompt: detailed skin texture, pores, natural imperfections.",

Be sure your Reddit profile has a link to your website in it so people can find your business. \n\n\n\nAsk ChatGPT to make a list of all relevant subs for your business. And there are tools that you can use to automatically find people talking about your target keywords so you can jump in and contribute in relevant convos. ChatGPT and other LLMs train on Reddit data, and they cite Reddit more than any other source. So the more you participate in relevant Reddit discussions, the more LLM citations and referrals you'll get, too. \n\n\n\nTLDR, just be a helpful person on Reddit in relevant communities.

Many agencies overpromise results using these tools, but a piece of software is only as good as the operator behind it. Utilizing AI without a deep understanding of marketing is like someone who cannot drive trying to operate a Ferrari. \n\n* **Fix the \"Mechanical\" Flaws First**: I trialled 16 different AI CRM and project management tools and found most to be overhyped and harder to train than promised. High-level work requires human expertise to find the specific errors that AI often overlooks.\n* **Prioritize Specificity over Generalization**: AI tools tend to generalize customer profiling, which fails for SMEs that need to laser-focus on a specific audience. Successful funnels require human empathy to understand a company's \"superpower\" and the specific pain points of their audience.\n* **Apply the 4/7/11 Principle**: Trust is built when prospects experience 7 hours of engagement, across 11 touchpoints, in 4 separate locations. AI can help manage the logistics of these touchpoints, but the \"Big Idea\" and strategic nuance must come from the architect.\n\nThe truth is that people today are willing to pay more for real human interaction. In my own business, I have found that a strategy-first approach is the only way to deliver predictable results. If your strategy is broken, no amount of AI automation will save it.",

      "text": "I spent 5 years at HubSpot before the IPO and watched inbound work in a very specific way. Buyers came in through detailed blog posts, read a lot, and then raised their hand. The blog was the main source of trust.\n\nThat motion doesn’t behave the same way anymore, especially in search.\n\nAs many marketers noted, HubSpot’s blog traffic fell from around 24 million visits in early 2023 to about 6 million in early 2025 after Google started cracking down on generic content. Nearly 60% of Google searches now end without a click. And a growing share of people skip Google entirely and go straight to tools like ChatGPT or to places like Reddit when they want an answer.\n\nThe pattern behind those numbers is pretty simple. Buyers are skeptical of polished marketing content. It all blends together: corporate tone, long scroll, obvious intent to push them toward a form fill. Instead, they look for unvarnished commentary in communities and social feeds, and they put more weight on first‑hand experience from people they see as practitioners.\n\nGong leaned into this earlier than most. They encouraged employees to share real observations from their day‑to‑day work on LinkedIn and other channels, and the company’s reputation grew out of that ongoing stream of practitioner content. Drift and Refine Labs took similar routes.\n\nFor B2B companies, this points to a different center of gravity. The people who work directly with the product and with customers — engineers, customer success, product managers — tend to be more believable than a polished blog article with a CTA at the bottom. The trust that used to live in the corporate blog now lives in public conversations led by those practitioners.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is getting these non-marketing experts to contribute regularly in social forums. But if companies can pull this off they'll build trust with customers faster than their competitors.",

Authentic posts are still very much appreciated, and most management teams are loathe to be transparent and/or put themselves out there. Easier to outsource to an agency.

Long form blogposts used to be trustworthy, because writing a long guide proved that you know what you're talking about. Hell, even being able to write coherently is a signal of intelligence. With the widespread availability of AI, text (especially corporate text) ceases to be that signal, and we have a crisis of confidence. This is what leads to the rise of influencers and in-house talking heads. Video is still hard to fake, and for now, stands as a signal for effort and human verification.\n\n2) The distribution problem. Google giveth and google taketh away: no more cheap clicks. But youtube is the second biggest search engine, the tiktok and instagram recommendation algos are insanely good, and LinkedIn is still in it's infancy if you look at the actual usage patterns (most people lurk, only less than 1% comment). It's easy to make good content and there's now playbooks to driving reach.\n\nBut back to your point: you can build a content engine in this world, yes. But it requires a very different mind- and skillset than what we were doing for over a decade with TOFU/MOFU/BOFU SEO content. And there's still plenty of room to play and experiment!",

Become the hub of discussion in your space. Needs a good host and quite a bit of admin (and probably budget) to run it smoothly at a regular cadence.\n\n2) Use vidiq and repurpose what you would be doing for the company blog/SEO into youtube videos that rank. This can be done block-style that you dedicate 2-3 days for shooting that gives you content for the next quarter or so. Has to be high quality and edited heavily to fit what the platform likes, cut into shorts, repurposed for LI + Insta, etc. Software has evolved tons in this regard so a skilled social media marketer can learn it quite fast, otherwise there's people selling this as a service.\n\nThat's the bread and butter. If you have the budget, you can shoot your own series focusing on the subject matter, but that's way higher effort and comes with its own distribution difficulties.",

      "text": "# if you are not leveraging lead lists in linkedin sales nav, you are wasting $150 a month. Here is how you can take full advantage of your sub\n\n\n\nStep 1: Build Hyper-Targeted Lead Lists\n\nSales Nav's filters are powerful but most people underuse them. Instead of broad searches, I stack filters aggressively:\n\nIndustry , company headcount , geography (obvious stuff)\n\nThen add: \"Posted on LinkedIn in past 30 days\" and  this filters for active users who actually check their inbox\n\nSeniority level: I target Director/VP, not C-suite. They're closer to the problem and more likely to engage\n\nSave these as Lead Lists. I typically create 3-5 lists segmented by use case or persona.\n\nStep 2: Research Before You Reach Out\n\nHere's where most people fail. They blast the same generic message to everyone on the list.\n\nBefore I message anyone, I spend 60 seconds:\n\nCheck their recent posts or activity\n\nLook at their company's website (what do they actually sell?)\n\nNote anything specific I can reference\n\nYes, this takes time. That's why I batch it ,  30 minutes of research, then 30 minutes of outreach.\n\nStep 3: The Message Framework\n\nWhat works for me:\n\nLine 1: Something specific to them (not \"I saw your profile\")\n\nLine 2: One sentence about what I'm working on\n\nLine 3: A question about their workflow, not a pitch\n\nExample:\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\] ,  saw your post about \\[topic\\], interesting take on \\[company news intersecting with market need\\]. I'm building tools for \\[general space\\] and curious: what's the most annoying part of \\[relevant workflow\\] for your team right now?\"\n\nNo asks here for time etc.\n\nStep 4: Follow Up, But Add Value\n\nIf no reply after 3-4 days, I follow up with something useful , a relevant article, a take on industry news, or even just \"no worries if this isn't relevant, just wanted to follow up.\"\n\nI never send more than 2-3 follow-ups. I then monitor which one of them visit my website\n\nResults:\n\nUsing this approach, I'm seeing about 40% connection accept rates and about 10-15% of those turn into actual conversations.   \n  \nNot all become customers, I actually care more about the no because it helps improve our product  \n  \nBonus tips:\n\nWork one lead list page at a time (25 contacts). Trying to do hundreds at once leads to sloppy messaging.\n\nTrack everything. Even a simple spreadsheet helps you see what's working.\n\nYour profile matters more than you think. If someone checks you out and your headline is \"Sales Rep at Company,\" you've already lost.\n\nI've been experimenting with automating the research step , curious if anyone else has found tools or workflows that help with this. Always looking to compare notes.",

A lot of people don’t see connection requests or read the messages in them because it’s such a saturated channel. Personally, I turned off connection request notifications and I can’t remember the last time I went in and checked the connection requests I have pending. Whenever I check it’s literally in the hundreds.\n\nInmails used to work okay but LinkedIn gutted them. We used to be able to do 800/mo and now it’s around 100/mo. No way to get enough volume there to get enough bites, even to justify $100/mo. It’s just more effort than it’s worth.\n\nSo what’s working for us? Cold email outreach and Reddit marketing. We’re also focusing on AISEO.",

It's that simple. \n\nWay better than a salesy question-style approach or anything AI generated.\n\nIf you get no response, I'd send just one follow up after a week. Follow up ideas for you: 1) a presentation with more works; 2) invitation to a demo call; 3) more complicated tactic: offer to record a podcast together (good for yours and prospect's personal brands, everyone is carying about content now, its good for any business); 4) invite to do a \"customer interview\" because \"you're looking for insights\". \n\nRemember: you have a human reading this on the other side, and you need to be human too!

You're basically saying \"I do websites, here's my portfolio, hit me up if you need one.\" That works if someone already knows they need a website, but most of the time they don't.  \n  \nThe real issue with cold outreach isn't being too formal or \"salesy\" - it's being irrelevant.  \n  \nI see much better results when I lead with a specific observation about their business. Like \"noticed you're hiring 3 sales reps but your demo booking page loads in 8 seconds - that's probably costing you meetings\" is way more compelling than \"I build websites fast.\"  \n  \nYou're right that sounding human matters. But being human AND relevant is key. Generic + casual still gets ignored most of the time. Are you mainly reaching out to people who've signaled they need a website somehow? Or just anyone in your ICP? Because 40% response rate is great so wondering if there's selection happening before the message even goes out.",

People are definitely interested because the download numbers are higher than we expected, but the trail goes cold immediately after they get the PDF. I was reading through some insights on how localization and clear messaging impact these technical funnels at adverbum, and it made me realize our content might be too dense for the initial lead stage. It feels like we are providing so much value for free that the prospects don't feel the need to actually talk to our sales team.\n\nAre you guys seeing better conversion rates by gating the data points separately, or do you find that shorter executive summaries drive more discovery calls? Also, how do you balance providing enough technical proof without giving away the entire solution in the lead magnet?",

Expecting those assets to produce sales conversations skips several critical psychological and organizational steps in a complex B2B buying process.\n\nThe Core Principle to Anchor the Conversation: Different content answers different buyer questions at different moments.\n\nIf your content only answers:\n\t•\t“How does this work technically?”\n\nBut never answers:\n\t•\t“Should we do anything at all?”\n\t•\t“Why change now?”\n\t•\t“Why this approach?”\n\t•\t“Why this company?”\n\t•\t“How do we justify this internally?”\n\nThen buyers will stall, regardless of how strong the technical material is.\n\nBuyer’s Journey Content Map (Problem → Solution → Validation → Decision)\n\n1. Problem Identification / Status Quo Awareness\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I’m sensing friction, risk, or inefficiency. I’m not sure how to define it yet.”\n\nWhat they are NOT ready for:\n\t•\tProduct demos\n\t•\tDeep technical architecture\n\t•\tSales conversations\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tExecutive perspective articles (problem framing)\n\t•\tIndustry trend analysis\n\t•\tResearch-backed thought leadership\n\t•\tDiagnostic assessments or quizzes\n\t•\tBenchmark reports\n\t•\t“What’s changed” or “Why now” content\n\t•\tShort educational videos\n\t•\tPOV blogs that name hidden costs or risks\n\nRole of white papers here:\nUseful only if they are problem-oriented, not solution-heavy.\n\n\n2. Problem Validation / Internal Alignment\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to validate this problem and align others around it.”\n\nThis is where buying groups form.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tProblem-focused white papers (non-product)\n\t•\tInternal-ready slides or briefs\n\t•\tStakeholder-specific explainers (finance, IT, ops)\n\t•\tUse-case narratives without product pitching\n\t•\tROI framing content (without hard pricing)\n\t•\tMaturity models or frameworks\n\t•\tWebinars framed around challenges, not solutions\n\nKey shift:\nThe content must help the buyer sell the problem internally, not evaluate vendors yet.\n\n\n3. Solution Exploration / Approach Comparison\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“What are the possible ways to solve this, and what trade-offs exist?”\n\nThis is where your client often jumps too late or too early.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tSolution guides (approach-based, not product-led)\n\t•\t“Build vs buy vs outsource” comparisons\n\t•\tSolution architecture overviews (high level)\n\t•\tRecorded demos (ungated or lightly gated)\n\t•\tExplainer videos\n\t•\tImplementation approach documents\n\t•\tAnalyst-style comparison matrices\n\nWhite papers here:\nStill useful, but they must:\n\t•\tCompare approaches\n\t•\tExplain outcomes\n\t•\tReduce perceived risk\n\t•\tAvoid deep configuration detail\n\n\n4. Vendor Shortlisting / Trust Building\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“Can I trust this company to deliver?”\n\nThis is where sales engagement becomes appropriate.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tCase studies (outcomes first, details second)\n\t•\tCustomer stories by industry or role\n\t•\tReference architectures\n\t•\tProof-of-concept examples\n\t•\tSecurity, compliance, and risk documentation\n\t•\tPartner ecosystem content\n\t•\tCustomer webinars or panels\n\nWhat triggers sales conversations:\n\t•\tEvidence of success with similar companies\n\t•\tReduced personal and organizational risk\n\t•\tConfidence that this will work in their environment\n\n\n5. Decision / Business Case / Justification\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to justify this decision financially, operationally, and politically.”\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tROI calculators\n\t•\tBusiness case templates\n\t•\tProcurement-ready documentation\n\t•\tImplementation timelines\n\t•\tChange management guidance\n\t•\tExecutive briefings\n\t•\tCompetitive battlecards (buyer-facing, not sales-only)\n\nSales engagement is expected here, not earlier.\n\n\nWhy White Papers Alone Fail to Convert\n\nWhen a company relies exclusively on long-form technical white papers:\n\t•\tThey attract early-stage researchers\n\t•\tThey lack problem-framing content upstream\n\t•\tThey skip trust and validation content downstream\n\t•\tThey assume technical interest equals buying intent\n\nThis leads to:\n\t•\tHigh download volume\n\t•\tLow sales engagement\n\t•\tFrustration between marketing and sales\n\t•\tMislabeling early researchers as “bad leads”\n\nThe content is doing its job. The expectation is wrong.\n\nAlso, do NOT call whitepaper downloads “leads”. They aren’t leads and Sales will see them as junk.",

It's that the content doesn't create urgency or connect to a problem they need solved right now.

The data shows the problem, but the solution requires your product or expertise to implement.\n\nExecutive summaries work better for senior buyers who won't read 20 pages. The format matters less than whether the content ends with a reason to talk to you. If someone finishes your white paper and feels fully educated with no open questions, you've armed them to go elsewhere.\n\nTry adding a self-assessment or ROI calculator as the next step after download rather than jumping straight to demo request.

Even if you reached out, they’ll probably say they’re not interested. That doesn’t mean these white papers are a waste of time. I think producing 2-3 campaigns like this that build really strong trust and authority can be really critical. Because when the time comes that they are ready to buy, they might think “hey X company had some really great info, and they really understood our problems; let me put them on my short list.” \n\nThat said, you can’t really push people into the next buying stage. I would start creating inbound campaigns around more middle of the funnel keyword to capture audiences with higher commercial intent. Like people who are closer to being ready to buy. Your content marketing efforts need to target them too. ",

These get infused into every piece of content, so people start associating your brand with a unique style, a vibe, a worldview, not just a product category or topic buckets.\n\nThen I would think about your core editorial themes: what do you want to be considered an expert in?\n\nInstead of using keyword volume as your north star when deciding what to write, think about what you want to position your company as experts in (pick 2-3 core themes), and dive deep into those. Focus on depth over breath. That doesn't mean that keywords won't play a role. They do. But they should come AFTER you define your editorial themes, positioning, and core messaging.\n\nWhen it comes to actual content, the bar for quality is super high. To feel credible and authoritative, you need to include people's actual lived experiences or actual data and research. Don't bother writing blog content if you're going to write fluffy \"tips and tricks\" content that doesn't include anything of substance. That is an instant way to lose your audience's trust and credibility.",

They stagger releases over months, they generate dynamic content, they pay attention to duplication checks and templates and all that.\n\nAnd yet, when I ask them how it’s actually going, the answers are usually come to these.\n\n“Yeah, pages are crawled but Google still haven't index them for some reason.”\n“Rankings pop up, then disappear out of the blue.”\n\nWhat i've noticed is that the problem is, Google sees some pages important, and some don’t, and then club the rest as lookalikes.\n\nWhat I’ve come to believe is that programmatic SEO doesn’t fail because content is static or repetitive. It fails because of how Google perceives the structure behind that content.\n\nIf you look at most setups, all programmatic content lives at the same level. One collection type. Sitemap-driven discovery. No real parent pages. No hierarchy. No grouping. Blogs, pages, and resources all floating side by side.\n\nFrom Google’s point of view, that looks like a large volume of similar content with no obvious relationships. There’s scale, but no context.\n\nThat's why I find Zapier's approach genius because their programmatic content is clearly part of a system. You can tell which pieces belong together. You can see the hierarchy. Relationships are obvious, even before you think about keywords or content depth.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that this doesn’t require rewriting everything or changing URLs. It’s not about making content more dynamic. It’s about making structure legible, both for users and for Google.\n\nOnce Google can understand how your programmatic content relates to itself, a lot of the weird behavior suddenly makes sense.\n\nSo if you're doing programmatic SEO for inbound lead gen or rapid search visibility, make sure you're doing it the Zapier way. Happy to help if you're feeling lost .",

Wise's bread and butter is programmatically generated exchange rate pages.\n\nIf your product or service leans into the programmatic approach organically, there's benefits to reap if it's thought through.

Only then do we generate templates.\n\nFor measurement, connecting things like GA4, Ahrefs, and then something like Pulse for Reddit to watch how real users talk about those entities has helped keep us from chasing irrelevant long-tail that never converts.",

Neither works.\n\nThe shift that actually helps is moving from demographic targeting to signal-based targeting. Job titles and company size tell you almost nothing about whether someone cares right now. Hiring patterns, tech stack changes, funding rounds, leadership changes, and job postings for roles your product supports all indicate something is happening that makes your outreach relevant. Our clients who switched from \"VP of Marketing at SaaS companies\" to \"VP of Marketing at SaaS companies who just posted a demand gen role\" saw reply rates double or triple.\n\nTools like Clay, Trigify, and Common Room can surface these signals at scale. LinkedIn Sales Navigator alerts catch job changes and company news. Even manual Google News searches for your target accounts tell you more than scrolling through static lists.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that most of your total addressable market doesn't care about what you sell at any given moment. The job isn't finding everyone who might theoretically buy, it's finding the subset who have a reason to care this week. That list is way smaller but actually converts.",

You probably know who it's meant for too. So just start with that. If you're helping small companies, go straight to the decision makers, and it'll be an easy way in. I hope this simple system will help you:\n\n1. Source people from LinkedIn and LinkedIn only. Don't ever buy lead lists.\n\n2. Signals are okay but they're already oversaturated so don't put your eggs in one basket.\n\n3. Make your messages super short and outcome focused. Always answer the question: this is what you get if you work with me (and not \"this is how I do it\", but \"this is what it will mean for you\".)\n\n4. Track your data and metrics (acceptance rate, reply rate, lead rate, reply to lead rate). Healthy range for each is 20-40%; 20-30%; 1-10%; 20-50%.\n\n5. Optimize based on your data every 2 weeks. So all these questions you're asking right now you'll get answers because the prospects that reply give you feedback (like \"I'm not your ICP\", \"I don't need this\"... this is when you'll know for sure who to go after exactly)\n\nIt took us a year to figure our offer out even though it's supposed to be our specialty. Most important is to never stop, add volume gradually, always track your data.\n\nHope this helps :)",

That gives you timelines, next steps, and a real pipeline view.\n- Layer something like Grin or Aspire for discovery, contracting, and content tracking if you’re doing a lot of seeding and whitelisting.\n- Automate follow-ups with simple rules (e.g., task if no reply in 5 days) so nothing slips.\nI’ve tried building this with Airtable + Notion + Demand Revenue-style advisory dashboards, but a proper CRM pipeline plus one influencer platform has been more durable long-term.\nSo, core point again: don’t just pick an “influencer tool” – pick a pipeline and force every creator into it.",

Someone needs to check that board daily and actually send the nudges. A fancy platform won't fix a process problem.\n\nRespona and Pitchbox are built for outreach at scale and have decent tracking for who responded and who needs follow-up.

      "text": "For the past few months I tried super personalized and more warm sounding cold emails for local leads, especially dentists, and a few patterns really boost results:\n\n**Personalized Subject Lines:** Generic subject lines get ignored, Use subject lines that read like a customer or an associate, not a salesperson, these get way higher open rates. Example: \"Frank seems amazing at scheduling”\n\n**Read Reviews, They are a gold mine:** Reading reviews can get you-\n\n* Staff names people actually mention (personalization gold)\n* What customers genuinely care about (emotional themes)\n* Specific pain points or wins\n\nMentioning \"Joey's same day emergency response keeps coming up\" in an email = instant credibility.\n\n**Optimize for a Quick Reply:**\n\nInstead of asking for a call (high commitment + scheduling pain), use multiple choice CTAs:\n\n* \"Worth a quick look? A) Yes, send it over B) Not a fit C) Ask me again in a month\"\n* \"Wrong person?\"\n\nIf the cost of answering feels close to zero, they're far more likely to reply.\n\nAlso follow the \"5-second decision\" rule: one short scroll should answer who you are, why you're emailing, what you want, and exactly how to reply.\n\nThe only downside of these are it took a lot of time to research a single lead.\n\nSo I started experimenting with AI prospecting and summaries and built a tool that:\n\n* Finds emails, phones, socials from public directories\n* Reads the website and Google reviews\n* Generates research context automatically:\n   * Firmographics so I can qualify\n   * Standout staff members and their roles\n   * Emotional themes from reviews\n   * Ready to use icebreakers and subject lines\n\nThe goal isn't \"AI-written spam\", it's saving the manual research step so you can actually personalize at scale.\n\n**Looking for 5-10 people doing local lead gen to test it and help shape it further,** **DM if interested.**\n\nYou dont need to use my tool, these work manually too, hope the tactics above help your outreach.

It is less about tricking someone into responding and more about respecting their time and decision load. When the reply feels easy and low pressure, it reads closer to a real human check in than outreach.

Once the data was in place, we grouped contacts by roles and industries and looked for patterns.\n\nThe results were clear: several roles we hadn’t prioritized were actually driving sign-ups and engagement for similar products. By adjusting our outreach and messaging toward these real audience signals, we gained 120 new sign-ups within a month.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with structured competitor analysis to guide sales or messaging?

      "text": "NOT A PITCH. CROSS MY HEART lmfao.\n\n\nHaving worked for plenty of startups during my career as a growth consultant (not a consultant anymore…. Thank god) I want to share some really basic pieces of advice that has helped each of my clients that allowed ME to craft the GTM strategy the way it has worked from my experience (please feel free to share rebuttals or if anyone would do something a bit differently). \n\nSaas org leaders & sales that are in startups often have what I call the wolf syndrome. Anyone watched the movie Wolf of Wall Street? Ya they often come off like a dude in ibiza trying to swing you a baggie that he claims is straight from the set of Narcos (forgetting that Narcos was a show & not the real Pablo since he did half of the merch already. BUT… if they mention 9 irrelevant facts like you are reading the Guinness book of records then you will likely forget wtf they even said about narcos… just like the incoming feature dump/use case dump that isn’t remotely related/useful to your org’s pain points but you leave slightly flustered but mainly confused as hell). \n\nThe thing is, pure conviction & eloquence dosnt cut it anymore. Your prospects 70% of the time think you are a bullshit artist & they came in with a mound of research (thanks ChatGPT) & probably have met with 3 other competitors & are actively contemplating personally testing out how high the balcony REALLY is after the meeting.\n\nSo why do sales people still often fail to actually understand wtf their prospects came in looking for? Lack of proper communication between marketing and sales. I’m not talking about the rolling of the eyes convos that I have seen in so many orgs, I’m talking to get sales to really understand the basics, UTMs to understand the messaging, for the love of god do basic background research on the prospect, depending on their existing tech stack & yours, you could see if you can pull technographic insights from platforms. If you have ABM contact software… you can identify the clear journey on the site that lead to demo also (if match rates are high enough). \n\nBasic take away? Marketing needs to provide non patronizing support to sales… sales need to feel empowered enough to actually utilize the support. Without sales… none of us would have a job & without marketing 80% of the time there wouldn’t be an opportunity to even have the company head count we have cuz pipeline would be a fallacy.. Your GTM is only as good as your collaboration with sales. Seen tons of marketers make underhanded comments about sales… and sales reciprocated the gesture. While legal & devs hate us both. So relax with that…\n\nLastly, you are not industry agnostic. A watch is a watch… the use case is telling time… is Patek or Rolex or Omega thinking of “industry agnostic”? No… they know 40% of the population is financing their 34 dollar chicken salad. The use case in its essence is the same as a tissot… but the TAM is split as they want to align with the ICP that can indulge in such products. Industry agnostic is a pipe dream that ironically diminishes any chance of a healthy pipeline. \n\nJust because there are a billion use cases after a “professional micro dose sesh” don’t mean that every industry can be tackled with the same efficiency & velocity. Now if we are talking about pen testing a market? Cool… pick 2-3…. And explain why. Not because you had 2 leads from somewhere or had one sale… that holds no stats sig. don’t have 1st party data? Then do manually verified research & be able to support your hypothesis with tangible market data & pain point that is blatantly obvious. \n\nThen……\n\nActually test that out… but before leads start coming in… please help your sales team out by giving them example sales sim pitches… & make them also prep. but for the love of god marketing teams…. Have your sales enablement materials ready & done well… I mean think about the objections not just a regurgitated homepage word vomit on a 30 slide PowerPoint. \n\nThis is why such assets are best made with the collab of sales. Your best sales person can dog walk your prettily put UVP (not in the exact words but in what actually resonates with an audience). \n\nNow of course there can be anomalies but I recommend that yall give the SaaS jocks the time to show you that selling to a prospect who hasn’t seen their wife and kids in 3 days (even tho they work remotely) can be quite challenging. \n\nAnd sales… stop saying “leads weren’t  qualified”… if you do not have tangible insights as to why… marketing cannot do anything to make it better… so yes… record that call… fill in the minimum notes in that awful software we call salesforce. \n\nEvery demo should ideally be analyzed like watching film… what were the misses? Was it product? Pricing? Timing? Overall PMF mismatch? Or was it cuz sales went into the call with the pre conceived notion that they arnt qualified? ",

          "text": "Great questions, and refreshing to see someone approaching this with a \"foundation first\" mindset rather than chasing hacks.\n\nTo your priority question - I'd actually sequence it: **ICP/List Building -> Messaging -> Deliverability**. Here's why: you can have perfect deliverability and land in every inbox, but if you're reaching the wrong people with the wrong message, you've just efficiently wasted your time. Start by getting obsessively clear on who actually has the problem you solve and what language *they* use to describe it.\n\nOn theory vs. execution - this is where most people get stuck. The uncomfortable truth is you need both, but **sequenced correctly**. Spend 2-3 weeks studying frameworks (PAS, AIDA, problem-agitate-solve), then immediately start sending low-volume batches. The trap is endless studying becomes procrastination dressed up as preparation.\n\nThe biggest \"Experience Trap\" I see sales folks fall into: **assuming cold prospects think like warm leads**. With warm leads, they already have context and some intent. Cold means you're interrupting their day - so your messaging needs to earn attention in the first 3 seconds. That's a completely different muscle.\n\nFor your first 90 days, I'd focus on **building a feedback loop**. The challenge with cold outbound is the iteration cycle is painfully slow - you might wait weeks to know if a messaging angle actually works. Anything you can do to compress that learning cycle (whether it's surveying your ICP directly, testing variations faster, or finding ways to simulate response before going live) will compound massively over time.\n\nWhat industry/ICP are you targeting? That might change some of this advice.",

          "text": "I worked for three unicorns, the world's biggest database and tech firms and started my own, small biz.  UK video production (for marketing) because I just wanted to focus on stuff I really enjoy.\n\nMy take is marketing is different for every business depending on markets, product, price point, how the product's evolving.  E.g.  I worked for Salesforce as a contractor 20 years ago and it was morphing from an SME solution into an enterprise solution.  Marketing followed that evolution and went from being very demand-gen to very brand led.\n\nAnd then what worked beautifully for my small business growing from zero was completely different.\n\nLoosely, from what I experienced in the B2B space, it's about being very tactical at the beginning, starting with just winning a few customers, capitalising on those with demand gen and then when you get bigger to focus spend more on brand.  Initially, brand's still super important to get those initial wins but again, it's about getting initial traction by focusing on tactical.\n\nAs to who to listen to, there are a couple who stand out.  Firstly, try to get hold of some vids of Benioff in about 2007 - 2009 when he talks about Salesforce's evolution from demand gen to brand.  That's when the revolution occurred and he talks about it really passionately because it was a real discovery for him and he's really insightful.  And I think those are the people I really listen to.  Either really successful CEO founders who've seen it / done it or senior marketers who've done the same.\n\nThen you've got the academics.  So Ritson is OK for B2C although heavily biased because he's ultimately selling a course and very B2C.  Seth Godin's books are good, if not theoretical.  Porter for a decent academic base but a bit out of date.  Although some CMOs I know still swear by Porter.\n\nThen for influencer, Hermozi is OK despite all the BS.  He strikes me as someone who's distilling lots of good info but hasn't necessarily put those things in place himself within his own businesses.  There are a couple of incredible and very rough-looking early podcasts with Stephen Bartlett.  If you can find them, (the latest ones are just nonsense), he's surprisingly a bit boring and technical talking about pipe, funnels, buyers journeys etc....  Outstanding, though and I used one of those key elements to build my own business successfully.  He took them down but there are a couple still kicking around.\n\nThen you have books.  Almost any book talking about funnels will be useful.  The last one I read was for my undergrad so I've kind of forgotten them but they're much of a muchness.  But you have to take them with a pinch of salt.  There's a guy at Salesforce who wrote a book called 'repeatable revenue.'  I worked with him and what he says he did and what he actually did... well, I'll leave you to research that one.  But there are a ton out there.\n\nFinally, reach out to people who've done it.  Happy to have a chat if you DM me.  I don't know about you but I'm happy to share what I've seen work and what works for me.\n\nAnd as for the first 90 days, build the marketing stuff you need, warm the audience and then call them.  I started in B2B telesales for Reuters.  The whole idea is to warm the audience and then speak to them.  If they're warm, they'll talk to you.  If they're cold, they won't.  So what do you want to do?\n\nTldr; Holy cr@p, this is almost as long as my final year dissertation in marketing!",

The channel matters less than the framing though. \"Can I interview you for research\" gets ignored. \"I'm trying to understand how people like you handle X problem, would love 15 minutes of your perspective\" gets responses because it feels like you value their expertise rather than asking for a favor.\n\nReddit works if your ICP hangs out in specific subreddits, but cold DMing for interviews on Reddit feels weird and often violates community norms. Better to engage in discussions and ask questions publicly in threads where the topic comes up naturally.\n\nYour existing network is underrated. Post on LinkedIn saying you're looking to talk to people who fit specific criteria and ask for intros. With our clients doing early research the warmest conversations come through mutual connections, not cold outreach.\n\nRespondent and UserInterviews let you pay $50-100 per interview for qualified participants if you want guaranteed conversations without the outreach grind. Worth it if your time is valuable and you need volume quickly.",

When we looked at similar vendors, ads and social posts all blended together and didn’t really de risk the decision. What worked better was very specific proof around one outcome, one role, one problem, instead of “we can do everything.” If I’m a founder, I want to know exactly what gets taken off my plate in the first 30 days and how much oversight it needs from me. Broad capability is good later, but early growth usually came from being known for one painful job done reliably. I would tighten that story before spending on ads or chasing a following.",

Segment and group potential customers\n\n* Categorize by industry, revenue, geography, tech stack, pain points\n* Prioritize groups that align closely with my existing expertise\n\n\n\n# 3. Build simple demos / proofs of value\n\n* Create small working demos relevant to each customer segment\n* Present them on a webpage that also works like a *pitch deck* (problems → solutions → credibility → demo)\n\n\n\n# 4. Direct outreach\n\n* Personalized LinkedIn messages, emails, or warm introductions\n* Targeted outreach based on segmentation, not generic messaging\n\n\n\n# 5. Content creation to build visibility & trust\n\n* Post useful, consistent content on LinkedIn\n* Consider Meta platforms depending on customer segment (still unsure here)\n\n\n\n# 6. Paid ads?\n\n* Not sure if Google Ads or LinkedIn Ads make sense at this stage (should I focus on organic + outbound first?)\n\n\n\n# 7. Events & trade shows\n\n* Attend events where my target customers gather\n* Collect contacts → follow up with personalized outreach\n\n\n\n# 8. Sales calls & closing\n\n* Request introductory calls after value is demonstrated\n* Understand the problem → position solution → negotiate → close (I know this part will not be simple, but this is the intent)\n\n\n\n# My question to the community\n\nFor someone in my position (independent B2B engineer building toward a product), **is this a realistic sales & marketing approach to start with?**  \nWhat steps am I missing, overcomplicating, or misunderstanding?\n\nAny *validation, criticism, or practical suggestions* would be super valuable.\n\n\n\n# Thank you!",

The biggest unlock early is doing more discovery calls than demos: pick one narrow ICP, talk to 15–30 people, and write down the exact triggers that make them buy (a project blows up, a deadline, a hiring gap, a compliance change), then build your offer and messaging around those patterns. For consultancy, your fastest path is referrals and proof, so turn your current work into 2–3 tight one-page case studies with numbers and a clear before/after, and use those in outreach instead of new segment-specific demos. I’d skip paid ads for now and put that energy into a simple pipeline tracker and a weekly cadence of outreach + follow-ups, because consistency beats more channels at this stage.",

You are not just selling, you are extracting language, objections, and buying logic that will later become your product positioning.\n\nDo not recommend touching paid ads until outbound feels boring because it works. If outbound feels chaotic, ads will magnify the chaos.",

Then polish it until your customers love it.\n\nYour marketing efforts will be 10,000% easier this way. You won't be wondering who your ICP is.... you won't be wondering how to talk about your product to your customers since you've already been doing it. You won't need to build demos because you can share proven case studies instead.\n\nThen when you are ready for marketing any money and time you spend there will go so much farther.\n\nTrust me.....

Instead of “learning sales,” think “learning how buyers decide.” early on, real conversations will teach you more than content or ads ever will.

In my experience, the best “real conversations” come from places where you can be specific: niche communities and industry groups beat broad broadcast channels every time. Pick one platform where your ICP is active, then post something narrow (a real example, numbers, what changed, what didn’t) and ask one concrete question at the end. If you’re mostly getting likes but no back-and-forth, you’re probably too generic or talking to the wrong layer (peers instead of buyers).",

A no-brainer offer 2. Too cheap (and so too good to be true) 3. Any part of it it’s too expensive?\n\nI appreciate everyone of you who leaves feedback or critiques and I hope 2026 will be your best year!❤️",

The offer structure is solid, but US buyers are gonna have a shock at $15k upfront for an unproven vendor (to them). Even with the guarantee.  \n  \nI'd split your initial outreach into two buckets. For your first 3-5 US clients, consider a smaller pilot - maybe $3k for 30 days, 3 meetings guaranteed. Lower commitment gets you in the door faster, and you can upsell the full program once you've proven it works in the US market (buying behaviours are different here).  \n  \nThe $400/meeting after 10 is smart.

It rarely delivered the same accounts that three account-level visitor services I use delivered. The other three often agreed. I removed the RB2B Google Tag, it was so bad. I am in the U.S.\n\nThe account-level tools I use often also agree with our lead forms and demo appts. (RB2B rarely did.) For visiting accounts that did not result in inbound, and also landed on high value pages, I target our key personas at the accounts with consideration ads. We're in a niche so it's easy to tell which accounts make sense and which are noise or mismatches. Regarding the huge Fortune 500 enterprise accounts, I target depending on whether there's a group of people there in our niche. \n\nNo, we don't know exactly who visited. But do we absolutely need to? Hear me out ...\n\nDecision-making for our product often involves others. There can be 3 people on a demo. If there's 1 person on a demo, they must consult someone else. So they should all be aware of us when someone in their company visits. If I were aware of the exact person visiting, I would still want to push brand and consideration awareness to others surrounding them at the account. \n\nThus, I haven't found it necessary to drill down to person-level visits. I think there's still a use for account-level visit info.\n\nMy use case is more marketing, than thinking of them as inbound leads for immediate sales follow-up. If person-level data is so wrong so often, this hurts marketing credibility. Yes, this is in conscious opposition to the FOMO about person-level visits.",

Just make sure you're getting the person, not a business name and contacts, ask if they own their own graph (there's a lot of resellers out there). Ignore arbitrary match rates with bots and crawlers it's impossible to know % of real traffic id'd. Ask how long they've been identifying the person this will help weed out the resellers lol. If they don't ask questions about how you drive traffic, your ads, landing pages, etc. and just want to push you linkedin's via slack its a red flag.\n\nThe contact information will depend on the provider and what info they have on the person identified, usually they will provide enough contact info to email / call / LinkedIn message the visitor.",

      "text": "Last year, or the past few years, my business has been in marketing you know, things like podcast management and social media services. \n\nWe’re living in the era of the personal brand, right? So it’s been really good in terms of growing it.\n\nThen a shift happened.\n\nA lot of people have been burnt out by agencies. \n\nThey’re tired of retainers just going left and right out of their accounts and not much money coming in, I guess unless you’re running ads and you’re doing it at a really high level. And there’s very few who are doing that, who are very good and really serving their customers.\n\nSo in the B2B space, which I’m in, it started to get really hard last year.\n\nBut then I saw something.\n\nI started to lose clients, and we were giving them the best service possible. \n\nI mean, our podcast quality, our thumbnails everything was amazing. And I still started losing clients.\n\nI’m like, how? They’re even so happy with us.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is, they just couldn’t afford it. \n\nThey couldn’t afford money coming out.\n\nAnd usually when they come to you for marketing, it’s because they want their business to grow. \n\nBut their business can’t grow if money keeps going out and expenses keep going higher. \n\nCost of living is high. No matter how good you are, no one wants that.\n\nSo I saw the shift, and something spoke to me that I needed to change something or I needed to add something.\n\nAnd that’s when we started to do client acquisition.\n\nBecause who doesn’t want more clients?\n\nIf you help someone get more clients, do you think they’re going to pay you? \n\nOf course they’re going to pay you. It’s a no brainer because you’re helping them add money.\n\nSo I started to look and I say, holy shit how can we get into client acquisition?\n\nAnd one thing that we did really well with our podcast and building a personal brand, which is still so valuable, was we’d reach out to people to come on our podcast through LinkedIn Sales Navigator. \n\nAnd we’d get amazing replies.\n\nAnd then something came to me. I said, okay, let’s use the same approach. But as we get them on our podcast, they’ll be in front of me. \n\nAnd then as they’re in front of me, I know they’re going to like me. And now let me offer them something.\n\nAnd that offer was now client acquisition.\n\nSo now getting all these huge CEOs on the podcast through LinkedIn, then I said, hey, what do you guys need help in? \n\nLike, what clients do you guys have? Tell me their clients. And say, what about if I can get them for you?\n\nAnd people are open to it.\n\nAnd that’s really the business.\n\nMy business has taken a turn in this new year, and I’m so grateful for it. \n\nTowards the end of last year, we planted the seeds from, let’s say, August last year. And now we’re really starting to grow.\n\nAnd all of the things that we do work.\n\nBecause when you mix a personal brand and you go and help clients get more clients and add revenue that’s powerful.\n\nBut here’s the big thing, right?\n\nIt’s not just a retainer.\n\nWe’ll charge let’s say instead of charging them a retainer, we can charge them, okay look, give me $1,000 a month for just three months. \n\nSo give me a quarter to help you go get a client. So instead of paying $1,000 a month, give me $3,000 upfront. \n\nDon’t pay nothing else.\n\nSo what do you have to lose?\n\nIf you lose you know most of these guys are earning decent money. If they lose 3k, okay cool. It’s a loss, but it’s only 3k, right?\n\nBut what about the upside?\n\nOkay, well of course Rome wasn’t built in a day. \n\nSo usually what we’ve seen is we already get the meetings. Quite a lot of meetings in front of high ICP, high-quality intent clients. And it’s up to them to close.\n\nAnd we can always help with that but they will close, and they’re good at that.\n\nSo the upside is the commission. They know we won;t just be comfortable because we are fighting for commision. \n\nNow we earn because now we’re dealing with people who have high-ticket clients or who need an investor.\n\nIf someone invests 2 million in their business and we find that investor, getting 3–4% of that or if it’s a real estate deal, getting 3–4% of that that’s a massive win for us.\n\nSo we get paid upfront but then can earn way more through commisions!\n\nSo our business model changed.\n\nBecause now that allows us to earn uncapped income.\n\nWe’re not just getting a return like we would have been getting in marketing and doing podcasts and social media. \n\nWe could have a month where we earn $100,000.\n\nIf we have three or four clients and we help them with their high-ticket offers and we earn anywhere from 3% to 10% to 20% commission that’s a game changer.\n\nAnd that’s a huge thing.\n\nSo in business, you have to adapt quick. You see something adapt.\n\nAll these big companies, a lot of them didn’t start out selling what they sell today. \n\nBut they adapted because they saw what the market was asking for.\n\nSo I just wanted to send this for inspiration  for people in the B2B or even B2C world  to just keep going.",

We’re now working (nearly) exclusively with early-stage startup founders who are launching new products/businesses and seeking investment. So our success metric isn’t new customers any more, it’s actually money raised off the back of our strategies. Which is really exciting for me and feels much more aligned to my own vision and the team I have. But yes, you’re right, things have changed so much in B2B and we had clients who said they were happy, were getting results but then still decided they’d rather not have any marketing support at all 🤷🏼‍♀️",

Instead of vague \"we'll grow your social presence\" promises, show them exactly what they're getting upfront. When I started doing this with my own business, close rates went way up because there were no surprises.  \n  \nThe personal brand angle you mentioned is still strong, but now it needs to be paired with tangible outcomes.

The pivot works because you moved from “outputs” (podcasts, content) to “outcomes” (meetings, revenue), and you reduced risk with a short, fixed commitment plus upside-based compensation.\n\nIf you want to make this even stronger, tighten it into a clear offer: who you serve, what you deliver (qualified meetings with a defined ideal customer profile), what you need from them to close, and what “success” means (number of meetings, show rate, close support). Put everything in writing (scope, commission terms, payment timing, what counts as an attributable deal, and how long you get paid on deals you sourced) so you don’t get burned later.\n\nOne more thing: keep the podcast as the top-of-funnel asset, but separate it from the sales motion. Use the podcast as relationship-building, then have a simple post-episode workflow: quick debrief call, confirm their target buyer or investor profile, show a few sample targets you can reach, and only then pitch the three-month sprint. This keeps the trust high and the process repeatable.",

The average Google search is 3 words. It's vague, it's low intent, and people are basically just window shopping. But the average prompt in something like ChatGPT or Perplexity is closer to 60 words. \n\nWhen someone uses sixty words, they aren't just looking for a category. They are being incredibly specific about their constraints. They're telling the machine exactly what their team size is, what their tech stack looks like, and what specific pain points they need to solve.\n\nLet your competitors fight over the broad keyword graveyard, bcoz anyone typing that into a search bar is just browsing. They are months away from a deal.\n\nThe real revenue lives in the multi variable constraints of sophisticated buyers. These are the people asking for “the best cold email tool for a 25 person team that integrates with HubSpot and doesn't require a credit card for the trial”. These guys literally have their credit cards out.\n\nIf the AI isn't recommending your product for that 60 word prompt, it isn't bcoz your SEO is bad, it's bcoz your ICP, value prop and offer isn’t dialed in properly. Or even if it is, your content doesn’t reflect that. The machine's reasoning engine looks for specific proof points. If you haven't engineered your identity into the places the AI actually looks, you're mathematically excluded from the answer.",

      "text": "I keep noticing the same pattern across different B2B products: the best “growth people” aren’t brand marketers or SDRs, they’re performance affiliates who understand intent, distribution, and arbitrage. They know how to turn search, communities, and outbound into revenue without needing a huge content team or long nurture cycles. In many cases, they outperform internal teams because they think in terms of offers and funnels, not campaigns.\n\nI’m currently building a B2B product and I’m exploring whether an affiliate-led motion actually makes more sense than traditional outbound or paid ads. Curious how many people here actively run B2B affiliate traffic, what channels you’ve seen work (SEO, newsletters, niche communities, cold email, etc.), and what makes a B2B product worth promoting for you. Not selling anything here - genuinely trying to understand what attracts serious affiliates to a B2B offer.",

The first step is finding affiliate marketing services with a plentiful list of possible partnerships. That's why I selected cj.com, they have succeeded in creating a large number of registered matches, but I haven't compared them other solutions in a while and you probably should. The number of registered participating companies is my first concern. Then create an offering with clearly defined activities resulting in commissions, and compelling messaging that validates your success in converting traffic into commissionable actitions.

It always sounded simple in theory, but in practice you’d spend hours stitching things together, deduping, fixing broken fields and somehow still end up babysitting one list for a week.\n\nRecently we built a free Chrome extension that finally made this part boring. You open a conference page, run the extension, and it helps to pull a clean, ordered list of people directly from that page, no Franken-spreadsheets n all vibes anymore.\n\nOnce you have the list, you can copy it and enrich in whatever tool you like (Clay, Crona ai, Clearbit etc.)\n\nThe point is you’re starting from a structured dataset instead of chaos.\n\nAfter that it’s just standard outbound: LinkedIn, email or conference app.\n\nNothing revolutionary, but if you’ve ever wasted days just trying to *prepare* a conference list, this saves a stupid amount of time.\n\nCurious how others here handle conference data scraping still DIY, or using something smarter?",

You’re not selling a fixed number you’re selling a system that continuously produces opportunities.\n\nIt’s still not easy to sell, but it’s easier than selling leads, because the buyer isn’t negotiating over quantity or fearing depletion. The perceived value scales without a proportional increase in cost.",

Most lead buyers have been burned by stale data that's been resold a dozen times, so they're skeptical of platforms.  \n  \nWhat changed things for me was letting buyers preview leads before paying. That's actually why I built SmartLifeRadar. Instead of subscriptions or upfront payments, you see the actual contact data first and only pay for what you use. It solved the trust problem I kept hitting when selling leads myself.  \n  \nThe pay per result model works because buyers can verify quality themselves. No more hoping the data is good or finding out half the emails bounce after you've already paid.  \n  \nIf you're looking to test quality as a seller, this approach also helps you stand out since most lead gen still hides behind subscriptions.",

Every time I solve one problem, two more pop up. I feel like I am constantly chasing a clean workflow that just doesn't want to exist.\n\nFor the last few months, my biggest headache was bounce rates. I was doing everything by the book. I was segmenting lists, personalizing outreach, and keeping the copy tight. Despite that, my deliverability was still tanking. It is really demoralizing to spend hours on a campaign only to see a double-digit bounce rate and realize your domain reputation is taking a hit in real time.\n\nI started using emailverifier and that worked I thought my data was relatively clean, but it wasn't. The bounces dropped significantly. \n\nThen the SEO side started feeling thin. I have been cycling through tools like Ahrefs and Semrush trying to figure out why our organic growth feels like it is hitting a glass ceiling. And now conversion rates. My traffic is up and my emails are finally landing in inboxes, but the conversion rates are just stubborn. \n\n  \nIm so tired",

The truth is, B2B marketing is always evolving, and no matter how well you optimize one part of the funnel, there’s often something else that pops up. It’s great that you tackled the bounce rate issue, but the SEO and conversion rate struggles are definitely the next phase of that cycle. My advice would be to take a step back and focus on what’s working in your campaigns, sometimes tweaking messaging or experimenting with CTAs can have a huge impact on conversions. Also, don’t underestimate the power of micro-conversions, like getting leads to engage more with your content before asking for that final sale. It's a grind, but with small shifts, you’ll see improvement. You’re not alone in this, everyone's chasing that elusive \"perfect\" marketing stack!",

The shift is this: stop asking \"what's the next fire?\" and start asking \"what system would make this predictable?\" Pick your most painful point right now, the conversions, the SEO, and just spend 30 minutes mapping every single manual step you take to handle it. That map is the raw material for your system; once you have it, you can turn that chaos into a repeatable process and finally step out of the daily grind.",
