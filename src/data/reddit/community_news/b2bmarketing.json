      "text": "So, I work at a B2B SaaS (I hope you've heard of us: marketowl ai - we're doing ai marketing agents and now viral posting), and like everyone else, we were doing the usual LinkedIn and email outreach, blog posts, etc. The leads were getting more expensive and honestly, not great quality.\n\nA couple months ago, we decided to switch things up and started posting genuinely useful stuff on a bunch of relevant subreddits. Nothing salesy, just sharing what we've learned and some behind-the-scenes stuff.\n\nWe put up maybe 20 posts across different subs.\n\nHere's the wild part: those posts ended up getting close to a million views.\n\nAnd then suddenly, our inbound calls shot up from 2-3 a week to more like 15-20.\n\nWhen we asked how people found us, a bunch said Reddit, like \"I saw your post about \\[topic\\]\" or \"I've been following your comments for a while.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: in Google Analytics, it's basically invisible. Almost everything shows up as direct traffic, and the only real hint is a spike in branded searches on Search Console.\n\nSince most of these subs don't allow links, we'd just mention our company name and let people look us up.\n\nOn the plus side, it's now our biggest lead source and they're way more qualified than what we got from ads. Also we're offering the same services to our clients lol",

Justin\\_Asher449, I found that the real shift happens when you move away from random posting and focus on a tight daily outreach loop.\n\nIn my experience, the best tools are the ones that help you stay consistent without making you look like a bot. I look for features that help me track who is actually engaging with my content so I can follow up while the lead is still warm. A simple framework that works for me is to start with a targeted feed of my ideal prospects, leave a few thoughtful comments to build familiarity, and then send a short, non pitchy DM.\n\nI run this entire workflow inside Depost AI now. It lets me track my prospects and follow ups in one place so I do not lose people in the chaos of the LinkedIn inbox. It has really helped my conversion rates because I am only talking to people who are already aware of my brand.

Most people jump straight to automation before figuring out what actually converts their audience.  \n  \nWe wasted months with generic email sequences that got maybe 1-2% response rates. The shift happened when we stopped thinking about tools as \"set it and forget it\" and started using them to be more personal at scale.  \n  \nFor us, tracking intent signals changed everything. We set up alerts for job changes, funding rounds, and hiring patterns at target accounts. Then we'd reach out with something actually relevant to their situation, not just another templated pitch.  \n  \nThe automation part came after we knew what messaging worked. Then it was just about scaling that with tools to handle the alerts, sequencing, and follow-ups. Response rates jumped to around 20% because we were reaching out at the right time with context.  \n  \nI'd focus first on identifying 3-5 buying signals that indicate someone might actually need what you're selling, then look for tools that help you act on those signals quickly.  \n  \nWhat type of companies are you targeting, and do you have a sense of what triggers them to start looking for solutions like yours?",

      "text": "I know, I know. \"Webinars are so 2020.\"\n\nEveryone's tired of the 45-minute pitch disguised as education.\n\nBut here's the thing - the companies that are doing webinars RIGHT are seeing insane numbers:\n\n* 20-40% of webinar attendees convert to trial or paid\n* Average cost per attendee: $30-50 (vs $80-150 for a cold lead)\n* Webinar leads close 30% faster than cold leads because they already understand the product\n\nThe difference between a webinar that converts and one that gets 12 attendees and 0 signups? It's not the topic.\n\nIt's the format.\n\n# The old way (what everyone's tired of):\n\n\"Join our webinar: How \\[Product\\] Helps You Do \\[Thing\\]\"\n\nThis is a demo with a calendar invite.\n\nNobody wants this.\n\nThe title screams \"we're going to sell you something for 45 minutes.\"\n\nAttendance rates: 15-20%.\n\nConversion: near zero.\n\n# The new way (workshops that actually grow your SaaS):\n\n**Teach something valuable. Use your product as the tool to teach it.**\n\nThe product isn't the topic. The SKILL is the topic. Your product is just the instrument.\n\nExamples:\n\n|**If You Sell...**|**Don't Run This Webinar**|**Run This Workshop**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Email marketing tool|\"How Our Tool Sends Better Emails\"|\"Write Email Sequences That Convert: Live Workshop\"|\n|Analytics platform|\"Demo of Our Dashboard\"|\"Find Your Biggest Revenue Leak in 30 Minutes\"|\n|Reddit lead gen (SleepLeads)|\"How SleepLeads Works\"|\"Find 50 Qualified Leads on Reddit in 60 Minutes — Live\"|\n|CRM|\"Tour of Our CRM Features\"|\"Build a Sales Pipeline From Scratch: Workshop\"|\n|Design tool|\"Canva Product Tour\"|\"Design a Landing Page That Converts in 45 Minutes\"|\n\nSee the difference? The workshop title promises a SKILL or RESULT. The product just happens to be what you use during the session.\n\n# The 5-step playbook:\n\n**1. Pick a problem, not a feature**\n\nYour audience doesn't care about your feature set.\n\nThey care about their problem.\n\nBuild the workshop around solving that problem live.\n\nAsk yourself: \"If I removed my product name from the title, would people still want to attend?\"\n\nIf yes, you've got a good topic.\n\n**2. Make it hands-on**\n\n\"Webinar\" = passive. Someone talks, you watch. \"Workshop\" = active. You follow along and build something.\n\nWorkshops convert 3-5x better because attendees experience the product while learning.\n\nThey don't need a separate trial, they already used it.\n\nGive attendees a temporary account or free access during the session.\n\nLet them follow along in real-time.\n\nBy the end, they've already built something with your tool.\n\nThe switching cost is now in YOUR favor.\n\n**3. Keep it short (45 min max)**\n\nNobody has 90 minutes for your webinar.\n\nRespect their time.\n\n* 5 min: quick intro, set expectations\n* 30 min: hands-on workshop (the meat)\n* 5 min: Q&A\n* 5 min: \"here's how to keep going\" (your soft CTA)\n\n**4. The soft CTA (not a pitch)**\n\nAt the end, don't do a 10-minute sales pitch. Instead:\n\n>\n\nThat's it.\n\nThey already experienced the value.\n\nThe CTA is just \"keep going.\" No \"buy now,\" no \"limited time offer.\"\n\n**5. Record and repurpose**\n\nThe live workshop is one event.\n\nThe recording is an evergreen asset.\n\n* Post the recording on YouTube (SEO value)\n* Clip highlights for LinkedIn and Twitter\n* Use the transcript as a blog post\n* Gate the recording behind an email capture for ongoing leads\n\nOne 45-minute workshop can generate content and leads for months.\n\n# Where to find attendees (without spending $5k on ads):\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. \"I'll run a great workshop... but who's coming?\"\n\n**1. Reddit threads** People posting \"how do I do X?\" in your niche subreddits are your workshop audience.\n\nDrop a helpful comment and mention you're running a live workshop on exactly that topic.\n\n**2. LinkedIn posts** Post about the problem your workshop solves. End with \"I'm running a free workshop on this - drop a 🔥 if you want the link.\"\n\n**3. Your existing email list** Even if it's 200 people. An email with \"Free live workshop: \\[Skill\\]\" outperforms any newsletter you'll ever write.\n\n**4. Partner with someone in an adjacent space** Find someone who serves the same audience but isn't a competitor.\n\nCo-host the workshop.\n\nYou both promote to your lists.\n\nDouble the attendance.\n\n# The numbers that matter:\n\n|**Metric**|**Good**|**Great**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Registration → attendance rate|30-40%|50%+|\n|Attendee → trial signup|15-20%|30%+|\n|Attendee → paid conversion|5-10%|15%+|\n|Cost per attendee|$30-50|Under $20|\n\nCompare that to cold outreach where you're paying $80-150 per lead who may or may not even have the problem you solve.\n\n# Common mistakes:\n\n**1. Making it a demo in disguise.** People can smell this. If your \"workshop\" is just your sales engineer clicking through the product, attendance drops to zero by minute 10.\n\n**2. Running it once and giving up.** The first webinar always has low attendance. The third one is where you find your groove. The tenth one is where it becomes a machine.\n\n**3. Not following up.** Someone attended your workshop but didn't convert? Follow up with the recording, a summary of what they built, and an offer to continue. This alone can double your conversion rate.\n\n**4. Overcomplicating the tech.** You don't need a $500/month webinar platform. Zoom + a landing page + an email reminder sequence. That's it.\n\n**5. Gating the workshop behind too much info.** Name and email. That's all you need to register. Every additional field drops registration by 10-15%.\n\n# The bottom line:\n\nWebinars-as-demos are dead. Workshops-as-education are the best-kept growth secret in SaaS.\n\nYou teach something valuable. You use your product as the tool. Attendees experience value before they ever see a pricing page. And the content lives forever as recordings, clips, and blog posts.\n\nIf you're spending $3k/month on ads and getting lukewarm leads, try running one free workshop per month instead. The leads are warmer, the conversion is higher, and the cost is basically your time.\n\nAnyone here running workshops for their SaaS? What's working?",

My team has developed very mature framework for running webinars starting from audience research to selecting topic, to selling the first step offer during the webinar.\n\nDM if interested.\n\nMy own opinion, as marketer, is that the main bottleneck with webinars are 2 things:\n\n1. Preparing an offer that participants can claim. Here I talk about first-step offer that converts at 50-80% to delivery of main offer. In IT these often are things, sucha as mini workshops or audits.\n\n2. Actuall follow-up after the webinar. No follow-up, no sales. While there are some participants who sign-up to offer during the webinar, most money is in making follow-up calls starting on the same day.\n\nI wrote earlier about our findings with running webinars for selling tech.

The ones where we actually taught something useful (like how to structure a cold outbound video message) got 40% attendance vs the ones that were thinly veiled product demos that got maybe 18%.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add is to use the Q&A section strategically. Instead of just answering random questions at the end, I started asking attendees halfway through to drop their specific challenge in the chat. Then in the last 10 minutes, I'd pick 2-3 and solve them live using the product. That made it feel even more hands-on and the conversion rate went up noticeably.  \n  \nThe follow-up piece you mentioned is huge too. We started sending a Loom video the next day to non-converters, basically saying \"here's what you built yesterday, here's how to take it further\" with a personal walkthrough. Takes 3 minutes to record but the response has been solid.  \n  \nWhat's your take on workshop frequency? I've been doing monthly but wondering if bi-weekly would build more momentum or just lead to burnout.",

      "text": "# What tools actually help with insurance binder creation and updates?\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m launching my own Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firm and building my client reporting process from scratch. I’m specifically looking for software, templates, or platforms that help create professional, branded client reports, beyond the standard custodian-generated performance PDFs.\n\nThe default reports cover account performance, but they don’t provide much narrative context, goal tracking, or visual clarity. My objective is to create reports that:\n\n• Clearly communicate portfolio performance and allocation  \n• Include goal tracking and progress metrics  \n• Visualize risk exposure and asset breakdowns  \n• Provide space for advisor commentary and planning insights  \n• Are easy to update quarterly without rebuilding from scratch  \n• Support branding and white-label customization\n\nI’m researching tools that balance strong data visualization with workflow efficiency.\n\nFor those running RIAs or working in wealth management:\n\n1. What reporting tools are you using?\n2. Are you designing reports internally or using pre-built templates?\n3. What sections have you found most valuable to include beyond raw performance numbers?\n4. Any platforms that integrate well with custodians and reduce manual formatting?\n\nI’m trying to build a reporting system that strengthens client communication, reinforces trust, and differentiates my firm and not just generate another PDF.\n\nAppreciate any specific tool recommendations, workflows, or examples you’re willing to share.",

Should you choose a tool for the company you are today, or for the company you are trying to become in three years?

Over time I realise how I have stopped taking care of myself, so I decided to research and look for more tools I can use. Here are some tools that helped me optimize my ads.\n\nKeywords Everywhere: Shows search volume, CPC, and competition data directly on the Google search results page\n\nGoogle Tag Assistant: Essential for verifying that your conversion tracking and remarketing tags are firing correctly.\n\nRyze AI- Managed my ad campaigns and automated my report collection. Gives pretty good insights and solutions from the inbuilt chatbot\n\nForeplay or Ad Library Cloud: These extensions allow you to \"save\" ads directly from the Facebook Ad Library into a personal organized board—perfect for building a \"swipe file\" of creative inspiration.\n\nWhat tools do you use?\n\nThere a few that didnt work as well, let me know if i should post those as well!",

Broad ICPs, generic value props, and lists built around volume instead of relevance.\n\nWhat I’m noticing:\n\n* Narrower segments are outperforming broad industry lists\n* Messaging tied to a specific trigger event gets significantly more replies\n* Follow-ups that add proof or insight perform better than simple nudges\n* Smaller daily volume per inbox seems to protect long-term performance\n\nWhat’s interesting is that teams blaming saturation are often sending to “anyone who might buy” instead of a tightly defined slice of the market.\n\nFor those actively running outbound:\n\n* Are reply rates trending up, down, or flat for you?\n* Are you seeing stronger results in certain industries?\n* Has personalization depth materially moved the needle?\n\nNot looking to sell anything, just trying to compare notes with other B2B marketers on what’s actually working right now.",

      "text": "Honestly, watching early-stage founders \"spray and pray\" a $500 monthly ad budget into the LinkedIn algorithm hurts my soul.\n\nIf you have virtually zero budget, you don't need reach.\n\nYou need surgical precision.\n\nAnd most \"best practices\" are just polite ways to burn cash.\n\nHere are the three micro-experiments we ran over the last month to generate B2B pipeline, what worked, and what was an embarrassing waste of time.\n\n# 1. The \"Anti-Landing Page\" Reddit Drop\n\n**The Delusion:** \"If I write 'Check out my new tool!' and drop a link, they'll surely click it.\" (Narrator: They won't.)\n\n**The Experiment:** We took our core landing page copy, stripped the marketing fluff, and posted it as an ugly, text-heavy native Reddit post.\n\nNo links until the absolute bottom paragraph.\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 14 qualified signups in 24 hours.\n\n**The Alpha:** B2B buyers despise clicking external links from strangers.\n\nIf the copy is actually good, it converts astronomically better natively on the app they're already scrolling.\n\n# 2. The Over-Engineered Free Template\n\n**The Delusion:** \"We need an 8,000-word SEO Ultimate Guide that nobody will ever read to capture emails.\"\n\n**The Experiment:** We mapped our software's entire core methodology into a ridiculously detailed, free Notion workspace.\n\nThen we dropped it in private Slack/Facebook groups, saying \"Hey, we use this internal template to do \\[X\\]. Steal it.\"\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 84 downloads.\n\n9 converted directly to paid users of our actual tool within a week.\n\n**The Catch:** You literally have to give away the farm. If the template is just a disguised brochure, the community will flame you.\n\nBut if it's actually useful standalone, they'll use it, realize how exhausting doing it manually is, and happily pay for your software to automate it.\n\n# 3. Intent-Based \"Anti-Cold\" DMs\n\n**The Delusion:** Cold email still works if you just \"personalize the first line.\"\n\nPut down the Apollo scraper.\n\nIt's dead.\n\n**The Experiment:** We searched Reddit for people literally screaming into the void: *\"What's a good alternative to \\[Competitor\\]?\"* or *\"How do I solve \\[X\\]?\"* Then, we DM'd them directly.\n\nNo pitch.\n\nJust: \"Saw your post. I built something that does exactly this if you're still looking.\"\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 25 DMs sent.\n\n8 replies.\n\n3 meetings booked.\n\n**The Alpha here is intent.** You're not interrupting them; you're answering a question they explicitly asked.\n\nBut let's be real - doing this manually is for absolute suckers.\n\nSearching Reddit for 4 hours a day to find 3 leads will make you question your life choices.\n\nThe biggest lesson from sweating over a $100 budget?\n\nStop trying to do \"marketing at scale.\"\n\nDo things that fundamentally do not scale until they break, and *then* use software to automate the winner.\n\nWhat's the best $0-$100 experiment you've ran that actually didn't suck?",

I search for posts where someone's asking for recommendations or complaining about a problem we solve, comment genuinely first (not pitching), then follow up in DMs a couple days later. The warm-up makes a huge difference.  \n  \nThe manual search grind is real though. I spent about 2 hours daily just finding relevant conversations across LinkedIn and Reddit. Built some basic alerts to speed it up, but yeah, it doesn't scale well without some automation.  \n  \nYour template idea is clever. I've seen this work when founders literally give away their internal playbook. The ones that fail are too high-level or obviously gated content disguised as value.  \n  \nHow did you decide which Slack/Facebook groups to target with the Notion template?

      "text": "Last week we booked 10 calls purely through LinkedIn cold outreach.  \n  \nThis wasn’t about copywriting tricks or posting content. The entire week was spent figuring out how to reliably reach a lot of relevant people on LinkedIn without getting restricted.\n\nThe main problem we were trying to solve was scale. One LinkedIn account can only send so many connection requests and messages per day before you hit hard limits. So the focus was building a system that lets us reach people consistently, week after week, without depending on a single profile.\n\nWhat we ended up with is a setup that allows us to reach out to thousands of people on LinkedIn in a controlled, scalable way. Multiple accounts, careful pacing, real personalization, and automation to manage everything without manual effort.\n\nHere’s what the **numbers look like for one week** (approximate averages):\n\n• \\~3,750 connection requests sent  \n• \\~1,360 accepted (≈36%)  \n• \\~1,160 messages sent  \n• \\~590 opens (≈50%)  \n• \\~520 replies (≈45%)\n\nThat’s a 45% reply rate on cold outreach to people we’ve never interacted with before.\n\nA quick note on conversions:  \nThe reason this turned into 10 booked meetings is partly because the offer was genuinely very strong. That helped a lot. But the bigger takeaway for us is the distribution itself. Being able to put any solid offer in front of \\~3–4k relevant people every single week is where the real leverage is.  \nthat\n\nA few important details:\n\n• This can’t be done from one LinkedIn account. One account will get you capped or restricted fast. We use multiple rebranded accounts that exist purely for outreach.  \n• Personalization is not fake. We pull real context like job changes, company info, posts, and mutual connections.  \n• This has to be automated. We use custom workflows to handle sending limits, personalization, replies, and follow-ups across accounts.  \n\n\nSetup took time and experimentation (and was expensive), but once it’s running, it’s predictable.  \n\n\nIn B2B, you don’t need many wins. One good client already makes this worth it.  \n\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper into any part of this. Reach out to discuss this setup for yourself :)   \n",

I have seen so many people hit those hard limits and get their accounts restricted because they tried to do too much from a single profile. Your point about the offer being the real driver for those 10 meetings is spot on. Even the best system fails if the message does not resonate with the person on the other side.\n\nI have moved toward a similar daily loop to keep things consistent. My focus is usually on:\n\n• Using a targeted feed to only see posts from my actual prospects\n\n• Leaving real, manual comments to build some initial familiarity\n\n• Sending short, contextual DMs based on their recent activity\n\n• Tracking every follow up so nobody slips through the cracks\n\nI run this entire workflow inside Depost AI to track my warm leads and DMs in one place, which keeps the chaos manageable. Are you finding that the rebranded accounts get lower acceptance rates compared to a main personal profile?",

      "text": "**leads (where money actually starts)**\n\n**Apollo**  \nwhat it is: b2b lead database with filters (industry, size, job title, tech, location).  \nhow i use it: i build tight lists. i don’t export “marketing managers in the US” and hope for replies. i do stuff like “founder/owner” + “10–200 headcount” + “industry” + one more filter that matches the offer.  \nwhat i like: fastest way to go from idea to a real list. good filters, easy exports.  \nwhat i don’t like: export credits get used quickly if you’re sloppy.\n\n**Lusha**  \nwhat it is: contact enrichment and lookup tool.  \nhow i use it: plug it into LinkedIn to pull emails/roles fast. great for spot-checking or filling gaps in apollo lists.  \nwhat i like: simple and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: accuracy varies and credits disappear fast if you blast it.\n\n**Kaspr**  \nwhat it is: linkedin scraping tool for emails and phone numbers.  \nhow i use it: when my apollo list is missing segment contact info, or i need direct phones for sms + call follow-up.  \nwhat i like: cheap and gets you data linkedin doesn’t show.  \nwhat i don’t like: linkedin will throttle you if you go too fast.\n\n**BuiltWith / Wappalyzer**  \nwhat they are: tech stack detectors that show what software or platforms a company uses.  \nhow i use them: only when my offer aligns with specific tech users (like shopify apps, crm tools, analytics add-ons).  \nwhat i like: adds intelligent targeting instead of guessing.  \nwhat i don’t like: not perfect — always double-check before blasting.\n\n\n\n**email verification (cheap insurance)**\n\n**MyEmailVerifier**  \nwhat it is: bulk email verifier that reduces bounces before you send.  \nhow i use it: every list runs through it. i trim invalids, risky catch-alls, spam traps.  \nwhat i like: affordable and gets the job done.  \nwhat i don’t like: slower for massive lists, but worth it.\n\n**MailboxValidator**  \nwhat it is: low-cost email verifier alternative.  \nhow i use it: when i have huge lists and don’t need a lot of detail, i run this for a quick clean.  \nwhat i like: cheap and simple.  \nwhat i don’t like: lighter reporting than premium tools.\n\n**NeverBounce / ZeroBounce**  \nwhat they are: higher-detail verification services.  \nhow i use them: when i want extra confidence or deeper risk flags.  \nwhat i like: detailed scoring and reporting.  \nwhat i don’t like: credits are more expensive.\n\n\n\n**sending + sequences (where deliverability lives or dies)**\n\n**Instantly / Smartlead**  \nwhat they are: email sequence platforms that automate follow-ups.  \nhow i use them: 3–5 step sequences with personalization and throttled sends so inboxes don’t die.  \nwhat i like: easy scheduling and testing.  \nwhat i don’t like: people use them to send too much and blame the tool for bad reputation.\n\n**Mailjet**  \nwhat it is: smtp + email platform alternative to MailScale.  \nhow i use it: as a sending relay with logs and throttle control when i want more delivery insight than a plain sending app.  \nwhat i like: stable delivery and real logs.  \nwhat i don’t like: not a full sequence tool — you pair it with Instantly/Smartlead.\n\n**PuzzleInbox**  \nwhat it is: google workspace inbox provisioning + outbound management.  \nhow i use it: separate inbox pools for each project, keeping my main domain clean and avoiding shared sending risk.  \nwhat i like: quick setup and isolation.  \nwhat i don’t like: not an all-in sequence tool.\n\n**Slicey**  \nwhat it is: outlook sender setup for diversification.  \nhow i use it: alternate inbox lane so i’m not only on one provider. helps if a niche responds better to microsoft senders.  \nwhat i like: diversification.  \nwhat i don’t like: more ops work than gmail-only.\n\n**SendGrid (cheap tier)**  \nwhat it is: smtp + email API and sending platform.  \nhow i use it: as another delivery pathway when i want logs and deliverability tools but don’t want enterprise pricing.  \nwhat i like: good reputation and tools.  \nwhat i don’t like: interface has some clutter.\n\n\n\n**crm + follow-up (where deals get won)**\n\n**OnePageCRM**  \nwhat it is: crm built around “next action” and simple pipelines.  \nhow i use it: every qualified reply becomes a deal with a next step. if it’s not moving, it dies.  \nwhat i like: forces follow-up. basic but effective.  \nwhat i don’t like: limited automation and reporting compared to big crms.\n\n**HubSpot CRM (free)**  \nwhat it is: free crm with contacts, deals, and email logging.  \nhow i use it: project tracking, basic analytics.  \nwhat i like: free and functional.  \nwhat i don’t like: paid tiers are expensive if you want more.\n\n**Pipedrive**  \nwhat it is: visual pipeline crm with deal stages.  \nhow i use it: simple visual tracking and activity logging.  \nwhat i like: clean pipeline views.  \nwhat i don’t like: automation features are in paid upgrades.\n\n\n\n**landing pages + conversions**\n\n**Carrd**  \nwhat it is: super cheap landing page builder.  \nhow i use it: simple pages that explain offer, who it’s for, and book calls.  \nwhat i like: cheap and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: not for full websites.\n\n**Tally / Typeform**  \nwhat they are: form builders for qualifications.  \nhow i use them: pre-call qualification so i don’t talk to tire-kickers.  \nwhat i like: quick setup.  \nwhat i don’t like: typeform gets pricey on paid plans.\n\n\n\n**analytics (only what i actually check)**\n\n**Plausible / Simple Analytics**  \nwhat they are: lightweight web analytics.  \nhow i use them: traffic sources and conversion tracking without drowning in metrics.  \nwhat i like: clear dashboards and easy to use.  \nwhat i don’t like: not as deep as Google Analytics.\n\n**Hotjar (when needed)**  \nwhat it is: session recordings + heatmaps.  \nhow i use it: when traffic is there but no conversions, watch 20 sessions, fix obvious stuff.  \nwhat i like: shows real user behavior.  \nwhat i don’t like: watch too many videos and you’ll never ship.\n\n\n\n**content + creative (cheap and good enough)**\n\n**Canva Pro**  \nwhat it is: design tool for graphics, posts, and ads.  \nhow i use it: thumbnails, reels, carousels, quick brand work.  \nwhat i like: affordable and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: templates can feel cookie-cutter if you don’t tweak them.\n\n**Descript**  \nwhat it is: video/audio editing by editing text.  \nhow i use it: quick clips, removes, captions.  \nwhat i like: speed.  \nwhat i don’t like: heavy editing still lives in premiere/final cut.\n\n\n\n**scheduling + distribution**\n\n**Buffer**  \nwhat it is: social post scheduler.  \nhow i use it: batch my posts so i don’t open socials daily.  \nwhat i like: simple and reliable.  \nwhat i don’t like: analytics are basic.\n\n**Zapier / Make**  \nwhat they are: automation between tools.  \nhow i use them: pipe replies, forms, leads, calls into my crm so nothing gets missed.  \nwhat i like: saves time.  \nwhat i don’t like: easy to create a spaghetti mess if you’re not careful.\n\n\n\n**my cheap “works for most people” setup**\n\napollo for leads

If your ICP, positioning, integrations, and current pricing are encoded correctly and AI systems can reference them, accuracy issues drop significantly. It's a different mental model â instead of monitoring AI output, you manage what AI can access.\n\nTactical version: publish a 'brand facts' document (not marketing copy, actual structured data) somewhere crawlable. Pricing tiers, current integrations, what you are/aren't. Update monthly. Reduces factual errors. The harder version is Meridian's approach â active correction loops.

Instead of 500 templated emails getting 8 replies, we send 50 videos referencing something specific about their company and get 12-15 replies. Same time investment, better maths.  \n  \nThe volume point is spot on though. I was guilty of spending weeks perfecting our deck when we were only doing 6 demos a month. Complete waste of time. Now we aim for 30+ conversations and suddenly you can actually see patterns in what objections come up or what messaging lands.  \n  \nOne thing that helped us was treating outreach like a daily non-negotiable, not something you do when you \"have time\". 30 mins every morning, no exceptions.

The other day I saw one post ranked for “best CRM for small business\" above the HubSpot blog, which is insane because there is no way a new website can outrank HubSpot if you use traditional SEO, even if you have hundreds of backlinks, because HubSpot already has a high DA they built through years. \n\nWhat’s also interesting about those searches is people trust Reddit more than Trustpilot or Yelp reviews because some businesses are faking reviews, and users are becoming aware of it. \n\nI’m not saying you should only depend on Reddit, but in today's consumer behavior, people do research about the product or service they’re buying before committing. This means watching your VSL or reading your newsletter isn’t enough anymore.\n\nMy idea is if you position your brand as the best choice on Reddit, they will see it when they do their research, and that will make their decision faster and easier. \n\nThe only problem I am seeing here is you can’t attribute your ROI from Reddit like Meta ads because it influences the decision stage, so people search about your brand or their problem, then see your brand mentioned in the discussion, and then search your brand and buy. \n\nSo I’d say  tracking branded searches and direct traffic is better to know if reddit is working or not. \n\nBtw, if you’re interested to know how others are using this opportunity, I wrote a full breakdown on Google Docs. I can't share links here so you can leave a comment and I will share it with you if you want to see actual examples ranking. \n\nThat’s my take, guys. I’d love to hear what others think about this opportunity or if you want to know if this applies to your brand, just comment what your product does and target audience in 2 lines and I will reply if it’s for you or not. ",

That means your buyers are reading peer discussions before they ever hit your site.\n* **Trust factor**: Reddit content feels authentic compared to polished brand blogs. In B2B, where skepticism is high, this peer‑to‑peer validation is powerful.\n* **Long‑tail visibility**: Threads stick around and keep ranking.

All founder-led. It worked until it didn't. Pipeline has dried up and we don't have a budget for paid channels. To makes things worse - we're mid fundraising, which means the pressure to show traction is real.\n\n**The most frustraiting part: the product actually works. Retention is solid, customers are happy, I talk to them whenever I get the chance.** Even one CEO of really big company in our Country uses our product couple times a week to post on LinkedIn.\n\n**For context shortly about our product:** We've build a tool that creates content (SM Posts and SEO&GEO Optimized articles) from recent industry news. Content is huminized and really contextual. My Co-founder and I ran a PR Agency before this, so we had a lot of data / know-how to train and adjust the content model. Of course that is not all, but it should be enough to get the context.\n\n**I feel like I've exhausted the obvious plays. So if you were in similar spot, I'd love to ask:**\n\n* Channels that worked for you without paid budget\n* How you leveraged happy customers to grow (referrals, case studies, etc.) \n* Anything that got you unstuck when pipeline just stopped :p\n* And maybe a weird question - how you kept sane?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Look, I'll be honest with you. After 15+ years in sales, I've thrown money at every shiny tool that promised better pipeline. Some were worth it. Most weren't.\n\nBut the thing that bothers me about every \"best tools\" list is they focus on features instead of what you actually need to solve. So here's my breakdown organized by the job to be done, not the marketing pitch.\n\nContact data — Apollo. The free tier alone gives you more coverage than most paid tools. ZoomInfo has deeper firmographics but unless you're running an enterprise team with budget to burn, Apollo covers it.\n\nEnrichment — Clay. Waterfall enrichment across 75+ providers is genuinely impressive. But fair warning, it's a workflow builder. You need to invest time setting it up. Not plug-and-play.\n\nSequencing — Instantly if you're doing volume email. Lemlist if you care about personalization controls. Outreach or Salesloft if you're enterprise and want coaching analytics baked in.\n\nCRM — HubSpot. I've tried Pipedrive, Close, even spreadsheets. Kept coming back.\n\nTiming/signals — This is the gap nobody talks about. Every tool above tells you WHO to contact or HOW to reach them. None of them tell you WHEN. I was sending the same messages to the same quality leads and getting 2% reply rates because the timing was random.\n\nI started using getcleed for this piece. It monitors your prospect list for buying signals - funding rounds, new hires, leadership changes - and flags who's ready right now. Reply rates jumped from around 2% to 13%. Some weeks north of 20% when the signals line up. 6Sense and Bombora do something similar but at the company level.\n\nHonestly though, you don't need a tool for this. Set up Google Alerts for your top 50 accounts. Check LinkedIn once a week for job changes. The insight is that timing matters more than copy. How you solve it is up to you.\n\nWhat's in your stack?

The idea that you gather masses of contacts and run them through increasingly optimized sequences assumes attention is available and buyers are open to being processed. But buyers don’t buy that anymore.\n\nIf you saw a 13% reply rate, I would confidently bet it came from a tight, highly relevant segment where the outreach was intentional, not from blasting a massive list.

Text is too easy to skim past - video with a specific hook (\"saw you just brought on a new VP of Sales\") is way harder to ignore.\n\nOn verticals - Series A-C SaaS has been the sweet spot for us. Signals are public, people are on LinkedIn, and they're actually in buying mode. Enterprise is trickier, by the time the funding news drops the decision is usually already in motion.",
