      "text": "I came across this breakdown and it completely flipped how I thought about YouTube. Figured it might be valuable for you as well.\n\nMost founders assume YouTube only works if you go big. Massive subscriber counts, viral videos, influencer-level reach. But this case study proves that's wrong, well at least for B2B.\n\nThere's a small company in immigration + tax optimization. Nothing sexy. Their average client pays around $2,000 though. Their YouTube channel has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 subscribers. And from that channel alone, they've booked 500+ sales calls. That's easily seven figures in revenue from what most people would call a \"dead\" channel.\n\nBut it gets crazier… They get only around 350 to 400 views per day. About 30 videos total. But they close roughly half their calls. They even spun up a second channel in another language with under 30 subscribers, and it already brought in multiple paying clients.\n\nThis is why B2B YouTube is a completely different game.\n\nSubscriber count is a vanity metric. What actually matters:\n\n* Who's watching: are they decision-makers or random browsers?\n* Why they're watching: are they actively looking for a solution?\n* How much one customer is worth: if a client pays $2k, $10k, or more, you don't need scale\n\nThe videos that drive revenue on this channel aren't flashy. They're boring, high-intent, search-driven stuff: \"how to get residency in X,\" \"best tax residency for digital nomads,\" country comparisons etc. These aren't entertainment videos. They're decision-stage videos, which means the viewer is already problem-aware and actively searching for a solution. That's why they convert.\n\nIf you're selling something where one customer is worth a few thousand dollars or more, obsessing over subscriber count makes no sense. A small channel with the right topics can outperform a larger audience watching for entertainment. The leverage comes from intent, not scale.\n\nI’d love to hear form other founders to see if you’ve had similar results? Have any of you tried YouTube as an acquisition channel? What results did you see?",

For B2B channels, content strategy plays the biggest role in conversions (or at least in driving people further down your funnel). \n\nThe behind the scenes is to humanize the channel and get people to know you and your process a little more.

I have many clients whose trust has been eroded by scammy marketing agency and I tell them, why did you let this happen? Their answer is always the same. They were oblivious. So, here are a few of my tips that everyone should use if they think their marketing agency is not doing their job.\n\n1. The \"Platform Trap\"Google and Meta are designed to make you spend. Their \"Auto-Apply\" recommendations are often biased toward their revenue, not your ROI. A great agency acts as a filter, knowing when to lean into the machine and when to take back the wheel\n\n.2. Creative is the New Targeting-As privacy laws and \"cookie-less\" tracking have leveled the playing field, your creative is what does the heavy lifting. If your agency isn't using data-backed storytelling, they’re just guessing.\n\n3. The Shift to \"Agentic\" Execution-The best agencies have stopped doing manual, repetitive \"button-clicking.\" They are now leveraging autonomous AI tools to handle the grunt work. By integrating stacks like Blobr AI or Ryze AI, agencies can run 24/7 audits and creative swaps that a human simply can’t keep up with.\n\nNext time, ask the important questions. It pains me to see us marketing agencies get a horrible reputation just because of a few sour apples.",

Often companies deal directly with a project manager but equally important to get feedback from the staff who manage your campaign on a day to day basis. \n\nSet realistic goals from both sides. Often companies want x amount of closes in 3 months but their sales cycle takes 4 months. Then they get frustrated, say it doesn't work and try another agency or strategy with the same result. \n\nAsk agencies for help. If they request something to be completed that impacts their sales but not getting done, ask the agency to do it or take the lead. If it's not a huge project and effects the results they will often just get it done. Otherwise the same conversation takes place every week and becomes a negative point.",

The client says they want to move forward. And then… nothing. No PO. No urgency. No decision. Even though they came to us with the problem and clearly need what we offer.\n\nIt feels like deals stall not because of objections, but because the buyer just isn’t prioritizing the decision. I’ve tried following up, checking timelines, and even hinting at things like pricing changes or limited availability, but I don’t want to rely on fake urgency or pressure tactics that damage trust.\n\nOne recent example really sums it up. Client wanted to move ahead during the summer. Quote delivered. Follow-ups done. They started debating sourcing some equipment themselves to lower cost, then went quiet. When we finally met again, the answer was that the budget for this year was gone and the project got pushed to next year. No hard “no,” just drift.\n\nI’m realizing I’m not losing these deals to competitors. I’m losing them to indecision and lack of momentum.\n\nI’m starting to think the issue isn’t the pitch or the pricing, but how I’m guiding the buyer once they say yes in principle. I’ve seen some teams use tools like Trumpet to keep everything in one place. Quote, scope, timelines, next steps, and decision checkpoints all visible so the buyer doesn’t mentally reset after every conversation.\n\nFor those of you in higher-end B2B sales, how do you handle this stage?  \n How do you create real urgency without pressure?  \n How do you help buyers actually commit when they agree but don’t act?\n\nAny practical tactics, frameworks, or lessons learned would be hugely appreciated.\n\n",

Personally, I realized I couldn’t do it all alone, no time and not enough knowledge back then, and my audience was mostly good on LinkedIn so I hired a team to handle outreach and lead generation for me so it freed me up to focus on strategy and execution, and it worked really well, which i assume would work too as soon as u figure out where your ICP tends to be the most",

For finding actual clients to pitch, I'd focus on warm outreach first - hit up former colleagues, people you've worked with at agencies or past companies, and LinkedIn connections in your niche. Most freelancers I know get their first few clients from their existing network before needing to do any cold outreach.\n\n\nWhen you do need to expand beyond warm leads, I came across SMB Sales Boost recently and it looks like a solid option for building prospect lists. It's basically a database of newly registered businesses, so you can find companies that might need demand gen help before they're already locked into other vendors. Seems especially useful for your niche since new SMBs are usually activley looking for help with paid ads and lead gen.\n\n\nAlso worth setting up a simple case study page showing specific results from your previous roles (even anonymized ones). Metrics like CPA improvements or pipeline growth make a huge differece when pitching.",

I spent the last 2 weeks running a split-test on Reddit outreach for my SaaS.\n\nThe Stats:\n\n* Duration: 15 Days\n* Volume: \\~100+ DMs sent (highly targeted)\n* Replies: 43 (>65% Reply Rate)\n* Booked Calls: 7\n\nThe \"Old\" Way (That failed): Finding a user, sending a generic \"Hey, I saw you like marketing. I have a tool...\" Result: Ghosted.\n\nThe \"New\" Way (The Secret): I realized that Redditors post because they want validation or help. They don't want to be sold to. So I stopped selling.\n\nThe Strategy Breakdown:\n\n**1. Context is King (The Search)** \n\nYou cannot DM random people. You need people who are active right now and talking about your specific problem.\n\nI stopped manually browsing. It's a waste of life.\n\nI set up monitors using SleepLeads (filters out the noise nicely and sends dms for me)\n\nI tracked keywords like: \"struggling with X\", \"alternative to Y\", \"how do I Z\".\n\nThe moment someone posted, I got a ping.\n\n**2. The \"Ego-First\" DM** \n\nI did not pitch my tool. I pitched their post back to them.\n\n* Script Structure: \"Saw your post about \\[X\\]. Totally agree with your point on \\[Y\\]. I actually tried \\[Z\\] and it worked. Curious how you're handling \\[A\\]?\"\n* Why it works: It positions me as a peer/expert, not a salesman. It strokes their ego (\"You agree with me? I like you.\").\n\n**3. The Pivot** \n\nOnce they reply (and they usually do, within a few mins), then we start a conversation. \"Yeah, manual tracking is a pain. I actually built a specific tool to automate that part if you want to test it out?\" Reply: \"Sure, link?\"\n\nTakeaway: You can't automate the human connection, but you absolutely should automate the finding part. Stop scrolling. Start listening. Pitch the problem, not the product.\n\nTL;DR: Be human. Validate their post first. Use tools to find high-intent posts instantly.\n\n",

Once they've replied and shown interest, a 30-second personalised video explaining the tool (showing your face, maybe a quick screen recording) converts way better than another text message with a link. It keeps that human connection going rather than suddenly switching to \"here's my product page.\"  \n  \nWe saw our demo booking rate jump from around 15% to 40% just by swapping out text for video at that exact pivot point you mentioned. Plus it filters out tyre kickers since only genuinely interested people will watch.  \n  \nThe monitoring approach you described sounds solid. How are you qualifying which posts are actually worth engaging with beyond just keyword matches?",

      "text": "Started this project back in May 2025 when our CEO asked me to explore video content without putting anyone from the team on camera. We're a 12 person company selling workflow automation software to mid market operations teams, and nobody wanted to be the face of the brand. Fair enough.\n\nThe goal was simple: create educational content about operations workflows, process documentation, and automation best practices. Target audience is ops managers and directors at companies doing $10M to $50M revenue. We figured YouTube could be a long term play for inbound since our blog was already ranking decently.\n\nMonth 1 and 2 were rough. I tried the classic stock footage plus voiceover approach. Hired a freelancer on Upwork for $400 per video to edit together B roll with our scripts. The videos looked... fine? But retention was terrible. Average view duration was under 40 seconds on 6 minute videos. Comments were mostly spam bots.\n\nThe problem was obvious in hindsight. B2B buyers want to see a person. They want to feel like someone is teaching them, not watching a corporate explainer with generic office footage. But again, nobody on our team wanted to be on camera, and hiring a spokesperson felt weird for a small company.\n\nMonth 3 I started experimenting with AI generated presenters. Tested a bunch of tools over about 6 weeks. Synthesia was the first one I tried since they're the most well known. Quality was decent but the pricing didn't work for us at our volume, and the avatar movements felt a bit stiff for longer educational content. Tried HeyGen next which had better pricing tiers but I ran into some consistency issues when I needed the same presenter across multiple videos with different outfits and backgrounds. Also looked at D-ID and Colossyan. Each had tradeoffs.\n\nEventually landed on a workflow using APOB for generating the presenter visuals and combining that with ElevenLabs for voice. Took me a solid week to figure out the lighting settings though because the default outputs kept looking overexposed when I tried to match our brand's cooler color palette. Had to regenerate a bunch of images before I got the hang of it. The key thing that worked for our use case was being able to maintain the same face across dozens of videos while changing everything else. Our fictional presenter Sarah now has appeared in 34 videos wearing different outfits in different virtual office settings, and she looks like the same person in all of them. That consistency matters more than I initially thought because returning viewers actually recognize her now.\n\nMonth 4 through 6 was pure iteration. We posted twice a week, tested different video lengths, thumbnails, titles. What actually moved the needle:\n\nSwitching from 6 to 8 minute videos down to 3 to 4 minute focused tutorials. Retention jumped from 38% to 52% average.\n\nAdding chapters and timestamps. Sounds basic but our audience skips around a lot.\n\nMaking thumbnails that show Sarah's face plus a specific problem statement. CTR went from 2.1% to 4.8% on average.\n\nPosting at 7am EST Tuesday and Thursday. Our audience is US operations managers who apparently watch YouTube before their morning meetings.\n\nMonth 7 and 8 is where things got interesting. We hit 2,400 subscribers which isn't huge but the quality of those subscribers matters more. Started getting comments from actual ops managers asking specific questions. More importantly, we can now trace 11 demo requests directly to YouTube in our attribution. We use HubSpot with UTM tracking on all our video description links, plus we added a \"how did you hear about us\" field to our demo form. 8 of those 11 explicitly mentioned YouTube or referenced specific video topics. The other 3 came through tracked links. At our ACV of $18k, if even half of those convert at our typical 35% demo to close rate, we're looking at around $70k in actual revenue from this channel. The $198k pipeline number is all 11 at full ACV which is optimistic but that's how we report it internally.\n\nTotal cost breakdown for the 8 months:\n\nAI tools and subscriptions: roughly $2,100\n\nElevenLabs voice generation: $660\n\nVideo editing software and stock music: $340\n\nFreelancer for thumbnail design: $850\n\nMy time: approximately 6 hours per week which I'm not counting since this was part of my role anyway\n\nSo under $4k in hard costs. Compare that to what a video production agency quoted us initially which was $3,500 per video. We would have spent $119k on 34 videos.\n\nThe weird part is that I don't think anyone watching knows or cares that Sarah isn't real. We've never tried to hide it but we've also never announced it. One commenter asked if she was AI generated and I just replied honestly. Nobody seemed to care, the conversation moved on to the actual content topic.\n\nBiggest lessons from this whole thing:\n\nConsistency of the presenter matters way more than I expected. Random stock footage people in every video kills any sense of relationship with the audience.\n\nB2B audiences on YouTube are more forgiving of production quality than I assumed. They care about the information being useful, not cinematic lighting.\n\nThe compounding effect is real but slow. Month 1 through 4 felt like shouting into the void. Month 5 onward the algorithm started actually pushing our content.\n\nHaving a face, even a synthetic one, makes a massive difference versus pure screen recordings or stock footage compilations.\n\nStill early days and I have no idea if this scales to 10k or 50k subscribers. But for now it's working as a supplement to our other demand gen efforts.",

So it’s imperative that you have a good strategy first and a mechanism to test if your strategy could work. In terms of leads, it’s the responsibility of the sales teams to ensure that they are converting the right prospects from your ICP. Marketing should typically focus on making sure that your prospects are not only knowledgable about your product but can also flag when there is an interest. Effectively, both sales and marketing need to be two sides of a strategy to convert a lead to a buying customer.\n\nI read somewhere in this thread that paid is the only way to generate leads, and I disagree with that. There are far too many factors to consider before you jump in with a paid strategy.\n\nI also see a lot of good advice in here about who your lead is and why they should care about what you have to offer. This is good advice because it helps you understand at what point in your funnel your prospects are willing to learn more and share their email with you. This is what should drive your overall strategy to help nurture, engage with more focused content or actually move towards a demo. Please remember, LinkedIn is not the only place where you can reach your ICP. Meaning you need a multi channel strategy that is based on data to show where your prospects are engaging with your content at the least possible price, with meaningful content.\n\nI help clients with B2B strategy and I have this conversation every single day, and I dont get bored. And the truth is, just because the strategy worked with someone else doesn’t mean it will work for you as well. Your product and your services are different from the others and require focussed attention to the funnel strategy.\n\nNo easy way out!",

We were reaching out to anyone matching our ICP criteria, but not considering whether they actually needed our solution right now.  \n  \nWhat changed things for us was focusing on intent signals rather than just demographic fit. We started tracking things like job postings (if they're hiring for a role our product helps), funding announcements, tech stack changes, and LinkedIn activity showing they're researching problems we solve.  \n  \nThen we switched from generic outreach to personalised video messages. Instead of a templated email, I'd record a 30-second video referencing something specific about their company and explaining why I thought we could help. Response rates jumped from about 3% to over 20%.  \n  \nThe quality improved massively because we were catching people at the right moment, and the video format meant they could see we'd actually done our homework rather than just adding them to a spray-and-pray list.  \n  \nWhat signals are you currently using to qualify leads before reaching out?",

B2b buyers are researching for weeks or months before they even fill out a form, they want substance not entertainment.\n\nI tested probably 30 different creative concepts in the first 3 months and the patterns were surprising. The polished, professional looking ads that would've flopped in dtc actually perform best. The decision makers don't want messy ugc style content, they want to feel like they're dealing with a legitimate company.\n\nAlso the messaging has to be way more specific, can't just say we help you grow or we make things easier. The need to call out the exact problem they're dealing with and show you understand their world. Generic value props get ignored immediately.\n\nThe creative that works best for us now is case study focused. Showing real results from real companies in their vertical, with actual data not just testimonials. It takes way longer to produce because you need to work with customers to get permission and pull the numbers but the performance makes it worth it.\n\nStill figuring this out but the learning curve has been steep.",

I feel like I have not figured out the correct marketing tactic yet, since I do not have much experience in marketing.\n\nThe business is focussed on digitisation and automation of tasks for businesses in europe, mainly focussing on reducing redundant use of AI, as a lot of things can be automated without or with less AI.\n\nMy current idea for the marketing would be to scan Google Maps for potential clients (using queries with certain niches/industries and cities, so it will not be a general scrape but location and industry specific), to then cold email with personalized messages based on the available data (industry/niche, location, size, etc) with potential solutions and how I could help them set it up.\n\nI feel like this is not yet enough, and I would like to start looking into other options like Reddit or LinkedIn. How would you tackle this process?",

LinkedIn and Reddit can be excellent for additional research and warmth-building before direct outreach.

You can also A/B test your subject lines and email copy to find what resonates. This way, you can focus on relevant conversations rather than chasing random leads.\n\nCurious how are you planning to manage the balance between personalization and automation in your outreach?",

      "text": "Look, I need to vent about something that nearly killed our outbound program last year. Everyone in B2B keeps saying it's a numbers game and just scale your lists. I bought into that completely and it almost got our entire domain infrastructure blacklisted.\n\nWe were working with the usual suspects for data. Apollo, ZoomInfo, the works. Paying premium rates for those verified badges next to every contact. Our dashboards looked immaculate. Bounce rates under 2%, deliverability scores in the high 90s, everything tracking green. We scaled up to about 18,000 to 20,000 touchpoints monthly across our sequences. I was genuinely expecting our pipeline to finally match the effort we were putting in.\n\nInstead we flatlined at a 0.4% reply rate. And most of those replies were variants of unsubscribe or how did you get my info. Our AE team was getting maybe two qualified conversations per week from thousands of sends. I spent entire evenings convinced it was a messaging problem. Rewrote subject lines, tested different value props, even brought in a contractor to rebuild our sequences from scratch. Nothing moved.\n\nThe wake up call came when I started manually checking who was actually opening our emails. Turns out a huge chunk of our verified contacts were people who'd left their companies four to six months ago, or whose email accounts were just auto forwarding to a black hole. The mailboxes existed so they passed the basic validation checks, but there was no human on the other end. We were burning sender reputation on what were essentially abandoned accounts.\n\nI finally admitted we needed to stop throwing volume at the problem and completely rethink our data hygiene approach. The issue wasn't our copy or our offer. It was that we were optimizing for the wrong metric. Deliverability doesn't mean anything if the recipient hasn't logged in since Q2 of last year.\n\nSo we shifted the entire workflow. Instead of just verifying that an email exists we started screening for actual activity signals. Things like mobile number status, recent job changes, social engagement patterns. We moved to a batch filtering process using TNTwuyou before any contacts even touched our CRM. The goal was to prioritize signal over scale.\n\nA few things became obvious pretty fast. First, phone number validation turned out to be a surprisingly strong proxy for active engagement. If someone's mobile line is dead or disconnected their email's probably not much better. Second, recency matters more than anything else. A contact that was valid three months ago is often worthless today in fast moving industries. Third, this approach adds friction to your workflow and your team will push back on smaller lists. You have to be willing to defend lower volume if it means higher quality.\n\nOnce we started filtering out the noise our effective reply rates climbed back up to the 5% to 7% range. We're running at maybe 20% of our previous monthly volume but our AEs are actually having real conversations again instead of just logging rejection after rejection. Using the TNTwuyou Data Filtering and Validation Tool as a pre outreach gate basically saved us from getting our domains torched.\n\nThat said, this level of filtering probably isn't worth the operational overhead if you're selling low ticket transactional stuff where volume really is the only lever. It makes sense for us because we're in high ticket enterprise sales where every bad touch costs us credibility we can't afford to lose.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has completely abandoned the big database model lately. Or are we just in a particularly stale vertical where contact decay happens faster than usual.",

Instead of cold emailing straight away, I'd check if they had a LinkedIn presence or recent Google review I could reference.

YouTube takes ages to build momentum and the ROI is tough to track early on.  \n  \nReddit worked surprisingly well for us because you can answer real questions in communities like this one, r/sales, r/startups. The key is being genuinely helpful without pitching. I spent 30 mins a day for 3 months just sharing what actually worked in outreach, and it brought in about 8-10 qualified leads that turned into customers.  \n  \nYouTube is great long term but needs serious commitment. You're looking at 6-12 months before meaningful traction unless you're already comfortable on camera and have a content system sorted.  \n  \nAnother thing to consider is partnering with complementary agencies (like email deliverability consultants or data providers). We got a decent chunk of referrals that way because you're reaching people who already need what you offer.  \n  \nWhat's your average deal size? That'll probably determine whether YouTube's effort is worth it vs more direct channels.",

No self promotion at all, so make sure you talk about your services the exact same way across platforms. AI’s look for contextual relationships between your services/products/pricing/case studies, etc. and consistent canonical phrasing.

          "text": "Congrats on trusting your gut! You just discovered what a lot of B2B SaaS founders learn the hard way: GTM advice is rarely one-size-fits-all.\n\n\n\nThe \"free plans don't work for B2B\" advice comes from traditional sales-led SaaS thinking. But if your product has a quick time-to-value and doesn't need heavy hand-holding, a free tier can be your best sales tool.\n\n\n\nHere's what makes free plans work:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Lower friction = faster feedback loop\\*\\*. You went from 3 months of slow growth to your best signup month. That's not just numbers—that's real people testing your product and giving you signal on what works.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Product-qualified leads beat cold leads\\*\\*. Someone who's used your product for free and hit a limit is 10x easier to convert than a cold prospect. They already understand the value.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Free users become your product team\\*\\*. The feedback you're getting now is worth way more than the revenue you might've gotten from forcing everyone into trials.\n\n\n\nThe key now is tracking activation metrics—what % of free users actually complete a meaningful action in their first session? That'll tell you if your onboarding needs work or if you're on the right track.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, set up automated nudges when free users approach limits (like \"You've tracked 80 of your 100 free documents—upgrade to unlimited?\"). That's where free-to-paid conversion happens.\n\n\n\nWhat's your conversion goal for free → paid? Even 2-3% is solid for early stage.",
