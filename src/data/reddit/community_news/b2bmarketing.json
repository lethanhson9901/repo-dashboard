      "text": "Hey everyone, I've spent the last few years running Reddit campaigns for clients across different industries, and I keep seeing the same mistakes over and over. Most brands either treat Reddit like Twitter (big mistake) or ignore it completely because they think it's just memes and arguments.\n\nHere's what actually drives results:\n\n**1. Reddit SEO is Evergreen (and Most People Are Sleeping on It)**\n\nUnlike every other social platform where your post dies in 24 hours, Reddit content lives forever and keeps bringing traffic.\n\nReddit posts rank insanely well on Google. A huge chunk of Reddit threads land in the top 5 search results, especially for product searches and review queries.\n\nTraffic compounds over time. A well-placed post from 6 months ago can still drive clicks daily if you targeted the right keywords.\n\nBoth broad and hyper-specific keywords work. The key is knowing which subreddits your audience actually hangs out in.\n\nHow to find opportunities:\n\nUse Ahrefs Keyword Explorer to find high-volume keywords that are trending up\n\nLook at your competitors' blog posts that rank well—then create Reddit discussions around similar topics with broader angles and similar keywords\n\nYour Reddit post will often rank right next to (or above) those blog posts if you do it right\n\n**2. Brand Protection on Reddit Isn't Optional Anymore**\n\nHere's something that caught a lot of companies off guard: ChatGPT and other AI tools now pull from Reddit threads to answer questions about products and companies.\n\nYour potential customers are asking AI \"what do people think about \\[your company\\]?\" and getting answers based on Reddit discussions\n\nSome competitors have figured this out and actively use Reddit to trash-talk other brands\n\nIf you're selling high-ticket products/services, your buyers are 100% reading Reddit threads about you during their research\n\nThe shift is real: Reddit used to be niche, but it's becoming more mainstream. More people = more conversations about brands = bigger impact on your reputation.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nUse F5Bot (free tool) to monitor mentions of your brand name across Reddit\n\nSet up alerts so you know when people are talking about you\n\nJump into conversations early before narratives form without your input\n\n**3. Reddit Cold DMs Can Work (But You Need to Be Smart About It)**\n\nCold outreach on Reddit works way better than most people think, but only if you're not spammy about it.\n\nRedditors can smell a sales pitch from a mile away. Your DM needs to be genuinely relevant to something they posted or commented on. Generic templates get you blocked immediately.\n\nThe Real Strategy: LM SEO + Brand Protection + Genuine Engagement\n\nMost successful Reddit strategies focus on three things:\n\nLM SEO and evergreen traffic - Creating content that ranks and drives visitors for months/years\n\nBrand reputation management - Monitoring and participating in discussions about your company\n\nBuilding actual relationships - Engaging authentically in relevant communities over time\n\nReddit isn't a growth hack. It's not about going viral or getting instant conversions. It's about long-term positioning and making sure you're part of the conversation when people research your space.\n\nThe brands winning on Reddit right now aren't the ones running ads or posting promotional content. They're the ones consistently showing up, providing value, and building trust over time.\n\nYour audience is already on Reddit talking about your industry. The only question is whether you're there too.",

Cold DMs are where I get nervous, most of the fallout lands in the inbox when people feel creeped out or misled.

The point about ai tools pulling from threads is something most founders completely miss until they see a hallucination or a bad review cited in a chat response. It is also worth noting that if you are pulling leads from these discussions to move them into an email sequence you have to be careful with deliverability. Using tools like emailverfier is a must because reddit users often use burner emails or old accounts that will bounce and kill your sender reputation. Authenticity is definitely the only way to survive here without getting banned by a mod on a power trip.",

One thing I'd add is that the companies that succeed, I feel like a lot of times they separate their identity from the company agenda. I think it's really important to build a persona that doesn't just feel like it's pushing something right down your throat. I think the ones that build karma by being helpful before their brand is mentioned is way more credible when they do jump in. I'm curious how you've seen teams handle internal buy-in on this.

Every time you post a response to someone looking for help or guidance (considering you actually provide help), you are demonstrating experience + expertise not only to the person who posted, but to anyone else who reads your comment.\n\n4) Reddit posts and comments will exist on the internet for as long as Reddit lives. So, even if your posts get ignored today, it might go viral tomorrow (or in a few years).\n\nOther marketers on Reddit, what am I missing?",

          "text": "The division-level targeting problem is real and it's why generic enterprise outreach has such abysmal response rates. The \"increase efficiency\" messaging gets deleted because it could apply to literally anyone and signals zero understanding of their specific situation.\n\nThe practical approach without dedicated research teams:\n\nBuild division-specific messaging templates once, then customize lightly per account. You probably have 5-7 common divisions you sell into. Create the core value prop and pain point messaging for each division type, then add account-specific context when you reach out. The manufacturing value prop stays mostly consistent across manufacturers, you're just adding details about their specific situation.\n\nThe account research that matters takes 15-20 minutes, not hours. LinkedIn for org structure and recent hires, earnings calls and 10-Ks for strategic priorities, news for recent initiatives or pain points. Our clients doing enterprise outreach usually find that one relevant detail about their specific situation beats pages of generic research.\n\nThe multi-threading approach works better than going deep on one division initially. Light touches across multiple divisions in the same account surface where actual budget and urgency exists. The division you thought was the entry point often isn't.\n\nThe signal-based prioritization helps focus effort. Look for divisions that just hired for roles related to your solution, ones posting jobs that suggest relevant projects, and executives engaging with content about problems you solve. Those signals indicate where actual budget and urgency exist, making deeper research worthwhile.",

The 20-page comprehensive guide is dead. A 5-page document focused on one specific problem with clear takeaways and data performs better. Our clients still using gated content usually find that anything over 8 pages tanks completion rates.\n\nThe alternative formats getting better engagement right now: interactive assessments where the \"white paper\" is actually a personalized output based on their answers, short video breakdowns of the same content, and ungated versions with a CTA to talk to sales rather than hiding everything behind a form.\n\nThe honest question is what you're trying to achieve. If it's lead capture, the download-and-forget problem matters less because you have their contact info for nurture sequences. If it's actual education and trust-building, the format needs to change because nobody's reading 15 pages of PDF on their phone.\n\nSome companies are abandoning gated content entirely and using white paper material as SEO-focused blog content instead.

Tools that try to be “one-click ads” usually fall apart once you need real testing.\n\nI use AI mostly to speed up inputs, not to replace the whole process. After visuals are ready, I usually pull everything into Flixier to cut multiple hook versions, resize for placements, add captions, or do quick voiceovers. That part matters more than the generation step when you’re batching and testing.\n\nFor B2B especially, content that looks slightly imperfect and native tends to win.

B2B buyers do way more research before ever identifying themselves, and privacy changes mean less tracking works than it used to. That said, \"most visitors never convert\" on paid traffic usually signals something fixable rather than just market behavior.\n\nThe diagnostic questions that matter: what's your landing page conversion rate? If you're below 2-3% on targeted B2B traffic, the page is probably the problem, not the ads. What happens after the click? Are people bouncing immediately or spending time and leaving without converting? Those are different problems.\n\nThe engagement-without-conversion pattern usually means one of a few things: the offer isn't compelling enough to justify giving up contact info, there's a mismatch between ad promise and landing page delivery, or the form is asking for too much too early. Our clients seeing this gap often fix it by lowering the commitment ask. \"Get a demo\" converts worse than \"see how it works\" which converts worse than ungated value.\n\nThe intent tools like Clearbit Reveal, RB2B, or Leadfeeder can identify some percentage of anonymous company-level traffic. Won't catch everyone but helps you see if the right companies are visiting even when individuals don't convert.\n\nThe LinkedIn versus Google comparison matters too. LinkedIn traffic is expensive but should be highly targeted. If that traffic isn't converting, your landing page or offer is almost certainly the issue. Google traffic might just be less qualified depending on keywords.",

High-intent stuff like demo requests stays fully manual. Cold LinkedIn outreach? That’s where automation actually saves you without killing quality.\n\nIf you're doing any linkedin prospecting, tools like HeyReach or Expandi can handle the volume side safely. HeyReach is nice because it lets you run multiple accounts without the constant ban paranoia, which is clutch when you're scaling. You can push serious volume across profiles, like 1000+ touches per week, but it's distributed so nothing looks spammy.\n\nThe trick is using it to open doors, not close them. Any reply or engagement gets flagged, then a real person jumps in with full context. Automation handles the grunt work, humans handle the trust building. That handoff is where most teams win or lose.\n\nAre you mostly inbound or is outbound part of the strategy too?",

If you're getting volume but zero revenue, it usually means your funnel isn't a funnel: it’s just a bunch of random touchpoints that don't actually talk to each other.\n​The breakdown usually happens because the \"vibe\" shifts. You lure them in with a cool ad, but then the landing page feels generic, and the follow-up emails feel like they were written by a robot from 2005. People drop off the second they feel a \"dead end\" or get confused about what they’re supposed to do next.\n​I used to have this exact problem until I stopped thinking about individual ads and started thinking about the whole flow. Personally, I've been leveraging the RIO integrated marketing campaign framework for a bit now and it completely changed my way of doing marketing. It makes sure everything is actually connected so you aren't just wasting cash on clicks.\n\n​Here is how I’d fix it:\n​First, you gotta Rally your message. If your top-of-funnel is promising a specific solution, your middle-of-funnel better be doubling down on that same \"messaging house.\" If there’s a gap between what they signed up for and what you’re selling, they’ll bounce every time.\n​Then, you have to Integrate the journey. This is where most funnels leak. You need to map it out so there are zero dead ends. If they download a PDF, the very next email should be a logical \"part two\" of that conversation. If they visit your pricing page but don't buy, your retargeting ads should hit them with a case study. It’s all about connecting the pipes so they can’t fall out.\n​Finally, you Orchestrate the timing. Conversion is a slow burn. You can't just scream \"buy now\" the second they give you an email. You gotta time your touches—educational stuff first to build trust, then some social proof, then the hard offer.\n\n​When you actually integrate your channels like this, the conversion part feels way more natural. You're not \"selling\" as much as you are just guiding them to the next step.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been trying to attain my first client for an agency I launched a few months ago.\n\nI opened up an email marketing agency for eCommerce brands, reason being is that I've worked on emails for brands for the better part of the last 6 years ( email attributed revenue coming to a total of $10+M ). The firm I worked for essentially had a portfolio of their own brands, and I started out as a person managing just one brand account, then moved upwards to managing 15-20 accounts on a day to day basis, the firm got bought out to a private equity firm so many of us were left out of our jobs.\n\nI hated the feeling that that happened, so I decided to start fresh and on my own, because I do not want to rely on just the job.\n\nThe problems that arose from me starting a few months back is that :\n\nA) Cold emails/dm's (not automated) barely get any positive replies, most of them are rejections ( but rejections with additions such as \" i get pitched for emails/sms a dozen times a day \" type replies\nB) Looking at Klaviyo's directory of agencies there's at least 1,400 other agencies selling the same service to ecommerce brands\nC) Looking at Fiverr/UpWork there's also tons of freelancers offering email marketing for ecommerce brands\n\nThe reason why I say this is, not because I want to quit, because I do not want to do that, I have very large ambitions for what I want to achieve with this business, but I do not see a way to even get 1 paying client on a retainer.\n\nIt just feels like the niche is so crowded with us \"email agencies/guys/girls\".\n\nLike, in my mind, when I think of this, since it's crowded, it means there's demand for the service, similar to how there's many dentists/spa's/gym's/whatever's in every city and all make money if you know what I mean.\n\nBut yeah, all in all, I'd love to hear some comments from people who might've been in the same boat or know how to overcome this.\n\nAppreciate you for reading, thanks.\n\n",

It tells you the problem isn't that brands don't want email help, it's that your outreach looks identical to everyone else's. You're getting filtered before they even evaluate your experience.\n\nThe $10M in attributed revenue across 15-20 accounts is legitimately impressive but that story isn't landing in cold outreach because every agency claims big numbers. Our clients who broke through saturated markets did it by being specific in ways competitors aren't. \"Email marketing for ecommerce\" competes with 1,400 agencies. \"Email marketing for supplement brands doing $2-5M\" competes with maybe a dozen.\n\nThe vertical specialization path works because you can speak directly to their problems, reference relevant results, and position yourself as the obvious expert for their specific situation. Pick a category where you have case studies from your previous work and own that corner.\n\nThe cold outreach channel might just be wrong for this moment. When founders are drowning in identical pitches, the agencies winning are doing it through referrals, partnerships with Shopify agencies or designers who don't do email, and content that demonstrates expertise.\n\nYour former colleagues and the brands you worked with before are probably the fastest path to your first clients. Reaching out to warm contacts about referrals typically unsticks things faster than optimizing cold emails that are fighting an uphill battle.",

Not scalable but currently the most accurate method.\n\nThe tools claiming to track AI mentions are mostly overselling their capabilities.

If AI discovery is happening, some percentage will search your brand name afterward or mention \"ChatGPT recommended you\" when asked.\n\nThe optimization side might matter more than the measurement side right now.

They want to hear what people inside it actually believe, experience, and stand behind.\n\nSo when marketing “lives” in one team:\n\n\t•\tThe CEO becomes a broadcaster instead of a leader\n\t•\tEmployees become spectators instead of advocates\n\t•\tCulture stays trapped internally instead of compounding externally\n\nThe companies that win in the next cycle move marketing from a department to a behaviour.\n\nIn that model, the marketing team’s real job is not to own the voice, but to:\n\n\t•\tcreate clarity\n\t•\tset the narrative\n\t•\tenable others to speak confidently and safely\n\nNot control the message - orchestrate it.\n\nThat’s the shift I see as a priority for CMOs in 2026. Many organisations feel it’s true, even if they haven’t named it yet.\n\nFor those who’ve tried to make this cultural shift:\nWhat has actually worked (or failed) when getting leadership and teams to adopt this way of operating?\n",

I know enough about lead gen to fake it in a pitch but we can't really activate well against it.\n\nOur primary model with bigger clients is to work with partner agencies in order to leverage scale when possible.  We have a proven partner for the brand space.  We need one for demand/lead gen.  Right now we are relying on a (somewhat flakey) freelancer to run our Google Ads accounts.  I run LinkedIn and other socials with the one junior on my team.\n\nI'm looking for either an agency or a rock solid freelancer that we can white label and bring on when necessary.  Definitely need to see some solid DG/LG case studies in addition to standard creds. We've lost pitches because we don't have this capability.\n\nFor case studies, I'm not sure exactly what we're looking for but maybe something that talks about lead quality (% that converted to SALs for example) or direct ties to closed /won $$$.\n\nI've been challenged by our CEO to come up with a short list of agencies to RFP.  Trying to Google this topic is a hellscape so I figured I'd start here.  Feel free to comment or hit my Reddit DMs.\n\nedit:\nSomeone sent me DM about cold emails and I fat fingered it and hit \"ignore\". Apologies for that.

          "text": "The white-label demand gen partner search is tricky because the agencies good enough to produce SAL conversion data and closed-won attribution usually have their own client roster and aren't hungry for white-label arrangements. The ones actively seeking white-label work are often the B-tier players who couldn't build their own book.\n\nThe exception is smaller shops or senior freelancers who prefer the referral model over business development. They exist but they're not advertising \"white label demand gen\" because their pipeline comes from relationships exactly like what you're describing.\n\nThe case study red flags to watch for: agencies showing MQL volume without downstream metrics are hiding poor lead quality. Anyone who can't speak to sales feedback loops or lead-to-opportunity conversion probably isn't measuring what matters. Our clients evaluating demand gen partners usually find that the willingness to discuss what didn't work is more telling than polished success stories.\n\nThe RFP criteria worth emphasizing: ask specifically about their process for feedback loops with sales teams, how they define and measure lead quality beyond form fills, and what their approach is when a campaign produces volume but sales says the leads are garbage. The good partners have answers because they've navigated this tension before.\n\nThe sourcing approach since Google is useless: LinkedIn posts from demand gen practitioners you respect, asking peers at non-competing agencies who they've partnered with, and honestly the HubSpot and 6sense partner directories sometimes surface capable smaller shops.\n\nThe freelancer versus agency question: a senior freelancer with 10+ years of B2B demand gen experience might outperform a mid-tier agency and be more flexible on white-label terms.",

I’ve had better luck with small shops like Animalz or Draft.dev than big agencies, plus vetted freelancers via Superpath or MarketerHire. \n\nWhatever you choose, run a 4–6 week pilot with clear goals: 3–5 bottom-of-funnel pieces (tutorials, benchmarks, integration guides) tied to signup or demo metrics, not just traffic. Also, tools like Ahrefs, Clearscope, and Pulse alongside something like Hootsuite can help you find real questions devs are asking and plug your content into those conversations on Reddit and elsewhere.",

I've heard good things about Brandlight for this kind of work, they seem to focus on helping tech companies with content that actually resonates with technical audiences. From what I understand they work with startups on creating the kind of educational content you're talking about, like the tutorials and guides for developers.\n\nMight be worth reaching out to see if they're a good fit for your budget and timeline.",

      "text": "No intro needed, I’ll skip the fluff and go straight to what actually worked for us and for other B2B/SaaS teams I’ve seen do it well:\n\n# 1. Make sure you’re ready\n\nAffiliate programs amplify what’s already working. If you don’t have product–market fit, happy customers, or predictable conversions, affiliates won’t fix that. What they will do is bring you more of what’s already converting.\n\nRule of thumb: wait until you can confidently say, “If I drive 100 visitors to my site, X will become paying customers.”\n\n# 2. Decide on commission structure\n\nThis is where SaaS differs from e-commerce. Most SaaS affiliate programs use recurring commissions, because affiliates love predictable income streams.\n\n* Typical range: 20–30% of subscription revenue\n* Duration: 12–24 months (some even go lifetime if margins allow)\n* Hybrid model: one-time signup bonus + recurring percentage\n\nMake it attractive enough that affiliates feel long-term upside, but sustainable for you.\n\n# 3. Recruit the right affiliates\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is thinking affiliates equal influencers. In SaaS/B2B, the best partners are usually:\n\n* Agencies/consultants serving your ICP\n* Freelancers/contractors who recommend tools daily\n* Community leaders (Slack groups, LinkedIn, Reddit mods)\n* Content creators who write reviews, tutorials, or comparison posts\n\nStart with people who already trust your brand or work with your customers.\n\n# 4. Onboard and activate them\n\nSigning someone up isn’t enough. Affiliates succeed when you make promotion frictionless. That means:\n\n* Clear onboarding (walkthrough of your product and program basics)\n* Access to promo resources (banners, swipe copy, FAQs, case studies)\n* Education (what messaging works best, who your ICP is)\n* A point of contact for questions (affiliates love human support)\n\n# 5. Track properly\n\nNothing kills a program faster than bad tracking. Affiliates need to trust that you’ll track their referrals accurately and pay them fairly.\n\n# 6. Start small and then scale (don't rush!)\n\nStart with a hand-picked group of affiliates. Work closely with them, optimize messaging, fix tracking issues, and learn what converts.\n\nOnce you’ve nailed these, you can scale recruitment with:\n\n* Affiliate directories\n* Outreach campaigns\n* Community partnerships\n* Even running paid ads to “recruit affiliates”\n\nIn a nutshell you need to remember that affiliate marketing in SaaS isn't just about sharing links. It takes time and effort so you need to know this before kicking it off.",

One thing that helped us was treating onboarding like a mini enablement kit (positioning, 2-3 best use cases, and a couple ready-to-share comparison angles) so partners do not default to generic promo.
