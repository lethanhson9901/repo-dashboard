      "text": "Working with clients across B2B, the biggest difference I see between teams that feel calm and teams that feel overwhelmed isn’t budget or tools, it’s focus. The strongest teams are very intentional about where human effort goes. They don’t try to deeply analyze everything. They use systems to handle the background work and save their thinking time for positioning, messaging, and decisions that actually move the needle.\n\nOn a lot of accounts, the messy part isn’t creativity, it’s the in-between work. Research, list cleanup, checking whether accounts are still relevant, keeping data in sync. When that layer is handled cleanly, clients are able to spend more time on strategy instead of maintenance. I’ve seen teams use tools like Clay for research and signals, HubSpot as the source of truth, and Notion to keep plans visible. The exact stack varies, but the mindset stays the same.\n\nThe pattern that keeps showing up is this: the better the focus, the less the team feels the need to overbuild process. They automate the boring parts, stay thoughtful about the rest, and move faster without feeling rushed.",

They ask questions, look for help, and post about their pain points here regularly (sometimes even complain about your competitors) - which is where you come in...\n\n2) Reddit is one of the most cited sources in LLM grounding (when a user asks about a product review or information about a service, 5 or 6 times out of 10, a post from Reddit gets pulled).\n\n3) You increase your brand/business visibility indirectly. Every time you post a response to someone looking for help or guidance (considering you actually provide help), you are demonstrating experience + expertise not only to the person who posted, but to anyone else who reads your comment.\n\n4) Reddit posts and comments will exist on the internet for as long as Reddit lives. So, even if your posts get ignored today, it might go viral tomorrow (or in a few years).\n\nOther marketers on Reddit, what am I missing?",

      "text": "Alright, story time.\n\nPicture this: Jan 2024, me staring at my Meta ads dashboard watching my CPMs go from $45... to $67... to $92... to eventually $180.\n\nMy SaaS was spending about $3k/day profitably. Then boom - overnight my CAC went from $38 to $142. I literally threw up in my mouth a little.\n\n**The \"Oh Shit\" Moment**\n\nI had 6 weeks of runway left\n\nTurned off all ads. Pipeline dropped 89% overnight.\n\nBut then I remembered this random ass comment from a Reddit thread about some guy who scaled to $2M ARR entirely on cold email. Figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nStarted with 3 mailboxes and zero idea what I was doing.\n\n12 weeks later: $107K in closed revenue from cold email alone.\n\nHere's exactly what I did.\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\nI started with 3 domains.\n\nThe math: 3 mailboxes × 33 emails per day = 100 emails/day to start.\n\nNot sexy. Not scalable yet. But it worked\n\nBy week 2, I was at 300 emails/day. Inbox rate? 73%. Not amazing, but not in the spam dungeon either.\n\nThe setup:\n\n* Bought aged domains (6+ months old) from expired domain marketplaces\n* Set up proper DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n* Warmed with Instantly's built-in warmup for 14 days before sending a single cold email\n\n**Week 3-4: The Lead Scraping System That Actually Works**\n\nHere's where I got weird.\n\nEveryone's out here buying Apollo lists and wondering why their emails sound like everyone else's. I said fuck that.\n\nI built custom software (okay fine, I paid a developer on Upwork $800, but I PROJECT MANAGED IT so basically I built it).\n\nThe scraper:\n\n* Pulls company websites from my ICP search\n* Scrapes their actual website copy, tech stack, recent blog posts\n* Hits LinkedIn to grab decision-maker info\n* Feeds it all into a prompt that writes personalized first lines\n\nPeople open emails that feel like you actually visited their website. Wild concept, I know.\n\n**Week 5-8: Scaling to 1,500 Emails/Day Without Losing My Mind**\n\nThis is where it got real.\n\nFrom 300 emails/day to 1,500/day.\n\nThe math: 1,500 emails/day × 21 working days = 31,500 emails per month.\n\nAt a 3% reply rate (industry average is 1%, but personalization is magic), that's 945 replies.\n\nAt a 15% meeting booking rate from replies, that's 141 meetings.\n\nAt a 25% close rate... you see where this is going.\n\nMy CAC went from $142 on Meta to $47 with cold email. And it kept dropping as I optimized.\n\nI shut down Meta ads entirely. Haven't looked back.\n\nNow I run a cold outreach agency helping other B2B companies do the same thing. Turns out when you figure out how to print money, people want to pay you to teach them.\n\n**The Shit No One Tells You**\n\n* Week 1 was fucking BRUTAL. 6% inbox rate because I didn't warm properly\n* I got my first domain blacklisted on day 4\n* Gmail's spam filters updated in week 5 and tanked my inbox rate overnight. Had to pivot my entire sending strategy\n\nAnyone wants my templates/sequences/scraper setup, drop a comment.\n\nI'll put everything together in a Google Doc (might take me a few days, I need to clean up my shamefully disorganized Notion workspace first).\n\nNo courses, no coaching, no bullshit. Just paying it forward because this sub saved my ass multiple times.",

The scoring itself tends to be decent when you feed it enough historical data, but the \"insights\" can be hit or miss.  \n  \nWhat I've found works better is using AI for specific, narrow tasks rather than broad lead scoring. For example, we use it to monitor job changes, funding announcements, and tech stack changes at target accounts. That stuff is factual and easy to verify, so less room for hallucinations.  \n  \nThe call and email analysis features can be useful but you need to spot check them regularly. I'd recommend running any new AI tool in parallel with your current process for at least a month before trusting it fully. Compare the AI recommendations against what your best reps would do manually.  \n  \nThe real danger is when sales teams stop thinking critically because \"the AI said so\". If you do implement it, make sure your reps understand it's a tool to augment their judgement, not replace it.  \n  \nWhich CRMs are you looking at right now?",

High-intent stuff like demo requests stays fully manual. Cold LinkedIn outreach? That’s where automation actually saves you without killing quality.\n\nIf you're doing any linkedin prospecting, tools like HeyReach or Expandi can handle the volume side safely. HeyReach is nice because it lets you run multiple accounts without the constant ban paranoia, which is clutch when you're scaling. You can push serious volume across profiles, like 1000+ touches per week, but it's distributed so nothing looks spammy.\n\nThe trick is using it to open doors, not close them. Any reply or engagement gets flagged, then a real person jumps in with full context. Automation handles the grunt work, humans handle the trust building. That handoff is where most teams win or lose.\n\nAre you mostly inbound or is outbound part of the strategy too?",

          "text": "The \"leads but no sales\" trap is the absolute worst. It’s like throwing a party where everyone shows up for the free drinks but nobody stays for the actual event. If you're getting volume but zero revenue, it usually means your funnel isn't a funnel: it’s just a bunch of random touchpoints that don't actually talk to each other.\n​The breakdown usually happens because the \"vibe\" shifts. You lure them in with a cool ad, but then the landing page feels generic, and the follow-up emails feel like they were written by a robot from 2005. People drop off the second they feel a \"dead end\" or get confused about what they’re supposed to do next.\n​I used to have this exact problem until I stopped thinking about individual ads and started thinking about the whole flow. Personally, I've been leveraging the RIO integrated marketing campaign framework for a bit now and it completely changed my way of doing marketing. It makes sure everything is actually connected so you aren't just wasting cash on clicks.\n\n​Here is how I’d fix it:\n​First, you gotta Rally your message. If your top-of-funnel is promising a specific solution, your middle-of-funnel better be doubling down on that same \"messaging house.\" If there’s a gap between what they signed up for and what you’re selling, they’ll bounce every time.\n​Then, you have to Integrate the journey. This is where most funnels leak. You need to map it out so there are zero dead ends. If they download a PDF, the very next email should be a logical \"part two\" of that conversation. If they visit your pricing page but don't buy, your retargeting ads should hit them with a case study. It’s all about connecting the pipes so they can’t fall out.\n​Finally, you Orchestrate the timing. Conversion is a slow burn. You can't just scream \"buy now\" the second they give you an email. You gotta time your touches—educational stuff first to build trust, then some social proof, then the hard offer.\n\n​When you actually integrate your channels like this, the conversion part feels way more natural. You're not \"selling\" as much as you are just guiding them to the next step.",

One thing I’ve learned is that a funnel that just drives lead volume often misses the deeper connection that moves prospects to convert. It’s crucial to build a clear narrative throughout your funnel that aligns with your positioning and resonates with your target audience’s pain points.\n\nYou want your messaging and website story to guide leads seamlessly toward a decision, supported by sales enablement materials that address objections and reinforce value. Consistent conversions come from treating leads as people, not just numbers, and creating a funnel that builds trust at every touchpoint. If you nail that narrative flow and back it with tailored content, your funnel shifts from volume to quality conversions naturally.",

Now we focus on signals like recent funding, job postings, or tech stack changes.  \n  \nTwo, what happens in that middle bit between lead capture and sales conversation? Most funnels I've seen (including ours initially) had this black hole where leads got generic nurture emails and went cold. We shifted to more direct, personalised outreach early in the funnel rather than waiting for them to be \"marketing qualified.\"  \n  \nThe other thing that helped was shortening the time between interest and human contact.

      "text": "Hi,\n\nover the past six months, I have developed a product that I now want to bring to market. It is a B2B tool designed to preserve operational and project knowledge when an employee leaves the company. Through my network, I already have several companies testing the product and providing feedback. However, my goal is to be successful internationally, as I believe this could be a valuable solution for many organizations. That said, I have read (including in this subreddit) that LinkedIn is increasingly filled with bots, bots that create posts and other bots that comment on them...\n\nGiven this, does it even make sense in 2026 to try to build reach on the platform?\n\nAdditionally, in my situation, what would work better: posting from my personal profile (around 80 followers) or building reach from a brand-new company profile?\n\nThank you in advance for any responses.",

Unfortunately, it's not like that. \n\nMore and more on LInkedin, you've got groups of cliques slapping each others backs and soothing each others egos hanging by the virtual watercooler. For the most part, their main goal seems to be building awareness of their own products and services. And it, just like networking in real-life, it's the same heads all the time. This wears very thin after a while. \n\nThe actual \"do-ers\" on the other don't seem to be continually LinkedIn. They're probably too busy doing the actual work. And, for your IP / data protection tool, these are the people you need to target.\n\nSo, maybe the best route for you here could be using webinars, inbound content or events targeting personas such as CISO / Systems Administrators / IT Managers / Compliance Managers, MSSPs and in-house Data Protection officers.  A cold-outreach strategy should also be considered but bear in mind that cohorts like system administrators and IT manager can be very averse, even hostile, to cold outreach so you might want to keep this strategy limited to other personas mentioned above.",

The people who would actually make this decision, especially founders or CEOs in smaller companies, are likely too busy to spend much time on LinkedIn. On top of that, the product is usually only searched for when the problem becomes urgent. It’s not something most people proactively look for months in advance just because they saw a post or a campaign. That definitely makes it harder to market, especially while the category itself is still relatively unknown.",

Not pitching. \nI probably spend about 30 mins making the content each week - but I have opened some great opportunities with people i wohldnt have without it.\n\nDon't post from the business page if you do it - post from your personal page as you'll get more traction.\n\nUltimately though, if youre looking to scale internationally you'll likely need outside help - but need to be smart about. \n\nFor context, I'm from Ireland and mainly focusing on the US. I've brought in outside help to scale quickly.\n\nAlways happy to share notes and chat so feel free to drop me a message if ya like. Not looking to sell you anything!!",

Personal profiles usually work better early, even with a small following, because they feel real and get engagement faster than empty company pages.

However, only 10% of his network are reading his posts and he has zero leads and business from this activity.\n\n  \nOutreach - that is specifically contacting people on LinkedIn can be very useful. As another poster mentioned, a bit of automation can help. I'm not advocating mass comms, or AI written posts, but sensible use of automation can safely amplify your reach and scale.

I know enough about lead gen to fake it in a pitch but we can't really activate well against it.\n\nOur primary model with bigger clients is to work with partner agencies in order to leverage scale when possible.  We have a proven partner for the brand space.  We need one for demand/lead gen.  Right now we are relying on a (somewhat flakey) freelancer to run our Google Ads accounts.  I run LinkedIn and other socials with the one junior on my team.\n\nI'm looking for either an agency or a rock solid freelancer that we can white label and bring on when necessary.  Definitely need to see some solid DG/LG case studies in addition to standard creds. We've lost pitches because we don't have this capability.\n\nFor case studies, I'm not sure exactly what we're looking for but maybe something that talks about lead quality (% that converted to SALs for example) or direct ties to closed /won $$$.\n\nI've been challenged by our CEO to come up with a short list of agencies to RFP.  Trying to Google this topic is a hellscape so I figured I'd start here.  Feel free to comment or hit my Reddit DMs.\n\nedit:\nSomeone sent me DM about cold emails and I fat fingered it and hit \"ignore\". Apologies for that.

          "text": "The white-label demand gen partner search is tricky because the agencies good enough to produce SAL conversion data and closed-won attribution usually have their own client roster and aren't hungry for white-label arrangements. The ones actively seeking white-label work are often the B-tier players who couldn't build their own book.\n\nThe exception is smaller shops or senior freelancers who prefer the referral model over business development. They exist but they're not advertising \"white label demand gen\" because their pipeline comes from relationships exactly like what you're describing.\n\nThe case study red flags to watch for: agencies showing MQL volume without downstream metrics are hiding poor lead quality. Anyone who can't speak to sales feedback loops or lead-to-opportunity conversion probably isn't measuring what matters. Our clients evaluating demand gen partners usually find that the willingness to discuss what didn't work is more telling than polished success stories.\n\nThe RFP criteria worth emphasizing: ask specifically about their process for feedback loops with sales teams, how they define and measure lead quality beyond form fills, and what their approach is when a campaign produces volume but sales says the leads are garbage. The good partners have answers because they've navigated this tension before.\n\nThe sourcing approach since Google is useless: LinkedIn posts from demand gen practitioners you respect, asking peers at non-competing agencies who they've partnered with, and honestly the HubSpot and 6sense partner directories sometimes surface capable smaller shops.\n\nThe freelancer versus agency question: a senior freelancer with 10+ years of B2B demand gen experience might outperform a mid-tier agency and be more flexible on white-label terms.",

The best fits are usually senior freelancers or small specialist shops who value referrals over branding and are comfortable being invisible.",

The ones doing their own demand gen well are usually better at doing it for others.  \n  \nFor vetting, ask to speak directly with the people who'd actually work on your accounts, not just the sales team. We learned this the hard way after partnering with an agency where the pitch team vanished after signing.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if they have experience with your typical deal sizes and sales cycles. An agency crushing it for SaaS with $5k ACV might struggle with enterprise deals that take 18 months to close.  \n  \nOne thing that worked for us was starting with a small paid test project before committing to a full partnership. Something like running one campaign for 60 days. Tells you loads about their communication style and whether they'll actually hit deadlines.  \n  \nWhat's your typical client deal size and sales cycle length?",

Refreshing. Checking again. Like throwing messages in bottles and never knowing if anyone found them.\n\nAnd honestly? It felt exhausting.\n\nSo I flipped it. Instead of talking, I started listening.\n\nI stopped posting every day and started tracking what my audience was actually talking about. Not on my posts. On theirs. In comment threads. In replies. The stuff they were complaining about, asking about, struggling with.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Finding posts where my ICP was already discussing their problems\n* Engaging in those conversations instead of creating new ones\n* Actually reading what people needed instead of guessing\n* Accepting that silence is okay if you have nothing useful to add\n\nIt's been surprisingly different. Less anxiety about \"does this post perform.\" More real conversations with people who actually need help. More trust built through showing up, not broadcasting.\n\nIf this resonates, maybe try this: spend one day not posting anything. Just find three posts where your audience is talking about something you know. Comment something genuinely helpful. See what happens.\n\nWould love to hear from others here. Does LinkedIn still feel like a place you \"network\" or has it quietly become a place where everyone's just talking at each other?",

Then I learned something incredible from an agency owner: create irresistible value for ICP.\n\nFor example, a newsletter they can’t resist subscribing to, or a profile they can’t resist following.\n\nThe agency owner was targeting eCommerce brands focused solely on creating valuable content for eCommerce businesses.\n\nNothing else.\n\nAs a result, he gained tens of thousands of followers (I don’t remember the exact number).",

      "text": "  \nMeta is working better for B2B services than most people assume. It's cheaper than Linkedin and it’s good at finding your audience once you give it the right inputs.\n\n* For our own agency offer, “we help you book 2–3 calls per week with your ICP,” we’ve booked calls as low as $19 per call\n* For high-ticket B2B service clients (mostly software dev, $50k+ ACV), booked call cost typically lands in the $150–250 range when the system is built correctly\n* We’ve successfully targeted niches that are hard to target via interests, for example Web3 startup founders, where Meta has almost no clean targeting criteria. We still got leads who were clearly building crypto products and startups, because the creative and conversion signals did the work.\n\nThat last point matters. People overestimate targeting and underestimate the creative. Meta is now good at finding the right B2B audience even with broad targeting, if your ads are clearly written for a specific persona and you feed it the right conversion signals.\n\n# The playbook\n\n# 1) Start with persona clarity, not targeting tricks\n\nThe single most important variable is whether the ad speaks to a very specific person.\n\nA real persona in a real context:\n\n* CTO at a scale-up SaaS company\n* Founder of an early-stage startup\n* CIO of a medical clinic network\n* CMO at a services firm\n\nIf the first line doesn’t make that person think “this is exactly my situation,” you’ll get junk leads regardless of your funnel.\n\nWhat we define upfront:\n\n* Persona and buying role\n* Trigger moment (what changed that makes them act now)\n* One expensive pain\n* One credible outcome\n* Proof that you can deliver it\n\n# 2) Services can work directly, but strong offers increase conversions\n\nDirect service ads can work well if they’re persona-specific and credible.\n\nIrresistible offers work because they create a mechanism and set expectations. Examples:\n\n* “Book 2–3 ICP-qualified calls per week”\n* “Cloud cost audit, find 15–25% savings”\n* “Delivery bottleneck scan in 24 hours”\n* “MVP scope and delivery plan”\n\nOne caution: audit/consultation offers attract “pick your brain” leads. That’s fine, but you must build filtering into the funnel so your calendar doesn’t get hijacked by free-advice seekers.\n\n# 3) Credibility is not optional in B2B\n\nMost Meta lead quality problems are really trust problems.\n\nHigh-ACV buyers need reasons to believe you, fast. Proof points are not decoration, they’re the conversion engine:\n\n* One strong metric\n* Logos, if allowed\n* Short, specific testimonials\n* Clear “what happens on the call”\n* Proof of a repeatable process\n\nIf you can’t show proof, you’ll still get leads. They just won’t be the ones you want.\n\n# 4) Funnel architecture: optimize for bookings, not form submits\n\nTwo flows work:\n\nInstant Form funnel (fast, mobile-first)\n\n* Ad → Instant Form → Thank You screen → Calendar booking → CRM → follow-up\n\nLanding page funnel (more context, higher intent)\n\n* Ad → Landing Page → Form → TY page with embedded calendar → CRM → follow-up\n\nEither way, the rule is the same: the conversion is the booked call, not the form.\n\nYour Thank You step should push scheduling hard:\n\n* Calendar button or embed\n* Clear instruction to book now\n* Backup email/SMS with booking link for non-bookers\n\n# 5) Qualification: filter without killing volume\n\nThis is where most teams break things.\n\nWe define QualifiedLead as strict rules and mirror it in the form:\n\n* Role/seniority\n* Company size\n* Industry or business model\n* Budget band (if needed)\n* Timeline/urgency\n\nThen we route:\n\n* Qualified → show calendar immediately\n* Not qualified → no calendar, lighter nurture path\n\nThis protects sales time and keeps CPL sane.\n\n# 6) Creative system: unpolished, specific, and diverse\n\nWhat works right now looks less like advertising and more like a relevant message.\n\nFormats that consistently perform:\n\n* Statics with simple “Twitter-style” text\n* Carousels (pain → mechanism → proof → CTA)\n* Founder videos (unpolished, direct, truthful)\n* iPhone Notes style, plain background text\n\nCreative rules we follow:\n\n* Call out the persona in the first line\n* One pain only\n* One outcome only\n* One proof point\n* One CTA\n\n# 7) The real edge: CRM + CAPI feedback loop (optimize for QualifiedLead)\n\nIf you optimize Meta for raw leads, it will find you the cheapest form-fillers on earth. So optimizing for MQLs or SQLs (depending on the client budget and the volume of SQLs) is the golden rule at my agency XQL Group.\n\nThe biggest unlock is sending back quality signals via Conversions API:\n\n* Lead captured in CRM (with UTMs and ad IDs)\n* Lead qualifies based on your rules\n* Send QualifiedLead event back to Meta\n* Send BookedCall event when they schedule\n* Optional: Showed, Deal Won later\n\nThis trains Meta to find people who look like your real buyers, not people who like filling forms.\n\n# 8) Follow-up is part of the funnel\n\nA lot of qualified people won’t book instantly.\n\nWe run:\n\n* Non-booker sequence (immediate, then daily for a week, then weekly)\n* Booked reminders (instant confirmation, 24h, 1h)\n* No-show recovery (same-day reschedule, 48h follow-up)\n\nThis is where a meaningful percentage of extra bookings come from.\n\n# The takeaway\n\nMeta is currently very capable at finding B2B audiences, even when targeting options are limited, if:\n\n* you speak clearly to a specific persona\n* you make trust easy through proof\n* you route and filter properly\n* you train the algorithm with QualifiedLead signals via CRM + CAPI\n\nIf you’ve tried Meta before and it “didn’t work,” the failure mode is usually one of these: vague persona, weak proof, wrong conversion signal, or no feedback loop.",

The part most teams miss is upstream signal quality if your audience seed is weak or generic, even great creative struggles.

Creative gets the credit, but audience definition quietly does most of the work.",

Not what you think their pain is, but the exact words they used in sales calls or support tickets. We pulled a phrase from a discovery call (\"we're hiring but can't find the right devs fast enough\") and used it verbatim in an ad. Response rate jumped noticeably because it didn't sound like marketing.  \n  \nThe filtering piece is interesting too. We used to be too aggressive with qualification questions and killed volume. Loosened it a bit and just added one really good disqualifying question at the end (\"what's your typical project budget range?\") instead of five mediocre ones. Got more volume, sales team was happier with quality.  \n  \nHow are you handling the gap between form submit and actual call show rate?

We add e-mail marketing automation with case studies and educational content to increase trust + multi-channel follow-ups (email, Linkedin, Whatsapp) + calling them if the sales team can do it.

You should push the pages that's gonna generate revenue for you.\n\nThis is what other successful cannabis companies are doing. Happy to share more insights and case studies if you need more help.",

They think your marketing is great. But sometimes the pain is not acute enough for them to act. They don't want to be \"that person\" who buys \"that solution\" that is never used or is a flop or results in reputations getting burned. That's normal. In B2B context, most people who buy are trying to protect their own reputations. Half the battle is getting a second person within the target organisation onboard. \n\nThis is why B2B selling becomes easier when you know how to leverage that social dynamic withing organisations to your advantage. Because once you get more than one person involved in the buying process, the personal \"reputational\" risk for the buyer is now hedged. Listening in on sales calls is great way to find out how people more experienced than you turn prospect into a \"champion\" or find a champion for your product within the organisation. Check out a book called The Challenger Customer - it helps explain this dynamic in a bit more detail.",

      "text": "No intro needed, I’ll skip the fluff and go straight to what actually worked for us and for other B2B/SaaS teams I’ve seen do it well:\n\n# 1. Make sure you’re ready\n\nAffiliate programs amplify what’s already working. If you don’t have product–market fit, happy customers, or predictable conversions, affiliates won’t fix that. What they will do is bring you more of what’s already converting.\n\nRule of thumb: wait until you can confidently say, “If I drive 100 visitors to my site, X will become paying customers.”\n\n# 2. Decide on commission structure\n\nThis is where SaaS differs from e-commerce. Most SaaS affiliate programs use recurring commissions, because affiliates love predictable income streams.\n\n* Typical range: 20–30% of subscription revenue\n* Duration: 12–24 months (some even go lifetime if margins allow)\n* Hybrid model: one-time signup bonus + recurring percentage\n\nMake it attractive enough that affiliates feel long-term upside, but sustainable for you.\n\n# 3. Recruit the right affiliates\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is thinking affiliates equal influencers. In SaaS/B2B, the best partners are usually:\n\n* Agencies/consultants serving your ICP\n* Freelancers/contractors who recommend tools daily\n* Community leaders (Slack groups, LinkedIn, Reddit mods)\n* Content creators who write reviews, tutorials, or comparison posts\n\nStart with people who already trust your brand or work with your customers.\n\n# 4. Onboard and activate them\n\nSigning someone up isn’t enough. Affiliates succeed when you make promotion frictionless. That means:\n\n* Clear onboarding (walkthrough of your product and program basics)\n* Access to promo resources (banners, swipe copy, FAQs, case studies)\n* Education (what messaging works best, who your ICP is)\n* A point of contact for questions (affiliates love human support)\n\n# 5. Track properly\n\nNothing kills a program faster than bad tracking. Affiliates need to trust that you’ll track their referrals accurately and pay them fairly.\n\n# 6. Start small and then scale (don't rush!)\n\nStart with a hand-picked group of affiliates. Work closely with them, optimize messaging, fix tracking issues, and learn what converts.\n\nOnce you’ve nailed these, you can scale recruitment with:\n\n* Affiliate directories\n* Outreach campaigns\n* Community partnerships\n* Even running paid ads to “recruit affiliates”\n\nIn a nutshell you need to remember that affiliate marketing in SaaS isn't just about sharing links. It takes time and effort so you need to know this before kicking it off.",
