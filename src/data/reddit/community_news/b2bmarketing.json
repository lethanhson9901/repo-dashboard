      "text": "So, I work at a B2B SaaS (I hope you've heard of us: marketowl ai - we're doing ai marketing agents and now viral posting), and like everyone else, we were doing the usual LinkedIn and email outreach, blog posts, etc. The leads were getting more expensive and honestly, not great quality.\n\nA couple months ago, we decided to switch things up and started posting genuinely useful stuff on a bunch of relevant subreddits. Nothing salesy, just sharing what we've learned and some behind-the-scenes stuff.\n\nWe put up maybe 20 posts across different subs.\n\nHere's the wild part: those posts ended up getting close to a million views.\n\nAnd then suddenly, our inbound calls shot up from 2-3 a week to more like 15-20.\n\nWhen we asked how people found us, a bunch said Reddit, like \"I saw your post about \\[topic\\]\" or \"I've been following your comments for a while.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: in Google Analytics, it's basically invisible. Almost everything shows up as direct traffic, and the only real hint is a spike in branded searches on Search Console.\n\nSince most of these subs don't allow links, we'd just mention our company name and let people look us up.\n\nOn the plus side, it's now our biggest lead source and they're way more qualified than what we got from ads. Also we're offering the same services to our clients lol",

Justin\\_Asher449, I found that the real shift happens when you move away from random posting and focus on a tight daily outreach loop.\n\nIn my experience, the best tools are the ones that help you stay consistent without making you look like a bot. I look for features that help me track who is actually engaging with my content so I can follow up while the lead is still warm. A simple framework that works for me is to start with a targeted feed of my ideal prospects, leave a few thoughtful comments to build familiarity, and then send a short, non pitchy DM.\n\nI run this entire workflow inside Depost AI now. It lets me track my prospects and follow ups in one place so I do not lose people in the chaos of the LinkedIn inbox. It has really helped my conversion rates because I am only talking to people who are already aware of my brand.

Most people jump straight to automation before figuring out what actually converts their audience.  \n  \nWe wasted months with generic email sequences that got maybe 1-2% response rates. The shift happened when we stopped thinking about tools as \"set it and forget it\" and started using them to be more personal at scale.  \n  \nFor us, tracking intent signals changed everything. We set up alerts for job changes, funding rounds, and hiring patterns at target accounts. Then we'd reach out with something actually relevant to their situation, not just another templated pitch.  \n  \nThe automation part came after we knew what messaging worked. Then it was just about scaling that with tools to handle the alerts, sequencing, and follow-ups. Response rates jumped to around 20% because we were reaching out at the right time with context.  \n  \nI'd focus first on identifying 3-5 buying signals that indicate someone might actually need what you're selling, then look for tools that help you act on those signals quickly.  \n  \nWhat type of companies are you targeting, and do you have a sense of what triggers them to start looking for solutions like yours?",

      "text": "I know, I know. \"Webinars are so 2020.\"\n\nEveryone's tired of the 45-minute pitch disguised as education.\n\nBut here's the thing - the companies that are doing webinars RIGHT are seeing insane numbers:\n\n* 20-40% of webinar attendees convert to trial or paid\n* Average cost per attendee: $30-50 (vs $80-150 for a cold lead)\n* Webinar leads close 30% faster than cold leads because they already understand the product\n\nThe difference between a webinar that converts and one that gets 12 attendees and 0 signups? It's not the topic.\n\nIt's the format.\n\n# The old way (what everyone's tired of):\n\n\"Join our webinar: How \\[Product\\] Helps You Do \\[Thing\\]\"\n\nThis is a demo with a calendar invite.\n\nNobody wants this.\n\nThe title screams \"we're going to sell you something for 45 minutes.\"\n\nAttendance rates: 15-20%.\n\nConversion: near zero.\n\n# The new way (workshops that actually grow your SaaS):\n\n**Teach something valuable. Use your product as the tool to teach it.**\n\nThe product isn't the topic. The SKILL is the topic. Your product is just the instrument.\n\nExamples:\n\n|**If You Sell...**|**Don't Run This Webinar**|**Run This Workshop**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Email marketing tool|\"How Our Tool Sends Better Emails\"|\"Write Email Sequences That Convert: Live Workshop\"|\n|Analytics platform|\"Demo of Our Dashboard\"|\"Find Your Biggest Revenue Leak in 30 Minutes\"|\n|Reddit lead gen (SleepLeads)|\"How SleepLeads Works\"|\"Find 50 Qualified Leads on Reddit in 60 Minutes — Live\"|\n|CRM|\"Tour of Our CRM Features\"|\"Build a Sales Pipeline From Scratch: Workshop\"|\n|Design tool|\"Canva Product Tour\"|\"Design a Landing Page That Converts in 45 Minutes\"|\n\nSee the difference? The workshop title promises a SKILL or RESULT. The product just happens to be what you use during the session.\n\n# The 5-step playbook:\n\n**1. Pick a problem, not a feature**\n\nYour audience doesn't care about your feature set.\n\nThey care about their problem.\n\nBuild the workshop around solving that problem live.\n\nAsk yourself: \"If I removed my product name from the title, would people still want to attend?\"\n\nIf yes, you've got a good topic.\n\n**2. Make it hands-on**\n\n\"Webinar\" = passive. Someone talks, you watch. \"Workshop\" = active. You follow along and build something.\n\nWorkshops convert 3-5x better because attendees experience the product while learning.\n\nThey don't need a separate trial, they already used it.\n\nGive attendees a temporary account or free access during the session.\n\nLet them follow along in real-time.\n\nBy the end, they've already built something with your tool.\n\nThe switching cost is now in YOUR favor.\n\n**3. Keep it short (45 min max)**\n\nNobody has 90 minutes for your webinar.\n\nRespect their time.\n\n* 5 min: quick intro, set expectations\n* 30 min: hands-on workshop (the meat)\n* 5 min: Q&A\n* 5 min: \"here's how to keep going\" (your soft CTA)\n\n**4. The soft CTA (not a pitch)**\n\nAt the end, don't do a 10-minute sales pitch. Instead:\n\n>\n\nThat's it.\n\nThey already experienced the value.\n\nThe CTA is just \"keep going.\" No \"buy now,\" no \"limited time offer.\"\n\n**5. Record and repurpose**\n\nThe live workshop is one event.\n\nThe recording is an evergreen asset.\n\n* Post the recording on YouTube (SEO value)\n* Clip highlights for LinkedIn and Twitter\n* Use the transcript as a blog post\n* Gate the recording behind an email capture for ongoing leads\n\nOne 45-minute workshop can generate content and leads for months.\n\n# Where to find attendees (without spending $5k on ads):\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. \"I'll run a great workshop... but who's coming?\"\n\n**1. Reddit threads** People posting \"how do I do X?\" in your niche subreddits are your workshop audience.\n\nDrop a helpful comment and mention you're running a live workshop on exactly that topic.\n\n**2. LinkedIn posts** Post about the problem your workshop solves. End with \"I'm running a free workshop on this - drop a 🔥 if you want the link.\"\n\n**3. Your existing email list** Even if it's 200 people. An email with \"Free live workshop: \\[Skill\\]\" outperforms any newsletter you'll ever write.\n\n**4. Partner with someone in an adjacent space** Find someone who serves the same audience but isn't a competitor.\n\nCo-host the workshop.\n\nYou both promote to your lists.\n\nDouble the attendance.\n\n# The numbers that matter:\n\n|**Metric**|**Good**|**Great**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Registration → attendance rate|30-40%|50%+|\n|Attendee → trial signup|15-20%|30%+|\n|Attendee → paid conversion|5-10%|15%+|\n|Cost per attendee|$30-50|Under $20|\n\nCompare that to cold outreach where you're paying $80-150 per lead who may or may not even have the problem you solve.\n\n# Common mistakes:\n\n**1. Making it a demo in disguise.** People can smell this. If your \"workshop\" is just your sales engineer clicking through the product, attendance drops to zero by minute 10.\n\n**2. Running it once and giving up.** The first webinar always has low attendance. The third one is where you find your groove. The tenth one is where it becomes a machine.\n\n**3. Not following up.** Someone attended your workshop but didn't convert? Follow up with the recording, a summary of what they built, and an offer to continue. This alone can double your conversion rate.\n\n**4. Overcomplicating the tech.** You don't need a $500/month webinar platform. Zoom + a landing page + an email reminder sequence. That's it.\n\n**5. Gating the workshop behind too much info.** Name and email. That's all you need to register. Every additional field drops registration by 10-15%.\n\n# The bottom line:\n\nWebinars-as-demos are dead. Workshops-as-education are the best-kept growth secret in SaaS.\n\nYou teach something valuable. You use your product as the tool. Attendees experience value before they ever see a pricing page. And the content lives forever as recordings, clips, and blog posts.\n\nIf you're spending $3k/month on ads and getting lukewarm leads, try running one free workshop per month instead. The leads are warmer, the conversion is higher, and the cost is basically your time.\n\nAnyone here running workshops for their SaaS? What's working?",

My team has developed very mature framework for running webinars starting from audience research to selecting topic, to selling the first step offer during the webinar.\n\nDM if interested.\n\nMy own opinion, as marketer, is that the main bottleneck with webinars are 2 things:\n\n1. Preparing an offer that participants can claim. Here I talk about first-step offer that converts at 50-80% to delivery of main offer. In IT these often are things, sucha as mini workshops or audits.\n\n2. Actuall follow-up after the webinar. No follow-up, no sales. While there are some participants who sign-up to offer during the webinar, most money is in making follow-up calls starting on the same day.\n\nI wrote earlier about our findings with running webinars for selling tech.

The ones where we actually taught something useful (like how to structure a cold outbound video message) got 40% attendance vs the ones that were thinly veiled product demos that got maybe 18%.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add is to use the Q&A section strategically. Instead of just answering random questions at the end, I started asking attendees halfway through to drop their specific challenge in the chat. Then in the last 10 minutes, I'd pick 2-3 and solve them live using the product. That made it feel even more hands-on and the conversion rate went up noticeably.  \n  \nThe follow-up piece you mentioned is huge too. We started sending a Loom video the next day to non-converters, basically saying \"here's what you built yesterday, here's how to take it further\" with a personal walkthrough. Takes 3 minutes to record but the response has been solid.  \n  \nWhat's your take on workshop frequency? I've been doing monthly but wondering if bi-weekly would build more momentum or just lead to burnout.",

I’m specifically looking for software, templates, or platforms that help create professional, branded client reports, beyond the standard custodian-generated performance PDFs.\n\nThe default reports cover account performance, but they don’t provide much narrative context, goal tracking, or visual clarity. My objective is to create reports that:\n\n• Clearly communicate portfolio performance and allocation  \n• Include goal tracking and progress metrics  \n• Visualize risk exposure and asset breakdowns  \n• Provide space for advisor commentary and planning insights  \n• Are easy to update quarterly without rebuilding from scratch  \n• Support branding and white-label customization\n\nI’m researching tools that balance strong data visualization with workflow efficiency.\n\nFor those running RIAs or working in wealth management:\n\n1. What reporting tools are you using?\n2. Are you designing reports internally or using pre-built templates?\n3. What sections have you found most valuable to include beyond raw performance numbers?\n4. Any platforms that integrate well with custodians and reduce manual formatting?\n\nI’m trying to build a reporting system that strengthens client communication, reinforces trust, and differentiates my firm and not just generate another PDF.\n\nAppreciate any specific tool recommendations, workflows, or examples you’re willing to share.",

      "text": "I know that sounds like bait and I get it. every other post on here is \"we booked 50 meetings in 3 days\" and then they try to sell you a course. im not selling anything. I just had the best week my agency has ever had and I want to break down exactly what happened because honestly im still kinda shocked myself.\n\nso let me explain what my business actually is first because context matters.\n\nI run a cold email lead generation agency. thats it. thats the whole business. companies hire me to fill there sales pipeline with qualified meetings. I dont do ads I dont do seo I dont do social media content. I send cold emails to the right people with the right message and I book calls on my clients calendars. thats my entire service.\n\nright now I have 4 active clients. one is a staffing agency in texas that places accountants and finance people at mid market companies. one is a software company that sells inventory management tools to ecommerce brands doing $2M to $20M in revenue. one is a commercial cleaning company that goes after property management firms and office buildings in the midwest. and the newest one is a cybersecurity consulting firm that targets healthcare organizations because healthcare has all these HIPAA compliance requirements and most of them are terrified of getting breached.\n\nthose are very different businesses selling very different things to very different people. but the process I use is basically the same for all of them. and last week all four campaigns hit at the same time which is how we ended up with 27 booked meetings in 7 days.\n\nlet me walk through everything.\n\nok so the first thing people screw up with cold email is they start writing emails before they even know who theyre emailing. im serious. people will spend 3 hours crafting the perfect subject line before theyve spent 5 minutes thinking about who the actual recipient is. thats backwards.\n\nevery campaign starts with me getting obsessively specific about who were going after. when I onboarded the staffing agency client for example I didnt just say ok we need to email companies that hire accountants. I sat down with the owner for like 90 minutes and asked her questions until she was probably annoyed with me. what size companies do your best placements come from. what industries. who makes the decision to use a staffing firm is it the CFO or the HR director or someone else. what triggers them to start looking. is it a resignation is it rapid growth is it a specific time of year. what do they usually say on the first call that tells you theyre a good fit.\n\nshe told me that there best clients are companies with 100 to 500 employees in financial services manufacturing and professional services. the decision maker is usually the HR director or VP of HR but sometimes its the CFO at smaller companies. and the trigger is almost always that someone just quit or theyre expanding a department and cant find qualified candidates fast enough through job boards.\n\nthats gold. thats everything I need to build a list and write an email that actually resonates.\n\nso I take all that and I go into **Apollo** which is what I use for building prospect lists. for the staffing client I set up a search for HR directors VP of HR and heads of talent at companies with 100 to 500 employees in financial services manufacturing and professional services in texas oklahoma and louisiana because thats where my client operates.\n\nbut heres where it gets more specific and this is the part most people miss. Apollo has a filter for job postings. you can find companies that are actively hiring for specific roles. so I filtered for companies that had open positions for accountants controllers or finance managers posted in the last 30 days. think about what that means. im now looking at a list of companies that I KNOW are trying to hire finance people RIGHT NOW. theyre not hypothetical prospects. theyre companies with an active need that my client directly solves.\n\npulled 340 contacts that matched all those criteria. took me maybe 30 minutes.\n\nfor the ecommerce inventory software client I did something similar but different filters obviously. searched for founders CEOs and heads of operations at ecommerce companies with 20 to 200 employees. used Apollos technology filter to find companies running Shopify because my clients tool integrates with Shopify natively. also filtered for companies using tools like ShipStation and Skubana because that signals theyre at a stage where inventory management is becoming a real problem. got about 500 contacts.\n\nthe cybersecurity healthcare client was interesting because healthcare is super regulated so I needed to be really targeted. searched for CISOs IT directors and compliance officers at healthcare organizations with 200 to 2000 employees. Apollo has industry subcategories so I could specifically target hospitals clinics health systems and medical device companies. filtered for companies in states that had recently had publicized data breaches because those organizations are usually scrambling to beef up security after something like that happens nearby. got about 400 contacts.\n\nthe commercial cleaning client is the simplest ICP. property managers facility directors and operations managers at commercial real estate firms and property management companies. filtered by portfolio size using employee count as a rough proxy. pulled about 450 contacts.\n\nso now I have lists for all four clients. roughly 1700 contacts total. but I dont just load those into a campaign and start sending. thats how you destroy your domains and waste everyones time.\n\nfirst every single list goes through **EmailVerifier**. I upload the CSV it checks every address and tells me whats valid whats risky and whats dead. dead ones get removed immediately no exceptions. risky ones are usually catch all domains which means the server accepts all emails regardless of whether that specific address exists. I keep some of those but separate them so I can watch bounce rates on them independently.\n\nheres why this matters and let me give you a real number. the cybersecurity client list of 400 contacts had 52 invalid emails. thats 13%. if I had sent to all 400 without verifying my bounce rate wouldve been over 10% in the first few days. google and microsoft see that and they think youre a spammer. your emails start going to junk. your reply rates die. and the domains you spent weeks warming up are suddenly useless. ive seen it happen to other agencies and it happened to me once early on before I learned this lesson. now I verify everything and my bounce rate across all campaigns stays under 1%.\n\nI also want to explain something about catch all domains that trips people up. just because EmailVerifier says an email is risky doesnt mean its bad. it means the tool cant fully confirm it because the server accepts everything. I still send to alot of these but I keep them separate and I watch the bounces closely. if a batch of catch alls starts bouncing above 3% I pull them immediately.\n\nok so lists are built and verified. now the mailbox situation.\n\nyou cannot send 300 plus cold emails a day from one or two email accounts. youll get flagged so fast. I cap every mailbox at 25 to 30 sends per day. so if I want to send 300 a day across my four clients I need at least 10 to 12 mailboxes. and those mailboxes need to be properly set up with the right authentication records and warmed up before they touch a single cold email.\n\nI get all my mailboxes from **PuzzleInbox**. they do google workspace inboxes. I switched to them about a year ago because I was tired of setting everything up myself and kept messing things up. id forget a DNS record or google would flag an account because I set up too many mailboxes on one domain in one day. just annoying stuff that was eating my time.\n\nonce I switched the accounts come with SPF DKIM DMARC already configured which was the main thing I kept screwing up. I ran two campaigns side by side at one point and the ones on PuzzleInbox mailboxes got more replies than the ones I set up myself. same emails same type of audience. so I just moved everything over and stopped overthinking it.\n\nfor the 27 meeting week specifically I had 14 mailboxes running across my four clients. 4 for the staffing agency 4 for the ecommerce software 3 for the cybersecurity firm and 3 for the cleaning company. every one of them had been warmed for at least 18 days before any cold sends started.\n\nwarming is something I want to talk about because people rush it and then wonder why there campaigns flop. I warm every mailbox for a minimum of 14 days but I prefer 18 to 21. I use the warmup tool thats built into my sending platform. it basically sends and receives emails automatically between your account and other accounts in the warmup network. this builds sending reputation so that when you start sending cold emails the email providers see a history of normal activity from that account not just sudden mass outreach.\n\nmy warmup schedule looks like this roughly. first few days its sending maybe 5 to 10 warmup emails per day. by day 7 its up to 20 to 30. around day 14 I start mixing in a small number of real cold sends. maybe 5 to 10 per day. by day 18 to 21 I ramp up to full volume at 25 to 30 cold emails per day with warmup still running in the background. I never turn warmup off even when a campaign is fully live. it keeps the account looking normal.\n\none thing to be careful about. dont ramp too fast. I made this mistake with the cleaning company client. had a mailbox that was only 12 days into warmup and I got impatient and started sending 25 cold emails a day from it. replies were basically nonexistent. like crickets for 5 days straight which never happens with my campaigns. pulled it back to 5 a day for another week then slowly ramped back up and it recovered. that impatience cost me about a weeks worth of sending from that account. not worth it.\n\nnow the sending itself. I use **Instantly** for all my campaigns. been on it about a year and a half. was on lemlist before that and switched mainly because rotating between a bunch of mailboxes was easier on Instantly.\n\nmailbox rotation basically means when you have 4 mailboxes connected to one campaign it spreads your sends across all 4 accounts. so instead of one account sending 100 emails each account sends 25. keeps each account under the radar and if one starts having issues the other 3 keep things running.\n\nfor each client I run multiple email variants simultaneously. this is crucial and its something I learned the hard way after months of just sending one email to everyone and hoping it worked.\n\nlet me walk you through the actual scripts I used for the week we booked 27 meetings because I think seeing the real language matters more than hearing me talk about frameworks.\n\n**the staffing agency client.** remember these are going to HR directors at companies actively hiring finance roles.\n\nthe subject line that performed best was just the prospects first name and a dash and \"quick question about your finance hiring\"\n\nthe email read something like\n\nhey {first\\_name}\n\nsaw that {company\\_name} has a few open roles on the finance side right now. finding qualified accountants in this market is rough I hear it from basically every HR leader I talk to.\n\nwe work with companies like {similar\\_company} who were spending 45 plus days trying to fill senior accounting roles. we got that down to under 15 days on average by tapping into a pre vetted network of finance professionals specifically in the {state} market.\n\nnot sure if outside help is something youre considering but if it is id love to share how we did it for {similar\\_company}. would a quick 15 min call make sense this week?\n\n{my\\_name}\n\nthis email has a few things going on that I want to point out. the opening line references something real and verifiable. they DO have open finance roles. I found that through Apollos job posting data. im not guessing. im telling them something they know is true which immediately builds credibility. then I name a specific pain point. 45 plus days to fill a role. that number came directly from my client who told me thats what most of her prospects are experiencing. then I drop social proof with a real company name and a real result. under 15 days. and the CTA is soft. \"not sure if outside help is something youre considering\" gives them an easy out which paradoxically makes them more likely to engage because they dont feel cornered.\n\nthat script pulled a 7.8% reply rate and about half of those replies were positive meaning they wanted to talk. thats really good for cold email.\n\n**the ecommerce inventory software client.** these emails go to founders and ops people at shopify brands.\n\nbest performing subject line was \"inventory question {company\\_name}\"\n\nhey {first\\_name}\n\nrandom question but how are you guys handling inventory across channels right now? most shopify brands I talk to in the {revenue\\_range} range are duct taping together spreadsheets and basic shopify tools and it starts breaking once you hit a certain SKU count.\n\nwe built {product\\_name} specifically for brands at your stage. {similar\\_brand} was losing about $8K a month in oversells and stockouts before they switched. took them maybe 2 weeks to get fully set up.\n\nworth a 15 min look?\n\n{my\\_name}\n\nthe opening question works really well for this audience because founders love talking about there operations. its almost like a challenge. and the $8K a month number is specific and painful enough to get attention. nobody wants to think theyre losing $8K a month on something fixable. that email did a 6.2% reply rate.\n\n**the cybersecurity healthcare client.** emails going to CISOs and IT directors at healthcare orgs.\n\nsubject line \"quick thought on {company\\_name} security posture\"\n\n{first\\_name}\n\nwith everything going on in healthcare security right now I wanted to reach out specifically because organizations in {state} have been getting hit hard over the past year.\n\nwe do security assessments and HIPAA compliance work specifically for healthcare orgs. worked with {similar\\_org} recently and found 3 critical vulnerabilities they didnt know existed. one of them wouldve been a reportable breach if it got exploited.\n\nI know you probably get emails like this all the time but if your team hasnt done a third party assessment recently it might be worth a conversation. happy to share what were seeing in the healthcare threat landscape right now no strings attached.\n\n{my\\_name}\n\nthis one is different in tone because the audience is different. security people are skeptical by nature and they get bombarded with vendor emails. so I go heavier on the fear angle which I normally avoid but in cybersecurity fear is a legitimate motivator because the consequences of a breach are real and severe especially in healthcare where HIPAA violations carry massive fines. the \"3 critical vulnerabilities\" detail makes it concrete and real. that script got a 5.1% reply rate which is lower than the others but the deal sizes are much bigger so the math still works.\n\n**the commercial cleaning client.** going to property managers and facility directors.\n\nsubject line \"{first\\_name} quick question about {company\\_name} properties\"\n\nhey {first\\_name}\n\nthis might be out of left field but im curious who handles the cleaning contracts for your properties right now. ive been talking to a bunch of property managers in {city} lately and the number one complaint is inconsistency. crew shows up late or doesnt show up at all and then you get tenant complaints.\n\nwe service about 40 commercial properties in the {region} area right now and our thing is basically reliability. {similar\\_company} switched to us after there last provider no showed twice in one month. havent had a single missed service in 8 months with them.\n\nif your current setup is working great then ignore me. but if its been a headache id love to chat for 10 minutes.\n\n{my\\_name}\n\nthis is the most casual script of the four and thats intentional. property managers are not corporate executives. they respond better to conversational language. \"this might be out of left field\" and \"if your current setup is working great ignore me\" make it feel like a real person talking not a sales machine. 8.4% reply rate on this one which was the highest of all four clients.\n\nnow the follow up sequence is where alot of those 27 meetings actually came from. I think only about 8 or 9 of the meetings came from the first email. the rest came from follow ups 2 3 and 4.\n\nfollow up 1 goes out 3 days after the initial email on the same thread. I dont add a new subject line it just looks like a reply. this one is short and adds value. I usually share a quick case study or a relevant insight. something like\n\nhey {first\\_name} wanted to share this quick. we just helped {company} do {specific thing} and the results were {specific number}. thought it might be relevant for you.\n\nlet me know if you want me to walk through how they did it.\n\nfollow up 2 goes 4 to 5 days after that. this ones even shorter and I try a different angle. instead of talking about my clients service I reference an industry pain point or trend. something like\n\n{first\\_name} one more thought. talked to a {industry} company last week and they mentioned {pain point} is getting worse because of {reason}. sounds like its hitting alot of people right now.\n\nif that sounds familiar and you want to jam on it for 10 minutes im around.\n\nfollow up 3 is the breakup. goes about a week later. this is the one that generates a surprising number of replies.\n\nhey {first\\_name} im gonna stop bugging you after this haha. totally get it if the timings not right.\n\nif {pain point} ever bubbles up as a priority feel free to grab time here {calendly link}. either way hope {company\\_name} is crushing it.\n\nthe \"im gonna stop bugging you\" line works because it shows self awareness. your acknowledging that youve sent a few emails and you know thats potentially annoying. people respect that. and something about knowing its the last email makes people reply when they wouldnt have otherwise. ive had prospects reply to this one saying \"sorry for not getting back to you earlier yeah lets chat.\"\n\nfollow up 4 comes like 2 to 3 weeks later with a brand new subject line. totally fresh thread. I reference something new. a recent article about there industry. something they posted on linkedin. a new hire they made. anything that gives me a reason to reach out again that doesnt feel like im just pestering them.\n\nfor the 27 meeting week specifically follow up 3 generated 7 of the meetings. the breakup email. seven meetings from an email that basically says im giving up. wild.\n\nlet me talk about some stuff to be careful about because cold email is a game where small mistakes compound fast.\n\nnumber one thing. your sending reputation is everything and its way easier to destroy than to build. I treat my domains like a credit score. every bounced email every spam complaint every ignored email hurts it a little. enough little hits and your done. this is why I verify every list before sending. why I use properly configured mailboxes. why I cap sends at 25 to 30 per account per day. why I warm up for 18 plus days. none of these steps are exciting but they protect the thing that makes everything else possible.\n\nnumber two. your emails will land in spam sometimes and you need to catch it early. I check deliverability regularly by watching reply rates. if replies suddenly dry up on a campaign that was performing fine thats a red flag. something changed. is it one specific mailbox thats the problem. did I accidentally send to a bad batch of emails. is there something in the email content triggering spam filters. you have to be proactive about this because by the time you realize somethings wrong it mightve been going on for days and your domain is already damaged.\n\nand by the way I dont track open rates. I know some people do but tracking opens requires a hidden pixel in your email which means your email has to be sent as HTML not plain text. plain text emails have way better deliverability. the moment you add tracking pixels your email looks more like marketing and less like a real person sending a real email. so I turned off open tracking a long time ago and I only look at reply rates and bounce rates. those two numbers tell me everything I need to know about whether a campaign is healthy or not.\n\nnumber three. personalization has to be real or dont bother. I see people using merge tags like \"I love what {company\\_name} is doing in the {industry} space\" and thinking thats personalization. its not. everyone can see through that. real personalization is referencing there open job postings or a specific project they completed or something there CEO said in a podcast. it takes more time but the difference in reply rates is massive.\n\nnumber four and this is one people dont talk about enough. you need to know when to pull back. I had a week about 3 months ago where one of my clients campaigns started getting an unusual number of negative replies. people saying take me off your list and a few actual angry responses. instead of pushing through I paused the campaign entirely. looked at the list and realized that batch of prospects was too senior for the offer. we were emailing C suite at enterprise companies with a service that was really designed for mid market. the emails werent bad. the targeting was off. pulled the list. built a new one focused on directors and VPs at smaller companies. relaunched and everything was fine. the lesson is that when people are responding negatively in unusual numbers its almost never about your email. its about who youre sending it to.\n\nnumber five. timing matters more than you think. I send all my campaigns tuesday through thursday between 8am and 11am in the recipients local time zone. mondays people are catching up from the weekend and fridays people are checked out. ive tested this extensively and tuesday through thursday morning consistently outperforms everything else. the 27 meeting week was a tuesday through thursday stretch which isnt a coincidence.\n\nI also use **Warmly** on two of my four clients right now. the ecommerce software client and the cybersecurity client because they both have enough website traffic for it to matter. basically it tells you when someone visits your website and in alot of cases it can tell you who specifically not just the company.\n\nheres how this played out during the 27 meeting week. on wednesday I got a Warmly alert that a CISO at a hospital system in ohio had visited my cybersecurity clients case studies page and then went to the contact page but didnt fill out the form. this person was already in our email sequence and had received the first email 5 days earlier but hadnt replied. instead of waiting for follow up 1 to go out automatically I jumped in and sent a personal email within an hour. referenced a specific breach that had affected a hospital system in a neighboring state recently and offered a free 20 minute threat briefing.\n\nshe replied that evening and we had a meeting booked for friday morning. that meeting is now in the proposal stage for a $45K engagement. wouldnt have happened if I didnt know she was poking around the website that day.\n\nyou cant really plan for stuff like that but knowing someone is looking at the website right now lets you jump on it instead of finding out a week later in google analytics when its too late.\n\nfor connecting all this stuff together I use **Zapier** so I dont have to manually copy paste between tools. when someone replies positively in Instantly and I tag them it creates a deal in **HubSpot** and pings me on **Slack**. when they book through **Calendly** it updates the deal stage and sends me there linkedin so I can prep. basic stuff but it saves me hours and nothing falls through the cracks.\n\nevery monday morning I update a **google sheet** for each client with that weeks numbers and share it with them. emails sent. reply rate. positive replies. meetings booked. simple. no fancy dashboard. clients just want to know whats happening and whether its working. the sheet tells them that in 30 seconds.\n\nfor the 27 meeting week the numbers across all four clients looked like this. sent about 1,400 emails total. average reply rate was 6.9%. total positive replies that converted to booked meetings was 27. overall thats about a 1.9% email to meeting conversion rate which might not sound high but in cold email thats a very strong week.\n\nI want to be clear this was an unusually good week. my average is more like 12 to 18 meetings per week across all clients. everything just clicked during this particular week. the lists were really dialed in. the scripts had been tested and optimized over the previous month. the mailboxes were all in good health. and honestly a little bit of luck with timing. sometimes you email someone on the exact day they were thinking about the problem you solve and thats not something you can control.\n\nbut what you can control is having the infrastructure in place so that when those lucky moments happen you actually capitalize on them. clean lists. verified emails. mailboxes that dont land in spam. a sending tool that spreads your volume properly. and scripts that are specific enough to feel personal and relevant.\n\nthats the whole system. its not complicated. its not some secret. its just a bunch of boring stuff done consistently and done right.\n\nif anyone has questions about specific parts of this fire away. happy to get more detailed on anything.",

I've had prospects go dark on email but then reply within hours when I send them a quick personalised video on LinkedIn referencing our previous emails. Something about seeing an actual face makes it feel less like spam and more like genuine outreach.  \n  \nThe conversion rate jumps because you're catching people who were maybe interested but just didn't prioritise responding to text. It's more work per prospect but for high value deals like your cybersecurity client it's often worth it.  \n  \nAre you doing anything on LinkedIn alongside the email sequences or keeping it purely email focused?",

      "text": "**leads (where money actually starts)**\n\n**Apollo**  \nwhat it is: b2b lead database with filters (industry, size, job title, tech, location).  \nhow i use it: i build tight lists. i don’t export “marketing managers in the US” and hope for replies. i do stuff like “founder/owner” + “10–200 headcount” + “industry” + one more filter that matches the offer.  \nwhat i like: fastest way to go from idea to a real list. good filters, easy exports.  \nwhat i don’t like: export credits get used quickly if you’re sloppy.\n\n**Lusha**  \nwhat it is: contact enrichment and lookup tool.  \nhow i use it: plug it into LinkedIn to pull emails/roles fast. great for spot-checking or filling gaps in apollo lists.  \nwhat i like: simple and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: accuracy varies and credits disappear fast if you blast it.\n\n**Kaspr**  \nwhat it is: linkedin scraping tool for emails and phone numbers.  \nhow i use it: when my apollo list is missing segment contact info, or i need direct phones for sms + call follow-up.  \nwhat i like: cheap and gets you data linkedin doesn’t show.  \nwhat i don’t like: linkedin will throttle you if you go too fast.\n\n**BuiltWith / Wappalyzer**  \nwhat they are: tech stack detectors that show what software or platforms a company uses.  \nhow i use them: only when my offer aligns with specific tech users (like shopify apps, crm tools, analytics add-ons).  \nwhat i like: adds intelligent targeting instead of guessing.  \nwhat i don’t like: not perfect — always double-check before blasting.\n\n\n\n**email verification (cheap insurance)**\n\n**MyEmailVerifier**  \nwhat it is: bulk email verifier that reduces bounces before you send.  \nhow i use it: every list runs through it. i trim invalids, risky catch-alls, spam traps.  \nwhat i like: affordable and gets the job done.  \nwhat i don’t like: slower for massive lists, but worth it.\n\n**MailboxValidator**  \nwhat it is: low-cost email verifier alternative.  \nhow i use it: when i have huge lists and don’t need a lot of detail, i run this for a quick clean.  \nwhat i like: cheap and simple.  \nwhat i don’t like: lighter reporting than premium tools.\n\n**NeverBounce / ZeroBounce**  \nwhat they are: higher-detail verification services.  \nhow i use them: when i want extra confidence or deeper risk flags.  \nwhat i like: detailed scoring and reporting.  \nwhat i don’t like: credits are more expensive.\n\n\n\n**sending + sequences (where deliverability lives or dies)**\n\n**Instantly / Smartlead**  \nwhat they are: email sequence platforms that automate follow-ups.  \nhow i use them: 3–5 step sequences with personalization and throttled sends so inboxes don’t die.  \nwhat i like: easy scheduling and testing.  \nwhat i don’t like: people use them to send too much and blame the tool for bad reputation.\n\n**Mailjet**  \nwhat it is: smtp + email platform alternative to MailScale.  \nhow i use it: as a sending relay with logs and throttle control when i want more delivery insight than a plain sending app.  \nwhat i like: stable delivery and real logs.  \nwhat i don’t like: not a full sequence tool — you pair it with Instantly/Smartlead.\n\n**PuzzleInbox**  \nwhat it is: google workspace inbox provisioning + outbound management.  \nhow i use it: separate inbox pools for each project, keeping my main domain clean and avoiding shared sending risk.  \nwhat i like: quick setup and isolation.  \nwhat i don’t like: not an all-in sequence tool.\n\n**Slicey**  \nwhat it is: outlook sender setup for diversification.  \nhow i use it: alternate inbox lane so i’m not only on one provider. helps if a niche responds better to microsoft senders.  \nwhat i like: diversification.  \nwhat i don’t like: more ops work than gmail-only.\n\n**SendGrid (cheap tier)**  \nwhat it is: smtp + email API and sending platform.  \nhow i use it: as another delivery pathway when i want logs and deliverability tools but don’t want enterprise pricing.  \nwhat i like: good reputation and tools.  \nwhat i don’t like: interface has some clutter.\n\n\n\n**crm + follow-up (where deals get won)**\n\n**OnePageCRM**  \nwhat it is: crm built around “next action” and simple pipelines.  \nhow i use it: every qualified reply becomes a deal with a next step. if it’s not moving, it dies.  \nwhat i like: forces follow-up. basic but effective.  \nwhat i don’t like: limited automation and reporting compared to big crms.\n\n**HubSpot CRM (free)**  \nwhat it is: free crm with contacts, deals, and email logging.  \nhow i use it: project tracking, basic analytics.  \nwhat i like: free and functional.  \nwhat i don’t like: paid tiers are expensive if you want more.\n\n**Pipedrive**  \nwhat it is: visual pipeline crm with deal stages.  \nhow i use it: simple visual tracking and activity logging.  \nwhat i like: clean pipeline views.  \nwhat i don’t like: automation features are in paid upgrades.\n\n\n\n**landing pages + conversions**\n\n**Carrd**  \nwhat it is: super cheap landing page builder.  \nhow i use it: simple pages that explain offer, who it’s for, and book calls.  \nwhat i like: cheap and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: not for full websites.\n\n**Tally / Typeform**  \nwhat they are: form builders for qualifications.  \nhow i use them: pre-call qualification so i don’t talk to tire-kickers.  \nwhat i like: quick setup.  \nwhat i don’t like: typeform gets pricey on paid plans.\n\n\n\n**analytics (only what i actually check)**\n\n**Plausible / Simple Analytics**  \nwhat they are: lightweight web analytics.  \nhow i use them: traffic sources and conversion tracking without drowning in metrics.  \nwhat i like: clear dashboards and easy to use.  \nwhat i don’t like: not as deep as Google Analytics.\n\n**Hotjar (when needed)**  \nwhat it is: session recordings + heatmaps.  \nhow i use it: when traffic is there but no conversions, watch 20 sessions, fix obvious stuff.  \nwhat i like: shows real user behavior.  \nwhat i don’t like: watch too many videos and you’ll never ship.\n\n\n\n**content + creative (cheap and good enough)**\n\n**Canva Pro**  \nwhat it is: design tool for graphics, posts, and ads.  \nhow i use it: thumbnails, reels, carousels, quick brand work.  \nwhat i like: affordable and fast.  \nwhat i don’t like: templates can feel cookie-cutter if you don’t tweak them.\n\n**Descript**  \nwhat it is: video/audio editing by editing text.  \nhow i use it: quick clips, removes, captions.  \nwhat i like: speed.  \nwhat i don’t like: heavy editing still lives in premiere/final cut.\n\n\n\n**scheduling + distribution**\n\n**Buffer**  \nwhat it is: social post scheduler.  \nhow i use it: batch my posts so i don’t open socials daily.  \nwhat i like: simple and reliable.  \nwhat i don’t like: analytics are basic.\n\n**Zapier / Make**  \nwhat they are: automation between tools.  \nhow i use them: pipe replies, forms, leads, calls into my crm so nothing gets missed.  \nwhat i like: saves time.  \nwhat i don’t like: easy to create a spaghetti mess if you’re not careful.\n\n\n\n**my cheap “works for most people” setup**\n\napollo for leads

      "text": "Honestly, watching early-stage founders \"spray and pray\" a $500 monthly ad budget into the LinkedIn algorithm hurts my soul.\n\nIf you have virtually zero budget, you don't need reach.\n\nYou need surgical precision.\n\nAnd most \"best practices\" are just polite ways to burn cash.\n\nHere are the three micro-experiments we ran over the last month to generate B2B pipeline, what worked, and what was an embarrassing waste of time.\n\n# 1. The \"Anti-Landing Page\" Reddit Drop\n\n**The Delusion:** \"If I write 'Check out my new tool!' and drop a link, they'll surely click it.\" (Narrator: They won't.)\n\n**The Experiment:** We took our core landing page copy, stripped the marketing fluff, and posted it as an ugly, text-heavy native Reddit post.\n\nNo links until the absolute bottom paragraph.\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 14 qualified signups in 24 hours.\n\n**The Alpha:** B2B buyers despise clicking external links from strangers.\n\nIf the copy is actually good, it converts astronomically better natively on the app they're already scrolling.\n\n# 2. The Over-Engineered Free Template\n\n**The Delusion:** \"We need an 8,000-word SEO Ultimate Guide that nobody will ever read to capture emails.\"\n\n**The Experiment:** We mapped our software's entire core methodology into a ridiculously detailed, free Notion workspace.\n\nThen we dropped it in private Slack/Facebook groups, saying \"Hey, we use this internal template to do \\[X\\]. Steal it.\"\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 84 downloads.\n\n9 converted directly to paid users of our actual tool within a week.\n\n**The Catch:** You literally have to give away the farm. If the template is just a disguised brochure, the community will flame you.\n\nBut if it's actually useful standalone, they'll use it, realize how exhausting doing it manually is, and happily pay for your software to automate it.\n\n# 3. Intent-Based \"Anti-Cold\" DMs\n\n**The Delusion:** Cold email still works if you just \"personalize the first line.\"\n\nPut down the Apollo scraper.\n\nIt's dead.\n\n**The Experiment:** We searched Reddit for people literally screaming into the void: *\"What's a good alternative to \\[Competitor\\]?\"* or *\"How do I solve \\[X\\]?\"* Then, we DM'd them directly.\n\nNo pitch.\n\nJust: \"Saw your post. I built something that does exactly this if you're still looking.\"\n\n**Spend:** $0.\n\n**Result:** 25 DMs sent.\n\n8 replies.\n\n3 meetings booked.\n\n**The Alpha here is intent.** You're not interrupting them; you're answering a question they explicitly asked.\n\nBut let's be real - doing this manually is for absolute suckers.\n\nSearching Reddit for 4 hours a day to find 3 leads will make you question your life choices.\n\nThe biggest lesson from sweating over a $100 budget?\n\nStop trying to do \"marketing at scale.\"\n\nDo things that fundamentally do not scale until they break, and *then* use software to automate the winner.\n\nWhat's the best $0-$100 experiment you've ran that actually didn't suck?",

The warm-up makes a huge difference.  \n  \nThe manual search grind is real though. I spent about 2 hours daily just finding relevant conversations across LinkedIn and Reddit. Built some basic alerts to speed it up, but yeah, it doesn't scale well without some automation.  \n  \nYour template idea is clever. I've seen this work when founders literally give away their internal playbook.

Most founders I see are sending plenty of outreach, they're just getting 1-2% response rates because it's generic templated stuff.  \n  \nWe shifted from cold email blasts to personalised video messages last year. Instead of 500 templated emails getting 8 replies, we send 50 videos referencing something specific about their company and get 12-15 replies. Same time investment, better maths.  \n  \nThe volume point is spot on though. I was guilty of spending weeks perfecting our deck when we were only doing 6 demos a month. Complete waste of time. Now we aim for 30+ conversations and suddenly you can actually see patterns in what objections come up or what messaging lands.  \n  \nOne thing that helped us was treating outreach like a daily non-negotiable, not something you do when you \"have time\". 30 mins every morning, no exceptions.

For example, 2 second hook, face to camera, one clear problem, one payoff, soft CTA. Once that structure works, we don’t reinvent it. We just swap variables. New hooks. Different opening lines. Different proof angles. Same pacing.\n\nIf you’re using generators, the real value isn’t auto-creating a finished ad. It’s speeding up structured variation. Canva is fine for quick edits and basic UGC style layouts, especially if you’re manually tweaking clips. But when you’re trying to spin 15 to 20 controlled variations off one concept, tools like Runable are more useful because you can template the format and swap inputs without rebuilding everything each time. It’s more about systemizing the structure than designing from scratch.\n\nThe native feel usually comes from imperfection anyway. Slight pauses, less aggressive cuts, casual framing. If it looks overly polished or templated, it dies.\n\nSo I’d focus less on finding a magic generator and more on building a repeatable format that lets you test hooks fast. The tool should reduce friction, not make the ad look smarter.\n\nThat’s usually what actually improves performance.",

      "text": "Last week we booked 10 calls purely through LinkedIn cold outreach.  \n  \nThis wasn’t about copywriting tricks or posting content. The entire week was spent figuring out how to reliably reach a lot of relevant people on LinkedIn without getting restricted.\n\nThe main problem we were trying to solve was scale. One LinkedIn account can only send so many connection requests and messages per day before you hit hard limits. So the focus was building a system that lets us reach people consistently, week after week, without depending on a single profile.\n\nWhat we ended up with is a setup that allows us to reach out to thousands of people on LinkedIn in a controlled, scalable way. Multiple accounts, careful pacing, real personalization, and automation to manage everything without manual effort.\n\nHere’s what the **numbers look like for one week** (approximate averages):\n\n• \\~3,750 connection requests sent  \n• \\~1,360 accepted (≈36%)  \n• \\~1,160 messages sent  \n• \\~590 opens (≈50%)  \n• \\~520 replies (≈45%)\n\nThat’s a 45% reply rate on cold outreach to people we’ve never interacted with before.\n\nA quick note on conversions:  \nThe reason this turned into 10 booked meetings is partly because the offer was genuinely very strong. That helped a lot. But the bigger takeaway for us is the distribution itself. Being able to put any solid offer in front of \\~3–4k relevant people every single week is where the real leverage is.  \nthat\n\nA few important details:\n\n• This can’t be done from one LinkedIn account. One account will get you capped or restricted fast. We use multiple rebranded accounts that exist purely for outreach.  \n• Personalization is not fake. We pull real context like job changes, company info, posts, and mutual connections.  \n• This has to be automated. We use custom workflows to handle sending limits, personalization, replies, and follow-ups across accounts.  \n\n\nSetup took time and experimentation (and was expensive), but once it’s running, it’s predictable.  \n\n\nIn B2B, you don’t need many wins. One good client already makes this worth it.  \n\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper into any part of this. Reach out to discuss this setup for yourself :)   \n",

I have seen so many people hit those hard limits and get their accounts restricted because they tried to do too much from a single profile. Your point about the offer being the real driver for those 10 meetings is spot on. Even the best system fails if the message does not resonate with the person on the other side.\n\nI have moved toward a similar daily loop to keep things consistent. My focus is usually on:\n\n• Using a targeted feed to only see posts from my actual prospects\n\n• Leaving real, manual comments to build some initial familiarity\n\n• Sending short, contextual DMs based on their recent activity\n\n• Tracking every follow up so nobody slips through the cracks\n\nI run this entire workflow inside Depost AI to track my warm leads and DMs in one place, which keeps the chaos manageable.

We ended up missing hot leads because they were buried in an inbox we weren't monitoring closely enough.  \n  \nThe 45% reply rate is impressive though. I'm curious how you're defining \"reply\" in your numbers. Does that include any response, or are you filtering out the \"not interested\" and \"remove me\" messages? I usually see a big gap between total replies and actually useful conversations.",

The root cause is that AI has no authoritative source of truth to query â it's working from cached web content and whatever happened to be indexed.\n\nWhat we've explored in brand consistency work: encoding the brand's authoritative data as structured, machine-queryable logic rather than web content. If your ICP, positioning, integrations, and current pricing are encoded correctly and AI systems can reference them, accuracy issues drop significantly. It's a different mental model â instead of monitoring AI output, you manage what AI can access.\n\nTactical version: publish a 'brand facts' document (not marketing copy, actual structured data) somewhere crawlable. Pricing tiers, current integrations, what you are/aren't. Update monthly. Reduces factual errors. The harder version is Meridian's approach â active correction loops.

To makes things worse - we're mid fundraising, which means the pressure to show traction is real.\n\n**The most frustraiting part: the product actually works.

Content is huminized and really contextual. My Co-founder and I ran a PR Agency before this, so we had a lot of data / know-how to train and adjust the content model. Of course that is not all, but it should be enough to get the context.\n\n**I feel like I've exhausted the obvious plays. So if you were in similar spot, I'd love to ask:**\n\n* Channels that worked for you without paid budget\n* How you leveraged happy customers to grow (referrals, case studies, etc.) \n* Anything that got you unstuck when pipeline just stopped :p\n* And maybe a weird question - how you kept sane?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

Case studies, co-created LinkedIn posts, “powered by” attribution, testimonials embedded in your on boarding. Early SaaS grows when 10 happy users become proof engines.\n\n**2) Narrow the ICP further.**  \n“AI content from industry news” is strong but for who exactly? The tighter the vertical, the easier referrals and word of mouth become. $1K–$5K MRR is usually a positioning refinement phase.\n\n**3) Build one compounding channel.**  \nCold outreach and calls are linear. You likely need one asset that compounds:  \n– Founder authority on LinkedIn  \n– A niche newsletter  \n– SEO around one specific use case  \n– Partnerships inside one vertical\n\nSomething that doesn’t reset every week.\n\n**4) Look at expansion before more acquisition.**  \nSeat growth, agency tier, white-label, premium features, increasing ARPU is often easier than increasing lead flow at this stage.\n\nYou’re probably not capped.

      "text": "Hey guys some of you might have heard about this, but google and reddit made a partnership in 2024 worth $60M per year to license Reddit's content for Google. \n\nBecause of that, literally, if you search for anything, you will see one Reddit post on the first page of Google. The other day I saw one post ranked for “best CRM for small business\" above the HubSpot blog, which is insane because there is no way a new website can outrank HubSpot if you use traditional SEO, even if you have hundreds of backlinks, because HubSpot already has a high DA they built through years. \n\nWhat’s also interesting about those searches is people trust Reddit more than Trustpilot or Yelp reviews because some businesses are faking reviews, and users are becoming aware of it. \n\nI’m not saying you should only depend on Reddit, but in today's consumer behavior, people do research about the product or service they’re buying before committing. This means watching your VSL or reading your newsletter isn’t enough anymore.\n\nMy idea is if you position your brand as the best choice on Reddit, they will see it when they do their research, and that will make their decision faster and easier. \n\nThe only problem I am seeing here is you can’t attribute your ROI from Reddit like Meta ads because it influences the decision stage, so people search about your brand or their problem, then see your brand mentioned in the discussion, and then search your brand and buy. \n\nSo I’d say  tracking branded searches and direct traffic is better to know if reddit is working or not. \n\nBtw, if you’re interested to know how others are using this opportunity, I wrote a full breakdown on Google Docs. I can't share links here so you can leave a comment and I will share it with you if you want to see actual examples ranking. \n\nThat’s my take, guys. I’d love to hear what others think about this opportunity or if you want to know if this applies to your brand, just comment what your product does and target audience in 2 lines and I will reply if it’s for you or not. ",

If you want to scale this, tools like SocListener can help you find the right posts to jump into with comments that actually convert instead of just lurking. Tracking branded searches is smart since direct ROI is hard to pin down here.",

That means your buyers are reading peer discussions before they ever hit your site.\n* **Trust factor**: Reddit content feels authentic compared to polished brand blogs. In B2B, where skepticism is high, this peer‑to‑peer validation is powerful.\n* **Long‑tail visibility**: Threads stick around and keep ranking. Unlike LinkedIn posts that fade in a week, Reddit discussions can drive traffic for years.",
