Alerts go to Slack and most of them I just ignore. The goal isn’t to reply to everything, it’s to notice the couple of threads a week I would’ve missed otherwise. When I do reply, I’m not trying to convert anyone. I’ll usually just share how I’d think about the problem or what I tried in the past. Sometimes the conversation goes nowhere, sometimes people ask follow ups or check your profile later. That’s where anything “lead-like” comes from.",

Then our subject experts review and jump in where they feel is most appropriate and helpful.\n\nIt's only been a month or so of this practice but this rhythm feels good for our team and helps us participate in a more true-to-Reddit way. \n\nAnd I'll second what other commenters have shared: focusing on quality of comments over quantity. It is evident which comments are posted just to catch fish vs which are shared out of true helpfulness, and Redditors respond accordingly. \n\n",

You'll get flagged, moderated, removed, banned, etc. Or, people will just have a low opinion of you and your product.\n\nThere are a ton of tools in this space now. I see a new one pop up every week. Most miss the point, and lack features that actually help you find relevant mentions. F5bot is okay. It's really bare bones. Same with Syften. They don't really have advanced features for contextual keyword filtering, negative keywords, keyword types, subreddit-specific monitoring, etc. They're okay if you're just starting up but not something I'd recommend for a more advanced Reddit campaign.\n\nI'd also agree with the other person here.

Switched to a combination of Google Alerts with specific Reddit operators and just setting up custom feeds in my Reddit app for key terms. Nothing fancy, but it works.  \n  \nThe key thing I learned is timing and tone. If someone posted 2 days ago, they've likely moved on or already found a solution. I try to catch threads within the first few hours. And I focus on being genuinely helpful rather than pitching. Most of my comments don't mention my company at all, I'm just sharing what's worked from experience.  \n  \nLeads come indirectly.

      "text": "I run lead gen mostly through cold email, boring b2b stuff like lending, transportation, manufacturing, insurance, and marketing agencies. Over the last few months we pushed just over **500,000 emails** to business owners and execs and I want to share what *really* happened, not twitter math or tool affiliate takes.\n\nFirst thing people get wrong is thinking volume fixes bad targeting. It doesn’t. We split those 500k across very specific slices. For lending we only emailed owners doing 1M–25M rev, mostly service businesses, titles like owner, founder, managing partner. For transportation we avoided owner operators completely and only went after fleet owners with at least 10 trucks. Manufacturing was plant managers + ops directors, not CEOs. Insurance was agency owners only, never brokers. Marketing was founders who already had 3–10 clients and were hiring.\n\nSame inboxes, same infra, different outcomes.\n\nOverall numbers across all verticals  \nOpen rate hovered around low 40s most weeks, sometimes dipped to high 30s when a domain got tired.  \nReply rate averaged **3.6–3.9 percent** depending on the vertical.  \n“Interested” replies ended up roughly **1 per 250–300 emails**, which sounds low until you realize that’s normal if you’re not lying to yourself.\n\nSome specifics that surprised me.\n\n**Lending**  \nThis was the weirdest one. Lowest reply rate overall, but the *fastest* replies. If someone was interested they replied within 12 hours, usually short messages like “how much” or “send details”. Long emails here killed performance. Anything over 65 words dropped replies hard. Also a trick people don’t mention: subject lines that looked internal worked better than curiosity. Think “RE: review for {{company}}” not “quick question”.\n\n**Transportation**  \nMost sensitive to sender reputation. One bad domain and it nukes the whole batch. Also these guys read emails on phones at 5–6am. We tested send times heavily and early mornings crushed afternoons. A line like “saw you’re running routes out of Dallas” beat any fancy personalization. Fake hyper personalization got ignored instantly.\n\n**Manufacturing**  \nLowest opens, highest quality replies. These people don’t reply unless it’s real. We once sent a batch with a small data mistake in employee count and replies literally called it out. But when it hit, it hit hard. One email sequence here generated 11 demos from 2,800 sends which is insane for manufacturing. Key thing nobody says: they hate marketing language, even soft marketing. Write like an engineer, not a sales rep.\n\n**Insurance**  \nThis one shocked me. Agency owners reply a lot but half of it is negative if you’re sloppy. We learned to put a soft exit line like “if this isn’t relevant just say no and I’ll close the loop”. That single sentence reduced angry replies by more than half and didn’t hurt positive replies at all. Also never email them on Mondays. Just don’t.\n\n**Marketing agencies**  \nHighest reply rate, lowest close rate. Tons of “sounds interesting” ghosts. You need to qualify in the first reply or you’ll waste your life. Asking one blunt question like “how are you getting clients right now” filtered serious people fast. Also founders respond more to slightly messy emails, perfect grammar actually hurt us here.\n\nUnknown stuff people never mention.\n\nEmail verification isn’t binary. “Valid” emails still bounce differently depending on provider. Google accepts garbage longer than Outlook. Outlook punishes patterns faster.  \nRotating inboxes isn’t enough, you need to rotate *intent*. Same offer phrased slightly differently kept domains alive longer.  \nFollow ups matter less than people think. Email 1 + Email 2 drove almost all results. Email 4 and 5 mostly just create spam complaints.  \nYour CRM tagging matters. We tagged replies by tone and used that to rewrite copy. Polite no’s teach you more than yes’s.\n\nBiggest takeaway after 500k sends: cold email still works, but only if you treat it like operations not hacks. Most people fail because they copy scripts without copying the thinking behind them.\n\nNot selling anything here, just sharing numbers because I wish someone did this before I burned a few domains learning it the hard way. If you’re doing cold email at scale I’m curious what vertical surprised you the most.",

          "text": "I totally get the frustration, and you are absolutely right. It’s kind of difficult to trust one agency to handle your branding efforts and another agency to handle your demand gen or lead gen efforts. These three elements should flow naturally, and not having one agency manage the entire thing is the best way to make sure the experience is broken, not to mention that you’re probably going to pay more than you should.\n\nThat being said, why this happens actually makes sense. There are a couple of reasons. First, it’s not the same skill set. Some of the agencies you’re describing are very creative. They hire the right talent to make your brand stand out, create a message that resonates, define your identity, and distribute it so this identity is visible to everyone.\n\nThe other type of agency you’re describing hires teams laser-focused on optimizing and generating business.\nAnother element is that most agencies really want clarity on your goals. When your goal is “do everything,” agencies often anticipate trouble. You might end up saying, “Yes, but I expected more leads,” and they are forced to shift focus from awareness to lead gen. Or you might say, “My brand isn’t as visible as I wanted,” and they pivot back to awareness, reducing leads. Basically, agencies are used to clients being unclear about what they want, and trying to do too much in one shot ends up causing constant changes in direction until things break, or worse, until the agency gets fired.\nThat may explain what you’re seeing. That being said, I’m totally with you. I’m a huge believer that campaigns should be properly integrated: start with awareness and go all the way down to lead gen.\n\nMy recommendation would be to first work with an agency to define your brand: what it should look like, what you stand for, and what your values are. Once that’s clear, work with a dimensional agency to build truly integrated campaigns that cover the entire customer journey, properly integrating all channels, not just making branding consistent, but ensuring the right message reaches the right audience with a perfect flow, so no customer is mishandled.\n\nOnce you have this in place, you can have the same agency manage distribution for your brand awareness elements. This part is actually easy. Be explicit with them: the goal of this brand awareness campaign is purely impressions and visibility for the right audience. You’re not trying to generate leads from this campaign; other campaigns will handle lead gen.\n\nIf you have the resources, it’s even better to do this in-house. If you lack experience, there are plenty of frameworks available. If you type “integrated campaign framework” into Google, you’ll find many that are easy to use. My favorite one is the RIO framework, but there are many others.\n\nIf you rely on an agency, make sure they integrate everything properly and don’t go rogue: building a patchwork of random activities that may generate some short-term leads but will be a disaster to manage in the long run.",

It’s that most of them were built with one core DNA, and that bias shows up in how they operate.\n\nBrand-led agencies tend to come from creative or comms backgrounds, so they think in terms of storytelling, positioning, and visibility. Demand-led agencies usually come from performance marketing or RevOps, so everything gets reduced to leads, CPL, and pipeline math.\n\nBoth are optimizing for what they know how to measure.\n\nThe problem is structural. Brand teams get judged on perception. Demand teams get judged on revenue. So agencies mirror that split and pick a lane.\n\nBut for a $20M ARR SaaS company, those two can’t really be separated anymore.\n\nBrand creates trust and familiarity, which lowers CAC and improves conversion.  \nDemand captures that trust and turns it into pipeline.\n\nIf you only run brand, you look great but struggle to prove ROI.  \nIf you only run demand, you burn budget chasing cold buyers forever.\n\nThe companies that scale well usually treat brand as demand infrastructure, not a separate function. Things like category POV, strong messaging, customer proof, and thought leadership directly improve ad performance, outbound response rates, and sales conversations.\n\nSo it’s less “brand vs demand” and more “brand feeding demand.”\n\nYou’re not looking in the wrong places. It’s just that many agencies are specialized silos. You probably want a team that thinks in terms of full-funnel or revenue marketing rather than either creative or performance alone.",

We spent months on a creative LinkedIn campaign with custom graphics, clever hooks, and trendy formats. It got decent engagement but generated maybe 3 qualified leads.\n\nMeanwhile, our boring weekly email with a simple case study breakdown and one actionable takeaway has driven 40+ demos in the same timeframe. Same thing with our plain LinkedIn posts that just share a customer problem and how we solved it. Zero creativity, just consistent value.\n\nI'm starting to think B2B marketers chase creativity because it's more fun, not because it works better. The fundamentals are boring but they actually move pipeline.\n\nOur best performing content is the stuff that feels too simple or repetitive. Our buyers don't care about creative, they care about whether we understand their problem.\n\nThe creative campaigns get more internal praise and look better in portfolio decks. The boring stuff actually closes deals. That gap is wild tbh.\n\nWhat boring tactics are driving results for you?",

The stuff that feels embarrassingly simple usually works best because decision makers are drowning in noise and just want to know if you can actually help them.  \n  \nWe tested this directly with outreach last quarter. The \"creative\" sequence with GIFs and clever subject lines got opened more but converted terribly. The plain text emails that looked like they came from a real person and referenced a specific problem we noticed at their company converted at nearly 4x the rate.  \n  \nI think the issue is that creativity in B2B often becomes about us (look how clever we are) instead of them (here's your problem and a solution). Your case study emails work because they're showing proof, not personality.  \n  \nThe repetition point you mentioned is interesting too. I used to worry about sending similar content too often, but our buyers aren't reading everything we publish. They need to see the same core message multiple times before it clicks, especially for high ticket stuff where the buying cycle is long.  \n  \nWhat's the typical time from first email open to booked demo for you? Curious if the boring approach also shortens the cycle or just increases volume.",

      "text": "alright posting this because i keep seeing the same recycled advice everywhere and it honestly doesnt match what happens in real businesses, we run a b2b operation and cold email alone brings us **200 to 300 plus inbound leads every single month**, real companies in lending saas transportation manufacturing and marketing, not course buyers not wanna be founders, actual decision makers with budgets.\n\nthe first mistake people make is thinking cold email starts with copy, **it starts with who you target**, and for us that is always **c suite and executives only**, ceo founder co founder managing partner cfo head of growth director level minimum, anything below that just slows deals down and kills reply quality.\n\n**how we actually pull leads**  \nwe use **Apollo and RocketReach together**, never just one, inside apollo we go very specific, united states only, employee count usually **10 to 200**, industry filtered tight depending on the offer, then we layer titles like **CEO, Founder, Co Founder, Managing Partner, CFO, Head of Growth, Director**, then comes the most important part which most people skip, manual exclusions, we remove banks, credit unions, nonprofits, trucking associations, churches, foundations, anything that cant buy or needs a board vote.\n\nexample from last month, we targeted lending companies and pulled **12,400 contacts** initially, sounds great right, after exclusions and cross checking with rocketreach that list dropped to **6,100**, then after verification it dropped again to **3,900**, that smaller list outperformed every bigger list weve ever sent.\n\n**email verification is not optional**  \nwe dont trust one verifier ever, we run the list through our verifier then we break it down by provider, **gmail outlook yahoo corporate**, if gmail bounces even smell risky we kill the batch, we literally deleted **8,400 manufacturing leads** last month because early testing bounced too much, rebuilt a tighter list of **3,100 execs**, that list alone generated **47 replies and 11 booked calls**, this is where most people lose before they even send.\n\n**inboxes matter more than copy**  \nwe use **Puzzle Inbox, Slicey, and Premium Inboxes**, typical setup is **3 inboxes per domain** sending **15 to 20 emails per inbox per day**, so one domain does around **45 to 60 emails daily**, when we want to scale we dont touch volume we add domains, one saas campaign ran on **18 domains with 54 inboxes**, sending just under **900 emails per day**, deliverability stayed clean for weeks.\n\nif youre sending 100 emails from one inbox youre already done you just havent felt it yet.\n\n**sending tools**  \nwe rotate between **Instantly and Smartlead**, instantly when we want speed and simplicity, smartlead when reply routing matters more, no links no images no tracking pixels, plain text only, first email is intentionally simple and slightly confusing.\n\nexample first email that still works insanely well  \nhey john quick question are you the right person for partnerships at company name\n\nthats it.\n\n**copy that actually gets replies**  \nwe write like humans not marketers, structure is always **relevance credibility low pressure question**, one of our highest performing emails for a transportation company had a typo in the first line and still booked **9 calls in two weeks**, people reply to intent not perfection.\n\nexample  \nhey mike saw you run operations at a mid sized freight company and figured id ask  \nwe help transportation teams book inbound demos without hiring more sales people  \nopen to me sending over how it works or should i disappear\n\nno pitch deck no calendar link no pressure.\n\n**crm and reply handling**  \nwe keep it boring on purpose, **HubSpot or GoHighLevel**, every reply is tagged manually at first, positive neutral negative out of office unsubscribe, this is how patterns show up, last month we noticed **lending CEOs reply between 6am and 8am eastern**, while **saas founders reply late night around 9 to 11pm**, we adjusted send windows and reply volume jumped without changing copy at all.\n\n**real numbers so this doesnt sound like fluff**  \nmarketing agency campaign  \n**22,400 emails sent**  \n**312 total replies**  \n**84 positive replies**  \n**19 booked calls**  \n**4 closed deals**  \naverage deal size **7k monthly**\n\nfunding company campaign  \n**15,000 emails sent**  \n**61 replies**  \n**14 asked directly for options**\n\nall cold email.\n\nlast thing ill say is this, cold email is not dead and its not about tricks, **its about clean data slow sending boring copy and respecting the inbox**, if youre getting zero replies its not because the channel is broken its because something upstream is.\n\nhappy to answer questions but if your inbox setup is trash templates wont save you.",

We had the same realisation about six months back.  \n  \nOne thing that's worked really well for us alongside email is layering in video messages to the people who respond positively. When someone replies saying \"yeah tell me more\" or asks a question, instead of another text email we send a quick personalised video walking through exactly what we mentioned. It's maybe 45 seconds, references their company specifically, and the conversion from interested reply to booked call went from around 30% to nearly 60% for us.  \n  \nThe reason it works is the same as your boring copy approach. It's human, low friction, and doesn't feel like you're being pushed through a sales machine.  \n  \nCurious though, when you get those positive replies back, are you jumping straight on a call or do you nurture them a bit first with more context?",

Meaning, you create it, you eventualy post it once, and at the end of the story, it sits on a shelf and starts acumulating dust.\n\nNow, that data is a little bit old. It seems to be 2016, so 10 years old, so it might have changed entierly since then, but my gut feeling is this is still very much true today.\n\nI don't know if it's 60, 70%, but I can tell that a good portion of what my marketing team is creating in terms of content is just sitting there on a shelf.\n\nAnd if I'm being totally transparent, it's not just the marketing team. We are in a B2B SaaS, so we also have a bunch of sales engineers that like to create their own content, white paper, that's not always on brand nor beautifull, by the way.\n\nAnd they create it once for one customer, send it to the marketing team as the new shiny object to use everywhere, and then it just sits on the shelf and no one ever uses it.\n\nI feel like we waste tons of money and efforts by creating a bunch of stuff that never gets used.\n\nIs it just me or is that a common trend? Do you guys have that experience as well?",

It gets made without a specific channel, owner, or moment in the funnel to plug it into, so it gets posted once and dies. The sales engineer one off PDFs are a classic too. Useful for that one deal, but nobody knows how to turn it into something repeatable.\n\nWhat usually fixes it is a simple rule. Don’t create anything unless you already know where it will be used and who owns distribution. And instead of making new stuff every time, build a few core assets and intentionally break them into smaller pieces for sales, email, website, and social.\n\nIt’s less a content problem and more a workflow and reuse problem.\n\nWe talk about this kind of demand gen and content reuse on r/LeadGenSEA too if you want more examples.",

Most content jumps straight to “our platform does X.”\n- It’s too long, too formal, too slow — modern buyers want clarity, not corporate essays.\n- It’s created without distribution in mind — content teams ship assets that sales never use and marketing never repurposes.\n- It’s not SEO‑aligned — meaning it never ranks, never gets discovered, and never compounds.\n- It’s not tied to revenue — no clear path from content → conversation → opportunity.\n\nThis is why 60–80% of B2B content sits in SharePoint or HubSpot folders untouched.\n\n---\n\nThe deeper truth\nUnused content isn’t a production problem.  \nIt’s a strategy and workflow problem.\n\nWhen content is built around:\n- buyer pains  \n- search intent  \n- daily workflows  \n- evergreen problems  \n- high‑demand solutions  \n\n…it gets used, shared, ranked, and repurposed automatically.\n\nThis is exactly why your approach — daily SEO‑optimized content tied to high‑demand B2B solutions — works.

I’m not some marketing veteran, but from what I’ve seen, most places just throw stuff at the wall because “the competitor did it,” or “the boss had an idea,” or “a customer asked for it.” No plan, no strategy, just reaction after reaction. And then we wonder why nothing sticks.\n\nI’ve been digging into integrated campaigns lately, trying out different frameworks, and the one that’s actually *clicked* for me is the RIO Integrated Campaign Framework. It forces you to think about content *differently*. Instead of just tossing a brief to the content team after everything’s already decided, you bring them in *early*, like, when you’re still figuring out the strategy. That way, the content actually *fits* the campaign, instead of feeling like an afterthought.\n\nNow, for me, it’s not a huge change. I’m basically a one-person band, handling everything from strategy to content (with a little freelance help). But I’ve seen bigger teams skip this step, and honestly? It’s a mess. Content ends up disconnected, campaigns feel patchy, and everyone’s scrambling to make sense of it all.\n\nSo yeah, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: **involve your content people from the start.** It’s not just about making *more* content, it’s about making content that *works*.

What you need for proactive situations is to use the right methodology when creating the queries and the correct framework, and it helps if the tool alerts you when you reach a certain threshold (being impressions, interactions, volume of mentions, or sensibilty). But from my PoV, the key is to create correctly those parameters for the alerts, so you dont need to be checking a dashboard or jumping when it's too late. There are specific courses that can teach you that.",

Some tools like Trumpet seem to focus on keeping the entire post-demo experience in one place.\n\nFor people who’ve used a Digital Sales Room, how would you explain it in simple terms? When does it actually add value, and when is it overkill?\n\nWould love to hear how people are using them in real sales workflows.",

      "text": "Everyone says \"Reddit Ads are cheap.\"\n\nEveryone also says \"Redditors hate ads.\"\n\nSo I decided to talk to this guy who burnt $2,000 to find out which is true.\n\nHere is the exact breakdown of his campaign for a B2B SaaS tool.\n\n# The Campaign Setup\n\n* **Budget:** $2,000\n* **Duration:** 30 days\n* **Targeting:** Subreddits (r/marketing, r/entrepreneur, r/sales)\n* **Creative:** 3 variations (Meme style, \"Native\" text style, Standard banner)\n\n# The Metrics (The Good, The Bad, The Ugly)\n\n**1. Impressions (The Good)**\n\n* **CPM:** $4.50 (Cheaper than LinkedIn's $30+ CPM)\n* **Total Impressions:** \\~440k\n* *verdict:* Reaching people on Reddit is incredibly cheap.\n\n**2. Clicks (The Bad)**\n\n* **CPC:** $0.85\n* **CTR:** 0.52%\n* *verdict:* Getting clicks isn't hard, but it's not \"high intent.\" A lot of fat-finger clicks or curiosity clicks.\n\n**3. Conversion (The Ugly)**\n\n* **Signups:** 14\n* **CAC:** $142.85\n* **Paying Customers:** 1\n* **ROI:** \\-85%\n\n# The \"Oh Sh*t\" Realization 💡\n\nWhile the ads were running, he spent 20 minutes a day manually commenting on threads in the *same* subreddits.\n\n* **Cost:** $0\n* **Time:** 10 hours total\n* **Signups:** 42\n* **Paying Customers:** 6\n\n**The Difference?**\n\n**Trust.**\n\nOn Reddit, an ad is an interruption.\n\nA comment is a contribution.\n\nWhen he tried to \"scale\" with ads, he lost the one thing that made Reddit work: **Authenticity.**\n\n# Key Lessons for SaaS Founders\n\n1. **Banner Blindness is Real:** Redditors are pro-level scrollers. Unless your ad looks *exactly* like a post, they skip it.\n2. **Comments > Creatives:** The \"real\" ad slot on Reddit isn't the feed. It's the comment section. That's where decisions are made.\n3. **Intent Mining vs. Interruption:** Ads target *demographics* (people interested in marketing). Comments target *intent* (people asking \"how do I do marketing?\"). The latter converts 10x better.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you have a venture budget and need brand awareness? Sure, Reddit Ads are cheap eyeballs. If you are bootstrapping and need **customers**? Keep your wallet closed. Open the comment section instead.\n\n\n\n**Has anyone else cracked the code on Reddit Ads for B2B? Or is it just a graveyard for ad spend?**",

If you want to get results, this starts with understanding how targeting and placement works.\n\nAudience Targeting:\n\n* Communities: Highly relevant targeting if you're targeting qualified communities because they are native users.\n* Keyword: Traffic could be from non-native Reddit users (e.g., Google search), so depending on the keywords used, the quality could be not as relevant as communities.\n* Interest: Too broad, not worth testing it.\n\nAds Placement:\n\n* Conversation: Conversations attract both native and non-native Reddit users who find posts through referrals from organic search and AI suggestions. These platforms don't link people to Reddit communities. They link people to the exact posts that answer their question.\n* Feed (the home and community feeds with various posts): Mostly native users and overall ads are more visible than conversation.\n\nConversation Ads look quite small and traffic is not as relevant as feed ads placement for communities. I usually like to use this placement for remarketing audiences or keyword targeting to be sure I have more qualified traffic. When people search on Google and land on Reddit threads, intent is higher so Conversation ads can work better.\n\n**If you enable both placements, most of your budget flows to Conversation Ads because the CPM is cheaper.**\n\nMy go-to setup:\n\n* Communities with Feed placement only.\n* Keyword targeting or Remarketing with Conversation ads placement.",

Some reps looked fried by day two sprinting booth to booth. Others were oddly calm, ducking out for coffees not stressing at all.\n\nI keep wondering if that calm comes from experience or if they just did the work before hopping on the plane.

          "text": "Hey everyone! So, I've been thinking a lot lately about marketing a product that's more of a \"nice-to-have\" than an absolute necessity in the B2B space. It's definitely a different ballgame, right? You can't just hit them with the \"you *need* this\" urgency. Instead, it feels like you have to gently nudge them towards seeing the value.\n\nMy current approach is focusing on how this \"nice-to-have\" can actually make their jobs easier or more enjoyable. We're trying to highlight the benefits that might not be immediately obvious, but would still be really appreciated. Think about how it could improve employee satisfaction or boost team morale.\n\nWe're also exploring ways to showcase its potential to free up valuable time for their teams. If your product can help them focus on more critical tasks, that's a huge win, even if it wasn't on their immediate radar. Ultimately, it's about demonstrating how it enhances their overall business environment in a positive, albeit not critical, way. It's a subtle art, for sure!",

          "text": "Reading your post felt surreal. I genuinely had the reaction of “wait… did I write this?” You are absolutely spot on. This is what I’ve been repeating for years.\nYes, of course, every channel can always be optimized.\nYour emails can have better subject lines, a cleaner database, stronger CTAs.\n\n\nYour LinkedIn ads can use better visuals, sharper targeting, smarter timing.\nYour events can benefit from a bigger booth, better staffing, smoother execution.\n\nBut let’s be honest.\nThose tweaks rarely change the game. They might give you a few extra points of performance here and there. What usually makes the real difference is something else entirely.\n\n\nWhat’s missing most of the time is proper integration across channels. And this is exactly where integrated marketing campaigns become critical.\nYour customers do not live inside your channels. They live in their own world.\n\nThey see you in the street. On their phone. On social media. In their inbox. In articles. On billboards. On TV. On the radio. What builds trust and brand preference is not one single touchpoint performing well in isolation. It’s the accumulation of all these interactions over time that creates familiarity, credibility, and eventually preference.\n\n\nAnd this is also where I think a lot of CFOs get it wrong.\nBeing able to read a P&L or a channel performance dashboard does not mean you understand how marketing actually works. Killing or scaling channels purely based on attribution models misses the bigger picture of how people experience brands in real life.\n\n\nFor me, the real eye-opener came when I started looking for a way to properly structure campaigns. I had read about models like PESO and the broader SOSTAC theories. They are solid, but often very theoretical. At the time, I couldn’t afford expensive marketing courses, so I was relying purely on free public resources. That’s when I came across the RIO integrated campaign framework, and it genuinely changed how I think about marketing.\n\nIt forced me to stop looking at performance purely through a channel ROI lens and start thinking in terms of customer experience and campaign coherence. It made painfully obvious how vital true integration is if you want your marketing to actually work in the real world.\n\n\nSo yes. The post you wrote is spot on.\nThanks for putting into words what a lot of marketers intuitively feel but struggle to articulate clearly.",

My bad.\n\n\nYes, of course, you can and should measure single-channel performance. Optimizing at channel level matters. You want your email to perform well as email. Your ads to perform well as ads. Your events to perform well as events.\n\nBut that should never be the full story. You need to look at the bigger picture.\n\nAnd honestly, I think multi-touch attribution is close to a utopia. I’ve worked in three different companies that either wanted to implement it or actually tried to roll it out. On paper, it sounds amazing. You measure exactly how each channel contributes. You finally get “the truth” behind performance.\nIn reality, it’s a nightmare.\n\nIt takes forever to configure properly. The data is fragile. The models are complex. And once you finally have something that works, anyone can tweak the weightings and percentages to tell whatever story they want to tell. Suddenly, attribution becomes less about truth and more about politics.\n\nThat’s why, for me, the only approach that really makes sense is campaign-level attribution. Kill the whole first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch battle altogether.\nLook at campaigns as coherent systems. Measure whether Campaign A, as a whole, created impact. Then optimize channels inside the campaign for execution quality, not for credit-taking.\n\n\nJust my two cents.",

My long-term goal is to build something that lets me work from home while my wife works full time, so I can be there for our kids and help care for our special needs daughter.\n\nHaving flexibility and stability is extremely important to my family. It’s very difficult trying to work around each other’s schedules to provide adequate supervision and care around the clock for our daughter. We don’t have outside help or government assistance. It’s just my wife and I.\n\nI’m also not working at the moment. I left my previous employer so my wife could work full time while I job hunt and watch the kids.\n\nA little about me:\n\n1.) I already have experience with scripting\n\n2.) I’m comfortable with prospecting\n\n3.) I have some cold calling skills\n\n4.) I’m not afraid of outreach or rejection\n\nWhat I’m hoping to learn from you all:\n\n1.) What’s the best way to get started in local lead generation with little to no experience?\n\n2.) I’m mainly interested in service-based lead gen for local companies in my area.\n\n3.) How did you land your first client?\n\n4.) What beginner mistakes should I watch out for?\n\n5.) What would you recommend learning first?\n\n6.) What niches would you recommend looking into?\n\n7.) What tools are best to start out with (preferably free or cheap)?\n\nRight now, I’m seriously considering targeting epoxy flooring companies as my main niche. Part of the reason is because I’ve worked with epoxy before and have done flooring in the past, so I already understand the product, the process, and what customers usually care about. I’ve checked with Google Maps and have seen there are plenty of companies in my area with little to no reviews and plenty more with no online presence. \n\nThat said, I’m still not 100% sure if epoxy will pan out long-term or scale well, so I’m very open to hearing other niche ideas too.\n\nI’m motivated, willing to put in the work, and in this for the long haul. I’m not looking for shortcuts. I just want to avoid wasting time going down the wrong paths.\n\nAny advice, resources, or personal experiences would mean a lot.\n\nAND PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO SELL ME ON YOUR AI PRODUCT. NOT INTERESTED. \n\nTIA y’all!",

The margins are high enough that they can afford to pay for leads, and you're right that most are invisible online.  \n  \nSince you're comfortable with cold calling, here's what I'd do first. Ring 10 epoxy companies in your area and ask them straight up how they currently get customers. You'll learn more in those conversations than any course will teach you. Most will actually tell you because they're not used to people asking smart questions.  \n  \nFor your first client, don't sell lead gen as a service yet. Offer to run a small test campaign for just the cost of ad spend (if you go that route) or do it purely on commission per lead. This removes all their risk and gets you a case study fast.  \n  \nTools to start: Google Business Profile optimisation costs nothing and actually works for local. If you want to run ads later, Google Local Services Ads convert well for home services.  \n  \nOne thing I'd caution against is building sites you don't own yet. Some people do the \"rank and rent\" model but it takes months to see results, and you need cash flow now.  \n  \nWhat's your plan for actually generating the leads once you land a client?",

For finding those local service businesses to target (like your epoxy flooring idea), I came across SMB Sales Boost recently and it looks like it could be useful for building out prospect lists. It's basically a database that shows you newly registered businesses in your area so you can reach out to them early before they're getting hit by everyone else.\n\nOne thing I'd add about epoxy flooring as a niche - it's pretty seasonal in some areas and the market can be saturated depending on where you are. Might be worth also looking at HVAC, plumbing, or electrical companies since they tend to have more consistent year-round demand and higher customer lifetime value. The fact that you have hands-on experince with epoxy is definitely valuable though, maybe use that as your starting point to land the first client and build proof of concept before branching out.",

That knowledge alone puts you ahead of 90% of people starting out because you can actually speak the language when talking to these business owners. Don't overthink the niche selection, just commit and go.\n\nYour scripting and cold calling background is honestly the perfect skill set for this. With our clients who sell lead gen services to local businesses, the ones who crush it early all started the same way. They picked up the phone, called local companies with crappy online presence, and offered to bring them leads. No fancy pitch deck, no website needed, just \"hey I can get your phone ringing, want to try it out.\" Landing that first client is always the hardest part so consider doing the first one free or on a pay per lead basis just to get proof that your system works.\n\nFor tools on a budget, grab Apollo for prospecting and building contact lists of local business owners. Use Google My Business to identify companies with weak online presence like you're already doing. For the actual lead gen delivery, start with a simple landing page through Carrd or a free WordPress setup paired with Google Local Service Ads. Those convert like crazy for home services and the barrier to entry is low.\n\nBiggest mistake I see beginners make is trying to offer everything to everyone. Stick with epoxy flooring, learn exactly what works to generate those leads, document your results obsessively, then use that proof to sign paying clients in the same niche. Rinse and repeat until you've got a system that runs predictably before even thinking about adding another niche.",
