We've found a lot of success by focusing on super-targeted engagement within niche communities, like you mentioned. The key is finding relevant conversations happening in real-time. For us, that's been across Reddit, X, and LinkedIn. The challenge we faced was the sheer volume of posts and comments. Just searching for keywords wasnt cutting it – too much irrelevant stuff. We ended up building a tool to solve this. It helps us filter out the noise and only notifies us when theres a genuine opportunity to contribute to a relevant discussion or connect with a potential customer. It’s been a game-changer for finding warm leads through organic outreach, because we can catch people actively discussing problems our product solves. Plus, having some suggested replies ready to go saves a ton of time. To answer your question directly, communities have been the biggest driver of real opportunities for us. Its about being helpful, adding value to the conversation, and building relationships. Outbound still has its place, but its gotta be warm and informed by insights gathered from those community interactions.",

Your list is basically the symptom list.What’s worked best for us lately is boring but reliable: pick a tight ICP, pick one problem they already admit they have, and build one path that goes from “I saw this” to “I want to talk” without switching voices 5 times. If LinkedIn posts don’t lead to DMs, the post is usually too generic, or the CTA is weird. If emails get no replies, they’re written for the sender, not the buyer.Also agree with the commenter calling out “activity cosplay.” If you’re not getting real convos, shrink the target list and go deeper. 20–50 accounts with real angles beats blasting 2,000 people with “quick question.”If you’re trying to fix the whole system (not just tweak copy), having someone come in and force alignment on ICP, offer, and what counts as a qualified opportunity can save months. I’ve seen Demand Revenue be solid for that kind of “make the machine actually connect” work without turning it into a million random tactics.",

      "text": "I know, I know. \"Webinars are so 2020.\"\n\nEveryone's tired of the 45-minute pitch disguised as education.\n\nBut here's the thing - the companies that are doing webinars RIGHT are seeing insane numbers:\n\n* 20-40% of webinar attendees convert to trial or paid\n* Average cost per attendee: $30-50 (vs $80-150 for a cold lead)\n* Webinar leads close 30% faster than cold leads because they already understand the product\n\nThe difference between a webinar that converts and one that gets 12 attendees and 0 signups? It's not the topic.\n\nIt's the format.\n\n# The old way (what everyone's tired of):\n\n\"Join our webinar: How \\[Product\\] Helps You Do \\[Thing\\]\"\n\nThis is a demo with a calendar invite.\n\nNobody wants this.\n\nThe title screams \"we're going to sell you something for 45 minutes.\"\n\nAttendance rates: 15-20%.\n\nConversion: near zero.\n\n# The new way (workshops that actually grow your SaaS):\n\n**Teach something valuable. Use your product as the tool to teach it.**\n\nThe product isn't the topic. The SKILL is the topic. Your product is just the instrument.\n\nExamples:\n\n|**If You Sell...**|**Don't Run This Webinar**|**Run This Workshop**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Email marketing tool|\"How Our Tool Sends Better Emails\"|\"Write Email Sequences That Convert: Live Workshop\"|\n|Analytics platform|\"Demo of Our Dashboard\"|\"Find Your Biggest Revenue Leak in 30 Minutes\"|\n|Reddit lead gen (SleepLeads)|\"How SleepLeads Works\"|\"Find 50 Qualified Leads on Reddit in 60 Minutes — Live\"|\n|CRM|\"Tour of Our CRM Features\"|\"Build a Sales Pipeline From Scratch: Workshop\"|\n|Design tool|\"Canva Product Tour\"|\"Design a Landing Page That Converts in 45 Minutes\"|\n\nSee the difference? The workshop title promises a SKILL or RESULT. The product just happens to be what you use during the session.\n\n# The 5-step playbook:\n\n**1. Pick a problem, not a feature**\n\nYour audience doesn't care about your feature set.\n\nThey care about their problem.\n\nBuild the workshop around solving that problem live.\n\nAsk yourself: \"If I removed my product name from the title, would people still want to attend?\"\n\nIf yes, you've got a good topic.\n\n**2. Make it hands-on**\n\n\"Webinar\" = passive. Someone talks, you watch. \"Workshop\" = active. You follow along and build something.\n\nWorkshops convert 3-5x better because attendees experience the product while learning.\n\nThey don't need a separate trial, they already used it.\n\nGive attendees a temporary account or free access during the session.\n\nLet them follow along in real-time.\n\nBy the end, they've already built something with your tool.\n\nThe switching cost is now in YOUR favor.\n\n**3. Keep it short (45 min max)**\n\nNobody has 90 minutes for your webinar.\n\nRespect their time.\n\n* 5 min: quick intro, set expectations\n* 30 min: hands-on workshop (the meat)\n* 5 min: Q&A\n* 5 min: \"here's how to keep going\" (your soft CTA)\n\n**4. The soft CTA (not a pitch)**\n\nAt the end, don't do a 10-minute sales pitch. Instead:\n\n>\n\nThat's it.\n\nThey already experienced the value.\n\nThe CTA is just \"keep going.\" No \"buy now,\" no \"limited time offer.\"\n\n**5. Record and repurpose**\n\nThe live workshop is one event.\n\nThe recording is an evergreen asset.\n\n* Post the recording on YouTube (SEO value)\n* Clip highlights for LinkedIn and Twitter\n* Use the transcript as a blog post\n* Gate the recording behind an email capture for ongoing leads\n\nOne 45-minute workshop can generate content and leads for months.\n\n# Where to find attendees (without spending $5k on ads):\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. \"I'll run a great workshop... but who's coming?\"\n\n**1. Reddit threads** People posting \"how do I do X?\" in your niche subreddits are your workshop audience.\n\nDrop a helpful comment and mention you're running a live workshop on exactly that topic.\n\n**2. LinkedIn posts** Post about the problem your workshop solves. End with \"I'm running a free workshop on this - drop a 🔥 if you want the link.\"\n\n**3. Your existing email list** Even if it's 200 people. An email with \"Free live workshop: \\[Skill\\]\" outperforms any newsletter you'll ever write.\n\n**4. Partner with someone in an adjacent space** Find someone who serves the same audience but isn't a competitor.\n\nCo-host the workshop.\n\nYou both promote to your lists.\n\nDouble the attendance.\n\n# The numbers that matter:\n\n|**Metric**|**Good**|**Great**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Registration → attendance rate|30-40%|50%+|\n|Attendee → trial signup|15-20%|30%+|\n|Attendee → paid conversion|5-10%|15%+|\n|Cost per attendee|$30-50|Under $20|\n\nCompare that to cold outreach where you're paying $80-150 per lead who may or may not even have the problem you solve.\n\n# Common mistakes:\n\n**1. Making it a demo in disguise.** People can smell this. If your \"workshop\" is just your sales engineer clicking through the product, attendance drops to zero by minute 10.\n\n**2. Running it once and giving up.** The first webinar always has low attendance. The third one is where you find your groove. The tenth one is where it becomes a machine.\n\n**3. Not following up.** Someone attended your workshop but didn't convert? Follow up with the recording, a summary of what they built, and an offer to continue. This alone can double your conversion rate.\n\n**4. Overcomplicating the tech.** You don't need a $500/month webinar platform. Zoom + a landing page + an email reminder sequence. That's it.\n\n**5. Gating the workshop behind too much info.** Name and email. That's all you need to register. Every additional field drops registration by 10-15%.\n\n# The bottom line:\n\nWebinars-as-demos are dead. Workshops-as-education are the best-kept growth secret in SaaS.\n\nYou teach something valuable. You use your product as the tool. Attendees experience value before they ever see a pricing page. And the content lives forever as recordings, clips, and blog posts.\n\nIf you're spending $3k/month on ads and getting lukewarm leads, try running one free workshop per month instead. The leads are warmer, the conversion is higher, and the cost is basically your time.\n\nAnyone here running workshops for their SaaS? What's working?",

Preparing an offer that participants can claim. Here I talk about first-step offer that converts at 50-80% to delivery of main offer. In IT these often are things, sucha as mini workshops or audits.\n\n2. Actuall follow-up after the webinar. No follow-up, no sales.

Then in the last 10 minutes, I'd pick 2-3 and solve them live using the product. That made it feel even more hands-on and the conversion rate went up noticeably.  \n  \nThe follow-up piece you mentioned is huge too. We started sending a Loom video the next day to non-converters, basically saying \"here's what you built yesterday, here's how to take it further\" with a personal walkthrough. Takes 3 minutes to record but the response has been solid.  \n  \nWhat's your take on workshop frequency? I've been doing monthly but wondering if bi-weekly would build more momentum or just lead to burnout.",

I’m specifically looking for software, templates, or platforms that help create professional, branded client reports, beyond the standard custodian-generated performance PDFs.\n\nThe default reports cover account performance, but they don’t provide much narrative context, goal tracking, or visual clarity. My objective is to create reports that:\n\n• Clearly communicate portfolio performance and allocation  \n• Include goal tracking and progress metrics  \n• Visualize risk exposure and asset breakdowns  \n• Provide space for advisor commentary and planning insights  \n• Are easy to update quarterly without rebuilding from scratch  \n• Support branding and white-label customization\n\nI’m researching tools that balance strong data visualization with workflow efficiency.\n\nFor those running RIAs or working in wealth management:\n\n1. What reporting tools are you using?\n2. Are you designing reports internally or using pre-built templates?\n3. What sections have you found most valuable to include beyond raw performance numbers?\n4. Any platforms that integrate well with custodians and reduce manual formatting?\n\nI’m trying to build a reporting system that strengthens client communication, reinforces trust, and differentiates my firm and not just generate another PDF.\n\nAppreciate any specific tool recommendations, workflows, or examples you’re willing to share.",

Stop selling dev. Start selling a business result\nInstead of:\n-“I build websites and web apps”\nSay:\n“I help B2B companies increase conversions / reduce ops cost / launch faster by building X.”\n\nSame skills. Completely different perceived value.\n\n2. Pick a narrow ICP (even temporarily)\nHigh-ticket clients come from relevance, not reach.\nExamples:\n-SaaS founders post-funding\n-Service businesses doing £50k–£500k/mo\n-Internal tools for ops-heavy businesses\n\nWhen someone reads your offer and thinks “this is for me”, price resistance drops.\n\n3. Productise your service\nCustom dev = low trust, lots of comparison.\nProductised = easier buying decision.\n\nExample:\n- “MVP in 30 days for SaaS founders\n- “Conversion-focused B2B website rebuild”\n- “Internal dashboard for ops teams”\n\nClear scope → clear price → better clients.\n\n4. Use proof without needing massive case studies\nIf you don’t have big logos yet:\n    - Break down how you’d solve a real business problem\n    - Share teardown-style posts (what’s broken, how you’d fix it, why it matters)\n    - Show thinking, not just code\n\nDecision-makers buy confidence and clarity.\n\n5. Go where buyers already are\nHigh-ticket dev clients usually come from:\n- Warm intros / partnerships (designers, marketers, agencies)\n - LinkedIn (commenting intelligently, not pitching)\n- Founder communities (not freelancing platforms)\n\nCold outreach works too — but only when your message speaks to a specific pain.\n\nIf you want, DM me:\n- who you ideally want to work with\n- what type of projects you want more of\n\nHappy to help you sharpen the positioning.",

What eventually worked was hanging out on Reddit in the right communities and chiming in whenever someone had a problem my app could solve, or when they were talking about stuff related to it if there was an organic fit I'd pitch my app. It was super time consuming constantly scanning Reddit for the right conversations. Thats why I built a tool that does that for me, now it finds relevant convos across Reddit, Twitter and LinkedIn. It started as an internal thing but I figured other people would find it useful too.

With knowledge/content of something they need to know.\n\n2. You have to be able to demonstrate your competency - think of webinar with a demo.\n\n3. Build trust. Again - customer quotes, case studies, obviously compelling demos.\n\n4. Sell first step offers. These offers are designed to get you in conversation with buying group. Think of mini workshops, product discovery workshop, audit, etc.\n\n  \nThe best and only way to achieve all 4 things in one go is to run webinars.\n\n  \nHowever, before you can do these 4 things, you have to make 4 strategic choices.\n\n1. Specialization. You will struggle to get any attention unless the competency you have is relevant to your audience. You just cannot profitably sell generic software development and make reasonable profits.\n\n2. ICP - ideal customer profile - you must decide who your ideal customer is. This is very much related to #1 - specialization.\n\n3. Buyers Persona - you have to understand your buyers and their needs very, very well. Research and create Buyers Persona - that is a very powerful marketing technique that helps you to profile and align to your buyers.\n\n4. Finally - create and describe your UVP - Unique value proposition. This helps to have a clarity and make sure in all communications you can refer back to the specific value you provide.\n\nOnce you have clarity about 4 steps of strategy, you can start executing.\n\nAgain - my rather well informed opinion is that nothing beats webinars.\n\nJust run webinar every 2 months and get more leads that you can handle. \n\nJust make sure you are relevant and strictly follow your own choices.\n\n  \nThis may sound intimidating, but in reality these are simple and logical steps. You would benefit from expert guidance, but you do not need marketing team to execute on that.\n\nI have developed a training program around these 4+4 steps and have a video case study of one of my students available.

Rankings and backlinks still matter, obviously, but I keep hearing people say they found brands through ChatGPT or Google AI Overviews instead of clicking search results. That kind of made me pause. It feels like LLM visibility and AI search optimization are becoming their own thing.\n\nWhat I’m trying to wrap my head around is what actually moves the needle here. Is it still mostly the traditional SEO stuff like topical authority and strong internal linking? Or is AI visibility more about clear positioning, solid comparison pages, tight FAQs, structured content, and consistent brand mentions across trusted sites? It’s a bit confusing tbh.\n\nFor anyone actively working on GEO or AEO, what has genuinely helped you get cited in AI answers? Are you tracking LLM mentions separately from normal rankings?

LLMs love pulling from these when someone asks \"whats the best X for Y\"\n- getting cited in independent reviews, not just your own blog. third-party mentions on forums, review sites, niche publications\n\n**what didnt work:**\n- just pumping out more blog content. volume means nothing if the content isnt structured for direct answers\n- schema markup alone. helps a little but its not the magic bullet people claim\n\n**mistakes to avoid:**\n- dont optimize for one model only. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude all weight things differently. you need to track across all of them\n- dont confuse Google AI Overview visibility with LLM visibility, totally different systems\n\nfor tracking I use vectorgap to monitor share of voice across models. biggest insight: some brands rank #1 on Google but are completely invisible to ChatGPT because they lack entity clarity. its a different game",

If a channel produces a lot of MQLs but almost no opps, it’s not a lead gen win.\n\nScoring only works if it’s tied to real intent signals. Pricing page visits, demo page views, repeat visits from the same company, ROI tool usage, and job title fit tend to correlate better than downloads.\n\nAlso, add a simple feedback loop. Sales should tag leads with reasons like no budget, wrong persona, not a priority, competitor locked in. After a few weeks, you’ll see patterns and marketing can adjust targeting instead of guessing.\n\nIt’s less about adding friction and more about closing the loop with actual pipeline data.

The brutal truth? Your low MQL-to-opportunity conversion screams **bad leads**, not lazy sales (though sales execution can suck too).\n\nThe fix that actually worked for us (and I've replicated the same at 3 other shops):\n\n1. Kill pure MQL handoff. Co-build a **pre-handoff qualification layer** with sales: Use fit (ICP firmographics) + behavioral scoring (e.g., pricing page views, demo requests, multiple touches) + light BANT/MEDDIC via forms or intent data. Threshold: Only hand off at 70+ score or clear intent signal.\n2. Closed-loop feedback: Sales rates every lead 1-5 on quality weekly; marketing sees the data live in CRM. We cut junk by 60% in 4 months, MQL volume dropped 40%, but SQL-to-opp jumped 2.5x.\n3. Measure real lead quality pre-sales: Track **pre-handoff conversion to meeting booked** or **early-stage progression velocity**. Volume KPIs die; revenue attribution lives.\n\nYour post is classic symptom of misaligned incentives marketing chases leads, sales chases pipeline. Stop patting backs on MQLs; they're meaningless without conversion data.\n\nIf conversions suck, leads are bad. Fix the scoring model together, or keep fighting. We did it, pipeline quality soared, and the blame game ended.",

The breakthrough for us was creating a shared definition of what \"qualified\" actually meant before anything got scored or passed over.  \n  \nWe sat both teams in a room and went through the last 50 deals that closed, then the last 50 that went nowhere. Looked for patterns in firmographics, behaviour, timing, all of it. Turned out our ICP was way off and we were sending over loads of leads that matched our \"ideal\" criteria but had zero budget authority or actual need.  \n  \nThe scoring came after, not before. We built it around those actual closed-won patterns rather than theoretical fit. Then added a simple manual step where marketing does a 2 minute LinkedIn check before handoff, just to verify the person's still in role and the company hasn't been acquired or whatever.  \n  \nConversion to opp went from about 8% to 19% in two months. Sales still complains sometimes but now we have the shared framework to point back to.  \n  \nThe other thing that helped was having sales commit to a specific follow-up cadence. If they're not working leads properly, that data needs to surface too.  \n  \nWhat does your current handoff process look like between the teams?",

We refresh role and company context before scoring using Limadata so sales isn’t chasing stale records, and we track downstream metrics like meeting rate and opportunity creation by source segment inside HubSpot.

I've been researching cheaper alternatives and keep seeing AI headshot generators mentioned. Has anyone here used AI headshots for B2B company websites or should I keep looking for a more affordable headshot photographer ?\n\nSomeone mentioned they tried **Looktara** for their team's professional headshots and spent under $300 total instead of thousands, but I'm worried about quality and whether it looks unprofessional for B2B.\n\nFor B2B marketers - what's your recommendation? Find a cheap headshot photographer, use an AI headshot generator, or just pay the premium for traditional photography?

The root cause is that AI has no authoritative source of truth to query â it's working from cached web content and whatever happened to be indexed.\n\nWhat we've explored in brand consistency work: encoding the brand's authoritative data as structured, machine-queryable logic rather than web content. If your ICP, positioning, integrations, and current pricing are encoded correctly and AI systems can reference them, accuracy issues drop significantly. It's a different mental model â instead of monitoring AI output, you manage what AI can access.\n\nTactical version: publish a 'brand facts' document (not marketing copy, actual structured data) somewhere crawlable. Pricing tiers, current integrations, what you are/aren't. Update monthly. Reduces factual errors. The harder version is Meridian's approach â active correction loops. Both together is the real answer.",

I used to proudly say how I don’t take any help from any “fancy” tools and could do all they do. Looking at it now, it was ignorance because I refused to move on with the times, i remember collapsing at my desk (I do wfh) because I was so overworked. Over time I realise how I have stopped taking care of myself, so I decided to research and look for more tools I can use. Here are some tools that helped me optimize my ads.\n\nKeywords Everywhere: Shows search volume, CPC, and competition data directly on the Google search results page\n\nGoogle Tag Assistant: Essential for verifying that your conversion tracking and remarketing tags are firing correctly.\n\nRyze AI- Managed my ad campaigns and automated my report collection. Gives pretty good insights and solutions from the inbuilt chatbot\n\nForeplay or Ad Library Cloud: These extensions allow you to \"save\" ads directly from the Facebook Ad Library into a personal organized board—perfect for building a \"swipe file\" of creative inspiration.\n\nWhat tools do you use?\n\nThere a few that didnt work as well, let me know if i should post those as well!",

Most founders I see are sending plenty of outreach, they're just getting 1-2% response rates because it's generic templated stuff.  \n  \nWe shifted from cold email blasts to personalised video messages last year. Instead of 500 templated emails getting 8 replies, we send 50 videos referencing something specific about their company and get 12-15 replies. Same time investment, better maths.  \n  \nThe volume point is spot on though. I was guilty of spending weeks perfecting our deck when we were only doing 6 demos a month. Complete waste of time. Now we aim for 30+ conversations and suddenly you can actually see patterns in what objections come up or what messaging lands.  \n  \nOne thing that helped us was treating outreach like a daily non-negotiable, not something you do when you \"have time\". 30 mins every morning, no exceptions. Adds up quickly.  \n  \nWhat channels are you currently using to generate conversations?",

We have been going at it for more than 5 years but were never able to scale beyond mid six figures.\n\nThe retainers we sell (media buying/lead gen agency with some design, CRO) range from $5k-$20k per month on 12 month agreements. We have high professional standards and do good work I would say.\n\nSo far the only thing that has worked for us is curating a targeted email list of contacts and accounts in our niche (buying data from brokers, segmenting it, filtering it etc.), creating highly targeted blogs and lead magnets for the email list and advertising our stuff on LinkedIn through targeted ads.\n\nOrganic social, SEO, event attendance/sponsorship, local networking, direct media deals with industry publishers and PR earned media have yielded only visibility and growth of reach but never real leads (most people that come through these channels are tire-kickers or freebie seekers).\n\nOur sales cycles are long (several weeks and months) and we only get a handful of good opportunities per year, with strong feast & famine cycles.\n\nA lot of people in our niche also regularly try to steal our ideas, frameworks and thought leadership without giving us credit, money or recognition. Most of our former clients have been small operators or mid-sized accounts with a small operator mindset. We would love to engage more mid-sized companies since they are much stickier (small accounts in our niche tend to fire you to save money if you are doing well, and fire you early if results take time or they can't leverage the leads properly). Enterprise clients have just tried to manipulate us in participating in bad faith pitches or doing free spec work and then went on to hire Accenture and these kind of people. We are all a bit burned out by these experiences.\n\nWe have a solid brand, good case studies and recognition from magazines, so I don't want to close shop or switch niches to something faster but low-ticket. Any ideas? Other owners or people working in similar niches? How do you generate leads for your conversative niche?\n\nHappy to network and exchange ideas with people on here in similar fields.\n\nTLDR:\n\nBoutique agency owner in ultra conservative niche wonders how other people generate leads in conservative niches",

We are not sure if this will improve pipeline, but we will see. We will also add 2.5-5k in Linkedin ad spend to each lead magnet to reach more decision makers once we sign one or two new clients this or next quarter.\n\nWe reject small clients in general now and dont even talk to them these days anymore. We have long forms, and a lot of qualification built into our sales funnel now.\n\nWe also dont participate in pitches or engage with enterprise companies anymore, I frankly dislike RFPs anyway. In the past these only came our way through event attendance and we stopped going due to the cost and lack of ROI.\n\nWe didnt have any results doing personalized outreach to mid level buyers in our niche in the past, neither through cold email (apollo.io) or LinkedIn DMs. We spent a lot of time on curating accounts, researching them, using sales anayltics to track opens, clicks, forwards, tracking domain health and deliverability etc. \n\nThe only thing we did not do were personalized video messages due to our small team size, which seem to work for non-niche agencies but seem prohibitive in terms of time for small teams like us.\n\nAny tips for outreach segmentation or personalization for a conservative niche beyond \"dont sound like an agency pitch or be salesy\"? We already tried to avoid the obvious mistakes.\n\nAccording to our trained AI agent, buyers in our niche do a lot of intellectual consumption and only buy services like ours if there is internal management or leadership driven pychological pressure to hire external help. \n\nThey supposedly love to read and download but rarely buy (some kind of ego trip or intellectual need for industry benchmarking according to the AI.)\n\nI wanted to make sure Im not missing out on additional viable approaches, hence why I wanted to get some input from real people here on Reddit.\n\nI cant really reveal what the account profile looks like without giving away the exact niche we work in, but we have targeting that consists of industry, business model, revenue size, employee size, job titles, pain points and buying scenarios based on industry patterns and trends.\n\n5mill in annual revenue is our minimum threshold.",

Industry & pain point specific audit -> Buisness Case -> Business Case Review -> Proposal -> Proposal review -> Agreement.\n\nWe are already highly specialized in terms of pain points we solve, with a limited offering in terms of services and case studies pointing out that we can walk the walk.\n\nThis is helpful in sales with the right mid sized accounts, but not really useful in lead gen since there are a lot of cheaper generalists that claim that they can do what we do (90% cant based on what people told us though).\n\nThe last solid opps came from the funnel I described at the beginning, it is just quite slow.  To be fair pre q3/q4 2025 our approach was more spray and pray with soft gates and a lot of small operators in the mix that didnt really care about our specialization as much and had in general low sophistication in terms of digital maturity.\n\nI just want to make sure we are locked in correctly in 2026. But at least we are moving in the right direction based on the responses here.",

They don’t convert like SaaS, they get referred.\n\nWhat usually scales better than content and ads in these markets is building a small circle of distribution partners. Think accountants, law firms, private banks, wealth tech vendors, real estate brokers, architects, or even niche software providers who already have trust and can introduce you. One strong partner can outperform a year of LinkedIn ads.\n\nI’d also stop trying to market to the whole niche and go hyper-specific, like one segment plus one flagship offer. Conservative buyers don’t want options, they want certainty.\n\nAnd for idea theft, the best defense is packaging. Don’t give away frameworks as content, turn them into paid audits, workshops, or diagnostics that require a call to access. Feels like you’re doing a lot right, but you’re relying on channels that attract researchers instead of buyers. Relationships and referrals are usually the real growth lever here.\n\nWe talk about high-ticket lead gen in SEA and conservative industries on r/LeadGenSEA too if you want more ideas.",

If someone would give me a data backed solid reason why our perception is wrong than Im all ears to change my view on it.\n\nThe people in our niche do work with agencies for different things but they often opt for low cost generalists over more expensive specialists like us due to a lack of digital maturity or sheer ignorance when it comes to the fact that industry specialization really matters a lot when it comes to targeting, copywriting, art direction, tech/channel selection, funnel math and customer psychology. Basically what we do drives results and success with a much higher likelyhood for clients in our industry then the frameworks that some of our low cost competitors use. Hency why a lot of industry media have covered us. \n\nIm blaming SaaS for that to be honest, since they commoditized marketing agencies in the eye of a lot of unsophisticated buyers with budget authority (results are just 1-2 clicks away, full marketing suite for $50 blabla)\n\nOur rates are fair and we deserve it due to our specialization. Our 12 month minimum is necessary since we do not do things like outsource to development countries, white label generalists doing all the work for peanuts etc to allow for cheaper rates, lower minimums and more volume. Everybody who works with us has industry expertise and gets paid fairly by western standards. Agency sweatshops are disgusting.\n\nWe have already reduced the technicality in our content massively and talk more about pain points and bad results of inaction now. We should prob ask for referrals earlier thats true.\n\nWe never organized round tables but we particpated in one or two which resulted in a lot ooohs and aahs, opt ins for our list but zero real leads.

That's not a bug, it's how the platform works.\n\nYour 4M views almost certainly generated near zero pipeline because viral Reddit posts attract random eyeballs not qualified buyers.

The corporate account paradox is real on Reddit because moderators (and users) are trained to spot and reject anything that feels like marketing, even when the content is genuinely valuable.  \n  \nFrom what I've observed, the personal account approach works better for a few reasons. You can participate in communities without triggering automatic suspicion, your advice lands better because it's coming from a person rather than a brand, and you actually build relationships over time rather than just broadcasting.  \n  \nThat said, I wouldn't write off the corporate account entirely. Use it for your own subreddit if you have one, for official announcements, and for responding when people specifically ask about your company. Just don't try to be everywhere with it.  \n  \nThe 4M views are nice for awareness, but you're right to be sceptical about lead gen impact. Most B2B buyers aren't going from \"saw a Reddit post\" to \"submitted a demo request\" in one go. It's more about staying top of mind and building trust gradually.  \n  \nWhat was the actual post about that went viral? Sometimes understanding why something hit can help you figure out where to lean in next.",
