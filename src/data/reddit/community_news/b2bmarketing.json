Alerts go to Slack and most of them I just ignore. The goal isn’t to reply to everything, it’s to notice the couple of threads a week I would’ve missed otherwise. When I do reply, I’m not trying to convert anyone. I’ll usually just share how I’d think about the problem or what I tried in the past. Sometimes the conversation goes nowhere, sometimes people ask follow ups or check your profile later. That’s where anything “lead-like” comes from.",

Then our subject experts review and jump in where they feel is most appropriate and helpful.\n\nIt's only been a month or so of this practice but this rhythm feels good for our team and helps us participate in a more true-to-Reddit way. \n\nAnd I'll second what other commenters have shared: focusing on quality of comments over quantity. It is evident which comments are posted just to catch fish vs which are shared out of true helpfulness, and Redditors respond accordingly. \n\n",

You'll get flagged, moderated, removed, banned, etc. Or, people will just have a low opinion of you and your product.\n\nThere are a ton of tools in this space now. I see a new one pop up every week. Most miss the point, and lack features that actually help you find relevant mentions. F5bot is okay. It's really bare bones. Same with Syften. They don't really have advanced features for contextual keyword filtering, negative keywords, keyword types, subreddit-specific monitoring, etc. They're okay if you're just starting up but not something I'd recommend for a more advanced Reddit campaign.\n\nI'd also agree with the other person here.

Be sure your Reddit profile has a link to your website in it so people can find your business. \n\n\n\nAsk ChatGPT to make a list of all relevant subs for your business. And there are tools that you can use to automatically find people talking about your target keywords so you can jump in and contribute in relevant convos. ChatGPT and other LLMs train on Reddit data, and they cite Reddit more than any other source. So the more you participate in relevant Reddit discussions, the more LLM citations and referrals you'll get, too. \n\n\n\nTLDR, just be a helpful person on Reddit in relevant communities.

      "text": "I run lead gen mostly through cold email, boring b2b stuff like lending, transportation, manufacturing, insurance, and marketing agencies. Over the last few months we pushed just over **500,000 emails** to business owners and execs and I want to share what *really* happened, not twitter math or tool affiliate takes.\n\nFirst thing people get wrong is thinking volume fixes bad targeting. It doesn’t. We split those 500k across very specific slices. For lending we only emailed owners doing 1M–25M rev, mostly service businesses, titles like owner, founder, managing partner. For transportation we avoided owner operators completely and only went after fleet owners with at least 10 trucks. Manufacturing was plant managers + ops directors, not CEOs. Insurance was agency owners only, never brokers. Marketing was founders who already had 3–10 clients and were hiring.\n\nSame inboxes, same infra, different outcomes.\n\nOverall numbers across all verticals  \nOpen rate hovered around low 40s most weeks, sometimes dipped to high 30s when a domain got tired.  \nReply rate averaged **3.6–3.9 percent** depending on the vertical.  \n“Interested” replies ended up roughly **1 per 250–300 emails**, which sounds low until you realize that’s normal if you’re not lying to yourself.\n\nSome specifics that surprised me.\n\n**Lending**  \nThis was the weirdest one. Lowest reply rate overall, but the *fastest* replies. If someone was interested they replied within 12 hours, usually short messages like “how much” or “send details”. Long emails here killed performance. Anything over 65 words dropped replies hard. Also a trick people don’t mention: subject lines that looked internal worked better than curiosity. Think “RE: review for {{company}}” not “quick question”.\n\n**Transportation**  \nMost sensitive to sender reputation. One bad domain and it nukes the whole batch. Also these guys read emails on phones at 5–6am. We tested send times heavily and early mornings crushed afternoons. A line like “saw you’re running routes out of Dallas” beat any fancy personalization. Fake hyper personalization got ignored instantly.\n\n**Manufacturing**  \nLowest opens, highest quality replies. These people don’t reply unless it’s real. We once sent a batch with a small data mistake in employee count and replies literally called it out. But when it hit, it hit hard. One email sequence here generated 11 demos from 2,800 sends which is insane for manufacturing. Key thing nobody says: they hate marketing language, even soft marketing. Write like an engineer, not a sales rep.\n\n**Insurance**  \nThis one shocked me. Agency owners reply a lot but half of it is negative if you’re sloppy. We learned to put a soft exit line like “if this isn’t relevant just say no and I’ll close the loop”. That single sentence reduced angry replies by more than half and didn’t hurt positive replies at all. Also never email them on Mondays. Just don’t.\n\n**Marketing agencies**  \nHighest reply rate, lowest close rate. Tons of “sounds interesting” ghosts. You need to qualify in the first reply or you’ll waste your life. Asking one blunt question like “how are you getting clients right now” filtered serious people fast. Also founders respond more to slightly messy emails, perfect grammar actually hurt us here.\n\nUnknown stuff people never mention.\n\nEmail verification isn’t binary. “Valid” emails still bounce differently depending on provider. Google accepts garbage longer than Outlook. Outlook punishes patterns faster.  \nRotating inboxes isn’t enough, you need to rotate *intent*. Same offer phrased slightly differently kept domains alive longer.  \nFollow ups matter less than people think. Email 1 + Email 2 drove almost all results. Email 4 and 5 mostly just create spam complaints.  \nYour CRM tagging matters. We tagged replies by tone and used that to rewrite copy. Polite no’s teach you more than yes’s.\n\nBiggest takeaway after 500k sends: cold email still works, but only if you treat it like operations not hacks. Most people fail because they copy scripts without copying the thinking behind them.\n\nNot selling anything here, just sharing numbers because I wish someone did this before I burned a few domains learning it the hard way. If you’re doing cold email at scale I’m curious what vertical surprised you the most.",

      "text": "Everyone says \"Reddit Ads are cheap.\"\n\nEveryone also says \"Redditors hate ads.\"\n\nSo I decided to talk to this guy who burnt $2,000 to find out which is true.\n\nHere is the exact breakdown of his campaign for a B2B SaaS tool.\n\n# The Campaign Setup\n\n* **Budget:** $2,000\n* **Duration:** 30 days\n* **Targeting:** Subreddits (r/marketing, r/entrepreneur, r/sales)\n* **Creative:** 3 variations (Meme style, \"Native\" text style, Standard banner)\n\n# The Metrics (The Good, The Bad, The Ugly)\n\n**1. Impressions (The Good)**\n\n* **CPM:** $4.50 (Cheaper than LinkedIn's $30+ CPM)\n* **Total Impressions:** \\~440k\n* *verdict:* Reaching people on Reddit is incredibly cheap.\n\n**2. Clicks (The Bad)**\n\n* **CPC:** $0.85\n* **CTR:** 0.52%\n* *verdict:* Getting clicks isn't hard, but it's not \"high intent.\" A lot of fat-finger clicks or curiosity clicks.\n\n**3. Conversion (The Ugly)**\n\n* **Signups:** 14\n* **CAC:** $142.85\n* **Paying Customers:** 1\n* **ROI:** \\-85%\n\n# The \"Oh Sh*t\" Realization 💡\n\nWhile the ads were running, he spent 20 minutes a day manually commenting on threads in the *same* subreddits.\n\n* **Cost:** $0\n* **Time:** 10 hours total\n* **Signups:** 42\n* **Paying Customers:** 6\n\n**The Difference?**\n\n**Trust.**\n\nOn Reddit, an ad is an interruption.\n\nA comment is a contribution.\n\nWhen he tried to \"scale\" with ads, he lost the one thing that made Reddit work: **Authenticity.**\n\n# Key Lessons for SaaS Founders\n\n1. **Banner Blindness is Real:** Redditors are pro-level scrollers. Unless your ad looks *exactly* like a post, they skip it.\n2. **Comments > Creatives:** The \"real\" ad slot on Reddit isn't the feed. It's the comment section. That's where decisions are made.\n3. **Intent Mining vs. Interruption:** Ads target *demographics* (people interested in marketing). Comments target *intent* (people asking \"how do I do marketing?\"). The latter converts 10x better.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you have a venture budget and need brand awareness? Sure, Reddit Ads are cheap eyeballs. If you are bootstrapping and need **customers**? Keep your wallet closed. Open the comment section instead.\n\n\n\n**Has anyone else cracked the code on Reddit Ads for B2B? Or is it just a graveyard for ad spend?**",

If you want to get results, this starts with understanding how targeting and placement works.\n\nAudience Targeting:\n\n* Communities: Highly relevant targeting if you're targeting qualified communities because they are native users.\n* Keyword: Traffic could be from non-native Reddit users (e.g., Google search), so depending on the keywords used, the quality could be not as relevant as communities.\n* Interest: Too broad, not worth testing it.\n\nAds Placement:\n\n* Conversation: Conversations attract both native and non-native Reddit users who find posts through referrals from organic search and AI suggestions. These platforms don't link people to Reddit communities. They link people to the exact posts that answer their question.\n* Feed (the home and community feeds with various posts): Mostly native users and overall ads are more visible than conversation.\n\nConversation Ads look quite small and traffic is not as relevant as feed ads placement for communities. I usually like to use this placement for remarketing audiences or keyword targeting to be sure I have more qualified traffic. When people search on Google and land on Reddit threads, intent is higher so Conversation ads can work better.\n\n**If you enable both placements, most of your budget flows to Conversation Ads because the CPM is cheaper.**\n\nOur go-to setup:\n\n* Communities with Feed placement only.\n* Keyword targeting or Remarketing with Conversation ads placement.",

Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then?

That “human touch” you’re talking about is usually less about creativity and more about judgment. AI doesn’t sit in tense board meetings. It doesn’t sense when a founder is insecure about positioning. It doesn’t read between the lines on why a strategy will fail culturally even if it works on paper.\n\nThat part isn’t getting automated anytime soon.\n\nBut here’s the nuance: AI doesn’t need to replace your strategy to compress your edge.\n\nIt’s already replacing average execution. It’s accelerating research. It’s leveling the floor. That means what used to feel like differentiation (clean messaging, solid funnels, decent ads) becomes baseline faster.\n\nSo maybe the real question isn’t “Will AI replace B2B marketing?”\n\nMaybe it’s “Which parts of B2B marketing become commodity, and which parts become more valuable because AI exists?”\n\nMy bet is strategic thinking and category creation go up in value. Tactics get cheaper.\n\nhave you noticed clients expecting more strategic depth now that tools make execution faster?",

When I was building BuiltCorrect, our team realized that pulling data from EHRs, scheduling systems, and marketing platforms into one coherent view was a massive pain point. We initially tried to integrate with everything, but that was a nightmare.\n\nWhat worked for us was focusing on a centralized dashboard that could ingest key metrics from various sources. We built out custom connectors for common systems, allowing us to track client details, appointment schedules, and financial metrics all in one place. It's not a silver bullet, and integrating with every legacy system is impossible, but having that core hub made a huge difference.\n\nMy advice would be to prioritize what your executive team actually cares about most. Likely patient acquisition cost, retention, and revenue. And then find a tool that can consolidate those specific data points. Don't try to report on everything just because you can.",

Most content jumps straight to “our platform does X.”\n- It’s too long, too formal, too slow — modern buyers want clarity, not corporate essays.\n- It’s created without distribution in mind — content teams ship assets that sales never use and marketing never repurposes.\n- It’s not SEO‑aligned — meaning it never ranks, never gets discovered, and never compounds.\n- It’s not tied to revenue — no clear path from content → conversation → opportunity.\n\nThis is why 60–80% of B2B content sits in SharePoint or HubSpot folders untouched.\n\n---\n\nThe deeper truth\nUnused content isn’t a production problem.  \nIt’s a strategy and workflow problem.\n\nWhen content is built around:\n- buyer pains  \n- search intent  \n- daily workflows  \n- evergreen problems  \n- high‑demand solutions  \n\n…it gets used, shared, ranked, and repurposed automatically.\n\nThis is exactly why your approach — daily SEO‑optimized content tied to high‑demand B2B solutions — works.

I’m not some marketing veteran, but from what I’ve seen, most places just throw stuff at the wall because “the competitor did it,” or “the boss had an idea,” or “a customer asked for it.” No plan, no strategy, just reaction after reaction. And then we wonder why nothing sticks.\n\nI’ve been digging into integrated campaigns lately, trying out different frameworks, and the one that’s actually *clicked* for me is the RIO Integrated Campaign Framework. It forces you to think about content *differently*. Instead of just tossing a brief to the content team after everything’s already decided, you bring them in *early*, like, when you’re still figuring out the strategy. That way, the content actually *fits* the campaign, instead of feeling like an afterthought.\n\nNow, for me, it’s not a huge change. I’m basically a one-person band, handling everything from strategy to content (with a little freelance help). But I’ve seen bigger teams skip this step, and honestly? It’s a mess. Content ends up disconnected, campaigns feel patchy, and everyone’s scrambling to make sense of it all.\n\nSo yeah, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: **involve your content people from the start.** It’s not just about making *more* content, it’s about making content that *works*. Otherwise, you’re just adding to the noise. And who needs more of that?",

I ended up building ColdGenius AI to automate that specific process of identifying an ICP and writing copy based on business needs rather than just job titles.

You don’t need perfect scoring, just enough to avoid wasting time. For follow-up, simple multi-step sequences usually beat fancy personalization. A few relevant touches spaced out well > over-automated messaging. Most CRMs can handle this part fine once the data is clean - tools like HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, or even newer lighter fully automated tailor made ones like RealTech CRM, Attio, GHL, Zoho CRM, etc all work if they’re set up cleanly. The tooling matters less than keeping the workflow simple and consistent. If I had to optimize one thing- reduce manual handoffs. That’s where most B2B follow-up breaks down.",

          "text": "Hey everyone! So, I've been thinking a lot lately about marketing a product that's more of a \"nice-to-have\" than an absolute necessity in the B2B space. It's definitely a different ballgame, right? You can't just hit them with the \"you *need* this\" urgency. Instead, it feels like you have to gently nudge them towards seeing the value.\n\nMy current approach is focusing on how this \"nice-to-have\" can actually make their jobs easier or more enjoyable. We're trying to highlight the benefits that might not be immediately obvious, but would still be really appreciated. Think about how it could improve employee satisfaction or boost team morale.\n\nWe're also exploring ways to showcase its potential to free up valuable time for their teams. If your product can help them focus on more critical tasks, that's a huge win, even if it wasn't on their immediate radar. Ultimately, it's about demonstrating how it enhances their overall business environment in a positive, albeit not critical, way. It's a subtle art, for sure!",

      "text": "I run a cold emailing business. Was getting decent traffic (\\~12-14K/month) but conversion was stuck at 1.5% ish. Most visitors would browse and leave without contacting us.\n\nThe problem was that people were visiting our website and had a lot of questions, but getting their answers required manually scrolling through the website and searching, and sometimes the answer wasn't even available on the site. This is how 99% of websites are today and the UX is horrible. Customers are lazy and want instant answers without any manual searching.\n\nLast week of December, I got an agency to implement an AI-Assistant that answers common visitor questions immediately - no waiting for email responses or business hours.\n\n**Results after 30 days:**\n\n* Lead ratio: 1.3% → 2.5%\n* Leads: 156 → 354\n* Revenue: $6,943 → $11,324\n\nSame ads. Same website. Just instant answers when visitors need them.\n\nThe wildest part was that most of the leads come after 6pm and on weekends - times when we'd normally lose them. People scroll the internet more during after work hours.\n\nNot trying to sound like a guru here. Just sharing because I know a lot of you struggle with website conversion like I did. Sometimes it's not about more traffic - it's about helping the traffic you already have.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the implementation.\n\n",

If someone has to hunt for answers, you’ve already added friction.\n\nI work in B2B marketing and we see this a lot... intent is there, but clarity is missing in the moment it matters. Real-time answers reduce hesitation. That alone can move conversion more than redesigns or extra traffic.\n\nOnly thing I’d watch is answer quality. If the AI gives vague or wrong replies, it can hurt trust fast. But if it’s trained properly on your FAQs, pricing logic, and objections... it’s basically a 24/7 pre-sales rep.\n\nCurious, did you notice what % of conversions were directly influenced by assistant chats vs normal form fills? That’d be interesting to track.",

          "text": "To your question about having a single source of truth for marketing analytics, my answer is simple: I look at campaign level only, always. And that’s the only thing I’ve ever seen actually work.\n\nI’ve worked almost my entire career in B2B SaaS, so attribution has always been a battle. I’ve never seen a company using first-touch attribution. Most of the companies I’ve worked with were either on last-touch or multi-touch.\nLast-touch misses 90% of the marketing efforts.\nMulti-touch is a mess to set up, and once it’s set up, it’s highly unreliable.\nThe only thing I’ve found to be working is stepping away from that.\n\nThere’s a bit of a learning curve to work with leadership to move past attribution, but once that’s done, it’s a huge relief for both you and them.\n\nSo how does it work, basically?\nYou stop bothering with channel-level attribution and start looking at campaign-level attribution.\nThis obviously requires super clear and tightly integrated marketing campaigns around specific audiences.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have one audience made of CMOs. You build one campaign around this audience and integrate all your channels inside that campaign. Now, any time a CMO comes in, regardless of which channel they came from, since everything is tightly integrated, you consider it a campaign win, not a channel win.\n\nThen you look at ROI at the campaign level:\ntotal budget spent on the campaign\ntotal revenue generated by the campaign\n\nThis does a few things:\nIt saves you a ton of time building reports and trying to make data from multiple platforms tell the same story.\nIt saves you time explaining that story to leadership.\nMost importantly, it prevents leadership from cutting channels just because you can’t “prove” attribution, even though you know deep down that those channels are actually critical to your success.\n\nIf you don’t mind doing a bit of reading, I strongly suggest looking into the RIO integrated campaign framework that explains exactly how to do this and why it helps.\n\nThis is what I started moving toward a couple of years ago, and quite frankly, it now saves me multiple hours every week and a ton of headaches.",

They've seen the name, maybe even checked the profile already.  \n  \nOne thing that surprised me though was how much faster video cuts through compared to text when you're doing that second or third touch. People are used to scanning text emails in 3 seconds, but a short personalised video makes them pause. We went from 2% reply rates to over 20% when we added video into the sequence after the initial LinkedIn touchpoints.  \n  \nThe system approach you're describing is right. It's not about being everywhere constantly, it's about being intentional with the order and timing so each touch builds on the last one.  \n  \nWhat's your typical sequence look like now?

          "text": "Reading your post felt surreal. I genuinely had the reaction of “wait… did I write this?” You are absolutely spot on. This is what I’ve been repeating for years.\nYes, of course, every channel can always be optimized.\nYour emails can have better subject lines, a cleaner database, stronger CTAs.\n\n\nYour LinkedIn ads can use better visuals, sharper targeting, smarter timing.\nYour events can benefit from a bigger booth, better staffing, smoother execution.\n\nBut let’s be honest.\nThose tweaks rarely change the game. They might give you a few extra points of performance here and there. What usually makes the real difference is something else entirely.\n\n\nWhat’s missing most of the time is proper integration across channels. And this is exactly where integrated marketing campaigns become critical.\nYour customers do not live inside your channels. They live in their own world.\n\nThey see you in the street. On their phone. On social media. In their inbox. In articles. On billboards. On TV. On the radio. What builds trust and brand preference is not one single touchpoint performing well in isolation. It’s the accumulation of all these interactions over time that creates familiarity, credibility, and eventually preference.\n\n\nAnd this is also where I think a lot of CFOs get it wrong.\nBeing able to read a P&L or a channel performance dashboard does not mean you understand how marketing actually works. Killing or scaling channels purely based on attribution models misses the bigger picture of how people experience brands in real life.\n\n\nFor me, the real eye-opener came when I started looking for a way to properly structure campaigns. I had read about models like PESO and the broader SOSTAC theories. They are solid, but often very theoretical. At the time, I couldn’t afford expensive marketing courses, so I was relying purely on free public resources. That’s when I came across the RIO integrated campaign framework, and it genuinely changed how I think about marketing.\n\nIt forced me to stop looking at performance purely through a channel ROI lens and start thinking in terms of customer experience and campaign coherence. It made painfully obvious how vital true integration is if you want your marketing to actually work in the real world.\n\n\nSo yes. The post you wrote is spot on.\nThanks for putting into words what a lot of marketers intuitively feel but struggle to articulate clearly.",

My bad.\n\n\nYes, of course, you can and should measure single-channel performance. Optimizing at channel level matters. You want your email to perform well as email. Your ads to perform well as ads. Your events to perform well as events.\n\nBut that should never be the full story. You need to look at the bigger picture.\n\nAnd honestly, I think multi-touch attribution is close to a utopia. I’ve worked in three different companies that either wanted to implement it or actually tried to roll it out. On paper, it sounds amazing. You measure exactly how each channel contributes. You finally get “the truth” behind performance.\nIn reality, it’s a nightmare.\n\nIt takes forever to configure properly. The data is fragile. The models are complex. And once you finally have something that works, anyone can tweak the weightings and percentages to tell whatever story they want to tell. Suddenly, attribution becomes less about truth and more about politics.\n\nThat’s why, for me, the only approach that really makes sense is campaign-level attribution. Kill the whole first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch battle altogether.\nLook at campaigns as coherent systems. Measure whether Campaign A, as a whole, created impact. Then optimize channels inside the campaign for execution quality, not for credit-taking.\n\n\nJust my two cents.",

It’s just showing up as people.\n\nLet your team’s faces be visible. Let your CEO sound like a real person, not a press release. Share the messy middle parts, not just the polished wins.\n\nThe companies I respect most don’t feel like “brands” , they feel like groups of people I’d want to grab a coffee with.\n\nAnd yeah, this goes against everything we were taught about “professional” B2B marketing. But buyers are tired. They’re tired of generic LinkedIn posts, tired of webinars that are nothing but just sales pitches, tired of websites that all say the same thing.\n\nWhat cuts through? A founder doing a real product walkthrough. A CS person sharing what actually annoys them about the industry. A marketer admitting what didn’t work.\n\nSo maybe stop hiding behind the logo. Your buyers want to know who they’re actually working with.",
