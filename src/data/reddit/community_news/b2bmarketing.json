It looks custom but doesn’t actually help the reader understand why you’re reaching out.  \nWhat worked better for me with Clay was dialing personalization way down and focusing on one real signal per message. Something concrete like a job change, a product launch, a pricing page update. When there’s an actual reason to reach out, the message feels natural without trying so hard. Curious how you’re deciding what’s worth personalizing right now. Are you using real signals or mostly profile data?",

I started looking for evidence of pain points.

      "text": "\nOver the last year, one of the software development companies we worked with crossed five million dollars in marketing sourced pipeline. This was not driven by a single tactic. It was the result of a few channels compounding together, and a couple of expensive mistakes we won’t repeat.\n\n1. SEO was the foundation, but not in the way most teams approach it\n\nOrganic search was still the largest source of inbound. The key shift was moving away from broad “software development services” type pages and building a very granular site structure.\n\nWe created highly specific service pages for individual industries, narrow problem statements, and sub services. Instead of one generic page, we built dozens of pages targeting very specific commercial intent keywords. Traffic volume was not massive, but intent was consistently high.\n\nThis approach came out of patterns we see repeatedly in our work at XQL Group, especially with software development firms that sell complex, multi service engagements rather than a single SKU.\n\n2. Case studies were rebuilt completely\n\nPreviously, one project equaled one case study page. That approach left a lot of demand uncaptured.\n\nWe broke projects down by individual services delivered, such as discovery, product design, backend engineering, DevOps, and security. We also created separate case study pages for key integrations and technical decisions.\n\nIn practice, one project turned into multiple narrow case studies. Each mapped directly to a service page and a specific buying question. This had a noticeable impact on both organic visibility and lead quality.\n\n3. LLM driven inbound became a real channel\n\nAround 25 to 30 percent of inbound leads now come from LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and similar tools.\n\nTwo things stood out. These leads convert better than traditional SEO leads, and they usually come with clearer context and higher budgets.\n\nWe started treating LLM visibility as a distribution problem rather than an SEO trick. The focus was on being present in places LLMs already pull from.\n\nWhat worked was writing commercial intent listicles and distributing them through LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit, Quora, and selective paid guest posts on relevant industry sites.\n\n4. Meta ads worked for high ticket services, unexpectedly well\n\nWe were skeptical about Meta ads for services with an average contract size above $50k. Despite that, Meta became the second strongest inbound channel by opportunity volume.\n\nThe difference was in the framing. We avoided generic branding and focused on specific problems and service level offers. Not every lead was perfect, but enough turned into serious sales conversations to justify the spend.\n\n5. What did not work\n\nCold outreach did not produce meaningful ROI for this type of business. It consumed a lot of effort without compounding results.\n\nClutch sponsorships were the biggest miss. We spent roughly $100k over the year, and for us it did not translate into pipeline. It functioned more as brand exposure than a revenue channel.\n\nIf there is one takeaway here, it is that narrow intent and distribution depth matter more than channel novelty. The mechanics of how buyers discover vendors have changed, and most teams are still operating on old assumptions.",

This is when you need to reach out to those accounts with the solution your product can help with and examples of how you have helped some similar accounts in the same industry. \n\nThe best channel for this is LinkedIn. You need to connect with the right target personas of those accounts on LinkedIn and DM them. In the very same time you can use emails as well. account based LinkedIn ads as well. And if you are using multiple channels then you need to ensure that the outreach is on the same time with the same messaging. \n\nBasically it has to be a 1:1 account based motion.",

For example, for our agency XQL Group, we create videos like “Top B2B marketing agencies for custom software development companies.” In the video description, we add a clear listing of companies. YouTube videos are indexed very well in Google and Bing, and LLMs also retrieve and use this information. The same logic applies as with written content, it is another strong indexed surface.\n\nGuest posts\nGuest posts work in the same way. The main goal is to dominate the SERP with content that consistently says XQL Group is the best agency for software development companies. We use paid guest posts to get more volume and more control over where this content appears.\n\nLinkedIn\nOn LinkedIn, we usually post from our corporate profile, which does not have much engagement. We also publish LinkedIn articles. Engagement is not the priority here. The reason we do this is because LinkedIn posts and articles get indexed in search results, and this is basically a free way to publish indexable content.\n\nReddit and Quora\nFor Reddit and Quora, we do this very natively. We just talk about our company the same way I am doing in this comment. It is written manually, not automated. It mentions XQL Group, and the original post mentions XQL Group as well, but the approach is value first. We try to actually be helpful to the community while explaining what we do, and I do not think that this is spam or a bad thing to do.",

      "text": "I spent 5 years at HubSpot before the IPO and watched inbound work in a very specific way. Buyers came in through detailed blog posts, read a lot, and then raised their hand. The blog was the main source of trust.\n\nThat motion doesn’t behave the same way anymore, especially in search.\n\nAs many marketers noted, HubSpot’s blog traffic fell from around 24 million visits in early 2023 to about 6 million in early 2025 after Google started cracking down on generic content. Nearly 60% of Google searches now end without a click. And a growing share of people skip Google entirely and go straight to tools like ChatGPT or to places like Reddit when they want an answer.\n\nThe pattern behind those numbers is pretty simple. Buyers are skeptical of polished marketing content. It all blends together: corporate tone, long scroll, obvious intent to push them toward a form fill. Instead, they look for unvarnished commentary in communities and social feeds, and they put more weight on first‑hand experience from people they see as practitioners.\n\nGong leaned into this earlier than most. They encouraged employees to share real observations from their day‑to‑day work on LinkedIn and other channels, and the company’s reputation grew out of that ongoing stream of practitioner content. Drift and Refine Labs took similar routes.\n\nFor B2B companies, this points to a different center of gravity. The people who work directly with the product and with customers — engineers, customer success, product managers — tend to be more believable than a polished blog article with a CTA at the bottom. The trust that used to live in the corporate blog now lives in public conversations led by those practitioners.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is getting these non-marketing experts to contribute regularly in social forums. But if companies can pull this off they'll build trust with customers faster than their competitors.",

          "text": "I think there's a twofold shift happening right now, and both stem from the AI shenanigans and big platform changes:\n\n1) The crisis of trust/authenticity. Long form blogposts used to be trustworthy, because writing a long guide proved that you know what you're talking about. Hell, even being able to write coherently is a signal of intelligence. With the widespread availability of AI, text (especially corporate text) ceases to be that signal, and we have a crisis of confidence. This is what leads to the rise of influencers and in-house talking heads. Video is still hard to fake, and for now, stands as a signal for effort and human verification.\n\n2) The distribution problem. Google giveth and google taketh away: no more cheap clicks. But youtube is the second biggest search engine, the tiktok and instagram recommendation algos are insanely good, and LinkedIn is still in it's infancy if you look at the actual usage patterns (most people lurk, only less than 1% comment). It's easy to make good content and there's now playbooks to driving reach.\n\nBut back to your point: you can build a content engine in this world, yes. But it requires a very different mind- and skillset than what we were doing for over a decade with TOFU/MOFU/BOFU SEO content. And there's still plenty of room to play and experiment!",

Become the hub of discussion in your space. Needs a good host and quite a bit of admin (and probably budget) to run it smoothly at a regular cadence.\n\n2) Use vidiq and repurpose what you would be doing for the company blog/SEO into youtube videos that rank. This can be done block-style that you dedicate 2-3 days for shooting that gives you content for the next quarter or so. Has to be high quality and edited heavily to fit what the platform likes, cut into shorts, repurposed for LI + Insta, etc. Software has evolved tons in this regard so a skilled social media marketer can learn it quite fast, otherwise there's people selling this as a service.\n\nThat's the bread and butter. If you have the budget, you can shoot your own series focusing on the subject matter, but that's way higher effort and comes with its own distribution difficulties.",

A simple, honest note with a clear opt out and no follow ups if they ignore it goes a long way. The fastest way to make people hate you is pretending it is permission based when it is not.

It's that simple. \n\nWay better than a salesy question-style approach or anything AI generated.\n\nIf you get no response, I'd send just one follow up after a week. Follow up ideas for you: 1) a presentation with more works; 2) invitation to a demo call; 3) more complicated tactic: offer to record a podcast together (good for yours and prospect's personal brands, everyone is carying about content now, its good for any business); 4) invite to do a \"customer interview\" because \"you're looking for insights\". \n\nRemember: you have a human reading this on the other side, and you need to be human too!

Like \"noticed you're hiring 3 sales reps but your demo booking page loads in 8 seconds - that's probably costing you meetings\" is way more compelling than \"I build websites fast.\"  \n  \nYou're right that sounding human matters. But being human AND relevant is key. Generic + casual still gets ignored most of the time. Are you mainly reaching out to people who've signaled they need a website somehow? Or just anyone in your ICP? Because 40% response rate is great so wondering if there's selection happening before the message even goes out.",

They keep A/B testing subject lines when the fundamental problem is they're emailing someone who literally cannot buy.\n\nThe founder threshold at sub-50 employees is spot on. Above that size, founders are usually too removed from the specific problem to care about your email. Below that, they're still in the weeds and making buying decisions directly.\n\nThe timing signals piece is what separates good lists from great ones. With our clients the job posting signal is particularly strong because a company hiring for a role often means they're also evaluating tools for that function. Recent funding works but it's overused since every sales rep hammers companies right after they announce a raise.\n\nThe question of \"when is a company worth emailing at all\" comes down to whether you can identify any trigger suggesting they're thinking about this problem now versus theoretically someday. No trigger means you're just playing the lottery hoping your email lands during the two weeks per year they actually care.",

People are definitely interested because the download numbers are higher than we expected, but the trail goes cold immediately after they get the PDF. I was reading through some insights on how localization and clear messaging impact these technical funnels at adverbum, and it made me realize our content might be too dense for the initial lead stage. It feels like we are providing so much value for free that the prospects don't feel the need to actually talk to our sales team.\n\nAre you guys seeing better conversion rates by gating the data points separately, or do you find that shorter executive summaries drive more discovery calls? Also, how do you balance providing enough technical proof without giving away the entire solution in the lead magnet?",

                  "text": "Highly technical white papers are almost always consumed in the early research phase, often by individual contributors or technical evaluators who are still framing the problem. Expecting those assets to produce sales conversations skips several critical psychological and organizational steps in a complex B2B buying process.\n\nThe Core Principle to Anchor the Conversation: Different content answers different buyer questions at different moments.\n\nIf your content only answers:\n\t•\t“How does this work technically?”\n\nBut never answers:\n\t•\t“Should we do anything at all?”\n\t•\t“Why change now?”\n\t•\t“Why this approach?”\n\t•\t“Why this company?”\n\t•\t“How do we justify this internally?”\n\nThen buyers will stall, regardless of how strong the technical material is.\n\nBuyer’s Journey Content Map (Problem → Solution → Validation → Decision)\n\n1. Problem Identification / Status Quo Awareness\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I’m sensing friction, risk, or inefficiency. I’m not sure how to define it yet.”\n\nWhat they are NOT ready for:\n\t•\tProduct demos\n\t•\tDeep technical architecture\n\t•\tSales conversations\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tExecutive perspective articles (problem framing)\n\t•\tIndustry trend analysis\n\t•\tResearch-backed thought leadership\n\t•\tDiagnostic assessments or quizzes\n\t•\tBenchmark reports\n\t•\t“What’s changed” or “Why now” content\n\t•\tShort educational videos\n\t•\tPOV blogs that name hidden costs or risks\n\nRole of white papers here:\nUseful only if they are problem-oriented, not solution-heavy.\n\n\n2. Problem Validation / Internal Alignment\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to validate this problem and align others around it.”\n\nThis is where buying groups form.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tProblem-focused white papers (non-product)\n\t•\tInternal-ready slides or briefs\n\t•\tStakeholder-specific explainers (finance, IT, ops)\n\t•\tUse-case narratives without product pitching\n\t•\tROI framing content (without hard pricing)\n\t•\tMaturity models or frameworks\n\t•\tWebinars framed around challenges, not solutions\n\nKey shift:\nThe content must help the buyer sell the problem internally, not evaluate vendors yet.\n\n\n3. Solution Exploration / Approach Comparison\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“What are the possible ways to solve this, and what trade-offs exist?”\n\nThis is where your client often jumps too late or too early.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tSolution guides (approach-based, not product-led)\n\t•\t“Build vs buy vs outsource” comparisons\n\t•\tSolution architecture overviews (high level)\n\t•\tRecorded demos (ungated or lightly gated)\n\t•\tExplainer videos\n\t•\tImplementation approach documents\n\t•\tAnalyst-style comparison matrices\n\nWhite papers here:\nStill useful, but they must:\n\t•\tCompare approaches\n\t•\tExplain outcomes\n\t•\tReduce perceived risk\n\t•\tAvoid deep configuration detail\n\n\n4. Vendor Shortlisting / Trust Building\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“Can I trust this company to deliver?”\n\nThis is where sales engagement becomes appropriate.\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tCase studies (outcomes first, details second)\n\t•\tCustomer stories by industry or role\n\t•\tReference architectures\n\t•\tProof-of-concept examples\n\t•\tSecurity, compliance, and risk documentation\n\t•\tPartner ecosystem content\n\t•\tCustomer webinars or panels\n\nWhat triggers sales conversations:\n\t•\tEvidence of success with similar companies\n\t•\tReduced personal and organizational risk\n\t•\tConfidence that this will work in their environment\n\n\n5. Decision / Business Case / Justification\n\nBuyer mindset:\n“I need to justify this decision financially, operationally, and politically.”\n\nContent types that work here:\n\t•\tROI calculators\n\t•\tBusiness case templates\n\t•\tProcurement-ready documentation\n\t•\tImplementation timelines\n\t•\tChange management guidance\n\t•\tExecutive briefings\n\t•\tCompetitive battlecards (buyer-facing, not sales-only)\n\nSales engagement is expected here, not earlier.\n\n\nWhy White Papers Alone Fail to Convert\n\nWhen a company relies exclusively on long-form technical white papers:\n\t•\tThey attract early-stage researchers\n\t•\tThey lack problem-framing content upstream\n\t•\tThey skip trust and validation content downstream\n\t•\tThey assume technical interest equals buying intent\n\nThis leads to:\n\t•\tHigh download volume\n\t•\tLow sales engagement\n\t•\tFrustration between marketing and sales\n\t•\tMislabeling early researchers as “bad leads”\n\nThe content is doing its job. The expectation is wrong.\n\nAlso, do NOT call whitepaper downloads “leads”. They aren’t leads and Sales will see them as junk.",

Technical content in manufacturing tends to get downloaded by engineers doing competitive research or students, not decision makers ready to purchase.\n\nThe issue probably isn't that you're giving away too much value. It's that the content doesn't create urgency or connect to a problem they need solved right now. With our clients doing technical white papers the ones that convert have a clear \"you can't do this yourself\" element baked in. The data shows the problem, but the solution requires your product or expertise to implement.\n\nExecutive summaries work better for senior buyers who won't read 20 pages. The format matters less than whether the content ends with a reason to talk to you. If someone finishes your white paper and feels fully educated with no open questions, you've armed them to go elsewhere.\n\nTry adding a self-assessment or ROI calculator as the next step after download rather than jumping straight to demo request. That middle step qualifies intent and warms them up before sales reaches out.",

Even if you reached out, they’ll probably say they’re not interested. That doesn’t mean these white papers are a waste of time. I think producing 2-3 campaigns like this that build really strong trust and authority can be really critical. Because when the time comes that they are ready to buy, they might think “hey X company had some really great info, and they really understood our problems; let me put them on my short list.” \n\nThat said, you can’t really push people into the next buying stage. I would start creating inbound campaigns around more middle of the funnel keyword to capture audiences with higher commercial intent. Like people who are closer to being ready to buy. Your content marketing efforts need to target them too. ",

That gives you timelines, next steps, and a real pipeline view.\n- Layer something like Grin or Aspire for discovery, contracting, and content tracking if you’re doing a lot of seeding and whitelisting.\n- Automate follow-ups with simple rules (e.g., task if no reply in 5 days) so nothing slips.\nI’ve tried building this with Airtable + Notion + Demand Revenue-style advisory dashboards, but a proper CRM pipeline plus one influencer platform has been more durable long-term.\nSo, core point again: don’t just pick an “influencer tool” – pick a pipeline and force every creator into it.",

Build a simple kanban with stages like outreach, negotiating, contracted, content in progress, live, and complete. Track contact info, last touchpoint, and next action date. It's not sexy but it's flexible and cheap.\n\nWith our clients doing B2B influencer work the real problem usually isn't the tool, it's that nobody owns the follow-up cadence. Someone needs to check that board daily and actually send the nudges. A fancy platform won't fix a process problem.\n\nRespona and Pitchbox are built for outreach at scale and have decent tracking for who responded and who needs follow-up.

      "text": "For the past few months I tried super personalized and more warm sounding cold emails for local leads, especially dentists, and a few patterns really boost results:\n\n**Personalized Subject Lines:** Generic subject lines get ignored, Use subject lines that read like a customer or an associate, not a salesperson, these get way higher open rates. Example: \"Frank seems amazing at scheduling”\n\n**Read Reviews, They are a gold mine:** Reading reviews can get you-\n\n* Staff names people actually mention (personalization gold)\n* What customers genuinely care about (emotional themes)\n* Specific pain points or wins\n\nMentioning \"Joey's same day emergency response keeps coming up\" in an email = instant credibility.\n\n**Optimize for a Quick Reply:**\n\nInstead of asking for a call (high commitment + scheduling pain), use multiple choice CTAs:\n\n* \"Worth a quick look? A) Yes, send it over B) Not a fit C) Ask me again in a month\"\n* \"Wrong person?\"\n\nIf the cost of answering feels close to zero, they're far more likely to reply.\n\nAlso follow the \"5-second decision\" rule: one short scroll should answer who you are, why you're emailing, what you want, and exactly how to reply.\n\nThe only downside of these are it took a lot of time to research a single lead.\n\nSo I started experimenting with AI prospecting and summaries and built a tool that:\n\n* Finds emails, phones, socials from public directories\n* Reads the website and Google reviews\n* Generates research context automatically:\n   * Firmographics so I can qualify\n   * Standout staff members and their roles\n   * Emotional themes from reviews\n   * Ready to use icebreakers and subject lines\n\nThe goal isn't \"AI-written spam\", it's saving the manual research step so you can actually personalize at scale.\n\n**Looking for 5-10 people doing local lead gen to test it and help shape it further,** **DM if interested.**\n\nYou dont need to use my tool, these work manually too, hope the tactics above help your outreach.

The traditional \"rank and bank\" content strategy is dying for most topics.\n\nWhat still works is content that builds trust during an active buying process. The prospect is already considering you and they Google your company name plus the problem they have. Finding a detailed article that addresses their exact situation moves them forward. That's not traffic generation, it's sales enablement disguised as content.\n\nWith our clients the blog strategy that produces results is comparison and alternatives content. Someone searching \"your competitor alternatives\" or \"your product vs competitor\" has buying intent. Those pages convert at way higher rates than general educational content even though the volume is lower.\n\nThe other shift is treating blog content as raw material for distribution rather than a destination. Write the post, then chop it into LinkedIn posts, email content, and sales enablement snippets. The blog itself is the archive, not the primary channel.\n\nThe honest answer is that most company blogs should publish way less frequently and focus only on content that serves someone actively evaluating solutions.",

Once the data was in place, we grouped contacts by roles and industries and looked for patterns.\n\nThe results were clear: several roles we hadn’t prioritized were actually driving sign-ups and engagement for similar products. By adjusting our outreach and messaging toward these real audience signals, we gained 120 new sign-ups within a month.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with structured competitor analysis to guide sales or messaging?

      "text": "NOT A PITCH. CROSS MY HEART lmfao.\n\n\nHaving worked for plenty of startups during my career as a growth consultant (not a consultant anymore…. Thank god) I want to share some really basic pieces of advice that has helped each of my clients that allowed ME to craft the GTM strategy the way it has worked from my experience (please feel free to share rebuttals or if anyone would do something a bit differently). \n\nSaas org leaders & sales that are in startups often have what I call the wolf syndrome. Anyone watched the movie Wolf of Wall Street? Ya they often come off like a dude in ibiza trying to swing you a baggie that he claims is straight from the set of Narcos (forgetting that Narcos was a show & not the real Pablo since he did half of the merch already. BUT… if they mention 9 irrelevant facts like you are reading the Guinness book of records then you will likely forget wtf they even said about narcos… just like the incoming feature dump/use case dump that isn’t remotely related/useful to your org’s pain points but you leave slightly flustered but mainly confused as hell). \n\nThe thing is, pure conviction & eloquence dosnt cut it anymore. Your prospects 70% of the time think you are a bullshit artist & they came in with a mound of research (thanks ChatGPT) & probably have met with 3 other competitors & are actively contemplating personally testing out how high the balcony REALLY is after the meeting.\n\nSo why do sales people still often fail to actually understand wtf their prospects came in looking for? Lack of proper communication between marketing and sales. I’m not talking about the rolling of the eyes convos that I have seen in so many orgs, I’m talking to get sales to really understand the basics, UTMs to understand the messaging, for the love of god do basic background research on the prospect, depending on their existing tech stack & yours, you could see if you can pull technographic insights from platforms. If you have ABM contact software… you can identify the clear journey on the site that lead to demo also (if match rates are high enough). \n\nBasic take away? Marketing needs to provide non patronizing support to sales… sales need to feel empowered enough to actually utilize the support. Without sales… none of us would have a job & without marketing 80% of the time there wouldn’t be an opportunity to even have the company head count we have cuz pipeline would be a fallacy.. Your GTM is only as good as your collaboration with sales. Seen tons of marketers make underhanded comments about sales… and sales reciprocated the gesture. While legal & devs hate us both. So relax with that…\n\nLastly, you are not industry agnostic. A watch is a watch… the use case is telling time… is Patek or Rolex or Omega thinking of “industry agnostic”? No… they know 40% of the population is financing their 34 dollar chicken salad. The use case in its essence is the same as a tissot… but the TAM is split as they want to align with the ICP that can indulge in such products. Industry agnostic is a pipe dream that ironically diminishes any chance of a healthy pipeline. \n\nJust because there are a billion use cases after a “professional micro dose sesh” don’t mean that every industry can be tackled with the same efficiency & velocity. Now if we are talking about pen testing a market? Cool… pick 2-3…. And explain why. Not because you had 2 leads from somewhere or had one sale… that holds no stats sig. don’t have 1st party data? Then do manually verified research & be able to support your hypothesis with tangible market data & pain point that is blatantly obvious. \n\nThen……\n\nActually test that out… but before leads start coming in… please help your sales team out by giving them example sales sim pitches… & make them also prep. but for the love of god marketing teams…. Have your sales enablement materials ready & done well… I mean think about the objections not just a regurgitated homepage word vomit on a 30 slide PowerPoint. \n\nThis is why such assets are best made with the collab of sales. Your best sales person can dog walk your prettily put UVP (not in the exact words but in what actually resonates with an audience). \n\nNow of course there can be anomalies but I recommend that yall give the SaaS jocks the time to show you that selling to a prospect who hasn’t seen their wife and kids in 3 days (even tho they work remotely) can be quite challenging. \n\nAnd sales… stop saying “leads weren’t  qualified”… if you do not have tangible insights as to why… marketing cannot do anything to make it better… so yes… record that call… fill in the minimum notes in that awful software we call salesforce. \n\nEvery demo should ideally be analyzed like watching film… what were the misses? Was it product? Pricing? Timing? Overall PMF mismatch? Or was it cuz sales went into the call with the pre conceived notion that they arnt qualified? ",

Especially the loss ones. There’s also been times we ended up closing an older prospect from few years back due to them being able to voice the why & also why they did or didn’t agree with the decision making panel but had to comply.

I know that cold email and LinkedIn outreach require a lot of testing, discipline, and a clean technical setup. My goal is to spend the next few months building a rock solid foundation instead of just \"spraying and praying\" and hoping for the best.\n\nThe problem is that the \"learning\" space is crowded with gurus and noise.

Are there specific newsletters, creators, or communities that focus on the fundamentals rather than shiny tools?\n* **The \"Experience\" Trap:** What are the biggest mistakes sales professionals make when they transition from handling warm leads to the cold outbound \"trench\" work?\n* **The First 90 Days:** What is one thing you wish you had focused on in your first three months of doing outbound?\n\nI’m looking for mental models and a roadmap for learning, not a list of software recommendations although if you think something like that could be useful for me shoot it.\n\nWhat was the single most helpful resource or lesson that moved the needle for you when you were starting out?",

          "text": "Great questions, and refreshing to see someone approaching this with a \"foundation first\" mindset rather than chasing hacks.\n\nTo your priority question - I'd actually sequence it: **ICP/List Building -> Messaging -> Deliverability**. Here's why: you can have perfect deliverability and land in every inbox, but if you're reaching the wrong people with the wrong message, you've just efficiently wasted your time. Start by getting obsessively clear on who actually has the problem you solve and what language *they* use to describe it.\n\nOn theory vs. execution - this is where most people get stuck. The uncomfortable truth is you need both, but **sequenced correctly**. Spend 2-3 weeks studying frameworks (PAS, AIDA, problem-agitate-solve), then immediately start sending low-volume batches. The trap is endless studying becomes procrastination dressed up as preparation.\n\nThe biggest \"Experience Trap\" I see sales folks fall into: **assuming cold prospects think like warm leads**. With warm leads, they already have context and some intent. Cold means you're interrupting their day - so your messaging needs to earn attention in the first 3 seconds. That's a completely different muscle.\n\nFor your first 90 days, I'd focus on **building a feedback loop**. The challenge with cold outbound is the iteration cycle is painfully slow - you might wait weeks to know if a messaging angle actually works. Anything you can do to compress that learning cycle (whether it's surveying your ICP directly, testing variations faster, or finding ways to simulate response before going live) will compound massively over time.\n\nWhat industry/ICP are you targeting? That might change some of this advice.",

          "text": "I worked for three unicorns, the world's biggest database and tech firms and started my own, small biz.  UK video production (for marketing) because I just wanted to focus on stuff I really enjoy.\n\nMy take is marketing is different for every business depending on markets, product, price point, how the product's evolving.  E.g.  I worked for Salesforce as a contractor 20 years ago and it was morphing from an SME solution into an enterprise solution.  Marketing followed that evolution and went from being very demand-gen to very brand led.\n\nAnd then what worked beautifully for my small business growing from zero was completely different.\n\nLoosely, from what I experienced in the B2B space, it's about being very tactical at the beginning, starting with just winning a few customers, capitalising on those with demand gen and then when you get bigger to focus spend more on brand.  Initially, brand's still super important to get those initial wins but again, it's about getting initial traction by focusing on tactical.\n\nAs to who to listen to, there are a couple who stand out.  Firstly, try to get hold of some vids of Benioff in about 2007 - 2009 when he talks about Salesforce's evolution from demand gen to brand.  That's when the revolution occurred and he talks about it really passionately because it was a real discovery for him and he's really insightful.  And I think those are the people I really listen to.  Either really successful CEO founders who've seen it / done it or senior marketers who've done the same.\n\nThen you've got the academics.  So Ritson is OK for B2C although heavily biased because he's ultimately selling a course and very B2C.  Seth Godin's books are good, if not theoretical.  Porter for a decent academic base but a bit out of date.  Although some CMOs I know still swear by Porter.\n\nThen for influencer, Hermozi is OK despite all the BS.  He strikes me as someone who's distilling lots of good info but hasn't necessarily put those things in place himself within his own businesses.  There are a couple of incredible and very rough-looking early podcasts with Stephen Bartlett.  If you can find them, (the latest ones are just nonsense), he's surprisingly a bit boring and technical talking about pipe, funnels, buyers journeys etc....  Outstanding, though and I used one of those key elements to build my own business successfully.  He took them down but there are a couple still kicking around.\n\nThen you have books.  Almost any book talking about funnels will be useful.  The last one I read was for my undergrad so I've kind of forgotten them but they're much of a muchness.  But you have to take them with a pinch of salt.  There's a guy at Salesforce who wrote a book called 'repeatable revenue.'  I worked with him and what he says he did and what he actually did... well, I'll leave you to research that one.  But there are a ton out there.\n\nFinally, reach out to people who've done it.  Happy to have a chat if you DM me.  I don't know about you but I'm happy to share what I've seen work and what works for me.\n\nAnd as for the first 90 days, build the marketing stuff you need, warm the audience and then call them.  I started in B2B telesales for Reuters.  The whole idea is to warm the audience and then speak to them.  If they're warm, they'll talk to you.  If they're cold, they won't.  So what do you want to do?\n\nTldr; Holy cr@p, this is almost as long as my final year dissertation in marketing!",

We worked closely with founders and growth teams on things like Export Apollo and Sales Navigator, keyword tracking, creator insights, and social listening.\n\nFrom a marketer’s perspective, what was the hardest part of outreach last year?  \nVolume, quality, follow-ups, or measurement?\n\nAlso curious. If you could wave a wand and build one thing to improve outreach in 2026, what would it be?",

Suddenly we're emailing 500 people instead of 50, and the personalisation gets watered down to \"I saw you're hiring\" which everyone ignores.  \n  \nWhat actually moved the needle was staying smaller but way more specific. Like instead of \"I saw you're hiring a sales manager,\" it became \"Noticed you're building out enterprise sales in healthcare - we went through similar growing pains last year when we hired our first AE for that vertical.\"  \n  \nThe hard part is resisting the urge to scale before you've really nailed the message.

Joint planning with sales reps and shared KPIs, outcome was way more buy-in and fewer rejected leads\n2. Content that helps prospects build internal cases, outcome was champions using our pieces to get budget\n3.

Better to engage in discussions and ask questions publicly in threads where the topic comes up naturally.\n\nYour existing network is underrated. Post on LinkedIn saying you're looking to talk to people who fit specific criteria and ask for intros. With our clients doing early research the warmest conversations come through mutual connections, not cold outreach.\n\nRespondent and UserInterviews let you pay $50-100 per interview for qualified participants if you want guaranteed conversations without the outreach grind.

I already have a few B2B clients, but my long-term plan is to develop and sell a product.  \nTo reach that point, I need to learn **sales & marketing** — a skill that I haven’t actively practiced before.\n\nI *could* hire someone to fill that gap, but before doing that, I want to understand the basics myself so I know what to expect and where to direct future efforts.\n\nBased on what I’ve learned so far (mostly theory), here is **the sales & marketing process I’m planning to follow.**  \nI’d love **validation, suggestions, or corrections** from people with experience.\n\n\n\n# 1. Identify where my ideal customers are\n\n* Start with existing clients: look for similar profiles (size, industry, geography, tech maturity)\n* Check my own network first: any potential customers or referrals?\n* Use tools like ChatGPT/LinkedIn/Semrush/etc. to refine ideal customer profiles\n\n\n\n# 2. Segment and group potential customers\n\n* Categorize by industry, revenue, geography, tech stack, pain points\n* Prioritize groups that align closely with my existing expertise\n\n\n\n# 3. Build simple demos / proofs of value\n\n* Create small working demos relevant to each customer segment\n* Present them on a webpage that also works like a *pitch deck* (problems → solutions → credibility → demo)\n\n\n\n# 4. Direct outreach\n\n* Personalized LinkedIn messages, emails, or warm introductions\n* Targeted outreach based on segmentation, not generic messaging\n\n\n\n# 5. Content creation to build visibility & trust\n\n* Post useful, consistent content on LinkedIn\n* Consider Meta platforms depending on customer segment (still unsure here)\n\n\n\n# 6. Paid ads?\n\n* Not sure if Google Ads or LinkedIn Ads make sense at this stage (should I focus on organic + outbound first?)\n\n\n\n# 7. Events & trade shows\n\n* Attend events where my target customers gather\n* Collect contacts → follow up with personalized outreach\n\n\n\n# 8. Sales calls & closing\n\n* Request introductory calls after value is demonstrated\n* Understand the problem → position solution → negotiate → close (I know this part will not be simple, but this is the intent)\n\n\n\n# My question to the community\n\nFor someone in my position (independent B2B engineer building toward a product), **is this a realistic sales & marketing approach to start with?**  \nWhat steps am I missing, overcomplicating, or misunderstanding?\n\nAny *validation, criticism, or practical suggestions* would be super valuable.\n\n\n\n# Thank you!",

The biggest unlock early is doing more discovery calls than demos: pick one narrow ICP, talk to 15–30 people, and write down the exact triggers that make them buy (a project blows up, a deadline, a hiring gap, a compliance change), then build your offer and messaging around those patterns. For consultancy, your fastest path is referrals and proof, so turn your current work into 2–3 tight one-page case studies with numbers and a clear before/after, and use those in outreach instead of new segment-specific demos. I’d skip paid ads for now and put that energy into a simple pipeline tracker and a weekly cadence of outreach + follow-ups, because consistency beats more channels at this stage.",

Yes sales and marketing is important.... but I'm going to kind of put myself out of a job here with the following advice:\n\nDon't bother with marketing until you have a few customers and are sure you've built them something truly useful.\n\nMarketing won't fix a product no one wants and it's a REALLY expensive way to figure that out (in both time and $$$)\n\nSee if you can product-ize something you built as a consultant and refine that with your current clients or do some cold outreach on reddit and linkedin to find your 1st couple customers. Then polish it until your customers love it.\n\nYour marketing efforts will be 10,000% easier this way. You won't be wondering who your ICP is.... you won't be wondering how to talk about your product to your customers since you've already been doing it. You won't need to build demos because you can share proven case studies instead.\n\nThen when you are ready for marketing any money and time you spend there will go so much farther.\n\nTrust me..... I've learned this hard way on both sides of the fence. Happy to share some of my experiences with launching 6 companies in the past 10 years and now consulting for multiple clients.",

Instead of “learning sales,” think “learning how buyers decide.” early on, real conversations will teach you more than content or ads ever will. If you can repeatedly identify a painful problem, show a small proof you can solve it, and get someone to pay, you are already doing effective GTM. The rest is optimization later.",

      "text": "I keep noticing the same pattern across different B2B products: the best “growth people” aren’t brand marketers or SDRs, they’re performance affiliates who understand intent, distribution, and arbitrage. They know how to turn search, communities, and outbound into revenue without needing a huge content team or long nurture cycles. In many cases, they outperform internal teams because they think in terms of offers and funnels, not campaigns.\n\nI’m currently building a B2B product and I’m exploring whether an affiliate-led motion actually makes more sense than traditional outbound or paid ads. Curious how many people here actively run B2B affiliate traffic, what channels you’ve seen work (SEO, newsletters, niche communities, cold email, etc.), and what makes a B2B product worth promoting for you. Not selling anything here - genuinely trying to understand what attracts serious affiliates to a B2B offer.",

That's why I selected cj.com, they have succeeded in creating a large number of registered matches, but I haven't compared them other solutions in a while and you probably should. The number of registered participating companies is my first concern. Then create an offering with clearly defined activities resulting in commissions, and compelling messaging that validates your success in converting traffic into commissionable actitions.

Our VAs are trained by us and handle higher level tasks like automations, funnels, content editing, websites, SEO, branding, social media, basically anything founders either hate doing or don’t know how to do well. We have a solid pool of skilled VAs and we match clients with the right person for their business.\n\nproblem is growth.\n\nIn the beginning we got most of our clients through my network, referrals, and email marketing. Some from the website too. Now referrals have slowed down a lot and email marketing is giving me literally zero results. I feel like I’ve exhausted my network.\n\nWe do have paying clients and the feedback has been really good, which is why this is frustrating. The service works. We start pricing at $8/hour since we’re still new and focused on growing.\n\nRight now I’m kind of stuck on what to do next.\n\nDo I run ads?\n\nDo I build a personal brand?\n\nDo I focus on growing a social media following first?\n\nFeels like too many options and I don’t want to waste time or money going in the wrong direction.

      "text": "Hello guys second post here, quick introduction I sell a service which is basically B2B outreach using cold emails for getting sales meeting using hyper personalized email and it’s completely DFY from warmup to lead gen to actually sending the emails.\n\nI managed to book 4 big enterprises with decisions maker for a marketing agency in Italy when i used to run this system and this year i want to go back at it but in the US where the market is bigger and the pay is better.\n\nNow what I came up with is a simple offer of 90-day pilot for 15k (5k every 30 days) 10 meetings guaranteed with 5M+ in revenue businesses or i keep working for free until we get that number of meeting and after the 10th meeting it’s 400$ per meeting booked.\n\nCause I’m not in the sales game let alone the US B2B market is this 1. A no-brainer offer 2. Too cheap (and so too good to be true) 3. Any part of it it’s too expensive?\n\nI appreciate everyone of you who leaves feedback or critiques and I hope 2026 will be your best year!❤️",

The offer structure is solid, but US buyers are gonna have a shock at $15k upfront for an unproven vendor (to them). Even with the guarantee.  \n  \nI'd split your initial outreach into two buckets. For your first 3-5 US clients, consider a smaller pilot - maybe $3k for 30 days, 3 meetings guaranteed. Lower commitment gets you in the door faster, and you can upsell the full program once you've proven it works in the US market (buying behaviours are different here).  \n  \nThe $400/meeting after 10 is smart. That's reasonable for qualified enterprise meetings.",
