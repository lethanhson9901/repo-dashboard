      "text": "Been running LinkedIn outbound for B2B clients for about 2 years now. Learned everything the hard way.\n\n\n\nHere's what I've landed on for infrastructure:\n\n\n\nFirst thing — never run outbound from a client's personal LinkedIn. Ever. One ban and you've torched their professional network, their content history, everything. Not worth it.\n\n\n\nWhat works instead: dedicated accounts specifically for outbound. Separate from anyone's personal brand.\n\n\n\nThe setup for each client:\n\n\n\n\\- 3-5 LinkedIn accounts per client depending on volume needed\n\n\\- Each account warms up for 2-3 weeks before any outreach (10 connections/day, engage with content, join groups)\n\n\\- Connection requests capped at 20-25/day per account. LinkedIn's limit is technically higher but the sweet spot for avoiding flags is lower\n\n\\- Rotate messaging across accounts so no single account is sending the same template 50x\n\n\\- Residential proxies, one per account. Datacenter IPs get flagged instantly\n\n\\- Activity patterns that mimic real users — no blasting 50 requests at 3am\n\n\n\nThe results across my 6 clients last quarter: \\~800 connections/week total, 12-15% accept rate, zero bans in the last 6 months.\n\n\n\nThe biggest mistake I see people make is trying to scale volume on one account. LinkedIn's detection is behavior-based now. One account sending 100+ requests/day with templated messages is the fastest way to get restricted.\n\n\n\nScale horizontally (more accounts) not vertically (more volume per account).",

I follow a similar horizontal path but focus heavily on the engagement side to keep those accounts safe. LinkedIn rewards real interactions over just sending requests.\n\nMy daily loop looks like this:\n\n1. Use a targeted feed to see only posts from my lead list.\n\n2. Leave 5 thoughtful comments to get my name known.\n\n3. Send a note referencing their specific post.\n\n4. Track every reply to ensure no one slips through.\n\nI use Depost AI to handle this workflow. it helps me manage the targeted feed, draft comments in my style, and track follow ups. It makes the process repeatable without the ban risk. Happy to share my tracking sheet if it helps.",

One restriction and you’ve basically killed their brand presence overnight. Scaling horizontally is the only sustainable way, and keeping connection volume low per account is smart. Most people get banned because they push limits too early or run everything from one profile.\n\nOnly thing I’d add is making sure each account looks real. Profile completeness, light posting, and normal browsing patterns matter as much as proxies.\n\nOverall though, this is one of the more realistic LinkedIn infra breakdowns I’ve seen.

      "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI’m about 4 months into an international B2B sales role at a Turkey-based industrial company, and I feel stuck. I’m starting from zero with no training or mentor, and despite trying cold emails, trade fair outreach, LinkedIn networking, and consistent follow-ups, I’m getting almost no responses. I’m also expected to sell across multiple very different product categories, which makes it hard to build a focused strategy. For those experienced in B2B sales, what should I prioritize to move past the “ignored” phase and start generating real conversations and closing deals? ",

I’d pick one product, one industry, and one target country and go deep for 30 days. Focus on getting conversations, not pitches. Learn how they buy, who the decision makers are, what triggers a supplier switch, and what objections come up. Then rewrite your outreach around that one segment.\n\nAlso, in industrial B2B, direct cold email is rarely enough. Start working distributors, agents, and importers in that market too.

You'll have a core proposition per customer group or per product (ideally the former) your proposition is a compelling offer that resonates. It's something that your organisation does better than the competition in delivering a valued outcome to your client.\n\nIts not easy to get clarity on your proposition but there are fairly formulaic steps you can follow to get there. The first is taking a step back from tactics and trying to really understand your target customer. Not understand what needs they have for your product but truly understand what makes them tick. This can be a little desk research (googling or gpt) but really needs to include calls with clients. No-sales research interviews. It can feel hard to run these when all you wanna do is pitch but it helps things in the long run.\n\nCustomer is most important, doing that and then layering competitor and your product capability should through up some ideas for what your core value proposition is.\n\nIf helpful to lay it out a bit more let me know and I'll write something up.",

It reduced my daily chaos and stopped eating my whole day.

That actually makes it harder because you can't refine one pitch.\n\nA few things that helped us when we were in a similar spot: pick one category and go deep on it first instead of spreading thin across all of them. Way easier to build momentum when you're not switching contexts every call.\n\nAlso, consistent follow-ups matter more than you think. We thought people were ignoring us, too but turns out B2B cycles are just long and people need like 5-7 touchpoints before they even respond. Set up a simple system to track who you've talked to and when to follow up again.\n\nAnd honestly, trade shows and LinkedIn might not be your best channels. What's worked better for us is finding where your buyers actually hang out: industry groups, forums, even niche Slack communities. Cold outreach from those places converts way better than generic LinkedIn messages.\n\nDon't give up yet. Four months is nothing in B2B. Most of our deals took 6-9 months from first contact to close.",

On the surface they sound similar, but I’m starting to think they focus on different parts of the sales process.\n\nSales enablement feels more internal. Things like training reps, organizing content in tools like Seismic or Highspot, managing playbooks, and keeping messaging consistent. It’s about helping the sales team execute better.\n\nBuyer enablement seems more external. It’s about making it easier for the buyer to evaluate, align internally, and move toward a decision. I’ve seen platforms like Trumpet, Dock, or Aligned positioned more on that side because they focus on how proposals, pricing, and next steps are presented and shared after a demo.\n\nSo I’m trying to separate the two in my head. One supports the rep. The other supports the buyer.\n\nFor teams that have invested in both types of tools, how do you define the difference in practice? Where did you see the biggest impact?",

But I would define sales enablement as a subset of buyer enablement. \n\nTo explain, the best description of sales I’ve encountered, and adopted, is that “sales is about helping people buy.”  I also believe that today, the mission of marketing is to help people buy and retain the role of supporting sales.  But as B2B buyers increasingly self-direct their discovery and evaluation of business solutions, buyer enablement now carries 60%-80% of the buyer journey. \n\nThe things that buyers care about at the end of the sales cycle - the sales enablement stage, are the same things that they care about long before sales engagement.  Messaging, content depth, and tactics must progress to meet buyer stage needs throughout the process, before and after sales engagement.  In today’s B2B, sales enablement and buyer enablement are effectively shape-shifting to meet buyer's needs and help people buy. ",

      "text": "I'm a content marketer and here's how we got our first 100 customers the unusual way. \n\nNo ads. No cold calls and No traditional outbound. Just content mapped to buyer intent + Reddit.\n\nHere's the exact system we used:\n- The Content Funnel Approach\nMost companies create random content and pray they start ranking on Google or LLMs. We did the opposite, mapped every single piece to where people were in their buying journey.\n\n- For awareness (TOFU), we created SEO-optimized blog posts answering specific \"how to\" questions our ICP was searching for. We wrote listicles that ranked on Google, things like \"10 ways to solve X problem\" or \"Best tools for Y.\" And we made viral Reels and YouTube Shorts to reach people who weren't actively searching but needed to discover us.\n\nThe goal here was simple: get them into the funnel.\n\nOnce they knew about us, we moved them to consideration (MOFU). This meant in-depth guides comparing different approaches to solving their problem, email nurture sequences that educated without being salesy, and product demo videos showing exactly how our solution worked.\n\nWe weren't trying to close them yet, just building trust and demonstrating expertise.\n\nThe conversion happened at the bottom of the funnel (BOFU). We used alternative guides and more showing specific results, but the real game-changer was our free plan.\n\nWe let people experience the value first before asking for money. This experience-first approach removed all friction. They could test it, see results, then decide to upgrade.\n\nFinally, the Reddit Strategy\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. We heavily targeted high-intent subreddits where our ICP actually lived and asked questions. Not the generic r/marketing or r/business, those are too broad and full of diverse audience, we wanted niche aud.\n\nWe found the specific communities where our ideal customers hung out. Then we did something most marketers won't do: we spent two full weeks just observing and commenting. No promotion. No links. Just genuine, helpful answers to people's questions.\n\nWe built the authority first. Only when it was directly relevant did we mention our product. The leads from Reddit? Highest quality we've ever had. Because they came from real conversations, not orthodox marketing.\nThe Results: 100 customers. All organic without any ad spend.\n\nThe content brought thousands into the funnel through blogs, listicles, and Shorts. The BOFO educated them and built trust. The free plan let them experience value firsthand. And Reddit gave us the most qualified, high-intent leads because we showed up where they were already asking for help.\nThe Real Lesson\nStop creating content randomly. Map every piece to buyer intent.\n\nAnd go where your customers are asking questions, even if that's Reddit.\n\nQuestion for Founders and SaaS team: So what's your approach? Are you creating across the full funnel or just focusing on awareness?",

So they end up with awareness that never compounds.\n\ni especially agree with the two-week observation phase on Reddit. The moment you try to shortcut trust in those communities, you’re dead. The highest-quality leads always come from answering one very specific problem really well, in public, without pitching.\n\nover the last few years I’ve been on the GTM and sales side of B2B and helped scale three businesses to around $1.2M ARR each, and this exact pattern shows up every time. Growth usually unlocks not by doing more channels, but by tightening who you sell to and forcing value discovery earlier in the journey.\n\ncurious how you decided what qualified as BOFU content versus “still education.” that handoff point is where I see most funnels quietly leak.",

I use LeadsRover to scan subreddits for specific keywords and questions, which helps me jump into relevant conversations faster. It even drafts initial responses, though I always tweak them to sound more like me.

Ensure your short company bio is identical on LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and your footer. If they differ, the AI tries to combine them and hallucinates.\n\n\\- Structured Data. If you dont have Organization Schema setup with the sameAs property linking your social profiles, the AI barely knows you exist as a distinct entity.\n\n\\- The About Page. Rewrite it for a 5th grader. No buzzwords. Just say: We do X for Y price. LLMs struggle to parse marketing fluff.\n\n\\-Third party weight.

Is it just a visual refresh, or does the structure and messaging need a full rethink? A lot of the time clunky mobile UX and weak copy can be fixed without blowing everything up. But if WordPress feels bloated with plugins and constant maintenance, that’s usually the sign it’s the stack, not just the design.\n\nSome teams stay on WordPress and clean it up with a lighter theme and fewer plugins. Others use the redesign as a reset and move to a more opinionated builder so updates are easier long term. I’ve seen people switch to simpler setups like Durable for that reason, especially when the goal is clean pages, smoother lead flow, and less backend babysitting.",

Do you sell online (eCommerce) or are you a service business looking for lead gen?\n\nLike what exactly is the purpose of the website?\n\nIs it to generate leads, or sales, or is it just a vanity piece? You need to define that clearly. If it's just a vanity item, focus more on the design and transitions and creative styling than anything else. However, rarely do businesses ever want a website just for aesthetics. \n\nAlso, do you run paid ads? Because if yes, you're going to need to think about conversion much more than anything else. \n\nSo my guess is that it is a little bit of both for you - lead gen/sales + aesthetic. In this case, before jumping into aesthetics, just visualize your ideal client's funnel. How do they find you, what do they wnat to know about you once they find you, and what are the key decision making factors that enable purchase or conversion? Once you know all of this - then build out the website. \n\nI run a performance marketing agency and our proecss for this is similar. We send out a questionnaire that gets this info out of you, then we jump to wire framing - which helps you visualize your funnel, then we jump to the actual branding and designing of the website.  Happy to answer any follow-up questions. \n\n  \nAs for the platform, it really doesn't matter THAT much. If you want you can stick to wordpress and just built a better looking and converting website. \n\nAlso, FYI, for a 10K budget, we could build you a great website that's both aesthetic and high-converting.

          "text": "To your question about having a single source of truth for marketing analytics, my answer is simple: I look at campaign level only, always. And that’s the only thing I’ve ever seen actually work.\n\nI’ve worked almost my entire career in B2B SaaS, so attribution has always been a battle. I’ve never seen a company using first-touch attribution. Most of the companies I’ve worked with were either on last-touch or multi-touch.\nLast-touch misses 90% of the marketing efforts.\nMulti-touch is a mess to set up, and once it’s set up, it’s highly unreliable.\nThe only thing I’ve found to be working is stepping away from that.\n\nThere’s a bit of a learning curve to work with leadership to move past attribution, but once that’s done, it’s a huge relief for both you and them.\n\nSo how does it work, basically?\nYou stop bothering with channel-level attribution and start looking at campaign-level attribution.\nThis obviously requires super clear and tightly integrated marketing campaigns around specific audiences.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have one audience made of CMOs. You build one campaign around this audience and integrate all your channels inside that campaign. Now, any time a CMO comes in, regardless of which channel they came from, since everything is tightly integrated, you consider it a campaign win, not a channel win.\n\nThen you look at ROI at the campaign level:\ntotal budget spent on the campaign\ntotal revenue generated by the campaign\n\nThis does a few things:\nIt saves you a ton of time building reports and trying to make data from multiple platforms tell the same story.\nIt saves you time explaining that story to leadership.\nMost importantly, it prevents leadership from cutting channels just because you can’t “prove” attribution, even though you know deep down that those channels are actually critical to your success.\n\nIf you don’t mind doing a bit of reading, I strongly suggest looking into the RIO integrated campaign framework that explains exactly how to do this and why it helps.\n\nThis is what I started moving toward a couple of years ago, and quite frankly, it now saves me multiple hours every week and a ton of headaches.",

We also have multi-touch attribution in an additional view, but our leadership mostly cares what was the initial source\n\n\\- we also have 'self-reported attribution' to account for 'dark funnel'. I.e. if the source shows 'direct' or 'brand search' or 'organic / home page' - but the lead itself tells a different source (i.e. youtube, linkedin, event), we'll reattribute this conversion to another source. Important -- don't give pre-defined answers but use simple text field instead. \n\n\\- since we have different types of leads (i.e. free plan, free trials with different plans, enterprise dem booking), we also use predictive lead scoring to understand real ad performance, and not just lead counts. \n\n\\- we also send these values back to ad platforms as monetary optimization signals for proper value-based bidding\n\nSo far this approach works best for us. We use SegmentStream's b2b attribution solution for all of this, but there are other tools you may check out (hockey stack, dream data, bizible)",

Per channel.\n\nSo you’re not looking at “LinkedIn generated 200 clicks.” You’re looking at “LinkedIn surfaced 84 new accounts this week, 12 became leads, 3 moved to opportunity in the CRM, representing $47K in pipeline.” Compare that side by side with Google, organic, events — same metrics, same table. Now you actually know what’s working.\n\nAnd every number is clickable. Click a stage → see the accounts. Click an account → see every touchpoint chronologically across every channel. Click a deal → see exactly which campaigns influenced it and how.\n\nThat’s the difference between platform reporting and attribution. Platforms tell you what happened inside their wall.

It’s just showing up as people.\n\nLet your team’s faces be visible. Let your CEO sound like a real person, not a press release. Share the messy middle parts, not just the polished wins.\n\nThe companies I respect most don’t feel like “brands” , they feel like groups of people I’d want to grab a coffee with.\n\nAnd yeah, this goes against everything we were taught about “professional” B2B marketing. But buyers are tired. They’re tired of generic LinkedIn posts, tired of webinars that are nothing but just sales pitches, tired of websites that all say the same thing.\n\nWhat cuts through? A founder doing a real product walkthrough. A CS person sharing what actually annoys them about the industry. A marketer admitting what didn’t work.\n\nSo maybe stop hiding behind the logo. Your buyers want to know who they’re actually working with.",

Today, there’s a big focus on whether you appear in LLMs. But it has never been only about your website.\n\nIn B2B, it has always been multi-touch.\nNow, the number of touches depends on what you’re selling:\nIf you’re targeting small businesses with a low-ticket offer paid by credit card, the journey might be short.\nIf you’re targeting large enterprises with long sales cycles and six-figure contracts, the journey is much longer.\n\nBut at no point was it ever enough to:\nRank first on Google →\nHave someone type the right keyword →\nSee you in position one →\nAnd immediately enter their credit card details.\n\nThat has never been how serious B2B decisions work.\nIt has always been a mix of touchpoints, such as:\nFinding your website and reading a few blog posts\nSeeing an ad in a magazine\nAsking peers what tools they use\nChecking what industry analysts are saying\nReading media rankings of the best solutions\nLooking at conversations on LinkedIn\nAttending events and trade shows to explore options\n\nWith AI, people are acting like the entire game has changed.\nYes, it’s true that LLMs are a new tool.\nYes, they may take time away from traditional search engines.\nBut no one ever made a serious B2B decision based solely on Google. \n\nAnd I don’t believe buyers will suddenly start making six-figure decisions based solely on a ChatGPT response either.\nMaybe it’s different for a $10 purchase.\nIt’s definitely different for a $500,000 contract.\nBut overall, multi-touch remains the foundation.\n\nTo me, AI and LLMs are simply one more channel to integrate into an existing strategy.\nAn important channel? Absolutely.\nA game-changer that replaces everything else? No.\nIf you already operate with a strong, disciplined integrated campaign framework, it’s not a revolution. It’s an addition.\n\nFor me, using the RIO Integrated Campaign Framework gives the structure to build well-orchestrated campaigns. Adding LLM visibility is simply about incorporating another touchpoint into the mix.\nIt doesn’t fundamentally change how I do marketing.\n\nIt’s just one more channel to influence buyers the right way.",

Last month I sent 50 emails to \"Shopify apparel shops in Miami with active Instagram.\" Got 19 replies. Thats when i realized most local lead gen fails before the first email is even sent, usually because the list is too broad. When you target \"local businesses\" or \"ecommerce brands,\" you’re forced to guess the pain points and guess the relevance. You end up writing \"personalization” that doesn't actually mean anything to the prospect.\n\n**Tightening the denominator:** I didnt write better emails, I made my lists so narrow that the offer became obvious.\n\nInstead of \"Ecommerce brands in Miami\" I started building lists like “Apparel shops in Miami” that\n\n* Were using Shopify or WooCommerce\n* With an active Instagram presence\n\nOnce the list is that specific, you aren't selling services, you’re continuing a conversation they’re already having.\n\n* The offer becomes a logical fit.\n* The language matches how they actually talk.\n* Personalization stops feeling like a tactic and starts feeling like actual research\n\n**Reading reviews** **:** Once I had a tight, narrow list, I read some reviews for more context-\n\n* Staff names: Mentioning \"I saw Joey gets a lot of love for same-day installs\" hits 10 times harder when your offer is actually relevant to them.\n* Customer Wins: What do people actually praise? Speed? Trust? Reliability?\n\n**Reducing reply friction :** I also stopped asking for 15 minute calls (high friction). If the list is high-quality, the reply should be low effort.\n\n* \"Worth a quick look? A) Yes B) Not a fit C) Ask me in a month.\"\n* Rule of thumb: If it takes more than 5 seconds to decide how to reply, they won't.\n\nYou can do all of this manually, personally I got tired of the research taking 10-12 minutes per lead, so I built a tool to automate this, run a search like “Apparel Shops in Miami, using Shopify or WooCommerce, with Instagram presence” and then:\n\n* Builds tightly filtered local leads lists ( with emails, socials, tech stack).\n* Firmographics and all other details.\n* Gives you decision makers mentioned, their bios, standout staff, review insights, etc.\n* Gives you context based personalization snippets and outreach hints, so you can focus on offer and CTA.\n\nThe goal isn’t \"AI written spam.\" It's about automating the manual research step so you can actually scale a narrow ICP.\n\nI’m running a beta for this, currently have 2 agencies and 3 others testing it out in beta and using the tool’s data in real outreach, if this seems useful to you, please DM.

It seems like so many people focus just on collecting contacts or building email lists, but I feel there’s a bigger picture, like finding the right prospects, building meaningful relationships, and creating a steady flow of opportunities without wasting time on the wrong leads. I’m curious about how others approach it and what they consider the most valuable outcomes from investing time and effort into lead generation.\n\nI’d really love to hear your insights and experiences. Have you tried strategies or tools that made a real difference in finding quality leads or improving conversions? Are there methods that surprised you with unexpected benefits, like better client relationships, clearer targeting, or even internal process improvements? Any advice, suggestions, or lessons learned would be incredibly helpful, not just for me, but for anyone looking to understand the real impact of lead generation beyond just numbers.\n\n",

B2B copy should be the same but most people find one message that \"works\" and run it until it dies\n\nwe switched one campaign from feature-focused (\"here's what we do\") to pain-focused (\"here's the problem you're probably dealing with\"). same list, same offer, same infrastructure. reply rates roughly doubled. the angle is the single biggest lever in your copy\n\nwhat to test in order of impact:\n\n* the angle (how you frame their problem)\n* the offer (what you're proposing)\n* the first line (your hook)\n* social proof\n\nwhat doesn't really move the needle: subject lines and CTAs. those tend to be hit or miss. once you find a pattern that works, keep it and only revisit occasionally. your time is better spent testing angles and offers\n\n**5. match your reading level to your audience**\n\n5th-6th grade reading level is the default and it works for most B2B outreach. simpler words, shorter sentences. but always think about who you're actually writing to. a CTO and a VP of marketing process language differently. different job titles have different technical thresholds\n\nif you mention something they don't understand or don't care about, they stop reading. every word should be immediately clear to exactly the segment you're targeting. this doubles as a natural qualifier too - the right people get it instantly, the wrong ones self-select out without wasting anyone's time\n\n**6. shorter is almost always better**\n\ndepends on your audience and value prop but as a default, <70 words copy means:\n\n* less overwhelm the moment they open it\n* readable on a phone without scrolling (most people read messages on mobile first)\n* clearer what you actually want from them\n* faster to process between meetings\n\nthe thread through all of this - stop writing from your perspective and start thinking about what a busy person will actually absorb in 8 seconds on their phone. that one mindset shift fixes most B2B copywriting problems",

Getting their email is the easy part, but cold email response rates are pretty rough unless you're hyper-personalised.  \n  \nI'd suggest focusing on micro-niches first (like physiotherapy clinics in Texas, or family-owned HVAC companies in Florida) rather than \"all small businesses\". That way you can craft messaging that actually speaks to their specific pain points rather than generic \"AI will help your business\" stuff.  \n  \nFor outreach, consider adding video into your workflow once you've got the contact list. Recording a quick 30-second personalised video explaining how your tool would work for their specific business type tends to cut through the noise better than text alone.  \n  \nWhat vertical or business type are you planning to start with?",

      "text": "We recently had a post go viral (hit 4M+ views), which was a massive surprise. But as soon as the numbers spiked, the 'brand tax' hit us: we got banned from several major subreddits. The moderators' logic was simple: 'You’re a brand, so this is marketing, regardless of the content.'\n\nNow that the dust has settled, I’m looking at these 'vanity metrics' and feeling a bit lost. On one hand, we have 4.3M views and decent karma. On the other hand, we are now 'blacklisted' from the very places where our audience hangs out.\n\nMy question for the veterans here: > Does having a 'high-authority' corporate account actually translate into leads or sales in the B2B world? Or is the friction with moderators and the community so high that it’s better to just stick to personal handles or paid ads?",

Real subject-matter experts who show up consistentlyy and add value usually go further than a branded account trying to go viral.

Reddit is a platform that fundamentally values personal interaction, and sometimes, that can get conflated with common lead generation tactics. Because of that, it can be easy to think that it's just adapting existing lead gen tactics into a new format, but the reality is much more specific to Reddit. \n\nReddit has a high-intent audience, sure, but it's also an audience that likes to handle its own decision-making, as well as congregating in defined communities that they *trust*, most importantly. Similarly, you as a brand have to gain trust the same way, by being a member of the community that shows respect and consistency for the community's rules and guidelines while *expecting* nothing in return. Is that less defined than a paid campaign? For sure. But when it's done right, lasting trust not only retains your audience, it becomes advocacy.",

A founder sharing genuine insights gets upvoted. The same content from a branded account gets reported. That's not a bug, it's how the platform works.\n\nYour 4M views almost certainly generated near zero pipeline because viral Reddit posts attract random eyeballs not qualified buyers. The B2B companies quietly generating leads from Reddit are doing it through personal accounts, helpful comments, and zero branding in their username. They'll never go viral and they don't need to because 10 genuine conversations in niche subreddits with decision makers beats 4M views from people who'll never damn buy anything.",

The corporate account paradox is real on Reddit because moderators (and users) are trained to spot and reject anything that feels like marketing, even when the content is genuinely valuable.  \n  \nFrom what I've observed, the personal account approach works better for a few reasons. You can participate in communities without triggering automatic suspicion, your advice lands better because it's coming from a person rather than a brand, and you actually build relationships over time rather than just broadcasting.  \n  \nThat said, I wouldn't write off the corporate account entirely. Use it for your own subreddit if you have one, for official announcements, and for responding when people specifically ask about your company. Just don't try to be everywhere with it.  \n  \nThe 4M views are nice for awareness, but you're right to be sceptical about lead gen impact. Most B2B buyers aren't going from \"saw a Reddit post\" to \"submitted a demo request\" in one go. It's more about staying top of mind and building trust gradually.  \n  \nWhat was the actual post about that went viral?
