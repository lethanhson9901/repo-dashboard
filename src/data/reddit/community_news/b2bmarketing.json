      "text": "Working with clients across B2B, the biggest difference I see between teams that feel calm and teams that feel overwhelmed isn’t budget or tools, it’s focus. The strongest teams are very intentional about where human effort goes. They don’t try to deeply analyze everything. They use systems to handle the background work and save their thinking time for positioning, messaging, and decisions that actually move the needle.\n\nOn a lot of accounts, the messy part isn’t creativity, it’s the in-between work. Research, list cleanup, checking whether accounts are still relevant, keeping data in sync. When that layer is handled cleanly, clients are able to spend more time on strategy instead of maintenance. I’ve seen teams use tools like Clay for research and signals, HubSpot as the source of truth, and Notion to keep plans visible. The exact stack varies, but the mindset stays the same.\n\nThe pattern that keeps showing up is this: the better the focus, the less the team feels the need to overbuild process. They automate the boring parts, stay thoughtful about the rest, and move faster without feeling rushed.",

This is not a channel problem yet. If Google ads brought junk traffic and LinkedIn feels easier, the real issue is probably messaging and ICP clarity, not the platform. Paid just amplifies what already works.\n2. Thought leader ads = learning, not pipeline. With $1.5k over a week, expect signals, not demos. You are testing awareness and message resonance, not demand. Judge success by comments, profile visits, and DMs, not conversions.\n3. Ads only work after messaging is proven. The best LinkedIn ads come from posts and DMs that already get replies organically. If you have not validated that yet, ads will feel random.\n4. This is where fractional makes sense. You are too early to hire a paid ads specialist, but too far along to guess. A fractional growth setup focuses on ICP, messaging, organic validation, then turns on paid as a multiplier, not a gamble. That is exactly how I work with bootstrapped B2B SaaS teams.\n\nIf you want a quick sanity check, share your ICP and deal size and I can tell you if this test is worth running or better paused.",

Document ads are great on LinkedIn, but you really need to know who your customer is by title and industry. The document also needs to be compelling for the user to want to download. For Google ads, you need to give the system a lot of information, for example, are your conversion pixels setup properly? Are you passing information for offline conversions back to Google? You can get help with setting this up via AI. Claude is a great option and can walk you through it. Google needs to have about 7-14 days to learn, so if you are strapped for cash, try running one campaign at $40/day. Be very tight with your keywords and don't touch the system for at least a couple of days. You can check out the search terms report and block irrelevant searches.

Remember, pipeline is irrelevant if you're really doing it for awareness - which may sound nice but remember in the end someone will be asking where is the revenue right quick so be ready for awareness vs. pipeline chat.\n2. Immediately turn off any Week 1 ads with some decent impression count compared to the rest, but are below 1% CTR\n3. Keep in mind depending on your spend, timing (weekends turned off or on? That's another thread entirely) geo targeting, titles, etc, even your best ads will fatigue within 10 days or so. You'll start to notice because last week's CTR winner is this week's not so much, especially when impressions per unique tap out at 5+. The catch 22 is the best clicked ads get shown more by the algorithm until people see them 3+ more repeated times and they ignore.\n4. You may be able to turn the best ones back on a few weeks later - or of course with a different targeting set - but know they will decay.\n5. Yes as stated before definitely turn OFF audience expansion no matter what pablum messaging is in the interface encouraging you to do so.\n6. I assume this Phillipines thing is sending you targeting emails that you are uploading as Audiences in Linkedin for specific targeting?\n7. The titles field is powerful for segmentation - know your vertical and understand if Managers have budget or does it start with Director and above.\n8. Again, if it's awareness, any broad targeted clicks by whatever title may work but be ready to push back when asked about ROI and \"where is the Pipeline from all this  spend?\" And in the end it always comes down to it so I'd put the awareness spend at no more than 20% effort.\n9. North star is CTR above 3% - and keep in mid it's all about the visuals as you want people to stop scrolling, especially on their phones.\n10. That said, white papers are great for thought leadership and positioning but depending on your vertical, they attract researchers, students, interns, data analysts, who are all great people but likely don't have huge budget or need to buy your full product, or the internal pull to make it happen. Again, awareness vs. ROI. Case studies work.\n11. And the same whitepaper can be positioned differently for those budget-conscious personas to get their attention.\n12. Pro tip: Mention  \"career,\" \"job,\", \"Your team\", \"falling behind\", \"becoming irrelevant,\" \"getting ahead,\" \"stay updated,\" etc because in the end it's a career preservation social platform. Good luck and keep us posted.\n\n(Edited for numbering)",

What makes sense is that he will need less validation and more likely to get to the next step faster whether to book a call or to subscribe. \n\nBased on my experience with an AI b2b startup, companies like these needs to deploy itself somewhere and build a strong presence utilizing content and communication with its target audience to get a better chance communicating with the same audience else where …. So choosing LinkedIn could be a better solution at your stage for sure. \n\nBut you won’t be able to get ROI from sales focused ads right now, what you need to focus on is choosing a specific segment of audience (an industry or a specific job title) and start boosting content that delivers your message to them, raise their awareness about your existence and raise the brand recognition. This is called top of the funnel (TOFU) \n\nAfterwards, you can create sales ads for this segment, but when you do you will be sure that you have built your presence and that your target audience are recognizing you, so you get a better chance in communication with them (middle of the funnel), and then you close them through sales efforts. \n\nI hope my comment was helpful, and if you need any further information from me or have any questions feel free to message me directly.",

Where I’ve seen it help is clarity, which message gets ignored, which title clicks, which segment doesn’t care at all. If you treat it as a fast feedback loop instead of a growth channel, it can be worth it. If you expect pipeline, you’ll probably be disappointed.",

Leads stall after the initial touches because they may be \"qualified\" on paper but not during an active buying window.\n\nExpectation gap plus handoff. The buyer becomes confused or loses urgency when marketing makes one promise and sales has a different conversation.\n\nThe stage you're measuring is incorrect. While MQL → SQL → opp quality is poor, MQL volume and even follow-up speed may appear healthy.\n\nThere's no obvious \"why now.\" Most will if the lead can postpone for three months without facing any repercussions.\n\nTightening ICP, adding more stringent qualification regarding timing and urgency, and aligning the first sales call with the same narrative that marketing developed are typically the quickest fixes.",

For example, proposal drops after meetings, problem is the meeting stage. \n\nHow to fix it:\n- for lead quality: adjust the landing page. Target correct ICP. Write correct message.\n- for meeting: focus on their situation and pain points.\n- for proposal: recap their pain point. Show them how your solution can ease their pain.\n\nIf u want I can do review for free for u. Happy to help.",

Lurk on those communities for a period, and then, create detailed answer that provide value, but not a sales pitch. The outcome will tell you whether your product aligns with your ICP and the type of content each community discuss. \n\nAs for paid ads, we have had our most sucess on Reddit Ads, especially through conversations. We begin by selecting a very small number of highest fit subreddits, running thread level ads to a middle funnel asset such as a guide or comparison page, and tagging every ad in the CRM using UTM's to allow us to determine which subs and threads are really converting.",

Then boom - overnight my CAC went from $38 to $142. I literally threw up in my mouth a little.\n\n**The \"Oh Shit\" Moment**\n\nI had 6 weeks of runway left\n\nTurned off all ads. Pipeline dropped 89% overnight.\n\nBut then I remembered this random ass comment from a Reddit thread about some guy who scaled to $2M ARR entirely on cold email. Figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nStarted with 3 mailboxes and zero idea what I was doing.\n\n12 weeks later: $107K in closed revenue from cold email alone.\n\nHere's exactly what I did.\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\nI started with 3 domains.\n\nThe math: 3 mailboxes × 33 emails per day = 100 emails/day to start.\n\nNot sexy. Not scalable yet. But it worked\n\nBy week 2, I was at 300 emails/day. Inbox rate? 73%. Not amazing, but not in the spam dungeon either.\n\nThe setup:\n\n* Bought aged domains (6+ months old) from expired domain marketplaces\n* Set up proper DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n* Warmed with Instantly's built-in warmup for 14 days before sending a single cold email\n\n**Week 3-4: The Lead Scraping System That Actually Works**\n\nHere's where I got weird.\n\nEveryone's out here buying Apollo lists and wondering why their emails sound like everyone else's. I said fuck that.\n\nI built custom software (okay fine, I paid a developer on Upwork $800, but I PROJECT MANAGED IT so basically I built it).\n\nThe scraper:\n\n* Pulls company websites from my ICP search\n* Scrapes their actual website copy, tech stack, recent blog posts\n* Hits LinkedIn to grab decision-maker info\n* Feeds it all into a prompt that writes personalized first lines\n\nPeople open emails that feel like you actually visited their website. Wild concept, I know.\n\n**Week 5-8: Scaling to 1,500 Emails/Day Without Losing My Mind**\n\nThis is where it got real.\n\nFrom 300 emails/day to 1,500/day.\n\nThe math: 1,500 emails/day × 21 working days = 31,500 emails per month.\n\nAt a 3% reply rate (industry average is 1%, but personalization is magic), that's 945 replies.\n\nAt a 15% meeting booking rate from replies, that's 141 meetings.\n\nAt a 25% close rate... you see where this is going.\n\nMy CAC went from $142 on Meta to $47 with cold email. And it kept dropping as I optimized.\n\nI shut down Meta ads entirely. Haven't looked back.\n\nNow I run a cold outreach agency helping other B2B companies do the same thing. Turns out when you figure out how to print money, people want to pay you to teach them.\n\n**The Shit No One Tells You**\n\n* Week 1 was fucking BRUTAL. 6% inbox rate because I didn't warm properly\n* I got my first domain blacklisted on day 4\n* Gmail's spam filters updated in week 5 and tanked my inbox rate overnight. Had to pivot my entire sending strategy\n\nAnyone wants my templates/sequences/scraper setup, drop a comment.\n\nI'll put everything together in a Google Doc (might take me a few days, I need to clean up my shamefully disorganized Notion workspace first).\n\nNo courses, no coaching, no bullshit.

Traditional channels like events, ads, and referrals were expensive and delivered inconsistent, hard-to-measure results.\n\nAfter shifting to a targeted email-led outreach strategy, we built a predictable pipeline.

Pick one ICP slice and one use case Most teams at this stage are still too broad. “Mid-market B2B” is not a strategy.\n2. Prove messaging before scaling channels Paid, content, and outbound all fail when messaging is fuzzy.\n3. Use outbound as a learning engine, not just a sales engine\n4. Content should support sales, not wait for SEO\n5. Stop running channels in silos The biggest waste I see is teams treating paid, content, outbound, and LinkedIn as separate things. What works is one clear message, reused everywhere:\n\n* Outbound tests it\n* LinkedIn amplifies it\n* Paid scales it\n* Content supports it\n\nThat is how you move faster with fewer resources.\n\nThis is also why many teams at this stage move to a fractional model instead of hiring specialists or agencies. One owner across channels usually beats three disconnected tactics.",

The look and feel of your website and brand design is so important.\n2. Organic social content: Again undervalued, but important to keep somewhat consistent.\n3. Paid ads (the key): Easy to understand messaging that solves your customer problem paired with **great** video, motion and graphic content is a winning formula. This takes some experimenting with various messages, method of delivery and channels. From experience, targeting particular roles within an org through video ads - motion and short testimonials has been most successful.\n\nHaving someone within your company in control of brand & content strategy, supported by a content creation agency may be your best best for scaling.",

I think it can be very useful but it's oftentimes imperfect and people will use it as a crutch and their work suffers. So if some of these CRMs can produce quality Al outputs then that's great but if it's full of hallucinations then I can only imagine the havoc it'd wreak on our pipeline.",

For example, we use it to monitor job changes, funding announcements, and tech stack changes at target accounts. That stuff is factual and easy to verify, so less room for hallucinations.  \n  \nThe call and email analysis features can be useful but you need to spot check them regularly. I'd recommend running any new AI tool in parallel with your current process for at least a month before trusting it fully. Compare the AI recommendations against what your best reps would do manually.  \n  \nThe real danger is when sales teams stop thinking critically because \"the AI said so\".

I know enough about lead gen to fake it in a pitch but we can't really activate well against it.\n\nOur primary model with bigger clients is to work with partner agencies in order to leverage scale when possible.  We have a proven partner for the brand space.  We need one for demand/lead gen.  Right now we are relying on a (somewhat flakey) freelancer to run our Google Ads accounts.  I run LinkedIn and other socials with the one junior on my team.\n\nI'm looking for either an agency or a rock solid freelancer that we can white label and bring on when necessary.  Definitely need to see some solid DG/LG case studies in addition to standard creds. We've lost pitches because we don't have this capability.\n\nFor case studies, I'm not sure exactly what we're looking for but maybe something that talks about lead quality (% that converted to SALs for example) or direct ties to closed /won $$$.\n\nI've been challenged by our CEO to come up with a short list of agencies to RFP.  Trying to Google this topic is a hellscape so I figured I'd start here.  Feel free to comment or hit my Reddit DMs.\n\nedit:\nSomeone sent me DM about cold emails and I fat fingered it and hit \"ignore\". Apologies for that.

          "text": "The white-label demand gen partner search is tricky because the agencies good enough to produce SAL conversion data and closed-won attribution usually have their own client roster and aren't hungry for white-label arrangements. The ones actively seeking white-label work are often the B-tier players who couldn't build their own book.\n\nThe exception is smaller shops or senior freelancers who prefer the referral model over business development. They exist but they're not advertising \"white label demand gen\" because their pipeline comes from relationships exactly like what you're describing.\n\nThe case study red flags to watch for: agencies showing MQL volume without downstream metrics are hiding poor lead quality. Anyone who can't speak to sales feedback loops or lead-to-opportunity conversion probably isn't measuring what matters. Our clients evaluating demand gen partners usually find that the willingness to discuss what didn't work is more telling than polished success stories.\n\nThe RFP criteria worth emphasizing: ask specifically about their process for feedback loops with sales teams, how they define and measure lead quality beyond form fills, and what their approach is when a campaign produces volume but sales says the leads are garbage. The good partners have answers because they've navigated this tension before.\n\nThe sourcing approach since Google is useless: LinkedIn posts from demand gen practitioners you respect, asking peers at non-competing agencies who they've partnered with, and honestly the HubSpot and 6sense partner directories sometimes surface capable smaller shops.\n\nThe freelancer versus agency question: a senior freelancer with 10+ years of B2B demand gen experience might outperform a mid-tier agency and be more flexible on white-label terms.",

The ones doing their own demand gen well are usually better at doing it for others.  \n  \nFor vetting, ask to speak directly with the people who'd actually work on your accounts, not just the sales team. We learned this the hard way after partnering with an agency where the pitch team vanished after signing.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if they have experience with your typical deal sizes and sales cycles. An agency crushing it for SaaS with $5k ACV might struggle with enterprise deals that take 18 months to close.  \n  \nOne thing that worked for us was starting with a small paid test project before committing to a full partnership. Something like running one campaign for 60 days. Tells you loads about their communication style and whether they'll actually hit deadlines.  \n  \nWhat's your typical client deal size and sales cycle length?",

Refreshing. Checking again. Like throwing messages in bottles and never knowing if anyone found them.\n\nAnd honestly? It felt exhausting.\n\nSo I flipped it. Instead of talking, I started listening.\n\nI stopped posting every day and started tracking what my audience was actually talking about. Not on my posts. On theirs. In comment threads. In replies. The stuff they were complaining about, asking about, struggling with.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Finding posts where my ICP was already discussing their problems\n* Engaging in those conversations instead of creating new ones\n* Actually reading what people needed instead of guessing\n* Accepting that silence is okay if you have nothing useful to add\n\nIt's been surprisingly different. Less anxiety about \"does this post perform.\" More real conversations with people who actually need help. More trust built through showing up, not broadcasting.\n\nIf this resonates, maybe try this: spend one day not posting anything. Just find three posts where your audience is talking about something you know. Comment something genuinely helpful. See what happens.\n\nWould love to hear from others here. Does LinkedIn still feel like a place you \"network\" or has it quietly become a place where everyone's just talking at each other?",

For the most part, their main goal seems to be building awareness of their own products and services. And it, just like networking in real-life, it's the same heads all the time. This wears very thin after a while. \n\nThe actual \"do-ers\" on the other don't seem to be continually LinkedIn. They're probably too busy doing the actual work. And, for your IP / data protection tool, these are the people you need to target.\n\nSo, maybe the best route for you here could be using webinars, inbound content or events targeting personas such as CISO / Systems Administrators / IT Managers / Compliance Managers, MSSPs and in-house Data Protection officers.  A cold-outreach strategy should also be considered but bear in mind that cohorts like system administrators and IT manager can be very averse, even hostile, to cold outreach so you might want to keep this strategy limited to other personas mentioned above.",

However, only 10% of his network are reading his posts and he has zero leads and business from this activity.\n\n  \nOutreach - that is specifically contacting people on LinkedIn can be very useful. As another poster mentioned, a bit of automation can help. I'm not advocating mass comms, or AI written posts, but sensible use of automation can safely amplify your reach and scale.

Nobody cares about your process until they trust you can deliver results. Also founder-led sales matters way more for services because buyers want to meet the actual people doing the work, not just a sales rep.\n\nWhat works best is targeted cold outreach to companies showing signals they need your help, content that demonstrates deep expertise in your niche, and partnership referrals with complementary firms.

They think your marketing is great. But sometimes the pain is not acute enough for them to act. They don't want to be \"that person\" who buys \"that solution\" that is never used or is a flop or results in reputations getting burned. That's normal. In B2B context, most people who buy are trying to protect their own reputations. Half the battle is getting a second person within the target organisation onboard. \n\nThis is why B2B selling becomes easier when you know how to leverage that social dynamic withing organisations to your advantage. Because once you get more than one person involved in the buying process, the personal \"reputational\" risk for the buyer is now hedged. Listening in on sales calls is great way to find out how people more experienced than you turn prospect into a \"champion\" or find a champion for your product within the organisation. Check out a book called The Challenger Customer - it helps explain this dynamic in a bit more detail.",

          "text": "2% reply rate on cold email isn't dying, that's actually pretty normal if you're targeting right. The problem is people expect 20% and get discouraged when reality hits. Our clients doing real volume see similar numbers and still generate solid pipeline because they're sending to qualified lists, not random blasts.\n\n\"Show up where your audience talks\" means actually participating in communities without pitching. Like if you sell to e-commerce brands, join their Facebook groups, answer questions on Reddit, comment on relevant LinkedIn posts. Build credibility first, then people DM you asking what you do. It's slower but the leads are way warmer than cold outreach.\n\nFor finding people ready to buy, track intent signals. Companies hiring for roles your product supports, recent funding announcements, tech stack changes, competitor review sites showing frustration. These indicate actual pain happening now versus \"might need this someday.\" Use Sales Navigator job alerts or set up Google alerts for your target keywords plus funding/hiring news.\n\nYour workflow should be multi-touch. Email, LinkedIn connection, engage with their posts, email again in 5 days, call if you have their number. One touchpoint doesn't cut it anymore. Most deals take 7 to 12 touches before someone even responds, let alone buys. If you're giving up after one email, that's your problem right there.",

What is dying is trying to sell before there’s any context or trust.\nFor us, it’s worked much better when people already “know” us before sales ever shows up. That usually happens through organic content, community participation, or just being visible in the right places. By the time someone reaches out or replies, the conversation doesn’t feel cold anymore.\nIn-person events have also been surprisingly effective again, but not big flashy ones. Smaller meetups, dinners, or industry events where you can actually talk. They don’t always turn into leads right away, but they speed up trust a lot.\nI don’t see it as events vs digital. Digital still matters, but impressions alone don’t do much. What helps is repeated exposure to how you think, not what you sell.\nSales works best when it comes later, once interest already exists. Cold messages with no context still get ignored. Messages that land after someone’s seen your content or met you once feel completely different.",

I did a test last year and I participated in these for about 2 months - whenever I saw a post like that I commented on it. They have impressive viral engagement on them as the algorithm seems to like the format. The problem is that 99% of the content I have received in this way has been crap. Very bad quality AI created slop, based on one key insight or idea. And they are presented as \"Download my playbook that I used to create 1 million dollars in my pipeline\".

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m seeing a lot of fintech SaaS teams stuck in the same loop right now:\n\n* 6–12 month sales cycles\n* compliance/legal as a hard gate\n* buyers ghosting anything that feels generic\n* “We need more leads” when the real issue is quality, trust and timing\n\nI’ve been working in B2B fintech SaaS (payments APIs, fraud/risk, lending, compliance automation), and a few patterns are consistently working in 2026 without needing insane ad budgets.\n\n**1) Hyper-narrow ICP and positioning**\n\n“Secure fintech platform” is invisible now.\n\nThe teams winning are painfully specific, like:\n\n>“Real-time fraud APIs for mid-market fintechs processing 50k and tx/day who need lower false positives without killing approval rates.”\n\nThat level of clarity makes ABM, content, outbound, and even demo flows way easier to execute.\n\nQuick test: can your ICP fit on one line with a disqualifier?\n\n**2) Intent signals > volume**\n\nA lot of teams still run outbound like it’s 2021: big lists, sequences and hope.\n\nWhat’s working better is signal-based targeting, even if the list is smaller:\n\n* compliance hiring spikes\n* vendor migration chatter\n* sudden increase in security/legal content consumption\n* product pages visited after pricing pages (big one)\n\nIt’s less “spray and pray” and more “show up when the pain is awake.”\n\n**3) Thought leadership that’s about risk and ROI** \n\nFintech buyers don’t want “innovation.” They want:\n\n* “Will this break us?”\n* “Will regulators hate this?”\n* “Will this reduce chargebacks/fraud losses without nuking approvals?”\n\nContent that performs best tends to be:\n\n* risk frameworks (“how this fails”)\n* ROI math with assumptions\n* implementation timelines (what actually takes 2 weeks vs 3 months)\n* AI governance / explainability (especially for fraud and lending)\n\nThe trust-building content isn’t flashy it’s specific and defensible.\n\n**4) Partnerships are still the fastest path to warm pipeline**\n\nEmbedded finance is noisy, but partnership motion is very real when done right.\n\nThe best fit I keep seeing:\n\nFintech SaaS and vertical SaaS / platforms with distribution\n\n(ERP, procurement, commerce tools, industry-specific software)\n\nEven a lightweight co-marketing and integration narrative can create higher-intent conversations than cold outbound.\n\n**5) Interactive beats long PDFs**\n\nMost decision makers won’t read a 50-slide deck.\n\nThings that get better engagement:\n\n* short, personalized demo videos (3–5 mins)\n* self-serve “what would this save me?” simulators\n* implementation checklists (security and compliance friendly)\n\nYou don’t need to be fancy just reduce the effort to understand the value.\n\n**6) First-party data is the real advantage now**\n\nWith privacy and cookie loss, the compounding strategy is:\n\n* SEO that targets “switching” queries (migration, alternatives, comparisons)\n* gated tools (checklists, calculators, templates)\n* newsletters that attract the right buyer persona\n* lifecycle content that supports expansion (bowtie)\n\nThe teams that win are building a feedback loop, not a one-time funnel.\n\n**7) Bowtie mindset: marketing owns expansion too**\n\nIn fintech SaaS, expansion is where the unit economics get clean.\n\nMarketing can support this by building:\n\n* onboarding education (reduce time-to-value)\n* usage-based upsell triggers (feature adoption campaigns)\n* proof libraries for security/compliance objections\n* customer stories that show “what changed after implementation”\n\n# Curious what others are seeing\n\n**What’s killing fintech SaaS lead gen for you right now?**\n\nLong cycles? Trust barriers? Procurement/compliance drag? Crowded category?\n\nAnd are you leaning more into:\n\n* partnerships and distribution\n* intent and signal-based outbound\n* trust-first content (risk/ROI/implementation)\n\nWould love to hear what’s working in your niche.",

Most teams are late *and* generic, which is a brutal combo.\n\nThe intent-signal point is huge. Volume-based outbound feels completely dead unless there’s a real reason for you to exist in someone’s inbox that week. Showing up when pain is *forming*, not after it’s been blasted by five vendors, changes the entire dynamic.\n\nI’d add one thing that seems under-discussed: **speed + freshness as a trust signal**. When buyers realize you’re reacting to *current* conditions instead of running recycled plays, it immediately lowers skepticism. Even strong content gets ignored if it feels like it was written “for everyone.”\n\nAlso agree on interactive > static. Anything that answers “what will this realistically look like for *me*?” beats polished thought leadership right now.\n\nCurious if others are seeing the same drop-off once something feels even slightly templated. It feels like relevance windows are getting shorter every quarter.",

It was turning LinkedIn into a boring daily system instead of a place I randomly post and pray.\n\nHere’s the loop I run now that consistently books B2B calls:\n\n\\-   Start with a hand built prospect list (not the feed) 50–150 ICP accounts + people in each.\n\n\\-  Create a “mini feed” just for those people. Each day I only look at posts from that list.\n\n\\-   Warm them with 5–10 real comments per day.\n\n\\-   Send connection requests only once they’re warm.\n\n\\-   First DM = context + one easy question.\n\n\\-   Treat follow ups like a pipeline, not an afterthought.\n\nWhat was a waste of time: Mass cold DMs, InMails without prior interaction, Posting more content hoping “leads will come”.\n\nThe system above still takes \\~30–45 minutes a day, but it made results predictable. To keep a targeted feed of prospects and run this system, I use Depost AI. It helps me build targeted feeds, draft comments and DMs and tracks follow ups so I don't miss anyone.",
