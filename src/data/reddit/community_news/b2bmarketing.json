      "text": "Working with clients across B2B, the biggest difference I see between teams that feel calm and teams that feel overwhelmed isn’t budget or tools, it’s focus. The strongest teams are very intentional about where human effort goes. They don’t try to deeply analyze everything. They use systems to handle the background work and save their thinking time for positioning, messaging, and decisions that actually move the needle.\n\nOn a lot of accounts, the messy part isn’t creativity, it’s the in-between work. Research, list cleanup, checking whether accounts are still relevant, keeping data in sync. When that layer is handled cleanly, clients are able to spend more time on strategy instead of maintenance. I’ve seen teams use tools like Clay for research and signals, HubSpot as the source of truth, and Notion to keep plans visible. The exact stack varies, but the mindset stays the same.\n\nThe pattern that keeps showing up is this: the better the focus, the less the team feels the need to overbuild process. They automate the boring parts, stay thoughtful about the rest, and move faster without feeling rushed.",

They ask questions, look for help, and post about their pain points here regularly (sometimes even complain about your competitors) - which is where you come in...\n\n2) Reddit is one of the most cited sources in LLM grounding (when a user asks about a product review or information about a service, 5 or 6 times out of 10, a post from Reddit gets pulled).\n\n3) You increase your brand/business visibility indirectly. Every time you post a response to someone looking for help or guidance (considering you actually provide help), you are demonstrating experience + expertise not only to the person who posted, but to anyone else who reads your comment.\n\n4) Reddit posts and comments will exist on the internet for as long as Reddit lives. So, even if your posts get ignored today, it might go viral tomorrow (or in a few years).\n\nOther marketers on Reddit, what am I missing?",

I always turn them off after a few hundred bucks because they typically drive junk traffic (despite turning off display network and setting location to US only). I am not a Google ads expert and don't have the budget to hire one, so I basically decided to stop trying there.\n\nLinkedIn ads feel far less complicated, and the audience targeting makes logical sense if you've used sales navigator or just spend a lot of time on linkedin.\n\nI'm committing \\~$1.5k to a week long thought leader ad experiment (our biggest issue is that our ideal customer doesn't know we exist).\n\nWill this level of spend move the needle?",

          "text": "Short answer: $1.5k will not “move the needle” in terms of revenue. But it can still be useful if you set the right goal.\n\nA few straight points:\n\n1. This is not a channel problem yet. If Google ads brought junk traffic and LinkedIn feels easier, the real issue is probably messaging and ICP clarity, not the platform. Paid just amplifies what already works.\n2. Thought leader ads = learning, not pipeline. With $1.5k over a week, expect signals, not demos. You are testing awareness and message resonance, not demand. Judge success by comments, profile visits, and DMs, not conversions.\n3. Ads only work after messaging is proven. The best LinkedIn ads come from posts and DMs that already get replies organically. If you have not validated that yet, ads will feel random.\n4. This is where fractional makes sense. You are too early to hire a paid ads specialist, but too far along to guess. A fractional growth setup focuses on ICP, messaging, organic validation, then turns on paid as a multiplier, not a gamble. That is exactly how I work with bootstrapped B2B SaaS teams.\n\nIf you want a quick sanity check, share your ICP and deal size and I can tell you if this test is worth running or better paused.",

Document ads are great on LinkedIn, but you really need to know who your customer is by title and industry. The document also needs to be compelling for the user to want to download. For Google ads, you need to give the system a lot of information, for example, are your conversion pixels setup properly? Are you passing information for offline conversions back to Google? You can get help with setting this up via AI. Claude is a great option and can walk you through it. Google needs to have about 7-14 days to learn, so if you are strapped for cash, try running one campaign at $40/day. Be very tight with your keywords and don't touch the system for at least a couple of days. You can check out the search terms report and block irrelevant searches. Also, try and modify your bids to remove mobile traffic or at least bid very low for it.",

Remember, pipeline is irrelevant if you're really doing it for awareness - which may sound nice but remember in the end someone will be asking where is the revenue right quick so be ready for awareness vs. pipeline chat.\n2. Immediately turn off any Week 1 ads with some decent impression count compared to the rest, but are below 1% CTR\n3. Keep in mind depending on your spend, timing (weekends turned off or on? That's another thread entirely) geo targeting, titles, etc, even your best ads will fatigue within 10 days or so. You'll start to notice because last week's CTR winner is this week's not so much, especially when impressions per unique tap out at 5+. The catch 22 is the best clicked ads get shown more by the algorithm until people see them 3+ more repeated times and they ignore.\n4. You may be able to turn the best ones back on a few weeks later - or of course with a different targeting set - but know they will decay.\n5. Yes as stated before definitely turn OFF audience expansion no matter what pablum messaging is in the interface encouraging you to do so.\n6. I assume this Phillipines thing is sending you targeting emails that you are uploading as Audiences in Linkedin for specific targeting?\n7. The titles field is powerful for segmentation - know your vertical and understand if Managers have budget or does it start with Director and above.\n8. Again, if it's awareness, any broad targeted clicks by whatever title may work but be ready to push back when asked about ROI and \"where is the Pipeline from all this  spend?\" And in the end it always comes down to it so I'd put the awareness spend at no more than 20% effort.\n9. North star is CTR above 3% - and keep in mid it's all about the visuals as you want people to stop scrolling, especially on their phones.\n10. That said, white papers are great for thought leadership and positioning but depending on your vertical, they attract researchers, students, interns, data analysts, who are all great people but likely don't have huge budget or need to buy your full product, or the internal pull to make it happen. Again, awareness vs. ROI. Case studies work.\n11. And the same whitepaper can be positioned differently for those budget-conscious personas to get their attention.\n12. Pro tip: Mention  \"career,\" \"job,\", \"Your team\", \"falling behind\", \"becoming irrelevant,\" \"getting ahead,\" \"stay updated,\" etc because in the end it's a career preservation social platform. Good luck and keep us posted.\n\n(Edited for numbering)",

Google ads can drive traffic and boost your online presence especially if you run ads for branded queries or against competitor brand names. Then it’s up to your site and technics you are using to convert that traffic - depending on your product, business model and sales cycle. That could be trials, gated content, optimised content assets, etc. Now on LinkedIn you can run ads within the platform and if leadgen is your target - use document ads under LinkedIn forms to generate prospects and then work with them to nurture to conversion. 1.5-2k a months for LinkedIn ads is a sufficient budget. With cpl around 3 dollars you can generate a good list of prospects to work with.",

What makes sense is that he will need less validation and more likely to get to the next step faster whether to book a call or to subscribe. \n\nBased on my experience with an AI b2b startup, companies like these needs to deploy itself somewhere and build a strong presence utilizing content and communication with its target audience to get a better chance communicating with the same audience else where …. So choosing LinkedIn could be a better solution at your stage for sure. \n\nBut you won’t be able to get ROI from sales focused ads right now, what you need to focus on is choosing a specific segment of audience (an industry or a specific job title) and start boosting content that delivers your message to them, raise their awareness about your existence and raise the brand recognition. This is called top of the funnel (TOFU) \n\nAfterwards, you can create sales ads for this segment, but when you do you will be sure that you have built your presence and that your target audience are recognizing you, so you get a better chance in communication with them (middle of the funnel), and then you close them through sales efforts. \n\nI hope my comment was helpful, and if you need any further information from me or have any questions feel free to message me directly.",

          "text": "One-pagers are about solving ONE specific problem for ONE specific buyer, not cramming your entire service offering onto a page. Most people screw this up by trying to include everything and end up with tiny font nobody reads.\n\nThe formula that works: problem statement (2 sentences), your solution (3 sentences), proof it works (one stat or case study result), clear next step. That's it. Everything else is fluff. Our clients doing B2B sales see way better conversion when their one-pagers focus on a single use case instead of trying to be a complete company overview.\n\nIf you're struggling to fit everything, you're probably trying to make one one-pager do too much work. Create different versions for different buyer personas or use cases. A CFO cares about cost savings, a VP Ops cares about efficiency, so make separate one-pagers targeting each with relevant messaging and proof points.\n\nReal talk, if your company is bugging you for more one-pagers but can't tell you who they're for or what problem they solve, that's the actual issue. Get clarity on the audience and purpose first, then the content decisions become obvious.",

      "text": "Alright, story time.\n\nPicture this: Jan 2024, me staring at my Meta ads dashboard watching my CPMs go from $45... to $67... to $92... to eventually $180.\n\nMy SaaS was spending about $3k/day profitably. Then boom - overnight my CAC went from $38 to $142. I literally threw up in my mouth a little.\n\n**The \"Oh Shit\" Moment**\n\nI had 6 weeks of runway left\n\nTurned off all ads. Pipeline dropped 89% overnight.\n\nBut then I remembered this random ass comment from a Reddit thread about some guy who scaled to $2M ARR entirely on cold email. Figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nStarted with 3 mailboxes and zero idea what I was doing.\n\n12 weeks later: $107K in closed revenue from cold email alone.\n\nHere's exactly what I did.\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\nI started with 3 domains.\n\nThe math: 3 mailboxes × 33 emails per day = 100 emails/day to start.\n\nNot sexy. Not scalable yet. But it worked\n\nBy week 2, I was at 300 emails/day. Inbox rate? 73%. Not amazing, but not in the spam dungeon either.\n\nThe setup:\n\n* Bought aged domains (6+ months old) from expired domain marketplaces\n* Set up proper DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n* Warmed with Instantly's built-in warmup for 14 days before sending a single cold email\n\n**Week 3-4: The Lead Scraping System That Actually Works**\n\nHere's where I got weird.\n\nEveryone's out here buying Apollo lists and wondering why their emails sound like everyone else's. I said fuck that.\n\nI built custom software (okay fine, I paid a developer on Upwork $800, but I PROJECT MANAGED IT so basically I built it).\n\nThe scraper:\n\n* Pulls company websites from my ICP search\n* Scrapes their actual website copy, tech stack, recent blog posts\n* Hits LinkedIn to grab decision-maker info\n* Feeds it all into a prompt that writes personalized first lines\n\nPeople open emails that feel like you actually visited their website. Wild concept, I know.\n\n**Week 5-8: Scaling to 1,500 Emails/Day Without Losing My Mind**\n\nThis is where it got real.\n\nFrom 300 emails/day to 1,500/day.\n\nThe math: 1,500 emails/day × 21 working days = 31,500 emails per month.\n\nAt a 3% reply rate (industry average is 1%, but personalization is magic), that's 945 replies.\n\nAt a 15% meeting booking rate from replies, that's 141 meetings.\n\nAt a 25% close rate... you see where this is going.\n\nMy CAC went from $142 on Meta to $47 with cold email. And it kept dropping as I optimized.\n\nI shut down Meta ads entirely. Haven't looked back.\n\nNow I run a cold outreach agency helping other B2B companies do the same thing. Turns out when you figure out how to print money, people want to pay you to teach them.\n\n**The Shit No One Tells You**\n\n* Week 1 was fucking BRUTAL. 6% inbox rate because I didn't warm properly\n* I got my first domain blacklisted on day 4\n* Gmail's spam filters updated in week 5 and tanked my inbox rate overnight. Had to pivot my entire sending strategy\n\nAnyone wants my templates/sequences/scraper setup, drop a comment.\n\nI'll put everything together in a Google Doc (might take me a few days, I need to clean up my shamefully disorganized Notion workspace first).\n\nNo courses, no coaching, no bullshit. Just paying it forward because this sub saved my ass multiple times.",

The scoring itself tends to be decent when you feed it enough historical data, but the \"insights\" can be hit or miss.  \n  \nWhat I've found works better is using AI for specific, narrow tasks rather than broad lead scoring. For example, we use it to monitor job changes, funding announcements, and tech stack changes at target accounts. That stuff is factual and easy to verify, so less room for hallucinations.  \n  \nThe call and email analysis features can be useful but you need to spot check them regularly. I'd recommend running any new AI tool in parallel with your current process for at least a month before trusting it fully. Compare the AI recommendations against what your best reps would do manually.  \n  \nThe real danger is when sales teams stop thinking critically because \"the AI said so\". If you do implement it, make sure your reps understand it's a tool to augment their judgement, not replace it.  \n  \nWhich CRMs are you looking at right now?",

Prove messaging before scaling channels Paid, content, and outbound all fail when messaging is fuzzy.\n3. Use outbound as a learning engine, not just a sales engine\n4. Content should support sales, not wait for SEO\n5. Stop running channels in silos The biggest waste I see is teams treating paid, content, outbound, and LinkedIn as separate things. What works is one clear message, reused everywhere:\n\n* Outbound tests it\n* LinkedIn amplifies it\n* Paid scales it\n* Content supports it\n\nThat is how you move faster with fewer resources.\n\nThis is also why many teams at this stage move to a fractional model instead of hiring specialists or agencies.

However, my goal is to be successful internationally, as I believe this could be a valuable solution for many organizations. That said, I have read (including in this subreddit) that LinkedIn is increasingly filled with bots, bots that create posts and other bots that comment on them...\n\nGiven this, does it even make sense in 2026 to try to build reach on the platform?\n\nAdditionally, in my situation, what would work better: posting from my personal profile (around 80 followers) or building reach from a brand-new company profile?\n\nThank you in advance for any responses.",

Unfortunately, it's not like that. \n\nMore and more on LInkedin, you've got groups of cliques slapping each others backs and soothing each others egos hanging by the virtual watercooler. For the most part, their main goal seems to be building awareness of their own products and services. And it, just like networking in real-life, it's the same heads all the time. This wears very thin after a while. \n\nThe actual \"do-ers\" on the other don't seem to be continually LinkedIn. They're probably too busy doing the actual work. And, for your IP / data protection tool, these are the people you need to target.\n\nSo, maybe the best route for you here could be using webinars, inbound content or events targeting personas such as CISO / Systems Administrators / IT Managers / Compliance Managers, MSSPs and in-house Data Protection officers.  A cold-outreach strategy should also be considered but bear in mind that cohorts like system administrators and IT manager can be very averse, even hostile, to cold outreach so you might want to keep this strategy limited to other personas mentioned above.",

As another poster mentioned, a bit of automation can help. I'm not advocating mass comms, or AI written posts, but sensible use of automation can safely amplify your reach and scale.

I know enough about lead gen to fake it in a pitch but we can't really activate well against it.\n\nOur primary model with bigger clients is to work with partner agencies in order to leverage scale when possible.  We have a proven partner for the brand space.  We need one for demand/lead gen.  Right now we are relying on a (somewhat flakey) freelancer to run our Google Ads accounts.

Definitely need to see some solid DG/LG case studies in addition to standard creds. We've lost pitches because we don't have this capability.\n\nFor case studies, I'm not sure exactly what we're looking for but maybe something that talks about lead quality (% that converted to SALs for example) or direct ties to closed /won $$$.\n\nI've been challenged by our CEO to come up with a short list of agencies to RFP.

          "text": "The white-label demand gen partner search is tricky because the agencies good enough to produce SAL conversion data and closed-won attribution usually have their own client roster and aren't hungry for white-label arrangements. The ones actively seeking white-label work are often the B-tier players who couldn't build their own book.\n\nThe exception is smaller shops or senior freelancers who prefer the referral model over business development. They exist but they're not advertising \"white label demand gen\" because their pipeline comes from relationships exactly like what you're describing.\n\nThe case study red flags to watch for: agencies showing MQL volume without downstream metrics are hiding poor lead quality. Anyone who can't speak to sales feedback loops or lead-to-opportunity conversion probably isn't measuring what matters. Our clients evaluating demand gen partners usually find that the willingness to discuss what didn't work is more telling than polished success stories.\n\nThe RFP criteria worth emphasizing: ask specifically about their process for feedback loops with sales teams, how they define and measure lead quality beyond form fills, and what their approach is when a campaign produces volume but sales says the leads are garbage. The good partners have answers because they've navigated this tension before.\n\nThe sourcing approach since Google is useless: LinkedIn posts from demand gen practitioners you respect, asking peers at non-competing agencies who they've partnered with, and honestly the HubSpot and 6sense partner directories sometimes surface capable smaller shops.\n\nThe freelancer versus agency question: a senior freelancer with 10+ years of B2B demand gen experience might outperform a mid-tier agency and be more flexible on white-label terms.",

The ones doing their own demand gen well are usually better at doing it for others.  \n  \nFor vetting, ask to speak directly with the people who'd actually work on your accounts, not just the sales team. We learned this the hard way after partnering with an agency where the pitch team vanished after signing.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if they have experience with your typical deal sizes and sales cycles. An agency crushing it for SaaS with $5k ACV might struggle with enterprise deals that take 18 months to close.  \n  \nOne thing that worked for us was starting with a small paid test project before committing to a full partnership. Something like running one campaign for 60 days. Tells you loads about their communication style and whether they'll actually hit deadlines.  \n  \nWhat's your typical client deal size and sales cycle length?",

I wasn't even really connecting with anyone.\n\nI was just… posting. Broadcasting my thoughts into the void. Hoping the algorithm would show it to someone who cared. Watching the like count. Refreshing. Checking again. Like throwing messages in bottles and never knowing if anyone found them.\n\nAnd honestly? It felt exhausting.\n\nSo I flipped it. Instead of talking, I started listening.\n\nI stopped posting every day and started tracking what my audience was actually talking about. Not on my posts. On theirs. In comment threads. In replies. The stuff they were complaining about, asking about, struggling with.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Finding posts where my ICP was already discussing their problems\n* Engaging in those conversations instead of creating new ones\n* Actually reading what people needed instead of guessing\n* Accepting that silence is okay if you have nothing useful to add\n\nIt's been surprisingly different. Less anxiety about \"does this post perform.\" More real conversations with people who actually need help. More trust built through showing up, not broadcasting.\n\nIf this resonates, maybe try this: spend one day not posting anything. Just find three posts where your audience is talking about something you know. Comment something genuinely helpful. See what happens.\n\nWould love to hear from others here. Does LinkedIn still feel like a place you \"network\" or has it quietly become a place where everyone's just talking at each other?",

I was considering advertising on LinkedIn (a small initial investment to see if there is potential) as a way to see if there's a justification for continuing with the time it takes to post, etc.\nI'm not convinced that people/ businesses go on LinkedIn looking for solutions or to grow their network. Many times it feels like a lot of people get on just so they can do the obligatory post and comment, and if that's the case it feels like B2B content can easily get lost at sea.",

Our clients in consulting see the best results when they lead outreach with specific client wins like \"helped X company reduce costs by 40%\" versus talking about their methodology. Nobody cares about your process until they trust you can deliver results. Also founder-led sales matters way more for services because buyers want to meet the actual people doing the work, not just a sales rep.\n\nWhat works best is targeted cold outreach to companies showing signals they need your help, content that demonstrates deep expertise in your niche, and partnership referrals with complementary firms. LinkedIn presence helps but it's slow. Cold email to decision-makers with personalized insights about their business converts way better when done properly. The key is positioning as an expert who understands their specific challenges, not a vendor selling generic consulting hours.",

For acquisition, lean harder on influencers/affiliates, creator partnerships, and educational content distribution, because it stays compliant longer than “buy now” ads. Also make sure basics are airtight: age gating, geo compliance, shipping rules by state, and clear policies because that trust layer matters more in regulated categories.",

Our clients doing real volume see similar numbers and still generate solid pipeline because they're sending to qualified lists, not random blasts.\n\n\"Show up where your audience talks\" means actually participating in communities without pitching. Like if you sell to e-commerce brands, join their Facebook groups, answer questions on Reddit, comment on relevant LinkedIn posts. Build credibility first, then people DM you asking what you do. It's slower but the leads are way warmer than cold outreach.\n\nFor finding people ready to buy, track intent signals. Companies hiring for roles your product supports, recent funding announcements, tech stack changes, competitor review sites showing frustration. These indicate actual pain happening now versus \"might need this someday.\" Use Sales Navigator job alerts or set up Google alerts for your target keywords plus funding/hiring news.\n\nYour workflow should be multi-touch. Email, LinkedIn connection, engage with their posts, email again in 5 days, call if you have their number. One touchpoint doesn't cut it anymore. Most deals take 7 to 12 touches before someone even responds, let alone buys. If you're giving up after one email, that's your problem right there.",

What is dying is trying to sell before there’s any context or trust.\nFor us, it’s worked much better when people already “know” us before sales ever shows up. That usually happens through organic content, community participation, or just being visible in the right places. By the time someone reaches out or replies, the conversation doesn’t feel cold anymore.\nIn-person events have also been surprisingly effective again, but not big flashy ones. Smaller meetups, dinners, or industry events where you can actually talk. They don’t always turn into leads right away, but they speed up trust a lot.\nI don’t see it as events vs digital. Digital still matters, but impressions alone don’t do much. What helps is repeated exposure to how you think, not what you sell.\nSales works best when it comes later, once interest already exists. Cold messages with no context still get ignored. Messages that land after someone’s seen your content or met you once feel completely different.",

They think your marketing is great. But sometimes the pain is not acute enough for them to act. They don't want to be \"that person\" who buys \"that solution\" that is never used or is a flop or results in reputations getting burned. That's normal. In B2B context, most people who buy are trying to protect their own reputations. Half the battle is getting a second person within the target organisation onboard. \n\nThis is why B2B selling becomes easier when you know how to leverage that social dynamic withing organisations to your advantage. Because once you get more than one person involved in the buying process, the personal \"reputational\" risk for the buyer is now hedged. Listening in on sales calls is great way to find out how people more experienced than you turn prospect into a \"champion\" or find a champion for your product within the organisation. Check out a book called The Challenger Customer - it helps explain this dynamic in a bit more detail.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m seeing a lot of fintech SaaS teams stuck in the same loop right now:\n\n* 6–12 month sales cycles\n* compliance/legal as a hard gate\n* buyers ghosting anything that feels generic\n* “We need more leads” when the real issue is quality, trust and timing\n\nI’ve been working in B2B fintech SaaS (payments APIs, fraud/risk, lending, compliance automation), and a few patterns are consistently working in 2026 without needing insane ad budgets.\n\n**1) Hyper-narrow ICP and positioning**\n\n“Secure fintech platform” is invisible now.\n\nThe teams winning are painfully specific, like:\n\n>“Real-time fraud APIs for mid-market fintechs processing 50k and tx/day who need lower false positives without killing approval rates.”\n\nThat level of clarity makes ABM, content, outbound, and even demo flows way easier to execute.\n\nQuick test: can your ICP fit on one line with a disqualifier?\n\n**2) Intent signals > volume**\n\nA lot of teams still run outbound like it’s 2021: big lists, sequences and hope.\n\nWhat’s working better is signal-based targeting, even if the list is smaller:\n\n* compliance hiring spikes\n* vendor migration chatter\n* sudden increase in security/legal content consumption\n* product pages visited after pricing pages (big one)\n\nIt’s less “spray and pray” and more “show up when the pain is awake.”\n\n**3) Thought leadership that’s about risk and ROI** \n\nFintech buyers don’t want “innovation.” They want:\n\n* “Will this break us?”\n* “Will regulators hate this?”\n* “Will this reduce chargebacks/fraud losses without nuking approvals?”\n\nContent that performs best tends to be:\n\n* risk frameworks (“how this fails”)\n* ROI math with assumptions\n* implementation timelines (what actually takes 2 weeks vs 3 months)\n* AI governance / explainability (especially for fraud and lending)\n\nThe trust-building content isn’t flashy it’s specific and defensible.\n\n**4) Partnerships are still the fastest path to warm pipeline**\n\nEmbedded finance is noisy, but partnership motion is very real when done right.\n\nThe best fit I keep seeing:\n\nFintech SaaS and vertical SaaS / platforms with distribution\n\n(ERP, procurement, commerce tools, industry-specific software)\n\nEven a lightweight co-marketing and integration narrative can create higher-intent conversations than cold outbound.\n\n**5) Interactive beats long PDFs**\n\nMost decision makers won’t read a 50-slide deck.\n\nThings that get better engagement:\n\n* short, personalized demo videos (3–5 mins)\n* self-serve “what would this save me?” simulators\n* implementation checklists (security and compliance friendly)\n\nYou don’t need to be fancy just reduce the effort to understand the value.\n\n**6) First-party data is the real advantage now**\n\nWith privacy and cookie loss, the compounding strategy is:\n\n* SEO that targets “switching” queries (migration, alternatives, comparisons)\n* gated tools (checklists, calculators, templates)\n* newsletters that attract the right buyer persona\n* lifecycle content that supports expansion (bowtie)\n\nThe teams that win are building a feedback loop, not a one-time funnel.\n\n**7) Bowtie mindset: marketing owns expansion too**\n\nIn fintech SaaS, expansion is where the unit economics get clean.\n\nMarketing can support this by building:\n\n* onboarding education (reduce time-to-value)\n* usage-based upsell triggers (feature adoption campaigns)\n* proof libraries for security/compliance objections\n* customer stories that show “what changed after implementation”\n\n# Curious what others are seeing\n\n**What’s killing fintech SaaS lead gen for you right now?**\n\nLong cycles? Trust barriers? Procurement/compliance drag? Crowded category?\n\nAnd are you leaning more into:\n\n* partnerships and distribution\n* intent and signal-based outbound\n* trust-first content (risk/ROI/implementation)\n\nWould love to hear what’s working in your niche.",

Most teams are late *and* generic, which is a brutal combo.\n\nThe intent-signal point is huge. Volume-based outbound feels completely dead unless there’s a real reason for you to exist in someone’s inbox that week. Showing up when pain is *forming*, not after it’s been blasted by five vendors, changes the entire dynamic.\n\nI’d add one thing that seems under-discussed: **speed + freshness as a trust signal**. When buyers realize you’re reacting to *current* conditions instead of running recycled plays, it immediately lowers skepticism. Even strong content gets ignored if it feels like it was written “for everyone.”\n\nAlso agree on interactive > static. Anything that answers “what will this realistically look like for *me*?” beats polished thought leadership right now.\n\nCurious if others are seeing the same drop-off once something feels even slightly templated. It feels like relevance windows are getting shorter every quarter.",

It was turning LinkedIn into a boring daily system instead of a place I randomly post and pray.\n\nHere’s the loop I run now that consistently books B2B calls:\n\n\\-   Start with a hand built prospect list (not the feed) 50–150 ICP accounts + people in each.\n\n\\-  Create a “mini feed” just for those people. Each day I only look at posts from that list.\n\n\\-   Warm them with 5–10 real comments per day.\n\n\\-   Send connection requests only once they’re warm.\n\n\\-   First DM = context + one easy question.\n\n\\-   Treat follow ups like a pipeline, not an afterthought.\n\nWhat was a waste of time: Mass cold DMs, InMails without prior interaction, Posting more content hoping “leads will come”.\n\nThe system above still takes \\~30–45 minutes a day, but it made results predictable. To keep a targeted feed of prospects and run this system, I use Depost AI. It helps me build targeted feeds, draft comments and DMs and tracks follow ups so I don't miss anyone.",

Are you running it parallel to shorter-cycle tactics, or have you found ways to show leading indicators earlier (engagement quality, sales using content in cycles, etc.)?\n\nThe compounding value is real, but the \"trust us, this will pay off in 2027\" pitch is brutal when you need results in Q2.",

I couldn't quite find an existing space or community that mapped well to my client's business, but that doesn't mean there would be one (or several) for yours!\n\nHowever, Redditors are quick to downvote thinly-veiled promotion, so sharing highly relevant, genuinely useful, educational content is the way to go to build up karma and credibililty.  \n\n  \nI'd be really interested to know thoughts on whether to use a real name or pseudonym for this kind of work though. Some thought leaders post under their names and I've been told it's always important to disclose any affiliation with a company for complete transparency, but the majority of Reddit users are fairly anonymous.",

In the beginning, I mistakenly believed in subreddits + content themes. That failed.\n\nThe solution we developed was to treat each subreddit like a small industry room – lurking for a couple weeks, noticing the same questions repeating, then replying with one concrete experience (what we tried, what broke, what we learned). No hyperlinks or calls to action.\n\nAs you set out to growth-hack your startup, here is a simple takeaway: don’t test Reddit as a distribution channel. Give it a test as your listening channel. \n\nAfter reading a week’s worth of posts, if you can’t see recurring pain points, it’s probably not worth B2B anyway.",
