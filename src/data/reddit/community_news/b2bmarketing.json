      "text": "I came across this breakdown and it completely flipped how I thought about YouTube. Figured it might be valuable for you as well.\n\nMost founders assume YouTube only works if you go big. Massive subscriber counts, viral videos, influencer-level reach. But this case study proves that's wrong, well at least for B2B.\n\nThere's a small company in immigration + tax optimization. Nothing sexy. Their average client pays around $2,000 though. Their YouTube channel has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 subscribers. And from that channel alone, they've booked 500+ sales calls. That's easily seven figures in revenue from what most people would call a \"dead\" channel.\n\nBut it gets crazier… They get only around 350 to 400 views per day. About 30 videos total. But they close roughly half their calls. They even spun up a second channel in another language with under 30 subscribers, and it already brought in multiple paying clients.\n\nThis is why B2B YouTube is a completely different game.\n\nSubscriber count is a vanity metric. What actually matters:\n\n* Who's watching: are they decision-makers or random browsers?\n* Why they're watching: are they actively looking for a solution?\n* How much one customer is worth: if a client pays $2k, $10k, or more, you don't need scale\n\nThe videos that drive revenue on this channel aren't flashy. They're boring, high-intent, search-driven stuff: \"how to get residency in X,\" \"best tax residency for digital nomads,\" country comparisons etc. These aren't entertainment videos. They're decision-stage videos, which means the viewer is already problem-aware and actively searching for a solution. That's why they convert.\n\nIf you're selling something where one customer is worth a few thousand dollars or more, obsessing over subscriber count makes no sense. A small channel with the right topics can outperform a larger audience watching for entertainment. The leverage comes from intent, not scale.\n\nI’d love to hear form other founders to see if you’ve had similar results? Have any of you tried YouTube as an acquisition channel? What results did you see?",

For B2B channels, content strategy plays the biggest role in conversions (or at least in driving people further down your funnel). \n\nThe behind the scenes is to humanize the channel and get people to know you and your process a little more.

When someone posts about their pain point or mentions a competitor, I engage there first. Warm intro before any DM or email.\n\nResults after 90 days:\n\n* Reply rate: 12% (vs 0.7% with cold email)\n* Meetings booked: 34 (vs 8-12/month with email)\n* Time spent on infrastructure: basically zero\n\nStack I'm using:\n\n* OutX to track keywords + competitors on LinkedIn automatically\n* Sales Navigator for additional research\n* Clay for data enrichment and list building\n* Apollo for contact verification and backup outreach\n* Instantly for the few cold emails I still send (way less volume now)\n* Notion to track conversations and buying signals\n* ChatGPT to help personalize responses at scale\n\nThe tradeoff: this doesn't scale to 1000+ touches/day like cold email.

I have many clients whose trust has been eroded by scammy marketing agency and I tell them, why did you let this happen? Their answer is always the same. They were oblivious. So, here are a few of my tips that everyone should use if they think their marketing agency is not doing their job.\n\n1. The \"Platform Trap\"Google and Meta are designed to make you spend. Their \"Auto-Apply\" recommendations are often biased toward their revenue, not your ROI. A great agency acts as a filter, knowing when to lean into the machine and when to take back the wheel\n\n.2. Creative is the New Targeting-As privacy laws and \"cookie-less\" tracking have leveled the playing field, your creative is what does the heavy lifting. If your agency isn't using data-backed storytelling, they’re just guessing.\n\n3. The Shift to \"Agentic\" Execution-The best agencies have stopped doing manual, repetitive \"button-clicking.\" They are now leveraging autonomous AI tools to handle the grunt work. By integrating stacks like Blobr AI or Ryze AI, agencies can run 24/7 audits and creative swaps that a human simply can’t keep up with.\n\nNext time, ask the important questions. It pains me to see us marketing agencies get a horrible reputation just because of a few sour apples.",

I would also suggest to communicate results and data via email and use meetings for strategy and in the early stages 4un through lists and basic stuff.\n\nAlso get everyone from the agency who you are working with involved. Often companies deal directly with a project manager but equally important to get feedback from the staff who manage your campaign on a day to day basis. \n\nSet realistic goals from both sides. Often companies want x amount of closes in 3 months but their sales cycle takes 4 months. Then they get frustrated, say it doesn't work and try another agency or strategy with the same result. \n\nAsk agencies for help. If they request something to be completed that impacts their sales but not getting done, ask the agency to do it or take the lead. If it's not a huge project and effects the results they will often just get it done. Otherwise the same conversation takes place every week and becomes a negative point.",

          "text": "I totally get the frustration, and you are absolutely right. It’s kind of difficult to trust one agency to handle your branding efforts and another agency to handle your demand gen or lead gen efforts. These three elements should flow naturally, and not having one agency manage the entire thing is the best way to make sure the experience is broken, not to mention that you’re probably going to pay more than you should.\n\nThat being said, why this happens actually makes sense. There are a couple of reasons. First, it’s not the same skill set. Some of the agencies you’re describing are very creative. They hire the right talent to make your brand stand out, create a message that resonates, define your identity, and distribute it so this identity is visible to everyone.\n\nThe other type of agency you’re describing hires teams laser-focused on optimizing and generating business.\nAnother element is that most agencies really want clarity on your goals. When your goal is “do everything,” agencies often anticipate trouble. You might end up saying, “Yes, but I expected more leads,” and they are forced to shift focus from awareness to lead gen. Or you might say, “My brand isn’t as visible as I wanted,” and they pivot back to awareness, reducing leads. Basically, agencies are used to clients being unclear about what they want, and trying to do too much in one shot ends up causing constant changes in direction until things break, or worse, until the agency gets fired.\nThat may explain what you’re seeing. That being said, I’m totally with you. I’m a huge believer that campaigns should be properly integrated: start with awareness and go all the way down to lead gen.\n\nMy recommendation would be to first work with an agency to define your brand: what it should look like, what you stand for, and what your values are. Once that’s clear, work with a dimensional agency to build truly integrated campaigns that cover the entire customer journey, properly integrating all channels, not just making branding consistent, but ensuring the right message reaches the right audience with a perfect flow, so no customer is mishandled.\n\nOnce you have this in place, you can have the same agency manage distribution for your brand awareness elements. This part is actually easy. Be explicit with them: the goal of this brand awareness campaign is purely impressions and visibility for the right audience. You’re not trying to generate leads from this campaign; other campaigns will handle lead gen.\n\nIf you have the resources, it’s even better to do this in-house. If you lack experience, there are plenty of frameworks available. If you type “integrated campaign framework” into Google, you’ll find many that are easy to use. My favorite one is the RIO framework, but there are many others.\n\nIf you rely on an agency, make sure they integrate everything properly and don’t go rogue: building a patchwork of random activities that may generate some short-term leads but will be a disaster to manage in the long run.",

It’s that most of them were built with one core DNA, and that bias shows up in how they operate.\n\nBrand-led agencies tend to come from creative or comms backgrounds, so they think in terms of storytelling, positioning, and visibility. Demand-led agencies usually come from performance marketing or RevOps, so everything gets reduced to leads, CPL, and pipeline math.\n\nBoth are optimizing for what they know how to measure.\n\nThe problem is structural. Brand teams get judged on perception. Demand teams get judged on revenue. So agencies mirror that split and pick a lane.\n\nBut for a $20M ARR SaaS company, those two can’t really be separated anymore.\n\nBrand creates trust and familiarity, which lowers CAC and improves conversion.  \nDemand captures that trust and turns it into pipeline.\n\nIf you only run brand, you look great but struggle to prove ROI.  \nIf you only run demand, you burn budget chasing cold buyers forever.\n\nThe companies that scale well usually treat brand as demand infrastructure, not a separate function. Things like category POV, strong messaging, customer proof, and thought leadership directly improve ad performance, outbound response rates, and sales conversations.\n\nSo it’s less “brand vs demand” and more “brand feeding demand.”\n\nYou’re not looking in the wrong places. It’s just that many agencies are specialized silos. You probably want a team that thinks in terms of full-funnel or revenue marketing rather than either creative or performance alone.",

If you only focus on the capture side, you are fighting a losing battle against the 77 percent of buyers who have already formed a preference before they even start an active search. Find an agency that understands and appreciated both!",

The client says they want to move forward. And then… nothing. No PO. No urgency. No decision. Even though they came to us with the problem and clearly need what we offer.\n\nIt feels like deals stall not because of objections, but because the buyer just isn’t prioritizing the decision. I’ve tried following up, checking timelines, and even hinting at things like pricing changes or limited availability, but I don’t want to rely on fake urgency or pressure tactics that damage trust.\n\nOne recent example really sums it up. Client wanted to move ahead during the summer. Quote delivered. Follow-ups done. They started debating sourcing some equipment themselves to lower cost, then went quiet. When we finally met again, the answer was that the budget for this year was gone and the project got pushed to next year. No hard “no,” just drift.\n\nI’m realizing I’m not losing these deals to competitors. I’m losing them to indecision and lack of momentum.\n\nI’m starting to think the issue isn’t the pitch or the pricing, but how I’m guiding the buyer once they say yes in principle. I’ve seen some teams use tools like Trumpet to keep everything in one place. Quote, scope, timelines, next steps, and decision checkpoints all visible so the buyer doesn’t mentally reset after every conversation.\n\nFor those of you in higher-end B2B sales, how do you handle this stage?  \n How do you create real urgency without pressure?  \n How do you help buyers actually commit when they agree but don’t act?\n\nAny practical tactics, frameworks, or lessons learned would be hugely appreciated.\n\n",

      "text": "Look, I need to vent about something that nearly killed our outbound program last year. Everyone in B2B keeps saying it's a numbers game and just scale your lists. I bought into that completely and it almost got our entire domain infrastructure blacklisted.\n\nWe were working with the usual suspects for data. Apollo, ZoomInfo, the works. Paying premium rates for those verified badges next to every contact. Our dashboards looked immaculate. Bounce rates under 2%, deliverability scores in the high 90s, everything tracking green. We scaled up to about 18,000 to 20,000 touchpoints monthly across our sequences. I was genuinely expecting our pipeline to finally match the effort we were putting in.\n\nInstead we flatlined at a 0.4% reply rate. And most of those replies were variants of unsubscribe or how did you get my info. Our AE team was getting maybe two qualified conversations per week from thousands of sends. I spent entire evenings convinced it was a messaging problem. Rewrote subject lines, tested different value props, even brought in a contractor to rebuild our sequences from scratch. Nothing moved.\n\nThe wake up call came when I started manually checking who was actually opening our emails. Turns out a huge chunk of our verified contacts were people who'd left their companies four to six months ago, or whose email accounts were just auto forwarding to a black hole. The mailboxes existed so they passed the basic validation checks, but there was no human on the other end. We were burning sender reputation on what were essentially abandoned accounts.\n\nI finally admitted we needed to stop throwing volume at the problem and completely rethink our data hygiene approach. The issue wasn't our copy or our offer. It was that we were optimizing for the wrong metric. Deliverability doesn't mean anything if the recipient hasn't logged in since Q2 of last year.\n\nSo we shifted the entire workflow. Instead of just verifying that an email exists we started screening for actual activity signals. Things like mobile number status, recent job changes, social engagement patterns. We moved to a batch filtering process using TNTwuyou before any contacts even touched our CRM. The goal was to prioritize signal over scale.\n\nA few things became obvious pretty fast. First, phone number validation turned out to be a surprisingly strong proxy for active engagement. If someone's mobile line is dead or disconnected their email's probably not much better. Second, recency matters more than anything else. A contact that was valid three months ago is often worthless today in fast moving industries. Third, this approach adds friction to your workflow and your team will push back on smaller lists. You have to be willing to defend lower volume if it means higher quality.\n\nOnce we started filtering out the noise our effective reply rates climbed back up to the 5% to 7% range. We're running at maybe 20% of our previous monthly volume but our AEs are actually having real conversations again instead of just logging rejection after rejection. Using the TNTwuyou Data Filtering and Validation Tool as a pre outreach gate basically saved us from getting our domains torched.\n\nThat said, this level of filtering probably isn't worth the operational overhead if you're selling low ticket transactional stuff where volume really is the only lever. It makes sense for us because we're in high ticket enterprise sales where every bad touch costs us credibility we can't afford to lose.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has completely abandoned the big database model lately. Or are we just in a particularly stale vertical where contact decay happens faster than usual.",

Even \"validated\" emails from scrapers can have 20-30% bounce rates, which tanks your sender reputation.  \n  \nSecond, I found way better response rates when I combined scraped data with a warmer approach. Instead of cold emailing straight away, I'd check if they had a LinkedIn presence or recent Google review I could reference.

Heavy focus on product marketing ads (how your company is different from competitors and the core capabilities you help with). Content that answers top questions your ICP has.\n\nRegarding the founder's content, you've already mentioned most of the angles that perform well but if I had to choose the top performers based on our results I would recommend these three:\n\n\\- Personal stories & hard-earned lessons: These work because people trust a human sharing a real mistake or success story much more than a corporate brand.\n\n\\- Industry commentary & insights: Sharing a unique opinion on a trend always works great for authority. It shows you're an expert who actually knows the \"real game\" behind the scenes.\n\n\\- Step-by-steps & how-tos: These are good for proving you know your stuff, but they don't get the same emotional engagement as a personal story.

YouTube takes ages to build momentum and the ROI is tough to track early on.  \n  \nReddit worked surprisingly well for us because you can answer real questions in communities like this one, r/sales, r/startups. The key is being genuinely helpful without pitching. I spent 30 mins a day for 3 months just sharing what actually worked in outreach, and it brought in about 8-10 qualified leads that turned into customers.  \n  \nYouTube is great long term but needs serious commitment. You're looking at 6-12 months before meaningful traction unless you're already comfortable on camera and have a content system sorted.  \n  \nAnother thing to consider is partnering with complementary agencies (like email deliverability consultants or data providers). We got a decent chunk of referrals that way because you're reaching people who already need what you offer.  \n  \nWhat's your average deal size? That'll probably determine whether YouTube's effort is worth it vs more direct channels.",

No self promotion at all, so make sure you talk about your services the exact same way across platforms.

It’s like comparing apples with pears. I would even go one step further and say that not all channels are revenue-generating channels from a tracking perspective. Some channels will always look more expensive because their influence is harder to track than others.\nHowever, to me, this is not even how the discussion should be framed.\nThe discussion should not be about comparing channels in front of a CFO or a CEO. If you are in charge of marketing, you should define the plan and be judged on the total outcome. The CFO has no business being involved in how each individual channel is performing, especially when they don’t have the context of what is expected from a specific channel.\nLooking at each channel purely in terms of direct impact on revenue is insanely short-sighted, and that’s typically what a CFO with no knowledge of marketing would do.\nWhat I’m saying is that the discussion should be happening on a completely different turf. The discussion should be about how your campaign as a whole, including channel A, channel B, and channel C, has spent X dollars of budget for Y dollars of revenue, with whatever ROI is attached to it.\nThen, as a marketer, with the full context, your expertise, and the metrics you are tracking, you should be the one deciding where to invest more money.\nIf your CEO and CFO are making those calls on your behalf, you’re not a CMO. You’re a marketing executive who has been hired to execute a strategy you’re not even deciding yourself.\nTo me, you have to take one step back, think in terms of integrated campaigns, and look at campaign ROI, not channel ROI, at least not in discussions with your executive team.",

We already do a ton of corporate orders, orders for brands and so on within India through B2B platforms like Indiamart, Justdial and we also run some Google Ads within India to get leads. We have a good technical sales team who convert these leads to orders.\n\nAt the moment, our order size typically averages in the hundreds to a few thousand units. However, we have to confirm and execute about 10 to 15 orders each month just to cover our monthly overheads.\n\nI want to start targeting bigger customers like clothing brands from Europe, Australia, etc. to grow the order volume significantly.\n\nI'm sure the decision makers of these brands aren't actively searching for manufacturers in Google so Google Ads and SEO might not be the right channel for us.\n\nI've read quite a lot on how cold emails work starting from data gathering and enrichment through Clay or other data sources followed by sending using platforms like Instantly. I can personally try it out myself and learn and improve and go ahead but I'm not too keen on that. I would rather prefer paying an agency who know what they are doing.\n\nWill cold emails work for our scenario?  \nWhat are the things I should look for when hiring an agency to handle cold emails for our business?\n\nIf not, should I look at LinkedIn marketing or other channels?   \n  \nI know I have everything in my business primed for success, and proper marketing seems to be the last missing piece of the puzzle that I really want to crack.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the past year building a B2B SaaS platform (AI-enabled scripting tool) but I’m facing the classic mistake: I built first, validated later (not entirely true, I did a bunch of early validation interviews and have kept that up recently). Now I’m stuck with what feels like three different products under one roof, and I need help finding the right positioning and acquisition channel.\n\n**What the platform does:** It’s a scripting tool that lets users create mini-apps with simple code. These apps guide users through multi-step AI workflows (think: structured SOPs, not automation/agents). The LLM follows your script, asks questions, processes inputs, and returns results at each step. Think custom GPTs on steriods.\n\n**The three “products” I could sell:**\n\n1. **DIY Platform** \\- Advanced users script their own workflow apps (small audience, high expertise required)\n2. **Done-for-you Service** \\- I interview clients about their SOPs and build custom apps for them (consultative, doesn’t scale well, but could be good in the beginning)\n3. **Ready-made Apps** \\- I build and distribute vertical-specific apps (e.g., “SoMe Commenter” for LinkedIn/Reddit engagement, “Long Text Editor” for working around LLM output limits), \"Content Repurposing\" app etc etc.\n\n**What I’ve tried so far:**\n\n* Marketed as a content creation tool to LinkedIn thought leaders (limited traction at the time)\n* Pitched custom workflow solutions to in-house content teams and agencies (slow sales cycle, and hard to get a foot in among the solutions they already use)\n* Positioned it as a dev tool with open-source apps on GitHub (minimal uptake)\n* Currently experimenting with marketing individual apps (SoMe Commenter, Long Text Editor) *without* mentioning the platform\n\n**Where I’m at:** Right now, I need to find my first paying customers to validate an ICP that’s actually willing to pay for this to get a beach head to operate from. I have hundreds of users registered but haven’t cracked the retention or monetization piece yet.\n\n**Channels I’m considering:**\n\n* Cold email campaigns to targeted ICPs\n* Google Ads (Search/Display)\n* Social media ads (LinkedIn/Facebook)\n* Organic social media content marketing (doing)\n* Direct LinkedIn outreach to book demos with ideal customers (doing)\n* Community engagement (Reddit, niche forums, etc.) (doing)\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Which of these three product approaches would you double down on to get initial traction and paying customers?\n2. Which acquisition channels would you prioritize given my situation? (Limited budget, B2B focus, workflow/productivity tool, need to validate willingness to pay)\n3. Should I continue decoupling the apps from the platform, or is there a way to leverage the platform story?\n4. For those who’ve tested these channels for similar products in super early days, what worked fastest for getting your first 5-10 paying customers?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s navigated similar positioning challenges!  \n",

I tried most common B2B channels (ads, LinkedIn, content, communities), but with a limited budget they were slow and noisy. What finally worked was focusing on cold email as the core channel and using everything else as support.\n\nMy current flow is pretty simple: identify a very narrow ICP → look for real buying signals → enrich and verify leads → run short, relevant cold email sequences → follow up consistently → only then bring in LinkedIn or calls if there’s engagement. That gave me faster feedback on who’s actually willing to pay.\n\nCold email to very specific roles with a clear problem beats ads early on. Once patterns emerge, you can package that into ready-made apps later.\n\nThis setup works for me because it’s credit-based, budget-friendly, and cuts a lot of manual work.   \n  \nCurious which ICP has shown any buying signal so far, even weak ones?",

Follower milestones. Exit records. Millionaires are old news - 2026 is the year of billionaires!  \n  \nIn the headlines, not in real market reality.  \n  \nWhat’s usually missing are the things that actually matter for YOUR business: honest insights, concrete systems, actionable learnings, real context, and a connection to the current (!) global market.  \n  \nThink about it:  \n  \n⭐ The opinion of an heir who never had to learn how to reach real customers in a tough market.  \n  \n⭐ The foodie influencer with a mega exit - when you’re selling bikes.  \n  \n⭐ Or a decade-old e-commerce success story - while you’re building B2B software and showing clients that “Vibe Coder” probably won’t meet their security standards.  \n  \nSuccess is context-dependent. And people-dependent.  \n  \nYet on LinkedIn, we often give the loudest voices or the biggest budgets the most attention. The “gurus\" with an opinion on everything.  \n  \nFact: only \\~1% of users post regularly. Most just watch silently. And many “top creators” aren’t even writing their own posts, they outsource them to staff or AI.  \n  \nThat’s fine. But if comments go unanswered, DMs disappear, and no real interest in collaboration is visible, then for me, that account is simply:  \n  \nirrelevant.  \n  \nLike reality TV, but in business casual.  \n  \nYour business doesn’t need tons of impressions. It needs real connections. The people who view your profile, respond to your posts, and could become valuable contacts or clients.  \n  \nAsk yourself:  \n  \n❤️ Who is YOUR business role model?  \n  \n❤️ Which parts of their story actually align with YOUR vision?  \n  \n❤️ Have they ever done anything concrete for YOUR business? A like, a comment, honest feedback?  \n  \nOr are you chasing reach, stressing over LinkedIn hacks, and missing the people who could truly push your business forward - or even become clients?  \n  \nMaybe we need fewer glossy hero stories and more honest context, real experience, and conversations that go deeper than what we get here.  \n  \nReal interaction beats parasocial connections with empty accounts.  \n  \nA simple growth hack for real business growth?",

      "text": "Here's what most B2B marketing playbooks get wrong: they're built for a world that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nEveryone's focused on RevOps frameworks, ABM strategies, and AI-powered personalization dashboards. Good luck explaining that to your board when your email list doesn't convert and your LinkedIn ads are bleeding cash.\n\nThe companies actually winning in 2026 aren't doing anything fancy. They're doing three unglamorous things well.\n\n**First: Sales and marketing aren't rivals anymore.** I mean actually, not just a monthly alignment call where everyone pretends to care. If marketing is measured on lead volume and sales is measured on deals closed, you've already lost. You need one shared metric: revenue. That's it. When both teams know they win together, things change. Fast.\n\n**Second: Stop spraying and praying.** The spray-and-pray email list you bought three years ago is exactly as useful as it sounds: useless. Instead, every piece of content you create should have a home. Blog post? Clip it into 5 social posts, a video, a deck your sales team can use. This isn't about being everywhere. It's about getting maximum mileage from what you actually build. HubSpot doesn't have 10x more writers than you. They just repurpose better.\n\n**Third: Your audience actually wants to hear from you.** This one trips people up. Forget cookies, forget third-party data. Your customers fill out forms. They download things. They email you questions. That's data. Real data. The companies crushing it in 2026 are using first-party data to segment, personalize, and actually talk to people about what they care about, not what your product does.\n\nAll three of these are table stakes, not innovations. But most companies still haven't figured them out.\n\nStop looking for the next hot tactic (webinars, community, AI agents, whatever). You're probably one channel away from better results if you just fixed these three things. Pick one. Nail it. Then move on.\n\nWhat's the easiest of these three to fix at your company? And what's actually stopping you from fixing it?",

Not a template, just me talking to the camera for 45 seconds about their actual problem.  \n  \nIt takes maybe 10 minutes to record 5 of these vs writing perfect email copy for an hour. The reply rate jumped because it felt like an actual conversation, not marketing automation doing its thing.  \n  \nThe stopping point is usually that it feels weird at first. You're on camera, it's not polished, your sales team might think it's odd.

Sales stops cherry-picking by gut feel. And you stop wasting spend driving people to content you can’t operationalize.\n\nDo you already have a way to see “what they cared about” (not just t hat they clicked), or is your reporting still mostly generic activity metrics?",
