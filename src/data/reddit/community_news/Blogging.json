I updated my content with fresh images and how to photo steps and did some internal linking. My bounce rate used to be 89% and now its 66% with the changes I've made. Don't know how much that helps with traffic really but people are staying longer and browsing more on my site now.\n\nI also use Feast Plug and that has been the best plug in I've ever purchased cause it lets me ad advance jump to features on my posts and lets me format my posts better.",

Treat each blog post as a hub: turn it into 3–5 short posts, 1 Reddit answer, and one email. Guest posts on smaller-but-relevant blogs can do more for you right now than chasing huge authority sites.\n\n\n\nCommunities beat generic social early on. Answer specific problems in niche subs, Discords, and forums, then link your post only when it truly helps. Tools like SparkToro and GummySearch help find where your readers talk, and Pulse quietly surfaces Reddit threads that match your topics so you’re not guessing where to show up.

Follow a 7-Day Strategy**\n\nDon’t pin aggressively one day and disappear the next. Pinterest prefers **steady daily activity**.\n\n**3. Don’t Follow–Unfollow**\n\nThis is not Instagram. Follow - unfollow patterns are a huge red flag.\n\n**4. Never Make Huge Profile Changes at Once**\n\nAvoid changing your niche, bio, username, boards, and links together. Make small changes slowly.\n\n**5. Use Pinterest Actively (Like a Real Person)**\n\nExplore your feed, save ideas, create boards, and publish helpful content. Pinterest favors active creators, not link-droppers.\n\n**6. Don’t Act Like a Bot**\n\nAvoid aggressive automation tools. Manual, natural actions build long-term trust.\n\n**7. Avoid Too Many Redirections**\n\nDirect links work best. Too many redirects, cloaked links, or shorteners can hurt your account.\n\n**8. Avoid Sharing Your Pinterest Profile URL Everywhere**\n\nConstant self-promotion can look suspicious. Let growth happen **organically**.\n\n**9. Diversify Your Links**\n\nDon’t send every pin to the same page. Use blogs, different pages, lead magnets, and resources.\n\n**10. Don’t Steal Pins or Images**\n\nAlways use: Your own designs, Licensed or royalty-free images.\n\nCopied content = high ban risk.\n\n**11. Diversify Your Publishing Pin Numbers**\n\nAvoid pinning the **exact same number every day or month**. Go from **low → medium → high** gradually over time.\n\nNatural variation = safe growth.\n\n**12. Find Your Golden Publishing Number**\n\nEvery account has a sweet spot. Test different daily pin counts and track: Impressions, Saves, Clicks.\n\n**More pins ≠ More growth.**\n\n**13. Pin Engagement > Outbound Links**\n\nPinterest prioritizes engagement first.\n\nFocus on: Saves, Comments, Time spent, High engagement builds trust before pushing links.\n\n**14. Always Have a Specific Publishing Time**\n\nPinning at a consistent time helps Pinterest understand your habits. Train the algorithm to expect you.\n\n**15. Be Consistent!**\n\nPinterest success is a long game, not overnight growth. Small daily actions beat random bursts - every time.\n\n# Let’s Talk\n\nPinterest growth isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\n**Which tip do you want more clarity on?**\n\n**What’s confusing you right now?**\n\n**Any Pinterest mistakes you’ve learned from?**\n\nDrop your questions below - let’s grow safely!",

I've been digging into this too and the disconnect between GA4 sessions and actual monetizable pageviews is a massive issue now. One thing worth looking into is fraudblocker, I've heard it works really well for blocking out the fake clicks and bot traffic before it even hits your analytics.\n\nSupposed to clean up your data so you're not making decisions based on garbage numbers. The geo-filtering stuff you mentioned helps but doesn't catch everything, especially teh more sophisticated bots that mimic real user behavior.",

I find usually engagement metrics align more closely than overall views due to different traffic filtering methods between platforms.\n\nUsually if there's a discrepancy between two platforms, the one showing you a higher number is usually lower engagement rate %s (ie. the extra traffic was low quality or bots.  Larger denominator, similar numerator), and there are telltale signs in terms of bounce rate or other indications that help you filter out and understand the discrepancy.",

What helped was building a separate “clean traffic” stack: Cloudflare logs + ad network reports + one privacy-focused analytics tool, then comparing all three by country and device. Once I blocked a few Chinese IP ranges and tightened WAF rules, sessions dropped hard but RPM and CTR actually went up.\n\nI’d also split reporting into 3 buckets: search, socials (Pinterest, FB), and “other / junk.” If a source sends thousands of “visits” with almost no ad impressions or scroll depth, I just treat it as bot noise and filter it. Netherlands vs Brazil RPM gaps will always be there, so I lean into high-RPM geos with content and pins.\n\nFor tracking and reacting faster, tools like Cloudflare Analytics, Fathom, and Pulse plus some basic IP blocking give a way more honest picture than GA4 alone.",

Im trying to decide if I should invest time into pinterest or focus on youtube or instagram instead\n\nMain concern is people say you need 15-20 pins daily which sounds overwhelming on top of writing posts and SEO. Already spending 20+ hours weekly just on content\n\nI tried tailwind for 2 weeks which helped with scheduling and has smartpin that creates designs automatically but not sure if worth continuing since havent seen much traffic yet, maybe 2 weeks isn't long enough to judge??\n\nFor bloggers what's your experience with pinterest growth lately? Still worth the time or focus elsewhere? And if using it how much time weekly are you actually spending?\n\nIm trying to figure out where to focus energy because I can't do everything and pinterest seems like it could either be amazing or total waste of time depending on who you ask",

You wait for numbers that may never come, while ignoring the things that actually build a real audience.\n\nMy approach has been much more old school and user-first.\n\nI start with a very simple principle that many modern playbooks ignore: understand what the user actually wants, how they think, and how they prefer to consume content. I design my posts not for algorithms, but for how a real person would naturally read, scan, and feel while going through the article.\n\nBefore I even think about monetization, I ask myself three questions:  \nWhat problem is the reader trying to solve?  \nWhat frustration are they carrying?  \nWhat would make this page genuinely useful for them?\n\nBased on that, I structure my content so that it is easy to follow, practical, and engaging rather than just keyword-heavy.\n\nI also focus heavily on linkable assets within my blog. For example, instead of only writing a theoretical post, I try to create elements that people would actually want to reference or share, such as:  \nmicro tools  \nstructured resources  \nlists or mini-directories  \ndownloadable checklists  \nvisual frameworks  \nor data points that feel valuable beyond the article itself.\n\nThese assets naturally make the content more shareable and more credible, even when traffic is still small.\n\nAnd of course, none of this works without genuinely strong content that fully satisfies user intent. If the reader leaves feeling that their question is still half-answered, no strategy, email list, or product will compensate for that.\n\nSo in short, my model has been:  \nuser understanding first  \nreading experience second  \nlinkable value third  \nand monetization only after trust is built.\n\nI’d be very curious to hear how other solo writers are approaching this, especially those who started with zero audience and built something meaningful over time.",

When I finished, she said \"never, ever, stop writing.\" Apparently I'm a pretty decent therapist for myself ;) \n\nI wish you all the luck for the journey.\n\nOver the years I've had moments of writing a lot, and moments of nothing. I'm back trying to put some effort into my blog again - it's mainly just random everyday things, not so much of a niche. \n\nI actually started using ChatGPT to try and figure out a blogging schedule that would work for me (I know, I know, embracing that whole AI thing, but I'll never get it to write \\*for\\* me). And it said \"make a routine that works for you, if you only commit to one post a fortnight, that's 26 more posts in the year than you did last year.\" \n\nSo my suggestion would be:  \n\\- Try and work out a schedule, write your post, walk away and come back with fresh eyes on a new day, edit and publish.   \n\\- Keep a list somewhere of all the posts you want to write. Inspiration will come at the most inconvenient times, so write it down and you can revisit it later when it's time to write but you're not sure what about.  \n\\- Remember who you're writing for. I write for myself, and try to not put any pressure on myself about visitor counts, subscriptions etc. \n\nAnd lastly, trust your gut. I'm by no means an expert, I write a pokey little blog with low numbers, and have a bloody good time doing so. Enjoy yourself!",

All still very fun and enjoyable...I just don't think I would have ever saw myself in this light without writing and being able to go back to previous posts and be like wow I really was in extreme pain and it was just a week ago...\n\nWhat I've been doing is having a post written in my journal and usually it gets published 2 days later as well...which allows me to re-read it with very fresh eyes and different set of emotions, allows me to word things more accurately/grammatically...but I try my best not change the emotion/context at all from the original piece. \n\nSo far I've made 10 consecutive posts, and it feels pretty good...varying sizes is okay...and usually the theme of the day is pretty apparent so I've been titling them as such.",

(Same name surname)\n\nContext: I updated my Mediavine payment method recently by switching to a new UAE bank account (Dubai) and entering my bank + SWIFT details (wire transfer), because I relocated and will be receiving payments there going forward. Shortly after that change, my payout stopped processing.\n\nTimeline (in order):\n\n• Jan 6: I emailed Mediavine Payments asking why my payment hadn’t been processed yet and whether there was a general delay.  \n• Jan 6 (later): Mediavine Payments replied that Tipalti flagged recent changes to my Payment Profile. They explained that when payment details are changed, Tipalti’s fraud monitoring can lock the account and the details must be confirmed. They asked me to list what changes I made and why.  \n• Jan 7: I replied explaining I relocated to Dubai and added a new UAE bank account / entered new SWIFT/bank details as the new payout method.  \n• Jan 7 (later): I sent a clearer breakdown (bullet points) summarizing: new UAE bank account added, new SWIFT/bank details entered, reason = relocation and receiving payouts there going forward. I also asked if any supporting documents were needed.  \n• Jan 8: Mediavine confirmed they notified Tipalti to confirm/clear the changes and said once it’s settled they can send the payment. They mentioned payouts/resubmissions typically go out on the 15th of the month (or closest business day).  \n• Jan 12: I asked if I would still receive payment on the 15th (or closest business day). Mediavine replied they were still waiting on Tipalti, and that Tipalti seemed to be having issues with their **messaging/email system** which delayed some replies. They said as soon as Tipalti provides the all-clear, the payment will be submitted.  \n• Jan 14: I asked if a phone call could speed things up because the delay is impacting my monthly bills. Mediavine said email is still the best way and that they can’t speed it up beyond continuing to email Tipalti; they repeated they understand the urgency and are trying to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\nAs of today (Jan 20), it’s still not resolved and the payment hasn’t been submitted because Tipalti hasn’t cleared the account yet.\n\nIs a 2+ week delay for Tipalti verification after changing bank/SWIFT details normal?\n\nAny insight would help a lot, this delay is putting me in a tough spot. Thank you.",

Then things went sideways: I completely disappeared from Bing search results, and most of my newer content isn't showing up on Google either. Bing likely tagged my articles as low quality or AI generated - which is about 50% true, I write about AI so of course I use AI to generate content, but I make sure its unique and value adding.\n\nAs a first-time website owner, I've been trying to tackle this myself - improving site performance, working on response times, and learning about technical SEO as I go. But it's overwhelming when you don't fully understand what went wrong or how to fix it.\n\nI'm losing motivation to create new content when I'm not sure anyone can actually find it.\n\n**For those who've dealt with indexing issues or sudden drops in visibility:**\n\n* Were you able to recover? What helped?\n* How did you stay motivated to keep publishing during the rough patch?\n* Any specific resources or approaches that made a difference?\n\nI don't want to create content if it's not going to be visible to my intended audience.

Expand those with clearer structure, original examples, stronger internal links, then resubmit them for indexing.

It often feels like a penalty, but it's usually a reset phase rather than something breaking. Treat this stretch as foundation mode instead of growth mode. Indexing can lag, but the fixes made here are often what unlock the next round once things start moving again.",
