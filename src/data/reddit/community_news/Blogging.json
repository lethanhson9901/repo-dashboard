Here's what actually moved the needle:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What DIDN'T work (or stopped working):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest - Unless you're in food/DIY/fashion niches\n\n\\- Facebook groups - Algorithm changes killed reach\n\n\\- Twitter threads - Gets engagement, rarely clicks\n\n\\- Mass guest posting - Low quality = no benefit\n\n\\- Commenting on other blogs - Time sink with minimal return\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What ACTUALLY works:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*\\*1. SEO (boring but true)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nTarget low competition, high intent keywords. One well-optimized post can bring traffic for years. I have posts from 2023 still bringing 1000+ monthly visitors.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Reddit (carefully)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGenuinely helping in relevant subreddits. Not dropping links - becoming known as helpful. People check profiles.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Updating old content\\*\\*\n\n\n\nRefreshing posts every 6-12 months. Adding new sections, updating stats, improving formatting. Google loves fresh content.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*4. Email list from day one\\*\\*\n\n\n\nEven 100 engaged subscribers > 10K social followers. They actually click and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*5. One platform, deeply\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI chose YouTube as my secondary. Every blog post becomes a video. Video ranks, drives to blog. Pick ONE and go deep.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nBlogging traffic takes 6-12 months to compound. Most people quit at month 3. Consistency beats tactics.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My current split:\\*\\*\n\n\\- 70% organic search\n\n\\- 15% direct/email\n\n\\- 10% YouTube\n\n\\- 5% social/other\n\n\n\nWhat's working for your blog right now?",

You can type it into Google and click the first result, it’s the same name I use on Pinterest.\n\nI strongly recommend avoiding bulk automation tools like BlogToPin or anything that mass-produces pins. From my experience, Pinterest is very picky. You actually need to spend time designing high-quality pins.\n\nI can’t pour my entire strategy here, but here’s what I can share:\n\n1. Write a lot of articles first.\nAim for around 150 posts before going hard on Pinterest.\n\n2. Pin consistently and do it properly.\nOne pin should link to one unique URL. Don’t publish 10 pins all pointing to the same article.\n\nI personally started with 1 pin per day. Literally. The goal is to show the algorithm you’re human. Then I moved to 2 per day, and now I’m pinning 5 per day.\n\nHaving 150 articles means I never run out of URLs to pin.\n\nThere’s a lot more to Pinterest that I can’t cover here. Board strategies, for example, but that’s the foundation.\n\nI do write about this stuff on Medium as well.",

It’s just my own experiment that I decided to share, I hope that some of you might find it useful.\n\nSo I already had one food blog and I started two new ones because my old one had reached a point where growth slowed down. At the same time, I launched three additional food blogs on WordPress, but with a completely different approach.\n\nThree blogs are written the “classic” way: topic research, manual writing, editing, internal linking – all by hand. The other three are fully automated using tools that can handle the entire process end-to-end (from topic selection to publishing), with only minimal human oversight.\n\nAfter one year, none of the six blogs is making meaningful ad revenue yet. However, viewership for both Versions skyrocketed in the beginning, 1 year later it stayed somewhat consistent in the 6-13k clicks range per month. Then something unexpected happened: One of the automated blogs (funny enough, the one with the least amount of views) got a direct sponsorship deal. It runs three banner placements of a local business who sells handforged pans and brings in €2,500 per month, fixed, independent of traffic spikes or ad networks. \n\nI am still trying out some new things and while I pretty much ran my automated ones on autopilot, I felt like there is so much potential I didn't use yet. I didn't optimize anything by hand, I didn't squeeze the potential that I see in so many things. As this is my first time posting, I am gonna see if there is interest in posting a follow up.",

              "text": "Oh dear, automation was hell for me in the beginning. So the thing is I am not that tech savy but am open minded so I tried a ton of different tools, in the end my son and I actually narrowed down the list to two tools I keep using. \n\nFirst thing is the content planning and for that I used just regular chatGPT in the beginning but I ended up with an n8n script that my son made over a weekend to scrape the web for interesting new topics. Its not perfect but it does the job honestly.\n\nSecond thing is content creation. As I use a wordpress Site, in the beginning I needed a tool to create content for me. I just used a plugin that promised to do the content creation part but it generated bad texts and also not SEO optimized. But no free tool did what I wanted so I ended up using [this automation tool](https://mypublio.com) . It automates more or less everything for wordpress but I just use it for the texts and its among the best texts I saw as a 20 year long blogger. The key factor for me was research... I want things to be properly researched, and the recipes to be genuine good ones that other have used. And unfortunately this is the only program that I found that did a proper research. \n\nIf you don't wanna spend money on automation tools I can really recommend you to just make it semi automatic by making an own chatGPT content Pipeline.",

Mediocre traffic. Minimal engagement. Zero shares.\n\n\n\nThen I changed my approach. Here's what happened.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The old way (SEO-first):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Find keyword with volume\n\n\\- Check top 10 results\n\n\\- Write something similar but \"better\"\n\n\\- Stuff keywords everywhere\n\n\\- Add H2s and H3s strategically\n\n\\- Build backlinks\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The new way (human-first):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Write about things I genuinely find interesting\n\n\\- Share real experiences and specific examples\n\n\\- Say controversial things I actually believe\n\n\\- Write like I'm talking to a friend\n\n\\- Only publish when I'd actually share it myself\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What changed:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | SEO-First | Human-First |\n\n|--------|-----------|-------------|\n\n| Avg time on page | 1:30 | 4:45 |\n\n| Bounce rate | 78% | 42% |\n\n| Social shares | \\~2 | \\~15 |\n\n| Return visitors | 8% | 31% |\n\n| Email signups | 0.5% | 3.2% |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The irony:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe \"human-first\" posts actually started ranking BETTER in search. Why? Because:\n\n\n\n1. People stayed longer (engagement signal)\n\n2. People shared them (backlinks)\n\n3. People came back (brand recognition)\n\n4. Lower bounce rate (quality signal)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I learned:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's algorithm has gotten good at detecting genuine value vs. content created purely to rank. The gap will only widen with AI content flooding the internet.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Practical tips:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Write your first draft as if no one will read it. Edit later.\n\n2. Include specific numbers, examples, and stories from your life.\n\n3. Have an actual opinion. Fence-sitting content doesn't get shared.\n\n4. Read your post out loud. If it sounds robotic, rewrite it.\n\n\n\nI've been using a tool I built (Crescitaly) to track which content resonates most, and the pattern is clear: authenticity wins.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for discussion:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed the shift? Are you writing differently in 2026 than you were a year ago?",

Submitting the sitemap to Google Search Console is key, but like others said, manual requests for each page can speed things up. Also, check if there's any robots.txt blocking crawlers or if your hosting has crawl limits. If you share the URL, folks here might spot something specific. Hang in there, it usually sorts itself out with a bit of patience and tweaking.",

I use the same email for my YouTube channel and for AdSense.\nRecently, I created a blog on the Blogger platform with the goal of promoting my work and also having a second source of monetization. I used the same email from my YouTube/AdSense account to create the blog, and I already set up the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which I saw are required for AdSense.\nMy question is:\nCan I link this blog to the same AdSense account I already use for my YouTube channel?\nIs it safe to do this, or is there any risk to my AdSense account or my YouTube channel?\nI really want to do things the right way and avoid problems in the future, but I’m honestly very much a beginner when it comes to these topics.\nThanks in advance for any help!",
