      "text": "I have been in SEO for 7 years. Started in-house, moved to agency, after that, SEO for affiliates in a large media group, and then, self-employed. Now I have 3 SEO clients and blogs I launched 10 months ago.\n\nI have a site in the VPN niche (1 GEO), one in crypto (1 GEO), and one in iGaming (2 GEOs). I hired someone to manage my SEO clients and dove deep into the blogs.\n\nI bought aged domains relevant to each niche to avoid the initial period of establishing authority from zero. \n\nGiven the fact that it was work I already did for several years, the only thing I had to do was work with an affiliate relations manager on a freelance basis, and one writer. Did the content strategy, plans, briefing and all else myself.\n\nSince launching, I have not taken a penny from what has been generated and reinvested everything.\n\nHere are some of my takeaways no matter the niche:\n\n\\- Backlinks are king in most regulated, highly profitable markets. Nowadays, there aren't many high-paying affiliate industries that are not saturated. Starting as a solo person is tough, as backlinks from the relevant domains are not cheap. So, keep that in mind.\n\n\\- AI content will very unlikely help you compete with long-form content. It is simply not ready. For someone who may be in the betting space, perhaps, creating automatic analysis content for football/basketball...  will work, in fact, it is the best use of AI, given that these matches happen daily, and it removes the need to distract writers from focusing on areas that are timeless. But for your normal content, do not rely on it.\n\n\\- Your money pages must be regularly updated. Every month I would say. You would be surprised at how fast rankings drop for highly commercial pages, no matter how good they are. There is always someone trying to take your spot. Sometimes including widgets or assets in your page that regularly autoupdate gives Google the impression  that the page is fresh and maintained.\n\n\\- Do not reinvent the wheel. See what your competitors are doing. Do the same, + a few differentiating aspects to summarise what users would find in 5 blogs from the 1st page of the SERPs in your article alone.\n\n\\- Think GEO. We are transitioning fast into a solution first environment. So, author mentions, citations, and more are super important.\n\n\\- Contrary to popular belief, You do not have to change the practices you used to do, just place a bit more focus on the AIO and GEO aspects.\n\n\\- Negotiate with affiliates once you have relevant traffic for better deals. Starting from scratch, they will just throw you a bone.\n\nMany people say it is impossible to make money blogging nowadays, but it is far from the true. I do not do ads. The company I worked for was making 15M per year with about 20 affiliate projects in 15 GEOs. They started in 2018.\n\nMy goal is not even that. It is to scale to 6 figures per month launching multiple GEOs and multiple projects in the next few years, and sell it as a media group. You can too.",

The editorial tone has been established from the beginning based on the trends we observed among competitors whilst doing the initial competitive analysis, but, still giving him the creative freedom to write as he normally would while remaining aligned.\n\nEvery blog has been great so far, He has some reputation. So, his name is on the blogs as the author.\n\nBut, the tone can be different between blogs. As far as I am concerned, this has never been a factor. Most of the companies I have been with were consistent delegating projects to writers and making them owners of each project, but, several different writers often contributed into one project. Adhering to certain content guidelines, but having creative freedom.",

When you say “I have a writer,” do you mean it’s the same person writing for all three sites, or one writer per project?\n\nHave you ever tried using an institutional byline (like “Editorial Team” / “Staff”), and if not, why do you prefer showing the author’s name even when it’s just one writer?\n\nDo you also publish as an author yourself, or are you mostly editing/directing?\n\nI’m asking because I’m building multiple sites and, budget-wise, I’ll probably be writing for more than one at the beginning. I keep wondering whether having the same author across 3–5 projects reads as consistency/transparency… or whether it can work against you by “mixing signals.” I’m interested in your reasoning, not a rule.",

That adds up to around 900 to 1200 visitors a month which is good for a new site. I believe the key is whether your traffic is growing each month and if it is relevant. I suggest checking which keywords bring traffic and if they are low competition then using tools like LowFruits to find easier keywords to rank for. I also focus on making sure articles have clear titles, proper headings and strong internal links. Posting daily is helpful but quality and smart keyword targeting matter more than volume. If your traffic is slowly increasing, you are on the right track and by refining your keyword strategy and updating older posts, you should see steady growth over time.",

My traffic has gone from 15-20 per day to 400-600 over night. I don't want to miss my chance to capitalize on this!\n\nHere's my plan but I'd love to hear some real tips:\n\n\\- Immediately stop all my other side hustles and bring them down to a minimum and treat this blog like a full-time job. I do have what I'd call passive income-adjacent income. More or less, I can scale my main business down and still make money for less work because of the work I've already put in.\n\n\\- Build a guide off of an old post and capture more emails. I currently have about 30 emails captured.\n\n\\- Focus on building my blog and YouTube channel up to reach monetization ASAP\n\n\\- Immediately begin posting at least once a day\n\n\\- Push to get to 50k sessions in 30 days so I can potentially qualify for a network like mediavine. Currently, I am in no networks for this blog.\n\nWhat else would you do? I don't want to divide my attention too much. My Instagram and Pinterest are also growing, but I have problems when I try to do too much all at once.",

May will recommend going on Journey to make more money, but as a web designer / UX guy I’d advise against it.\n\nWith Raptive they ask to link your GA so they can verify things, I’m assuming Mediavina is the same if you’re doing Adsense.\n\nI managed to meet the requirements for Raptive after 1 month of going live (on track for 30,000 views this month) but my domain is only 2 months old so they told me to wait until it’s 6 months. \n\nGood luck OP!

That way you can capitalize on the popularity. Rankmath can help with the webstory Schema so your more likley to get picked up.\n\nThe easiest monetization from here is an ad network like Journey by Mediavine. RPM's are lower than they have been but better than nothing and requires very little work on your end. If you can push to a premium platform like Mediavine Full or Raptive thats where the real money is made. \n\nThe difference is crazy, I've got 2 sites with similar traffic in adjacent niches, one on Journey getting $9 RPM's and another on Mediavine getting $47 RPM's. \n\nYou will need to stabalize the traffic and branch out a bit more before getting accepted to one of the big guys but Journey will get you started. Email can be a slog but worth setting up a few automations with Grow by Journey and Kit (formerly convert Kit) both are free. Grow will send new post's to subs automatically with a decently designed template thats hands off then you can get inot the weeds a bit more with Kit once the list is worth actively tapping.   \n\nHappy to answer any follow ups that dont DOX my sites or niche.

And basic on-page SEO often means just a good and accessibility friendly website which just makes the user experience better.\n\nThat said working on traffic from other directions could be faster and probably can be better to do at the start.

Some friends of mine are not on social media, so we just call each now and then and plan trips. So there's definitely an existing friendship offline.\n\nBut I feel social media impacting my health and privacy on a big scale. Doomscrolling rots my mind and cookies sell every step I make so big tech can profit off of it. Every picture I post belongs to meta nowadays and they can do whatever they want to with it. I'd prefer autonomy over my information and not funding some billionaires lifestyle. Algorythm makes you passive and you suddenly forget how to reach out because your feed pushes peoples information towards you instead the other way around.\n\nI like the idea of them just having to click on a website and then they know whats up. Blogs are usually without an account, so it's free access but you can set up passwords only they know. Costs are some bucks a month, but if that means I don't have to sell my soul to the algorythmic machine then thats fine with me.\n\nLife before social media has existed. It was different, but it was possible. I think my friends care about me enough to vibe with it. Heck, let me be that one weird friend with a blog and a phone number. Those who like me stick around, those who don't see worth in friendship pass on. I would stick around for my friends no matter what shenanigans they're up to.",

Google is clearly starting to notice you.\nA few things that helped me scale my blogs faster:\n1. Focus on long-tail keywords. With a new site, you won’t rank for competitive terms. Target specific, low-competition queries — they add up fast.\n2. Nail your on-page SEO. Make sure every post has a proper meta title, description, FAQ schema, and optimized images. This alone can double your CTR from impressions.\n3. Increase publishing frequency if you can. Every two days is good, but if you can batch-create content and publish daily, the compounding effect kicks in much sooner. I use an AI content tool I built to queue up 10-20 articles at once, which saves me hours.\n4. Don’t ignore Pinterest. For certain niches it can drive more traffic than Google in the early months.\nThe first 6-12 months are the hardest. Your impressions are growing — that means Google is testing your content. Keep going, the clicks will follow.",

I wanted to set up AdSense early and then just let it run while I keep posting.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n\n* I usually place **1–2 ads max** on long game reviews (my reviews are usually **2000–2500 words**)\n* I try to put **no ads** on short “news” posts\n* I added **noindex,follow** to “thin” pages like **tags** and **author pages**\n* I also noindexed some very short news posts (100–250 words)\n\nMy site is minimalist (not super fancy). It’s also **in French** (not sure if that matters).\n\nDo you see any common reasons why I’d still be getting refused? Anything I might be missing?\n\nAlso: **how long did it take you to start getting traffic**, and what actually helped you the most (besides SEO)? Any strategies that worked well for you beside (shorts/reels, communities, etc.)?\n\nThanks a lot!",

Then you apply again once the checklist is clean instead of burning another review.\n\nOn the traffic question: no, AdSense doesn’t have an official minimum. Plenty of people get approved with low traffic. What *does* matter is that the site looks complete, trustworthy, and technically solid.\n\nFor growth (especially for a new French blog), what moved the needle for me wasn’t ads or even pure SEO at the start — it was:\n\n* picking topics with existing search demand\n* internal linking between related posts\n* posting consistently for a few months\n* sharing in niche communities where the audience already cares\n\nYou’re actually on the right track — this is the phase where most people get stuck because the rejection message is so vague.",

If your site isn’t earning, it’s usually a traffic quality and positioning problem, not that blogging is dead. Focus on a tight niche, publish fewer but deeper posts, and optimize for both Google and AI discovery (clear answers, structured content, strong topical authority). \n\nAdd email capture and consider monetization beyond AdSense (affiliates, digital products, services). Refresh old posts don’t just add new ones and improve internal linking. Use tools like Runable, Google Search Console, and analytics to see what actually drives clicks.
