But after 15th Jan, both traffic and income started coming back to normal.\n\nIn total, I got around **1,13,000 page views** with an **RPM of $2.63**.\n\nIncome dropped compared to December 2025, but this is normal, every year, income drops during the first few months.\n\nSome of my new blog posts (written in the last few months) also started getting traffic. That really motivates me to keep blogging.\n\nMy blog is a pure content blog, and the niche is employee-related, such as resume templates, career advice, job portal guides, etc.\n\n",

          "text": "There are too many factors to account for with such a vague question. Consider \"how long did it take you to learn to swim, or walk\", and then correlate the answer.\n\nEach website or blog can be vastly different from another. The topic of choice for a blog alone can determine how fast traffic will spike.\n\nWhat topic are you writing about? Lifestyle? Psychology? or Micromanaging Bonsai trees for maximum growth potential?\n\nWho or what is the target audience that you are writing for? Is it a personal blog or a business blog? Cat lovers? Dog lovers? or \"revisiting the extinct species lists\"?\n\nThe point I would like to address is that you should have a purpose behind the process of building your blog. The more purposeful you create your blog, the greater the chances of traffic to that blog. If you are simply writing personal notes to the world, that's awesome, but not entirely \"calling people in\".\n\nIf your blog is actively solving problems that are highly needed throughout society, then it would be hard to stop the flow of traffic. People often read things that solve a problem for themselves.\n\nConsider this site, is all about receiving helpful insight. Users ask a question, in the hopes of getting useful answers. So there is a high likelihood that you come back to read the topic, and you have a direct interest in the outcome of the topic.\n\nDoes your blog fulfill this same need to your readers? If not, this becomes the most deterministic factor for how fast your blog will get traffic. We are in an era where a single post can travel the internet a million times overnight. Most of the time, this happens due to the nature of the topic, not where the topic originated.\n\nOnce you have more clearly defined the overall purpose of your content, then you can actively do more to enhance the shareability factors. There are things you will want to do. such as:\n\n* Writing long and short-form content,\n* uploading images to your blog,\n* creating engaging content posts,\n* encouraging feedback on your site\n* making sure your blog posts are curated\n* blog consistently\n* managing your SEO\n* internal and external linkbuild practices\n* social engagement\n* either a simple design or a good design\n* easy to read formatting\n* and a bunch more...\n\nThere is a lot that goes into \"creating\" a blog, least of all just posting. It should be treated as a business if you are trying to use it as a business. Your urgency to get traffic will not \"solve\" a traffic issue, trust me on that one. We've all been there before.\n\nConsider your blog as a community project, a living, growing environment where people will come to read for \"their benefit\", not yours. That's the key.",

I decided to revamp the website and relaunched the blog on Oct 20th. I’m excited to report the progress I’ve seen in January!\n\nMy goal was to publish (at a minimum) 4 blog posts and I did just that. Giving me a total of 27 blog posts.\n\nJanuary Traffic per Google Analytics: Event Count: 1.45K Active Users: 209 New Users: 205 Avg Session: 2m 50s\n\nNew user traffic:\nOrganic social: 81\nOrganic search: 76\nDirect: 41\nUnassigned: 5\nReferral: 2\n\n\nI am very excited for this month’s results. As wedding planning season has begun for a lot of couples, I believe my site is picking up momentum and getting visibility.\n\nWhat I did: I do focus on SEO. Not in the, cookie-cutter have chat gpt spit out a blog sort of way, but really considering what brides/couples are googling. I do my research and post with intention.\n\nWhat I didn’t do: I didn’t use Pinterest this month like I wanted to or social media. They are two great resources, but I struggle to find the time to do it all. So I am focusing on blogging and hopefully the rest will come later.\n\nThanks for following along on my journey! Hopefully you’re enjoy it as much as I am 🙂",

You’re doing the right thing focusing on SEO first - it compounds over time.\n\nFor Pinterest/social: Don’t beat yourself up. Many successful bloggers actually *delay* social until they have 20-30 strong posts, because then you have more content to distribute. You’re at 27, so you’re actually at the perfect point to start layering it in gradually.\n\nOne tip: Instead of trying to do everything, maybe pick ONE Pinterest session per week (30 mins) where you batch-pin your recent posts. Use a scheduler like Tailwind so it drips out over the month. That way you’re still focusing 90% on content but getting *some* Pinterest traction.\n\nThe wedding planning season momentum will definitely help - you’re positioned well.

But I did not gave up on watching videos and reading blogs on how I was going to start my own blog.\n\nEventually, In Nov 2025 I made ChatGPT my mentor and published my first blog. I was so overwhelmed by the information that I could not decide where to start. I am thankful to openAI and chatGPT for guiding me through all the processes including hosting, designing website, setting up various pages. Of course I did all the things myself, ChatGPT helped me to streamline the process. This was a game changer for me. \n\n  \nThen on 25th Nov ~~2026~~ 2025 I published 7 blogs. And then, I went back to my old ways. I did nothing till Jan end. In Jan end I published 15 more blogs. \n\nI write blogs with AI but with restricted sources. The blogs are informative in nature.\n\n  \nBelow are some stats till date. I don't know what to make of it.

CTR problems tend to be about classification and SERP layout (AI overviews, widgets, other tools) rather than pure on‑page SEO. industry data still finds organic search is the largest long‑term traffic source for most sites but utility pages are disproportionately affected by AI overviews and zero‑click answers... you only get real traffic when your page is the obvious next action (richer explanations, scenarios, comparisons) rather than just one more calculator.\n\nwhat’s moved the needle on similar builds:  \n\\- deepen a few winners before chasing more pages. in public case studies, utility pages that added use cases like for example inputs/outputs, mini‑FAQs and what this number means for you sections saw meaningful CTR and ranking lifts even with AI overviews present. because they became the page users clicked after the summary  \n\\- tighten keyword–tool fit. check Search Console for each tool: if impressions come from queries that dont match the tool’s real job, rewrite titles/meta to mirror the exact phrasing of the highest‑intent queries, then adjust content so the tool plus explainer page is clearly designed for that use case. this intent realignment step is commonly cited in growth breakdowns where impressions were flat for months before compounding  \n\\- authority matters but only after the above. links to thin tools mostly increase impressions without fixing CTR. and links to clearly positioned, high‑intent tools tend to produce both more impressions and a steeper click curve. recent studies and practitioner write‑ups suggest selective link building to 5-10 hub tools (not every page) performs better than spraying low‑quality links sitewide\n\nif this were my project at \\~7-8mos i’d:  \n1) pull the last 90 days of GSC data, sort by impressions and then pick the top 10 tool URLs. for each, list the top 10 queries, current position and CTR. then rewrite title/H1/meta and above‑the‑fold copy so they exactly answer the searcher’s wording and promise a clear outcome, not just calculator or generator  \n2) expand those 10 pages with 300-800 words covering: what the tool is for, 2-3 real‑world scenarios, step‑by‑step usage and a short FAQ targeting People Also Ask style questions around that keyword set. this pattern is used in many SEO avalanche case studies that broke out of low‑CTR plateaus  \n3) only after that, run a small, focused link‑building sprint: 5-15 relevant links from niche blogs, directories and resource pages pointing to those core tools and the homepage (no spam, no random swaps). for utility sites, a modest authority bump on the right pages can move you from positions 8-15 to 3-5 which typically yields multi‑x higher CTR\n\nso clearly youre not in a failed zone yet for a 7-8mo utility site especially with AI search compressing clicks. this is the moment where sharpening intent and then layering authority usually decides whether the curve bends up or stays flat.",

One thing people miss at this stage is that “backlinks vs content” is often the wrong fork when impressions are there but CTR stays soft.\n\nWhen Google hasn’t really decided what a utility page is yet, links mostly just amplify whatever classification already exists. If it’s being treated like a thin tool or reference, more authority can mean more impressions without changing how it’s shown or clicked. That’s why the curve stays flat even as visibility creeps up.\n\nWhat usually matters first is whether the page earns a clearer intent label over time. Use cases, FAQs, examples, those aren’t just filler. They’re often the signals that move a page from “functional resource” to “solution someone actually chooses,” which affects snippets, sitelinks, and where clicks go. Once that settles, links start to compound instead of leaking.\n\nThe AI overview point is real too, but I’ve still seen pages get clicks when they’re the obvious next step after the summary, not just the cited source.\n\nOut of curiosity, are most of the impressions hitting the core tool pages, or the surrounding explanatory content you’ve been adding?",

      "text": "Been blogging since 2019. Three sites, mixed niches, decent traffic. Thought 2025's big challenge would be content flooding or Google algo updates. Nope. It's accessibility compliance.\n\nTwo of my blogs have EU audiences. Just found out about EAA 2025 - June deadline, mandatory WCAG 2.2 compliance, fines that'll make your hosting bill look like pocket change. Suddenly my \"good enough\" designs are liability traps.\n\nI prided myself on clean aesthetics. Minimalist themes, subtle colors, sleek navigation. Turns out \"subtle\" often means \"invisible to screen readers\" or \"unusable for keyboard navigation.\"\n\nMy food blog had recipe cards with gorgeous low-contrast text - light gray on white for \"elegant\" typography. WCAG wants 4.5:1 minimum. Had to darken everything. Looks \"less premium\" but actual humans can read ingredient lists now.\n\nFocus indicators were another blind spot. Removed default browser outlines for that polished look. Keyboard users? Completely lost. WCAG 2.2 specifically tightened focus appearance rules - minimum size, contrast, not obscured by other elements.\n\nThen there's target size. My \"clean\" social sharing buttons? 20x20px. WCAG 2.2 requires 24x24px minimum. Had to redesign entire component.\n\nAnyone else scrambling? Found tools that don't require hiring accessibility devs? Found One Tap it's a plugin for Wordpress and it handles baseline fixes, but curious what design compromises you've made for compliance vs. aesthetics?",

          "text": "This is a very common problem, and you are right to be cautious. Generating a large volume of AI ideas without traffic validation usually leads to wasted effort, not growth.\n\nThe core issue is that most AI tools are good at producing topics, but weak at prioritizing demand and intent. A list of 200 ideas is meaningless unless you know which ones already attract real searches and why.\n\nA strategy that works more reliably looks like this.\n\nFirst, reverse the process. Instead of asking AI to invent topics, start with topics that are already proving demand.\n\nUse Google search itself. Type your main keyword and carefully read:\n\n* Autocomplete suggestions\n* “People also ask” questions\n* Related searches at the bottom\n\nThese reflect real queries, not hypothetical ones.\n\nNext, validate through search results, not keyword volume alone. Open the top 10 ranking pages and ask:\n\n* Are forums like Reddit or Quora ranking?\n* Are the articles thin, outdated, or poorly structured?\n* Are they missing clear answers, examples, or depth?\n\nIf Reddit threads are ranking, that is usually a strong signal of underserved intent. Google is telling you it cannot find a better page.\n\nOnly after that should AI come in.\n\nInstead of “Give me SEO blog ideas,” use prompts like:  \n“Based on this keyword and the current top-ranking pages, identify content gaps and unanswered questions. Suggest one article that would fully satisfy search intent better than existing results.”\n\nThis forces AI to work as an analyst, not a generator.\n\nAnother effective approach is topic clustering with intent tiers:\n\n* One core page targeting the main keyword\n* Several supporting posts answering very specific questions people ask before or after that query\n\nTraffic compounds when content supports other content.\n\nSome writers also use tools like WordHero specifically for expanding validated ideas rather than discovering them. It works best when you already know what you want to rank for and need help shaping outlines, sections, or variations without losing focus.\n\nThe most important mindset shift is this: fewer articles with proven demand outperform hundreds of speculative ones. One well-aligned post that matches intent precisely can outperform 50 generic SEO pieces.\n\nIf an idea cannot clearly answer “who is searching this and what are they trying to decide,” it is usually not worth writing yet.",

(Semrush)\n2. **48%** leverage AI to brainstorm content ideas, **38%** for content briefs and outlines. (Semrush)\n3. **Top-ranked AI citations** come from pages with higher engagement metrics (longer sessions, more pages per visit, better conversions). (Semrush)\n4. **Organization, Article, and Breadcrumb schema** are the top 3 markup types appearing in AI citations. (Semrush)\n5. **Organic traffic dropped just 2.5%** year over year—far less than the predicted 25-60% decline. (Search Engine Land)\n6. **Traditional SEO KPIs** (rankings, CTR) are losing relevance as AI reshapes search results. (Kevin Indig)\n7. **88% of AI Overview triggers** are informational searches, impacting educational content the most. (Semrush)\n8. **AI Overviews reached 2 billion monthly users** across 200+ countries by mid-2025. (Google reports)\n9. **68% of AI Overview triggers** are low-volume keywords (under 100 monthly searches).

          "text": "If you’re new to blogging and publishing 15–20 posts a month, you don’t need perfect hosting — just something affordable and reliable. Bluehost and Hostinger aren’t as bad as the reviews make them seem; they’re heavily advertised, which skews opinions, but they’re fine for starting and you can always migrate later. Other solid beginner-friendly options include SiteGround or Cloudways if you want better performance. You can also consider Substack, which removes hosting complexity entirely and lets you focus purely on writing and growing an audience. That said, hosting isn’t usually the biggest bottleneck early on — distribution is. Writing consistently matters, but getting your posts seen matters more. That’s where ReGenr.app helps: it’s a creator-first platform (currently in beta) that automatically shares your blog posts across social platforms when you publish, so your content doesn’t just rely on SEO. The goal is simple: write once, distribute everywhere, and grow without burning out.",

I’ve been on Wordpress forever, own a few travel style blogs and have done the blue host then then thing. Everything I have is now hosted in Vercel and is a react app using markdown for pages. It’s a game changer. If you want to take your site seriously I would ditch Wordpress, get a $20 Claude pro license, and vibe code the perfect react website. Might sound daunting, but I promise Claude is up to the task these days a you will be essentially free hosting for a long time.",
