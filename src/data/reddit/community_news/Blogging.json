What moves the needle faster is pairing the blog with 1–2 channels where your niche already hangs out and you can get repeat exposure.\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I’d pick one “home base” (X, YouTube, or a single subreddit) and one guest-post target. Treat each blog post as a hub: turn it into 3–5 short posts, 1 Reddit answer, and one email. Guest posts on smaller-but-relevant blogs can do more for you right now than chasing huge authority sites.\n\n\n\nCommunities beat generic social early on. Answer specific problems in niche subs, Discords, and forums, then link your post only when it truly helps. Tools like SparkToro and GummySearch help find where your readers talk, and Pulse quietly surfaces Reddit threads that match your topics so you’re not guessing where to show up. Keep your main goal: consistent, useful output plus 1–2 focused distribution channels, not everywhere at once.",

      "text": "**For beginners, stuck accounts, and creators worried about bans or suspensions.**\n\n**1. Avoid Pinning the Same Pin Repeatedly**\n\nRe-pinning the same design repeatedly can look spammy. Create **new pin designs** instead (the same link is fine).\n\n**2. Follow a 7-Day Strategy**\n\nDon’t pin aggressively one day and disappear the next. Pinterest prefers **steady daily activity**.\n\n**3. Don’t Follow–Unfollow**\n\nThis is not Instagram. Follow - unfollow patterns are a huge red flag.\n\n**4. Never Make Huge Profile Changes at Once**\n\nAvoid changing your niche, bio, username, boards, and links together. Make small changes slowly.\n\n**5. Use Pinterest Actively (Like a Real Person)**\n\nExplore your feed, save ideas, create boards, and publish helpful content. Pinterest favors active creators, not link-droppers.\n\n**6. Don’t Act Like a Bot**\n\nAvoid aggressive automation tools. Manual, natural actions build long-term trust.\n\n**7. Avoid Too Many Redirections**\n\nDirect links work best. Too many redirects, cloaked links, or shorteners can hurt your account.\n\n**8. Avoid Sharing Your Pinterest Profile URL Everywhere**\n\nConstant self-promotion can look suspicious. Let growth happen **organically**.\n\n**9. Diversify Your Links**\n\nDon’t send every pin to the same page. Use blogs, different pages, lead magnets, and resources.\n\n**10. Don’t Steal Pins or Images**\n\nAlways use: Your own designs, Licensed or royalty-free images.\n\nCopied content = high ban risk.\n\n**11. Diversify Your Publishing Pin Numbers**\n\nAvoid pinning the **exact same number every day or month**. Go from **low → medium → high** gradually over time.\n\nNatural variation = safe growth.\n\n**12. Find Your Golden Publishing Number**\n\nEvery account has a sweet spot. Test different daily pin counts and track: Impressions, Saves, Clicks.\n\n**More pins ≠ More growth.**\n\n**13. Pin Engagement > Outbound Links**\n\nPinterest prioritizes engagement first.\n\nFocus on: Saves, Comments, Time spent, High engagement builds trust before pushing links.\n\n**14. Always Have a Specific Publishing Time**\n\nPinning at a consistent time helps Pinterest understand your habits. Train the algorithm to expect you.\n\n**15. Be Consistent!**\n\nPinterest success is a long game, not overnight growth. Small daily actions beat random bursts - every time.\n\n# Let’s Talk\n\nPinterest growth isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\n**Which tip do you want more clarity on?**\n\n**What’s confusing you right now?**\n\n**Any Pinterest mistakes you’ve learned from?**\n\nDrop your questions below - let’s grow safely!",

Already spending 20+ hours weekly just on content\n\nI tried tailwind for 2 weeks which helped with scheduling and has smartpin that creates designs automatically but not sure if worth continuing since havent seen much traffic yet, maybe 2 weeks isn't long enough to judge??\n\nFor bloggers what's your experience with pinterest growth lately? Still worth the time or focus elsewhere? And if using it how much time weekly are you actually spending?\n\nIm trying to figure out where to focus energy because I can't do everything and pinterest seems like it could either be amazing or total waste of time depending on who you ask",

Pins compound, insta doesn’t and if you’re already writing blog posts, pinterest is still worth it :)",

Once I blocked a few Chinese IP ranges and tightened WAF rules, sessions dropped hard but RPM and CTR actually went up.\n\nI’d also split reporting into 3 buckets: search, socials (Pinterest, FB), and “other / junk.” If a source sends thousands of “visits” with almost no ad impressions or scroll depth, I just treat it as bot noise and filter it. Netherlands vs Brazil RPM gaps will always be there, so I lean into high-RPM geos with content and pins.\n\nFor tracking and reacting faster, tools like Cloudflare Analytics, Fathom, and Pulse plus some basic IP blocking give a way more honest picture than GA4 alone.",

          "text": "Interesting observation, and I completely agree with the core of this.\n\nFrom my own experience building from a home office and starting from scratch, I’ve realized that “traffic-first thinking” often traps new bloggers in a long, discouraging loop. You wait for numbers that may never come, while ignoring the things that actually build a real audience.\n\nMy approach has been much more old school and user-first.\n\nI start with a very simple principle that many modern playbooks ignore: understand what the user actually wants, how they think, and how they prefer to consume content. I design my posts not for algorithms, but for how a real person would naturally read, scan, and feel while going through the article.\n\nBefore I even think about monetization, I ask myself three questions:  \nWhat problem is the reader trying to solve?  \nWhat frustration are they carrying?  \nWhat would make this page genuinely useful for them?\n\nBased on that, I structure my content so that it is easy to follow, practical, and engaging rather than just keyword-heavy.\n\nI also focus heavily on linkable assets within my blog. For example, instead of only writing a theoretical post, I try to create elements that people would actually want to reference or share, such as:  \nmicro tools  \nstructured resources  \nlists or mini-directories  \ndownloadable checklists  \nvisual frameworks  \nor data points that feel valuable beyond the article itself.\n\nThese assets naturally make the content more shareable and more credible, even when traffic is still small.\n\nAnd of course, none of this works without genuinely strong content that fully satisfies user intent. If the reader leaves feeling that their question is still half-answered, no strategy, email list, or product will compensate for that.\n\nSo in short, my model has been:  \nuser understanding first  \nreading experience second  \nlinkable value third  \nand monetization only after trust is built.\n\nI’d be very curious to hear how other solo writers are approaching this, especially those who started with zero audience and built something meaningful over time.",

When I finished, she said \"never, ever, stop writing.\" Apparently I'm a pretty decent therapist for myself ;) \n\nI wish you all the luck for the journey.\n\nOver the years I've had moments of writing a lot, and moments of nothing. I'm back trying to put some effort into my blog again - it's mainly just random everyday things, not so much of a niche. \n\nI actually started using ChatGPT to try and figure out a blogging schedule that would work for me (I know, I know, embracing that whole AI thing, but I'll never get it to write \\*for\\* me). And it said \"make a routine that works for you, if you only commit to one post a fortnight, that's 26 more posts in the year than you did last year.\" \n\nSo my suggestion would be:  \n\\- Try and work out a schedule, write your post, walk away and come back with fresh eyes on a new day, edit and publish.   \n\\- Keep a list somewhere of all the posts you want to write. Inspiration will come at the most inconvenient times, so write it down and you can revisit it later when it's time to write but you're not sure what about.  \n\\- Remember who you're writing for. I write for myself, and try to not put any pressure on myself about visitor counts, subscriptions etc. \n\nAnd lastly, trust your gut. I'm by no means an expert, I write a pokey little blog with low numbers, and have a bloody good time doing so. Enjoy yourself!",

You can still keep “Scrolls of Sonder” as a tagline or section name if you love it.\n\n\n\nAlso, your about page and subtitle matter more than the exact title. Clear subtitle like “Short stories exploring ordinary lives” will fix any confusion fast.\n\n\n\nFor inspiration and testing names, people use tools like Namecheap’s domain search, Notion pages for mockups, and even Reddit tools like Pulse alongside Hootsuite to see what wording actually pulls clicks and comments.

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m posting because this is currently my main/only source of income, and I had several bills scheduled based on receiving my Mediavine payout between the 2nd–5th of the month. Because the payment is delayed, I’m now financially tight and trying to understand what’s normal and what I can do next. (Same name surname)\n\nContext: I updated my Mediavine payment method recently by switching to a new UAE bank account (Dubai) and entering my bank + SWIFT details (wire transfer), because I relocated and will be receiving payments there going forward. Shortly after that change, my payout stopped processing.\n\nTimeline (in order):\n\n• Jan 6: I emailed Mediavine Payments asking why my payment hadn’t been processed yet and whether there was a general delay.  \n• Jan 6 (later): Mediavine Payments replied that Tipalti flagged recent changes to my Payment Profile. They explained that when payment details are changed, Tipalti’s fraud monitoring can lock the account and the details must be confirmed. They asked me to list what changes I made and why.  \n• Jan 7: I replied explaining I relocated to Dubai and added a new UAE bank account / entered new SWIFT/bank details as the new payout method.  \n• Jan 7 (later): I sent a clearer breakdown (bullet points) summarizing: new UAE bank account added, new SWIFT/bank details entered, reason = relocation and receiving payouts there going forward. I also asked if any supporting documents were needed.  \n• Jan 8: Mediavine confirmed they notified Tipalti to confirm/clear the changes and said once it’s settled they can send the payment. They mentioned payouts/resubmissions typically go out on the 15th of the month (or closest business day).  \n• Jan 12: I asked if I would still receive payment on the 15th (or closest business day). Mediavine replied they were still waiting on Tipalti, and that Tipalti seemed to be having issues with their **messaging/email system** which delayed some replies. They said as soon as Tipalti provides the all-clear, the payment will be submitted.  \n• Jan 14: I asked if a phone call could speed things up because the delay is impacting my monthly bills. Mediavine said email is still the best way and that they can’t speed it up beyond continuing to email Tipalti; they repeated they understand the urgency and are trying to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\nAs of today (Jan 20), it’s still not resolved and the payment hasn’t been submitted because Tipalti hasn’t cleared the account yet.\n\nIs a 2+ week delay for Tipalti verification after changing bank/SWIFT details normal?\n\nAny insight would help a lot, this delay is putting me in a tough spot. Thank you.",

How often?\n\n\nOne thing that helps my blog increase in search results is scheduling posts, so search engines know that I intend to maintain a posting flow and that it's not an abandoned blog.

      "text": "I’m posting because this is currently my main (and only) source of income, and I had several bills scheduled based on receiving my Mediavine payout between the 2nd–5th of the month. Because the payment has been delayed, I’m now financially tight and trying to understand what’s normal in this situation and what my options are.\n\nContext:  \nI recently updated my Mediavine payment method by switching to a new UAE bank account (Dubai) and entering my bank and SWIFT details for wire transfer, as I relocated and will be receiving payouts there going forward. Shortly after this change, my payout stopped processing.\n\nTimeline (in order):\n\n• Jan 6: I emailed Mediavine Payments asking why my payment hadn’t been processed yet and whether there was a general delay.\n\n• Jan 6 (later): Mediavine Payments replied that Tipalti flagged recent changes to my Payment Profile. They explained that when payment details are changed, Tipalti’s fraud monitoring can lock the account and the details must be confirmed. They asked me to list what changes I made and why.\n\n• Jan 7: I replied explaining that I relocated to Dubai and added a new UAE bank account, entering new bank and SWIFT details as my new payout method.\n\n• Jan 7 (later): I sent a clearer breakdown in bullet points, summarizing that a new UAE bank account was added, new SWIFT/bank details were entered, and the reason was relocation and receiving payouts there going forward. I also asked whether any supporting documents were needed.\n\n• Jan 8: Mediavine confirmed they notified Tipalti to confirm and clear the changes, and said once it’s settled they can send the payment. They also mentioned that payouts or resubmissions typically go out on the 15th of the month (or the closest business day).\n\n• Jan 12: I asked whether I would still receive payment on the 15th (or closest business day). Mediavine replied that they were still waiting on Tipalti and that Tipalti appeared to be having issues with their messaging/email system, which delayed some replies. They said that as soon as Tipalti provides the all-clear, the payment will be submitted.\n\n• Jan 14: I asked whether a phone call could help speed things up, as the delay was impacting my monthly bills. Mediavine replied that email is still the best channel and that they can’t speed things up beyond continuing to email Tipalti. They reiterated that they understand the urgency and are trying to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\n• Jan 16: I followed up noting that the 15th was a business day and asked whether my payment would be submitted immediately once Tipalti clears the hold, even if clearance comes after the 15th. I also requested the Tipalti ticket or case reference number so I could follow up directly if possible.\n\n• Jan 19: I followed up again and suggested the issue might be related to this being a wire transfer. I offered to revert to my previous payout account if that would make the process easier or faster, assuming there is no issue on Mediavine’s end.\n\n• Jan 21: I sent another follow-up stating that the payment hold has been pending since Jan 6, that I understand we’re waiting on Tipalti to confirm the changes, but that I haven’t received an update since the last email. I asked for a status update so I could plan around the timing.\n\n• Jan 23: I sent another follow-up email noting that the issue is still ongoing, reiterating the financial impact of the continued delay, and asking whether Tipalti is actively reviewing the case or if any additional information is needed from my side.\n\nAt this point, despite sending four follow-up emails to the payments department over the past ten days, I haven’t received a response. Meanwhile, the accumulated January, February, and March payments now represent a significant amount, and the continued lack of communication has started to cause real financial stress and anxiety. I understand this may still be pending Tipalti verification, but the silence makes it difficult to plan or know what to expect next.",
