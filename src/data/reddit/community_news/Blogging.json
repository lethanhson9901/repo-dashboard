      "text": "I am an old blogger but very new to this community. As I don't know if it'll count as self promotion I decided to write this one without any links or recommendations. It’s just my own experiment that I decided to share, I hope that some of you might find it useful.\n\nSo I already had one food blog and I started two new ones because my old one had reached a point where growth slowed down. At the same time, I launched three additional food blogs on WordPress, but with a completely different approach.\n\nThree blogs are written the “classic” way: topic research, manual writing, editing, internal linking – all by hand. The other three are fully automated using tools that can handle the entire process end-to-end (from topic selection to publishing), with only minimal human oversight.\n\nAfter one year, none of the six blogs is making meaningful ad revenue yet. However, viewership for both Versions skyrocketed in the beginning, 1 year later it stayed somewhat consistent in the 6-13k clicks range per month. Then something unexpected happened: One of the automated blogs (funny enough, the one with the least amount of views) got a direct sponsorship deal. It runs three banner placements of a local business who sells handforged pans and brings in €2,500 per month, fixed, independent of traffic spikes or ad networks. \n\nI am still trying out some new things and while I pretty much ran my automated ones on autopilot, I felt like there is so much potential I didn't use yet. I didn't optimize anything by hand, I didn't squeeze the potential that I see in so many things. As this is my first time posting, I am gonna see if there is interest in posting a follow up.",

So the thing is I am not that tech savy but am open minded so I tried a ton of different tools, in the end my son and I actually narrowed down the list to two tools I keep using. \n\nFirst thing is the content planning and for that I used just regular chatGPT in the beginning but I ended up with an n8n script that my son made over a weekend to scrape the web for interesting new topics. Its not perfect but it does the job honestly.\n\nSecond thing is content creation. As I use a wordpress Site, in the beginning I needed a tool to create content for me. I just used a plugin that promised to do the content creation part but it generated bad texts and also not SEO optimized. But no free tool did what I wanted so I ended up using [this automation tool](https://mypublio.com) . It automates more or less everything for wordpress but I just use it for the texts and its among the best texts I saw as a 20 year long blogger. The key factor for me was research... I want things to be properly researched, and the recipes to be genuine good ones that other have used. And unfortunately this is the only program that I found that did a proper research. \n\nIf you don't wanna spend money on automation tools I can really recommend you to just make it semi automatic by making an own chatGPT content Pipeline.",

Old content that used to be stable became volatile. What helped was shifting focus from volume to intent.\n\nI stopped relying on one traffic source and leaned into channels where content compounds instead of resets. SEO is still part of it, but I’m more selective now. Fewer posts, clearer problems, deeper answers.\n\nI’ve also leaned more into Pinterest and email. Pinterest for discovery and long-tail traffic, email for stability. Social platforms feel louder but less reliable than they used to.\n\nIncome-wise, I moved away from display ads being the main driver. Affiliates and owned products held up better because they’re tied to trust, not raw pageviews.\n\nAI didn’t kill blogging for me. It forced me to be more intentional. The blogs that survived weren’t the biggest. They were the clearest.",

      "text": "**For beginners, stuck accounts, and creators worried about bans or suspensions.**\n\n**1. Avoid Pinning the Same Pin Repeatedly**\n\nRe-pinning the same design repeatedly can look spammy. Create **new pin designs** instead (the same link is fine).\n\n**2. Follow a 7-Day Strategy**\n\nDon’t pin aggressively one day and disappear the next. Pinterest prefers **steady daily activity**.\n\n**3. Don’t Follow–Unfollow**\n\nThis is not Instagram. Follow - unfollow patterns are a huge red flag.\n\n**4. Never Make Huge Profile Changes at Once**\n\nAvoid changing your niche, bio, username, boards, and links together. Make small changes slowly.\n\n**5. Use Pinterest Actively (Like a Real Person)**\n\nExplore your feed, save ideas, create boards, and publish helpful content. Pinterest favors active creators, not link-droppers.\n\n**6. Don’t Act Like a Bot**\n\nAvoid aggressive automation tools. Manual, natural actions build long-term trust.\n\n**7. Avoid Too Many Redirections**\n\nDirect links work best. Too many redirects, cloaked links, or shorteners can hurt your account.\n\n**8. Avoid Sharing Your Pinterest Profile URL Everywhere**\n\nConstant self-promotion can look suspicious. Let growth happen **organically**.\n\n**9. Diversify Your Links**\n\nDon’t send every pin to the same page. Use blogs, different pages, lead magnets, and resources.\n\n**10. Don’t Steal Pins or Images**\n\nAlways use: Your own designs, Licensed or royalty-free images.\n\nCopied content = high ban risk.\n\n**11. Diversify Your Publishing Pin Numbers**\n\nAvoid pinning the **exact same number every day or month**. Go from **low → medium → high** gradually over time.\n\nNatural variation = safe growth.\n\n**12. Find Your Golden Publishing Number**\n\nEvery account has a sweet spot. Test different daily pin counts and track: Impressions, Saves, Clicks.\n\n**More pins ≠ More growth.**\n\n**13. Pin Engagement > Outbound Links**\n\nPinterest prioritizes engagement first.\n\nFocus on: Saves, Comments, Time spent, High engagement builds trust before pushing links.\n\n**14. Always Have a Specific Publishing Time**\n\nPinning at a consistent time helps Pinterest understand your habits. Train the algorithm to expect you.\n\n**15. Be Consistent!**\n\nPinterest success is a long game, not overnight growth. Small daily actions beat random bursts - every time.\n\n# Let’s Talk\n\nPinterest growth isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\n**Which tip do you want more clarity on?**\n\n**What’s confusing you right now?**\n\n**Any Pinterest mistakes you’ve learned from?**\n\nDrop your questions below - let’s grow safely!",

Here's what happened.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The old way (SEO-first):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Find keyword with volume\n\n\\- Check top 10 results\n\n\\- Write something similar but \"better\"\n\n\\- Stuff keywords everywhere\n\n\\- Add H2s and H3s strategically\n\n\\- Build backlinks\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The new way (human-first):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Write about things I genuinely find interesting\n\n\\- Share real experiences and specific examples\n\n\\- Say controversial things I actually believe\n\n\\- Write like I'm talking to a friend\n\n\\- Only publish when I'd actually share it myself\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What changed:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n| Metric | SEO-First | Human-First |\n\n|--------|-----------|-------------|\n\n| Avg time on page | 1:30 | 4:45 |\n\n| Bounce rate | 78% | 42% |\n\n| Social shares | \\~2 | \\~15 |\n\n| Return visitors | 8% | 31% |\n\n| Email signups | 0.5% | 3.2% |\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The irony:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe \"human-first\" posts actually started ranking BETTER in search. Why? Because:\n\n\n\n1. People stayed longer (engagement signal)\n\n2. People shared them (backlinks)\n\n3. People came back (brand recognition)\n\n4. Lower bounce rate (quality signal)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I learned:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGoogle's algorithm has gotten good at detecting genuine value vs. content created purely to rank. The gap will only widen with AI content flooding the internet.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Practical tips:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. Write your first draft as if no one will read it. Edit later.\n\n2. Include specific numbers, examples, and stories from your life.\n\n3. Have an actual opinion. Fence-sitting content doesn't get shared.\n\n4. Read your post out loud. If it sounds robotic, rewrite it.\n\n\n\nI've been using a tool I built (Crescitaly) to track which content resonates most, and the pattern is clear: authenticity wins.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for discussion:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed the shift? Are you writing differently in 2026 than you were a year ago?",

Already spending 20+ hours weekly just on content\n\nI tried tailwind for 2 weeks which helped with scheduling and has smartpin that creates designs automatically but not sure if worth continuing since havent seen much traffic yet, maybe 2 weeks isn't long enough to judge??\n\nFor bloggers what's your experience with pinterest growth lately? Still worth the time or focus elsewhere? And if using it how much time weekly are you actually spending?\n\nIm trying to figure out where to focus energy because I can't do everything and pinterest seems like it could either be amazing or total waste of time depending on who you ask",

What helped was building a separate “clean traffic” stack: Cloudflare logs + ad network reports + one privacy-focused analytics tool, then comparing all three by country and device. Once I blocked a few Chinese IP ranges and tightened WAF rules, sessions dropped hard but RPM and CTR actually went up.\n\nI’d also split reporting into 3 buckets: search, socials (Pinterest, FB), and “other / junk.” If a source sends thousands of “visits” with almost no ad impressions or scroll depth, I just treat it as bot noise and filter it. Netherlands vs Brazil RPM gaps will always be there, so I lean into high-RPM geos with content and pins.\n\nFor tracking and reacting faster, tools like Cloudflare Analytics, Fathom, and Pulse plus some basic IP blocking give a way more honest picture than GA4 alone.",

You wait for numbers that may never come, while ignoring the things that actually build a real audience.\n\nMy approach has been much more old school and user-first.\n\nI start with a very simple principle that many modern playbooks ignore: understand what the user actually wants, how they think, and how they prefer to consume content. I design my posts not for algorithms, but for how a real person would naturally read, scan, and feel while going through the article.\n\nBefore I even think about monetization, I ask myself three questions:  \nWhat problem is the reader trying to solve?  \nWhat frustration are they carrying?  \nWhat would make this page genuinely useful for them?\n\nBased on that, I structure my content so that it is easy to follow, practical, and engaging rather than just keyword-heavy.\n\nI also focus heavily on linkable assets within my blog. For example, instead of only writing a theoretical post, I try to create elements that people would actually want to reference or share, such as:  \nmicro tools  \nstructured resources  \nlists or mini-directories  \ndownloadable checklists  \nvisual frameworks  \nor data points that feel valuable beyond the article itself.\n\nThese assets naturally make the content more shareable and more credible, even when traffic is still small.\n\nAnd of course, none of this works without genuinely strong content that fully satisfies user intent. If the reader leaves feeling that their question is still half-answered, no strategy, email list, or product will compensate for that.\n\nSo in short, my model has been:  \nuser understanding first  \nreading experience second  \nlinkable value third  \nand monetization only after trust is built.\n\nI’d be very curious to hear how other solo writers are approaching this, especially those who started with zero audience and built something meaningful over time.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m posting because this is currently my main/only source of income, and I had several bills scheduled based on receiving my Mediavine payout between the 2nd–5th of the month. Because the payment is delayed, I’m now financially tight and trying to understand what’s normal and what I can do next. (Same name surname)\n\nContext: I updated my Mediavine payment method recently by switching to a new UAE bank account (Dubai) and entering my bank + SWIFT details (wire transfer), because I relocated and will be receiving payments there going forward. Shortly after that change, my payout stopped processing.\n\nTimeline (in order):\n\n• Jan 6: I emailed Mediavine Payments asking why my payment hadn’t been processed yet and whether there was a general delay.  \n• Jan 6 (later): Mediavine Payments replied that Tipalti flagged recent changes to my Payment Profile. They explained that when payment details are changed, Tipalti’s fraud monitoring can lock the account and the details must be confirmed. They asked me to list what changes I made and why.  \n• Jan 7: I replied explaining I relocated to Dubai and added a new UAE bank account / entered new SWIFT/bank details as the new payout method.  \n• Jan 7 (later): I sent a clearer breakdown (bullet points) summarizing: new UAE bank account added, new SWIFT/bank details entered, reason = relocation and receiving payouts there going forward. I also asked if any supporting documents were needed.  \n• Jan 8: Mediavine confirmed they notified Tipalti to confirm/clear the changes and said once it’s settled they can send the payment. They mentioned payouts/resubmissions typically go out on the 15th of the month (or closest business day).  \n• Jan 12: I asked if I would still receive payment on the 15th (or closest business day). Mediavine replied they were still waiting on Tipalti, and that Tipalti seemed to be having issues with their **messaging/email system** which delayed some replies. They said as soon as Tipalti provides the all-clear, the payment will be submitted.  \n• Jan 14: I asked if a phone call could speed things up because the delay is impacting my monthly bills. Mediavine said email is still the best way and that they can’t speed it up beyond continuing to email Tipalti; they repeated they understand the urgency and are trying to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\nAs of today (Jan 20), it’s still not resolved and the payment hasn’t been submitted because Tipalti hasn’t cleared the account yet.\n\nIs a 2+ week delay for Tipalti verification after changing bank/SWIFT details normal?\n\nAny insight would help a lot, this delay is putting me in a tough spot. Thank you.",
