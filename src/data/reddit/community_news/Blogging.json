Here's what actually moved the needle:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What DIDN'T work (or stopped working):\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Pinterest - Unless you're in food/DIY/fashion niches\n\n\\- Facebook groups - Algorithm changes killed reach\n\n\\- Twitter threads - Gets engagement, rarely clicks\n\n\\- Mass guest posting - Low quality = no benefit\n\n\\- Commenting on other blogs - Time sink with minimal return\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What ACTUALLY works:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*\\*1. SEO (boring but true)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nTarget low competition, high intent keywords. One well-optimized post can bring traffic for years. I have posts from 2023 still bringing 1000+ monthly visitors.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Reddit (carefully)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nGenuinely helping in relevant subreddits. Not dropping links - becoming known as helpful. People check profiles.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Updating old content\\*\\*\n\n\n\nRefreshing posts every 6-12 months. Adding new sections, updating stats, improving formatting. Google loves fresh content.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*4. Email list from day one\\*\\*\n\n\n\nEven 100 engaged subscribers > 10K social followers. They actually click and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*5. One platform, deeply\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI chose YouTube as my secondary. Every blog post becomes a video. Video ranks, drives to blog. Pick ONE and go deep.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nBlogging traffic takes 6-12 months to compound. Most people quit at month 3. Consistency beats tactics.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My current split:\\*\\*\n\n\\- 70% organic search\n\n\\- 15% direct/email\n\n\\- 10% YouTube\n\n\\- 5% social/other\n\n\n\nWhat's working for your blog right now?",

You can type it into Google and click the first result, it’s the same name I use on Pinterest.\n\nI strongly recommend avoiding bulk automation tools like BlogToPin or anything that mass-produces pins. From my experience, Pinterest is very picky. You actually need to spend time designing high-quality pins.\n\nI can’t pour my entire strategy here, but here’s what I can share:\n\n1. Write a lot of articles first.\nAim for around 150 posts before going hard on Pinterest.\n\n2. Pin consistently and do it properly.\nOne pin should link to one unique URL. Don’t publish 10 pins all pointing to the same article.\n\nI personally started with 1 pin per day. Literally. The goal is to show the algorithm you’re human. Then I moved to 2 per day, and now I’m pinning 5 per day.\n\nHaving 150 articles means I never run out of URLs to pin.\n\nThere’s a lot more to Pinterest that I can’t cover here. Board strategies, for example, but that’s the foundation.\n\nI do write about this stuff on Medium as well.",

It’s just my own experiment that I decided to share, I hope that some of you might find it useful.\n\nSo I already had one food blog and I started two new ones because my old one had reached a point where growth slowed down. At the same time, I launched three additional food blogs on WordPress, but with a completely different approach.\n\nThree blogs are written the “classic” way: topic research, manual writing, editing, internal linking – all by hand. The other three are fully automated using tools that can handle the entire process end-to-end (from topic selection to publishing), with only minimal human oversight.\n\nAfter one year, none of the six blogs is making meaningful ad revenue yet. However, viewership for both Versions skyrocketed in the beginning, 1 year later it stayed somewhat consistent in the 6-13k clicks range per month. Then something unexpected happened: One of the automated blogs (funny enough, the one with the least amount of views) got a direct sponsorship deal. It runs three banner placements of a local business who sells handforged pans and brings in €2,500 per month, fixed, independent of traffic spikes or ad networks. \n\nI am still trying out some new things and while I pretty much ran my automated ones on autopilot, I felt like there is so much potential I didn't use yet. I didn't optimize anything by hand, I didn't squeeze the potential that I see in so many things. As this is my first time posting, I am gonna see if there is interest in posting a follow up.",

So the thing is I am not that tech savy but am open minded so I tried a ton of different tools, in the end my son and I actually narrowed down the list to two tools I keep using. \n\nFirst thing is the content planning and for that I used just regular chatGPT in the beginning but I ended up with an n8n script that my son made over a weekend to scrape the web for interesting new topics. Its not perfect but it does the job honestly.\n\nSecond thing is content creation. As I use a wordpress Site, in the beginning I needed a tool to create content for me. I just used a plugin that promised to do the content creation part but it generated bad texts and also not SEO optimized. But no free tool did what I wanted so I ended up using [this automation tool](https://mypublio.com) . It automates more or less everything for wordpress but I just use it for the texts and its among the best texts I saw as a 20 year long blogger. The key factor for me was research... I want things to be properly researched, and the recipes to be genuine good ones that other have used. And unfortunately this is the only program that I found that did a proper research. \n\nIf you don't wanna spend money on automation tools I can really recommend you to just make it semi automatic by making an own chatGPT content Pipeline.",

I’ve found that if a topic can’t naturally extend into a video or short, it often doesn’t have enough depth or demand to warrant long-term effort. That simple check saves more time than people expect.\n\nBut I also want to make one point based on my experience: if the topic is relevant to your audience, it's important to cover it on your blog.\n\nThe 50/50 time split also makes sense, especially now that YouTube is monetized. Repurposing the same idea across formats has been one of the biggest leverage points — it feels like finally getting paid for thinking once instead of multiple times.\n\nAnd shifting your focus toward creating digital products feels like a natural evolution. AdSense pays for traffic, but products reward clarity and trust. Curious to see which part of this system gives you the biggest lift over the next few months. And also curious to know what process you will follow to create digital products. All the best!",

Why does it matter? How to do it (steps)? Common mistakes? Example.\n\n\\- Add depth with simple blocks: a stat, a mini case study, a checklist, a comparison, an FAQ, a short story.\n\n\\- Research fast: grab “People Also Ask” questions on Google, scan top 3 results, Reddit/Quora threads, then explain in your own words.\n\n\\- Use a repeatable structure:\n\n  \\- Hook: problem + promise\n\n  \\- Context: who this helps\n\n  \\- Steps: 3–7 clear actions\n\n  \\- Examples: 1–2 quick ones\n\n  \\- Tools/templates\n\n  \\- Pitfalls + fixes\n\n  \\- Summary + next step\n\n\n\nWordHero can help expand bullets into full sections, generate examples, FAQs, and SEO subheadings so you’re not staring at a blank page.\n\n\n\nI’ve turned 5 bullet points into a 1,500-word post in under an hour by expanding each point with the “what/why/how/example/mistake” pattern and then tightening the draft.\n\n\n\nIf you want, share your niche and 3 bullet points, I’ll show you a quick outline and first paragraph.

Commercial intent is useful, but CPC alone doesn’t guarantee a good outcome. Some high-CPC queries convert poorly because the searcher is still in comparison mode, not decision mode.\n\nWhat’s quietly doing the work here is that both strategies bias toward existing demand instead of speculative topics. That’s usually the real reason they outperform experimentation-heavy approaches.",

As you scale, you will see your income go up and risk go down. \n\nThe really amazing thing is this whole gig can be started with just a few dollars a month, mainly for hosting. \n\nEverything else can be free. \n\nHere are the tools I use:\n* Content management: Wordpress (free)\n* Hosting: Cloudways ($30/month)\n* Create content: Abacus ($10/month)\n* Automation: Make (free)\n* Video content: Openart ($7/month)\n* Design: Canva (free)\n\nIt’s really that simple and straightforward.

However since 5th January our RPM is now down to about $0.60 and it has only gone over $1 once since then, whereas our average sessions per day has remained fairly similar since beginning December. On 24th December we were still getting over $7 RPM. Normally I'd put this down to the seasonal drop. But interestingly it coincides almost exactly with Journey being reclassified, with the entry requirements dropping to 1000 sessions compared to the original 10,000, making it much easier to enter. Has Mediavine changed their RPM algorithm since their reclassification?\n\nAnyone experiencing similar?\n\nThanks.\n",

I’d post in roundup groups, ask for submissions, collect links, images, short descriptions, and publish. Honestly, I didn’t pay much attention to formal permissions because it seemed normal, no one complained, and contributors were getting dofollow links and Pinterest traffic.\n\nRecently, though, one contributor asked me to remove their article from a roundup. I did, but that triggered a bigger issue. The post had some of my top-performing pins, so I also had to remove those. Losing that traffic hurt more than I expected.\n\nNow I’m seriously rethinking how I do roundups.\n\n1. How do you gather content for roundup posts?  \n2. Do you ask for explicit permission in writing every time?  \n3. Do you avoid using images and just write summaries instead?  \n4. Have you ever faced complaints like this, even when giving full credit and links?\n\nI’d really love to hear how other food and craft bloggers are handling this now, especially if roundups are a big traffic driver for you.",

      "text": "My experience posting links to my own writing on Reddit has been consistently discouraging, and I’m trying to understand what it is I’m doing wrong, or what expectations I may have misunderstood.\n\nI’ve searched this subreddit and others, as well as advice posts and guides more generally, and the same explanations tend to come up repeatedly: avoid self-promotion, participate before linking, do not farm traffic, add value to the community. I understand those principles and agree with them. Unfortunately, they rarely come with concrete examples of what does work, especially for writers sharing long-form, non-commercial work.\n\nI completely understand why overt self-promotion is frowned upon. When people are selling products, chasing clicks, or posting low-effort content, it makes sense to moderate that aggressively. I dislike that kind of content as much as anyone else, and I do not object to moderation in principle.\n\nWhat I have struggled with is that even when I share writing I have spent a significant amount of time on, usually reflective or informational essays intended to spark discussion around my interests rather than sell anything, the posts are often removed or heavily downvoted very quickly, usually without any explanation.\n\nIn some cases, removals appear to be automated or based on a surface reading, assuming it was read at all, where the post is treated as generic promotion rather than engaged writing. When that happens, it becomes difficult to understand what standard is actually being applied, or how the content is being interpreted.\n\nPart of the difficulty for me is that I am on the autistic-spectrum, and I do not reliably pick up on unspoken rules or vague appeals to “common sense.” When guidance is implicit rather than explicit, I genuinely struggle to translate that into actionable behaviour. It’s especially frustrating when some explanations given contradict one another, and don’t allow any avenues to clarify or ask further. This is not an attempt to assign blame, but to explain why unclear or inconsistently applied expectations are especially hard for me to navigate.\n\nI am not looking for special treatment or guaranteed engagement. I am genuinely trying to understand how writers are meant to share original work on Reddit at all without it being perceived as spam by default.\n\nAll I’d like to know is:\n\n\\- Is Reddit simply a poor platform for sharing external essays, regardless of intent or quality?\n\n\\- Is it generally expected that ideas should be reposted or summarised as text-only rather than linked out (which would surely defeat the purpose of having a blog in the first place)?\n\n\\- Are there unwritten thresholds around context, participation, or framing that determine whether a post is treated as contribution versus promotion?\n\n\\- If so, how are writers supposed to learn those expectations when they are not stated clearly in rules or removal messages\n\nI would appreciate insight from people who have successfully shared original writing here, or from anyone who understands how these expectations are actually enforced in practice.",

I loved the creative mission, but I eventually realized that poetry is extremely difficult to scale online without an existing audience. Growth was slow, monetization was unclear, and my interests were expanding beyond poetry alone.\n\nSo I decided to start fresh with a new project called Merged Insight. The focus now is cultural analysis, media, technology, and how information shapes human behavior. It feels more aligned with how I think and what I want to write about long term.\n\nFrom a growth perspective, I also changed my approach. Instead of relying purely on organic discovery, I’m focusing on paid traffic and intentional backlink building from the beginning. Since I launched on January 1st, I can track everything cleanly from start to year end and really see what works.\n\nThe pivot doesn’t feel like failure, it feels like alignment.

Of course it's just me and my little ole LLC, but it's something, and I'm excited now more than ever.\n\nI can't wait to analyze growth over the years, and make decisions based on outcomes I've learned from in the past. Blogging can be very fun if you're dedicated to it.",

      "text": "Google AI overviews provide information on its search engine result pages (SERPs) for people searching for a query and pull that information from websites directly, reducing clicks that would once go to blogs.\n\nBloggers often see this as a big hurdle, and it can even be a deterrent for those wanting to start a new blog successfully.\n\nThis can be turned around, meaning less bloggers for your niche in the age of AI means less competition.\n\nIf you're thinking about starting, stick to fundamentals; choose a niche that you're passionate about and have expertise for and acquire a domain, WordPress is recommended and then spend time on finding a good WordPress theme for the layout of your blog.\n\nGoogle continues to value high quality content and gets its information from those websites with great content.\n\nWhat better way to adapt and create great content for your blog, than to use AI overviews or AI assistants as a research tool for your blog. While fact checking is required, you are only limited in finding information by how you present your queries to them.\n\nA blog can cover many aspects of a topic, whereas an AI overview on a SERP responds to a single query and to compete with the amount of information a blog can present would require people to search multiple queries.\n\nIf you craft your blog to cover a topic broadly, it will increase its topical authority and give people a reason to explore your blog directly.",
