I’m putting a lot of effort into creating quality content, but I’m still waiting for Google AdSense approval. I know blogging takes time, but sometimes I wonder if I’m heading in the right direction.\nFor those who are already monetizing —\nHow long did it take you?\nWhat did you focus on in the early stage?\nDid you just keep publishing and wait, or did you change strategies along the way?\nI’m really committed and working hard, but I’d appreciate any honest advice or perspective.\nThank you .",

You definitely do not NEED 100 posts. A lot of folks here say 30 is the number where you consider yourself a proper blogger. I only have about 2 backlinks to other average size blogs. \n\nI would say it's extremely difficult mentally. I deleted and started my blog over 3 times because of not liking my niche or the angle I was going at. Constantly posting, promoting, networking, learning, applying SEO, researching stuff just takes a toll and if you allow yourself to give up and you stop posting for a month or something, that's where you lose your progress. \n\nI've visited reddit posts that are 6 months old where people talk about their blogs with excitement and telling everybody about it. But when I click their blog, it doesn't exist anymore. They gave up. \n\nWhen I look at my competition, the websites that rank 1 to 5 on Google for my keywords, the one thing they have in common is age. Those blogs are all 6 to 12 years old on average. So no matter what monetary results you see today, try to stick with it.",

      "text": "I keep seeing posts here saying you need 15-20+ articles before applying for AdSense. Just wanted to share that I got approved with only 6.\n\nSome context: I'm a software developer from Nepal. I've had a portfolio website for about 2 years - just a simple site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No WordPress, no CMS, nothing fancy. It's hosted on GitHub Pages for free.\n\nAbout 15 days ago, I decided to start writing technical blog posts directly on my portfolio site. Wrote 6 articles in roughly 6 days. Topics like deploying Django to production, building authentication systems, that kind of stuff. Developer-focused content.\n\nAfter publishing the 6 posts, I applied for AdSense and waited.\n\nHere's what I think made the difference though - one of my articles got posted on Hacker News by someone and it blew up. That single post brought around 40k views. Some people also shared another article on LinkedIn. So by the time Google reviewed my application, the site already had solid traffic and engagement.\n\nAbout 14-15 days after applying, I got the approval email today.\n\n**What I think helped:**\n\n* Quality over quantity. 6 in-depth, well-structured posts (1000-2000+ words each) instead of 20 thin ones\n* Real traffic before applying. The Hacker News spike probably showed Google that people actually find the content valuable\n* Clean site structure. Proper meta tags, headings, fast load times. Static HTML loads faster than most WordPress sites\n* Original content. Everything was written from my own experience building projects, not rewritten from other blogs\n* The site wasn't just a blog - it was an established portfolio with projects, skills, about section. It looked like a real website, not a blog farm\n\n**What my setup looks like:**\n\n* Static HTML/CSS/JS site (no framework, no CMS)\n* Hosted on GitHub Pages (free)\n* Domain Name Free(.com.np)\n* Total cost: basically $0\n\nI'm not saying everyone will get approved with 6 posts. The traffic from Hacker News definitely played a role. But if you're debating whether to wait until you have 20+ posts - maybe focus on writing fewer, better articles and finding ways to get them in front of people instead.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the process.",

Also, often will focus on keyword research or blog design, or something to keep it fresh. \n\nI think having a plan helps too - if I make a target or writing two posts a week it’s good to have goals to meet. \n\nGood luck",

I’ve run blogs before and the compounding effect of organic search traffic is something newsletters simply can’t replicate.\nThat said, the smart move is: start with a blog, add a newsletter later as your email collection tool. Your blog brings in the traffic from Google, and your newsletter keeps those readers engaged. They work best together, but the blog should be the foundation.\nA few things that changed since you last blogged:\n\t∙\tAI tools can seriously speed up your content workflow now (research, outlines, first drafts) — you still need to edit and add your voice, but it cuts production time by 60-70%\n\t∙\tGoogle is rewarding helpful, experience-based content more than ever (E-E-A-T)\n\t∙\tMonetization options like Mediavine/Raptive are still very much alive if you hit the traffic thresholds\nNewsletters are great, but they have a ceiling without a traffic source. A blog IS the traffic source.\nWhat niche are you thinking about?",

Blogging is still worth it, but it’s slower and more RNG because SEO takes time.\n\nBest setup if you can do both without burning out: write 1 solid post per week, then send the newsletter as the short version of that post, with 1 extra insight. The blog becomes your library, the newsletter is your distribution engine [(e.g.)](https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-distribution-guide/).\n\nRule of thumb:\nIf you like evergreen how-to, searchable topics, and you’re ok waiting 6-12 months, pick blogging.\nIf you want momentum, replies, and repeat readers, pick newsletter.\n\nEither way, don’t overbuild.

With Google now showing AI-generated summaries at the top of search results and more people turning to ChatGPT for quick answers, it feels like we're in the middle of a major shift in search behavior.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has noticed changes in how users interact with search engines now compared to a year or two ago. Are people still clicking through to websites, or are they just getting their answers from the AI overview and moving on? And for those using ChatGPT regularly, are you finding yourself bypassing Google entirely for certain types of queries?\n\nI'm especially interested in hearing from anyone who's seen this reflected in their website analytics or if you've had to adjust your content strategy because of these changes. Does traditional SEO even matter as much anymore when AI is summarizing everything at the top?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives on this.",

          "text": "I think you're looking for the Holy Grail, and it won't exist.\n\nHere's why: It depends on many factors.\n\nSites like Reddit get thousands of new pages each day. A new blog, most likely won.t, but could it, yes.\n\nThe problem won't officially be the number of posts, but Google will know that 1000 posts, with zero traffic, won't be organic growth. This is the issue right here. They know it's not human generated content from viewers.\n\nNow, can a business post 100 pages a day? Sure. But they will also look to see if you \"are an active business\", vs \"Joe blogger\". In this situation, a business footprint will often include legal addressing, a valid phone number, a legal structure like an LLC, etc. Google will look at this info as authoritative, and this will help. But not likely enough.\n\nIf you are building the next Facebook or Reddit, then make sure you get users to post; that would be better. If it goes viral, and people keep dropping 100 posts a day, Google will show the love.\n\nIf you're not there yet, then there is a mix of \"quality and quantity\". This is based on factors such as the topics you write, the overall niche, and other issues.\n\nI have 5 articles on a website that are a total of about 100 pages of written content across 5 long-form topics. Those are quality contents. At no point are these articles likely to be read by people, because It took forever to write them, let alone reading. and the topics are dry, academic, and mostly for documentation.\n\nThen the site also gets regular article-type posts that cover a more normal bite sides, 800-1500 words per article. These are specifically meant to be read by \"the average attention deficit, dopamine-starved reader\".\n\nNow, depending on the goal, this matters. Google sees my site. sure. But Google seeing it and traffic are different issues. Building authority is harder, takes more time, and requires more stringent controls. If you want virality, you could just post potentially clickbait or hyperbolic content and get clicks. So, intent and long-term goals determine your content plan as well.",

We're not trying to conveny long-winded rhetorical arguments on a tech piece. We aren't shooting for descriptive scenery that has to be spread out over a full page. \n\nHumans can quite easily write like AI, but it is harder for AI to write like \"what we are capable of\". This is because most humans have a level of \"writing sprawl\". We tend to drift off from time to time and include a run on sentece, or an out-of-place structure, or strange vernacular that most AI won't do \"by accident\". \n\nHope this helps.",

They're especially bad with short text and non-native writing, false positives can hit 20% or higher .\n\nThat's exactly why I started using Rephrasy ai. You run your drafts through it before posting anywhere, and it rewrites everything to sound human. It has a built-in checker that shows you the score, so you know for sure it won't get flagged. I've tested the output against multiple detectors and it passes every time. For your Mediavine concern, that's been my go-to.

Editing the robots.txt file to prevent an AI from scrape your site\n2. Preparing your site TO be scraped, so that you can encourage more traffic to your site.\n\nGiven my tech topics I discuss a lot, and PKM etc. I actually get some really relevant leads from chatbots because I ranked high enough in those topics.

          "text": "You're thinking about this the right way by separating the two goals--they're completely different strategies.\n\nBlocking scraping is a control decision. Preparing to be scraped is a visibility decision.  Some people mix them. I go the visibility route with the 2 blogs I have (one long-established, the other brand new).\n\nIf you're in the growth focused camp, I would think less about “AI optimization” and more about “canonical clarity.”\n\nAI systems tend to surface pages that:\n\n* Clearly define a concept\n* Use direct, unambiguous language\n* Structure ideas in logical sections\n* Answer the core question early\n* Avoid fluff or rhetorical detours\n\nIn other words, they favor pages that read like reference explanations rather than personality-driven essays.\n\nHere are a few practical things that have worked well for my long-running site:\n\n1. Put the definition up front - If the article answers “What is X?” then define X in the first few paragraphs in plain language.\n\n2. Use clean structural hierarchy - H2s and H3s that are concept based, not clever. Think “Causes,” “How It Works,” “Common Mistakes,” “What To Try.”\n\n3. Remove ambiguity - AI systems struggle with implied context. Replace “this” and “that” with explicit nouns. Shorter subject verb object sentences help.\n\n4. Create calibration pages - Instead of chasing trends, build foundational explanations that other articles internally link to. These become anchor references.\n\n5. Reinforce topical depth - If you have 900 posts, look for clusters where you can tighten internal linking around core concepts. AI retrieval systems seem to reward consistency and reinforcement.\n\nOn the blocking side, robots.txt alone does not guarantee much anymore. Some models respect it, some don't. Blocking can reduce exposure but also reduces the chance of being cited.\n\nSo the real question is strategic: are you trying to prevent your content from training models or are you trying to become the explanation models quote?\n\nThose are different long term bets.\n\nPersonally, for mature sites with deep archives, I would focus on becoming the cleanest explanation in your niche. The more your content reads like a durable reference instead of a reaction to the algorithm of the month, the more likely it is to surface in AI driven contexts.\n\n[Yes, ChatGPT helped me write that reply, but it wasn't just copy/paste.  I figured why not get the opinion \"straight from the horse's mouth\" as it were....]\n\nI started going \"all in\" late last year.  My GSC stats for the long-established site went from about 80K impressions/day in Dec. '25 to 270K impressions/day last I looked a few days ago.  The new site is still \"finding its legs\" so there's not enough data yet.\n\nCurious what niche you are in. That can change the calculus quite a bit.",

      "text": "I'll start with the embarrassing part. Eight years ago I started an ecommerce store selling print on demand maps. Posters, that kind of thing. I thought if I built it, people would come. They didn't. I worked really hard on it for a long time before I finally had to face the fact that it was costing me more than I was making. Shutting it down was genuinely difficult. Sunk cost is a real psychological trap and I fell right into it.\n\nTo drive traffic to the store I started a podcast, purely as a content strategy. I work in a pretty niche industry and there was nothing else like it out there, so I figured the transcripts alone would be good for SEO. The podcast ended up being more successful than the store ever was. So I shut the store down and leaned into the podcast instead.\n\nFor a few years I was also paying writers to produce articles for the site. Informational stuff, how-tos, that kind of content. It worked for a while. Then AI arrived and basically ate that whole category of content overnight. Watching that happen while sitting on a bunch of sunk costs in articles I'd paid for was not fun.\n\nRather than keep doubling down on something that wasn't working anymore, I made a call to stop writing articles entirely and start building interactive tools instead. In my case, web based map applications. The logic was that people engage with interactive tools in a way they just don't with written content. They share them, they link to them, and they keep coming back.\n\nThe first few were duds. I made a lot of mistakes. But I kept at it, got more systematic about keyword research, and started going after very specific terms rather than chasing volume. One of the biggest things I learned was that if you actually want to make money from programmatic advertising, the keywords that matter are not necessarily the ones with the most traffic. They're the ones where advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach that audience. Some of my lower traffic pages make significantly more money than my higher traffic ones because of this.\n\nOnce I committed to producing these tools consistently and stopped second guessing myself, the analytics started moving in the right direction. Traffic up, ad revenue up.\n\nThen something unexpected started happening. People who were trying to rank for the same keywords started reaching out to me. Some of them just wanted to buy the map outright. Others asked if I could build something similar for their own site. I hadn't planned for any of that, it just came from ranking well for specific terms. So now alongside the ad revenue, I also do this as a service for other website owners, building these kinds of tools for them. It's become a genuine part time income stream on top of everything else, and every client has come inbound, from the work already being visible online.\n\nA few things I really wish I'd figured out earlier:\n\nMove faster. Identify what isn't working and drop it. I held on to things way too long out of a sense of obligation to the time I'd already put in.\n\nGive yourself a budget and actually use it. I was so cautious about spending money early on that I slowed myself down. Being willing to invest, whether that's in tools, in help, in experiments, speeds up the whole process of figuring out what works.\n\nOn the technical side, with AI you honestly don't need to be a developer to build things like this anymore. The unfair advantage I have is knowing where the good data lives and understanding enough about the tools to know what to ask for. That's the part that takes time to learn but it's learnable.\n\nThe plan now is to keep building, and when something gets real traction, spin it off into its own small product rather than just leaving it sitting on the site earning ad revenue. Redirect the URL, build something simple around it, see if it converts.\n\nIt's been a weird, winding road. But the thing I keep coming back to is that the moments that felt like failures at the time, shutting down the store, walking away from the content strategy I'd invested in, were the ones that actually pushed me somewhere better.",

These are pages with /ideas/ in the url. Sometimes they are listed as interests pages. Try to find one when you are not logged in.\n\nThe issue is you cannot search for them. You can try Google with 'site:pinterest.com ideas keyword'\n\nHere is the thing. All 11-12 mio of these interest pages are included in their sitemap as URLs. So you can download them and put them into a database for search. \n\nFor getting search volumens into the database you most then read the HTML and take the search volumes. (Scrape). Than you can search and sort.\n\nI think there is a commercial tool for this (not mine).\n\nFrom my experience. All topics that jump into your face when you are not logged in are hot: nails, beauty, fashion, tattoo, recipes, diy, hello kitty get the highest traffic. Nails is highest with about 40mio searches a month. The shorter the keyword the more volume. But i also look for the number of keywords that include a short keywords. This is an indication how broad a topic is on Pinterest.\n\nAnother good way to find new keywords is to look at your pins when not logged in. Pinterest annotates pins after 2-3 weeks with additional keywords. If you click on them you get to the magic ideas pages with search volumes i was talking about . These annotations are the bridge from your pins to interests of people. I.e. if someone searches chicken recipes and you do chicken recipes, Pinterest knows it can show a pin from you.\n\n\nLook at your good pins when not logged in, you may discover a keyword that was assigned by Pinterest. But also if people engage or just stop scrolling with your pin visible it may signal something to Pinterests algo.\n\nJust keep going!",

          "text": "We didn’t really pause publishing to restructure, because we try not to let publishing outrun structure in the first place. We think about the site more like a library than a timeline. Posts are written to fit a role, either as a foundational piece or as supporting content, and internal links are applied consistently as part of that structure rather than added ad-hoc over time.\n\nPruning and merging absolutely helps, especially when older posts overlap or no longer serve a clear purpose. But in our experience, it’s not a silver bullet. Some older posts that look expendable may still be contributing topical context that helps define the subject as a whole. The bigger gains usually come from clarity, having a clear hierarchy so both readers and search engines know what actually matters.\n\nI don’t think structure naturally resolves itself as authority grows. If anything, authority just amplifies whatever structure is already there, good or bad. Publishing more without that backbone tends to increase confusion instead of fixing it.",

      "text": "**UPDATE 2 (2/19):** I've been in touch with John directly, and the Ghost team is actively working on solutions for this right now. Really great to see how quickly they've moved on this once it was brought to their attention. Hopefully, this means better restore options and clearer backup policies for all Ghost(Pro) customers going forward.\n\n**UPDATE 1 (2/19):** Roughly 48 hours after my initial support request, John O'Nolan, the founder of Ghost, personally stepped in and restored my site. Credit where it's due, I'm grateful he made it right.\n\n\\--------------\n\nI want to save someone else from the nightmare I just went through.\n\nIf you're running a Ghost(Pro) site and assuming your data is protected because of their \"automatic backups\" messaging, think again. **Ghost(Pro) cannot and will not restore your site.**\n\n**What happened:**\n\nYesterday, a script interacting with the Ghost Admin API accidentally bulk-updated a large number of posts incorrectly. It was an honest mistake — anyone working with APIs knows these things can happen. The moment I realized what occurred, I immediately contacted Ghost support to request a restore.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours to get a response. And when it finally came? This:\n\n>\n\nThat's it. No restore. No rollback. Nothing.\n\n**The misleading marketing:**\n\nHere's the part that really stings. Ghost has a help article titled \"Does Ghost automatically back up my data?\" that opens with:\n\n>\n\nSounds reassuring, right? But buried further down the page, they clarify that site archives are \"not provided for service continuity and are not provided as backups.\" They only provide archives if you're closing your site, migrating away, or setting up a staging environment.\n\nRead that again: **the backups they advertise are not actually backups.** They won't use them to restore your site under any circumstances. So what exactly are they backing up, and for whose benefit?\n\n**The takeaway:**\n\nIf you're on Ghost(Pro), you are on your own when it comes to disaster recovery. There is no safety net. If something goes wrong — whether it's a bad API call, a botched integration, or anything else — Ghost support will not restore your data, even though they market the platform as having \"automatic backups.\"\n\n**What you should do right now if you're on Ghost(Pro):**\n\n1. Set up your own automated backups using the Content API and Admin API\n2. Export your content regularly from Ghost Admin and store it somewhere safe\n3. Back up your images and media separately — the standard JSON export doesn't include them\n4. Do NOT assume \"we've got you covered\" means what you think it means\n\nI'm sharing this so nobody else gets blindsided. If you're evaluating Ghost(Pro) vs self-hosting, factor in that \"managed\" doesn't mean \"protected\" here. You're paying premium prices for hosting with no meaningful disaster recovery.\n\nHas anyone else run into this?",

Just a backup that’s a little too old to feel safe.\n\nA lot of people assume managed hosting means rollback for everything. It usually just covers hardware or major outages. If an API call makes a change and the system thinks it was legit, there’s nothing to “fix.” It did what it was told.\n\nBulk scripts are basically production access with no seatbelt. Versioned exports stop being optional at that point.\n\nDoes this change how you’ll handle API pushes going forward? Maybe staging first before touching live?",

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout.
