I’m putting a lot of effort into creating quality content, but I’m still waiting for Google AdSense approval. I know blogging takes time, but sometimes I wonder if I’m heading in the right direction.\nFor those who are already monetizing —\nHow long did it take you?\nWhat did you focus on in the early stage?\nDid you just keep publishing and wait, or did you change strategies along the way?\nI’m really committed and working hard, but I’d appreciate any honest advice or perspective.\nThank you .",

You definitely do not NEED 100 posts. A lot of folks here say 30 is the number where you consider yourself a proper blogger. I only have about 2 backlinks to other average size blogs. \n\nI would say it's extremely difficult mentally. I deleted and started my blog over 3 times because of not liking my niche or the angle I was going at. Constantly posting, promoting, networking, learning, applying SEO, researching stuff just takes a toll and if you allow yourself to give up and you stop posting for a month or something, that's where you lose your progress. \n\nI've visited reddit posts that are 6 months old where people talk about their blogs with excitement and telling everybody about it. But when I click their blog, it doesn't exist anymore. They gave up. \n\nWhen I look at my competition, the websites that rank 1 to 5 on Google for my keywords, the one thing they have in common is age. Those blogs are all 6 to 12 years old on average. So no matter what monetary results you see today, try to stick with it.",

Also pinterest has a good way of dropping your ass out of the algorithm and shadowbaning you when you're doing good.

      "text": "I keep seeing posts here saying you need 15-20+ articles before applying for AdSense. Just wanted to share that I got approved with only 6.\n\nSome context: I'm a software developer from Nepal. I've had a portfolio website for about 2 years - just a simple site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No WordPress, no CMS, nothing fancy. It's hosted on GitHub Pages for free.\n\nAbout 15 days ago, I decided to start writing technical blog posts directly on my portfolio site. Wrote 6 articles in roughly 6 days. Topics like deploying Django to production, building authentication systems, that kind of stuff. Developer-focused content.\n\nAfter publishing the 6 posts, I applied for AdSense and waited.\n\nHere's what I think made the difference though - one of my articles got posted on Hacker News by someone and it blew up. That single post brought around 40k views. Some people also shared another article on LinkedIn. So by the time Google reviewed my application, the site already had solid traffic and engagement.\n\nAbout 14-15 days after applying, I got the approval email today.\n\n**What I think helped:**\n\n* Quality over quantity. 6 in-depth, well-structured posts (1000-2000+ words each) instead of 20 thin ones\n* Real traffic before applying. The Hacker News spike probably showed Google that people actually find the content valuable\n* Clean site structure. Proper meta tags, headings, fast load times. Static HTML loads faster than most WordPress sites\n* Original content. Everything was written from my own experience building projects, not rewritten from other blogs\n* The site wasn't just a blog - it was an established portfolio with projects, skills, about section. It looked like a real website, not a blog farm\n\n**What my setup looks like:**\n\n* Static HTML/CSS/JS site (no framework, no CMS)\n* Hosted on GitHub Pages (free)\n* Domain Name Free(.com.np)\n* Total cost: basically $0\n\nI'm not saying everyone will get approved with 6 posts. The traffic from Hacker News definitely played a role. But if you're debating whether to wait until you have 20+ posts - maybe focus on writing fewer, better articles and finding ways to get them in front of people instead.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the process.",

However, every blogger will go through a phase when nothing works.\n\nWorking on a blog without worrying about page views is the biggest luxury.\n\nTo achieve that, you need to have a primary source of income, whether it is a job or a business.\n\nBlogging takes time to see results, so during that phase, you can focus on your blog without worrying about outcomes.\n\nMost importantly, when you work on your blog, use proven strategies. \n\nIt can be content strategy, keyword strategy, backlinks, or social media. Whatever strategy you follow, learn it from someone who has already done it and whose style matches yours.\n\nI learned blogging from Income School, where I mainly focused on content.\n\nSo, do blogging with proven strategies.

That adds up to around 900 to 1200 visitors a month which is good for a new site. I believe the key is whether your traffic is growing each month and if it is relevant. I suggest checking which keywords bring traffic and if they are low competition then using tools like LowFruits to find easier keywords to rank for. I also focus on making sure articles have clear titles, proper headings and strong internal links. Posting daily is helpful but quality and smart keyword targeting matter more than volume. If your traffic is slowly increasing, you are on the right track and by refining your keyword strategy and updating older posts, you should see steady growth over time.",

          "text": "First, how do you measure your website traffic? With 8k monthly traffic and 60% of it from tier 1 countries, you’ve got a solid foundation for monetization. Since you’re waiting on Mediavine, here are a few other ad networks that could be a good fit for smaller publishers like you:\n\n* Adsense - While AdSense can be a good starting point, the eCPM (earnings per 1,000 impressions) might be lower compared to other premium networks.\n* AdThrive - Similar to Mediavine, they accept publishers with 8k+ traffic but often prioritize sites with good content and high-quality traffic. If you’re denied by Mediavine, AdThrive could be a good alternative.\n* Ezoic - Great for small to medium-sized publishers. Ezoic uses AI to optimize ad placements and can be more flexible with traffic requirements.\n* Monumetric - They have a relatively low traffic threshold (usually around 10k) and offer a more personalized service, which could be helpful for a tech blog.\n* Sovrn // Commerce - If you’re open to affiliate ads alongside display ads, Sovrn offers a good combination for smaller sites.\n* Media .net - A solid choice for contextual ads, especially for sites with content targeted to an audience in tier 1 countries.\n* PropellerAds - They accept smaller traffic volumes and are known for display ads, pop-unders, and native ads.\n* Adversal - They accept publishers with smaller traffic volumes and could provide a good balance of display ads.\n\nKeep in mind, you might also want to experiment with affiliate marketing (like Amazon Associates or Impact Radius) to supplement your income if ad networks are slow to take off.",

      "text": "I'll start with the embarrassing part. Eight years ago I started an ecommerce store selling print on demand maps. Posters, that kind of thing. I thought if I built it, people would come. They didn't. I worked really hard on it for a long time before I finally had to face the fact that it was costing me more than I was making. Shutting it down was genuinely difficult. Sunk cost is a real psychological trap and I fell right into it.\n\nTo drive traffic to the store I started a podcast, purely as a content strategy. I work in a pretty niche industry and there was nothing else like it out there, so I figured the transcripts alone would be good for SEO. The podcast ended up being more successful than the store ever was. So I shut the store down and leaned into the podcast instead.\n\nFor a few years I was also paying writers to produce articles for the site. Informational stuff, how-tos, that kind of content. It worked for a while. Then AI arrived and basically ate that whole category of content overnight. Watching that happen while sitting on a bunch of sunk costs in articles I'd paid for was not fun.\n\nRather than keep doubling down on something that wasn't working anymore, I made a call to stop writing articles entirely and start building interactive tools instead. In my case, web based map applications. The logic was that people engage with interactive tools in a way they just don't with written content. They share them, they link to them, and they keep coming back.\n\nThe first few were duds. I made a lot of mistakes. But I kept at it, got more systematic about keyword research, and started going after very specific terms rather than chasing volume. One of the biggest things I learned was that if you actually want to make money from programmatic advertising, the keywords that matter are not necessarily the ones with the most traffic. They're the ones where advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach that audience. Some of my lower traffic pages make significantly more money than my higher traffic ones because of this.\n\nOnce I committed to producing these tools consistently and stopped second guessing myself, the analytics started moving in the right direction. Traffic up, ad revenue up.\n\nThen something unexpected started happening. People who were trying to rank for the same keywords started reaching out to me. Some of them just wanted to buy the map outright. Others asked if I could build something similar for their own site. I hadn't planned for any of that, it just came from ranking well for specific terms. So now alongside the ad revenue, I also do this as a service for other website owners, building these kinds of tools for them. It's become a genuine part time income stream on top of everything else, and every client has come inbound, from the work already being visible online.\n\nA few things I really wish I'd figured out earlier:\n\nMove faster. Identify what isn't working and drop it. I held on to things way too long out of a sense of obligation to the time I'd already put in.\n\nGive yourself a budget and actually use it. I was so cautious about spending money early on that I slowed myself down. Being willing to invest, whether that's in tools, in help, in experiments, speeds up the whole process of figuring out what works.\n\nOn the technical side, with AI you honestly don't need to be a developer to build things like this anymore. The unfair advantage I have is knowing where the good data lives and understanding enough about the tools to know what to ask for. That's the part that takes time to learn but it's learnable.\n\nThe plan now is to keep building, and when something gets real traction, spin it off into its own small product rather than just leaving it sitting on the site earning ad revenue. Redirect the URL, build something simple around it, see if it converts.\n\nIt's been a weird, winding road. But the thing I keep coming back to is that the moments that felt like failures at the time, shutting down the store, walking away from the content strategy I'd invested in, were the ones that actually pushed me somewhere better.",

I wish I could say it's all due to my hard work, but I have only handful of quality posts and the topic I write on has become seemingly popular overnight. I've written about my blog before--it's basically on a celebrity and there's only 2 active blogs (including mine) dedicated solely to this celebrity. My traffic has gone from 15-20 per day to 400-600 over night. I don't want to miss my chance to capitalize on this!\n\nHere's my plan but I'd love to hear some real tips:\n\n\\- Immediately stop all my other side hustles and bring them down to a minimum and treat this blog like a full-time job. I do have what I'd call passive income-adjacent income. More or less, I can scale my main business down and still make money for less work because of the work I've already put in.\n\n\\- Build a guide off of an old post and capture more emails. I currently have about 30 emails captured.\n\n\\- Focus on building my blog and YouTube channel up to reach monetization ASAP\n\n\\- Immediately begin posting at least once a day\n\n\\- Push to get to 50k sessions in 30 days so I can potentially qualify for a network like mediavine. Currently, I am in no networks for this blog.\n\nWhat else would you do? I don't want to divide my attention too much. My Instagram and Pinterest are also growing, but I have problems when I try to do too much all at once.",

          "text": "I had the same frustration. Most people just use autosuggest terms from the search bar. \n\nIf you want to be more fancy. Pinterest has search volumens on idea pages. These are pages with /ideas/ in the url. Sometimes they are listed as interests pages. Try to find one when you are not logged in.\n\nThe issue is you cannot search for them. You can try Google with 'site:pinterest.com ideas keyword'\n\nHere is the thing. All 11-12 mio of these interest pages are included in their sitemap as URLs. So you can download them and put them into a database for search. \n\nFor getting search volumens into the database you most then read the HTML and take the search volumes. (Scrape). Than you can search and sort.\n\nI think there is a commercial tool for this (not mine).\n\nFrom my experience. All topics that jump into your face when you are not logged in are hot: nails, beauty, fashion, tattoo, recipes, diy, hello kitty get the highest traffic. Nails is highest with about 40mio searches a month. The shorter the keyword the more volume. But i also look for the number of keywords that include a short keywords. This is an indication how broad a topic is on Pinterest.\n\nAnother good way to find new keywords is to look at your pins when not logged in. Pinterest annotates pins after 2-3 weeks with additional keywords. If you click on them you get to the magic ideas pages with search volumes i was talking about . These annotations are the bridge from your pins to interests of people. I.e. if someone searches chicken recipes and you do chicken recipes, Pinterest knows it can show a pin from you.\n\n\nLook at your good pins when not logged in, you may discover a keyword that was assigned by Pinterest. But also if people engage or just stop scrolling with your pin visible it may signal something to Pinterests algo.\n\nJust keep going!",

We think about the site more like a library than a timeline. Posts are written to fit a role, either as a foundational piece or as supporting content, and internal links are applied consistently as part of that structure rather than added ad-hoc over time.\n\nPruning and merging absolutely helps, especially when older posts overlap or no longer serve a clear purpose. But in our experience, it’s not a silver bullet. Some older posts that look expendable may still be contributing topical context that helps define the subject as a whole. The bigger gains usually come from clarity, having a clear hierarchy so both readers and search engines know what actually matters.\n\nI don’t think structure naturally resolves itself as authority grows. If anything, authority just amplifies whatever structure is already there, good or bad. Publishing more without that backbone tends to increase confusion instead of fixing it.",

      "text": "**UPDATE 2 (2/19):** I've been in touch with John directly, and the Ghost team is actively working on solutions for this right now. Really great to see how quickly they've moved on this once it was brought to their attention. Hopefully, this means better restore options and clearer backup policies for all Ghost(Pro) customers going forward.\n\n**UPDATE 1 (2/19):** Roughly 48 hours after my initial support request, John O'Nolan, the founder of Ghost, personally stepped in and restored my site. Credit where it's due, I'm grateful he made it right.\n\n\\--------------\n\nI want to save someone else from the nightmare I just went through.\n\nIf you're running a Ghost(Pro) site and assuming your data is protected because of their \"automatic backups\" messaging, think again. **Ghost(Pro) cannot and will not restore your site.**\n\n**What happened:**\n\nYesterday, a script interacting with the Ghost Admin API accidentally bulk-updated a large number of posts incorrectly. It was an honest mistake — anyone working with APIs knows these things can happen. The moment I realized what occurred, I immediately contacted Ghost support to request a restore.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours to get a response. And when it finally came? This:\n\n>\n\nThat's it. No restore. No rollback. Nothing.\n\n**The misleading marketing:**\n\nHere's the part that really stings. Ghost has a help article titled \"Does Ghost automatically back up my data?\" that opens with:\n\n>\n\nSounds reassuring, right? But buried further down the page, they clarify that site archives are \"not provided for service continuity and are not provided as backups.\" They only provide archives if you're closing your site, migrating away, or setting up a staging environment.\n\nRead that again: **the backups they advertise are not actually backups.** They won't use them to restore your site under any circumstances. So what exactly are they backing up, and for whose benefit?\n\n**The takeaway:**\n\nIf you're on Ghost(Pro), you are on your own when it comes to disaster recovery. There is no safety net. If something goes wrong — whether it's a bad API call, a botched integration, or anything else — Ghost support will not restore your data, even though they market the platform as having \"automatic backups.\"\n\n**What you should do right now if you're on Ghost(Pro):**\n\n1. Set up your own automated backups using the Content API and Admin API\n2. Export your content regularly from Ghost Admin and store it somewhere safe\n3. Back up your images and media separately — the standard JSON export doesn't include them\n4. Do NOT assume \"we've got you covered\" means what you think it means\n\nI'm sharing this so nobody else gets blindsided. If you're evaluating Ghost(Pro) vs self-hosting, factor in that \"managed\" doesn't mean \"protected\" here. You're paying premium prices for hosting with no meaningful disaster recovery.\n\nHas anyone else run into this?",

Turned out most of my drop off was from in-app browsers.\n\nWhen people click ads on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok they land in those app browsers and those things are terrible for checkout. No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, and way slower.\n\nMy conversion was 1.2% in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nFix was routing people to their real browser before checkout. Saw 15% revenue lift from same ad spend.\n\nCheck your analytics for conversion by browser. If Instagram or Facebook is way lower than Safari that's your leak.\n\nhttps://tryhoox.com handles the redirect automatically if you want to test it",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m trying to figure out something really confusing happening with Pinterest and I’m wondering if others have seen the same thing.\n\nPinterest recently started blocking links on many of my older pins, especially ones that used to perform very well and drive consistent traffic.\n\nWhat’s strange is:\n\nNew pins with the same domain work normally\n\nMy account and boards are fine\n\nDomain is verified\n\nContent is original (no affiliate links, no redirects, no shorteners)\n\nThe affected pins were active for months or even years before this happened\n\nBasically, older pins that previously ranked and brought traffic suddenly have blocked URLs or stopped sending clicks, while newly published pins linking to the exact same site are not affected.\n\nSo it doesn’t look like a domain ban or account penalty.\n\nThings I already tried:\n\nappealing through Pinterest support\n\nchecking URLs and page health\n\nupdating descriptions/images\n\nreducing pinning frequency\n\nSupport replies didn’t explain anything specific.\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is:\n\nsome kind of re-evaluation of older pins\n\nan algorithm cleanup targeting legacy content\n\nor a trust reset on older outbound links\n\nHas anyone recovered traffic on old pins after this?\n\nDid editing or recreating pins help, or is it better to just remake them completely?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences because this feels very random right now.\n\nThanks!",

If the original pins lost saves or CTR over time, it might trigger a reclassification even if the domain is fine. Have you checked whether the affected pins had declining engagement before they were blocked?",
