Fast site, clean design, technical SEO, writing in a way I think people would like etc. I haven’t even thought about backlinks yet until I’m happy with the foundation being solid. \n\nFor example, most sites on this sub are using uncompressed PNG images when you can convert to WEBP and AVIF for 80 - 90% reduction with no quality loss. If someone has a several images that are larger than 1mb, that’s going to massively slow the site on load and people will close the site. Convert those, priority high the above the fold and lazy load the rest and suddenly you’ve got a 5mb load turning into 80kb. \n\nThat’s just one of many examples I’ve seen.",

Right now I’m averaging around position 21 with a CTR of 1.6%.  But the volume is a lot smaller given that I’m just over 30 days old. \n\nYeah agree on the smaller search engines, I’ve been holding rank 1 on 200 search terms and then 2 to 5 on another 250 years. 12% CTR from Bing alone (13k impressions). I have the same amount of traffic from DuckDuckGo too. \n\nEngagement on the site has been good (35% bounce rate and an average duration of 13 minutes) so hopefully when Google kicks in, I’ll have the numbers to back it to have the higher rank.

If I just wrote better, more often, or longer posts, people would finally start reading.\n\nWhat actually happened was this:\n\nI’d write something I felt good about, hit publish, share it once, and then basically move on. Days later I’d check analytics and feel like it never even existed.\n\nA few months in I realized what so many here have probably experienced: **publishing regularly doesn’t guarantee anyone will see what you wrote.**\n\nMost of us treat publishing as the finish line. In fact, it’s the point at which the *real work* begins: getting that content in front of people.\n\nAfter that realization, I started thinking about:\n\n* breaking my posts into smaller takeaways\n* creating multiple entry points for the same idea\n* intentionally planning *where* and *how* each post gets a second life\n\nOne practical support I sometimes use to sketch different ways a post can show up elsewhere is a tool called WaveGen. It helps draft carousels, quote cards with alternate captions so I’m not re-creating everything from scratch. But that’s just convenience; the real shift was changing how I think about what happens *after* publish.\n\nDo you actively reuse, or do you find it mostly feels like “write → publish → hope for traffic”?",

Otherwise, it just disappears into the void.\n\nI don’t think tools fix this mindset, but they can remove friction. I use **Indzu Social** mainly to map out reuse paths, so I don’t have to start from zero every time. The real work is still thinking about **audience + context,** not writing more.\n\nCurious how others here decide *where* to resurface old posts or if most of us are still stuck in publish → hope mode.",

      "text": "Most websites fail at marketing before they even launch.\nNo SEO foundation.\nZero blogs.\nCrappy URLs.\nMinimal keyword coverage.\n\nHere’s how to launch a marketing-ready site that drives leads from DAY 1.\n\nStep 1: Domain & Hosting\n\n· Short, brandable OR keyword-matched domain\n· SSL installed (HTTPS)\n· 99%+ uptime hosting\n· CDN configured\n\nStep 2: URL Architecture\n\n· Plan BEFORE you build\n· Flat structure (2–3 clicks from homepage)\n· Short, descriptive URLs with hyphens\n· No dates, parameters, or uppercase\n  Good: /services/seo-audit/\n  Bad: /services/index.php?id=4\n\nStep 3: Service Page Structure\nHomepage = 1 primary keyword\nService pages = all the rest.\nExample: Law firm in Houston\nHomepage: \"personal injury lawyer Houston\"\nService pages:\n/services/car-accident-lawyer-houston/\n/services/motorcycle-accident-lawyer-houston/\netc.\nEach page = 1 keyword. 1,000–2,000 words.\nUnique content per service. Clear CTA.\n\nStep 4: Location Page Architecture (if multi-location)\nHub page: /locations/\nCity pages: /locations/dallas-personal-injury/\nNest services: /locations/dallas/car-accident/\nUnique content per city—local stats, laws, testimonials.\nNo copy-paste + find/replace. Google penalizes that.\n\nStep 5: Google Search Console\nSet up Day 1. Verify. Submit XML sitemap.\nCheck crawl errors. Enable email alerts.\n\nStep 6: Google Analytics 4\nGA4 property + tracking code on all pages.\nSet up goals/conversions.\n\"If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.\"\n\nStep 7: Technical Foundation\n\n· robots.txt (correctly configured)\n· Auto-updating XML sitemap\n· Custom 404 page\n· Canonical tags on every page\n· No accidental noindex tags (#1 launch killer)\n· Schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ)\n\nStep 8: Site Speed\n\n· Images compressed + WebP\n· Lazy loading enabled\n· CSS/JS minified\n· Load under 3 seconds\n· Core Web Vitals passing\n\nStep 9: Mobile\n\n· Responsive design\n· Touch targets ≥48px\n· No horizontal scrolling\n· Test on REAL devices\n\n60% of searches are on mobile.\n\nStep 10: Core Pages at Launch\nHomepage\nAbout page\nContact page\nService pages (1k+ words each)\nLocation pages (if applicable)\nPrivacy Policy + Terms\nDon’t “add later.”\n\nStep 11: Blog Setup\n\n· /blog/ subfolder (NOT subdomain)\n· Categories mirror services\n· Author pages with real bios\n· 5–10 posts ready at launch\n· 3-month content calendar ready\n\nStep 12: Internal Linking\nThe circulatory system of your site.\nLink:\nHomepage → service/location pages\nLocation hub → city pages\nCity pages → nested service pages\nBlog posts → relevant service pages\nNo orphan pages.\nFooter links to key pages.\n\nStep 13: External Link Foundation\n\n· Google Business Profile (if local)\n· Social profiles created\n· List of 50+ link prospects\n· Documented link-building strategy\n  No “we’ll figure it out later.”\n\nStep 14: Pre-Launch Checks\n\n· No placeholder text\n· All links work\n· Forms function\n· Mobile tested\n· Speed test passed\n· robots.txt allows crawling\n· NO leftover noindex tags\n\nStep 15: Launch Day\n\n· Submit sitemap to GSC\n· Request indexing for top 10–15 pages\n· Share on social\n· Check GSC next day for errors\n  Don’t overthink it.\n\nStep 16: First Month Post-Launch\nMost drop the ball here.\n\n· Publish content weekly\n· Build 5–10 backlinks\n· Monitor rankings & indexing\n· Internal link from new content\n· Launch Google Ads (ad sets per service)\n  First 30 days set the trajectory.\n\nCommon Launch Mistakes:\n\n1. Dev noindex still on\n2. No SSL in 2026\n3. No analytics\n4. Empty “coming soon” blog\n5. Thin service pages (100 words)\n6. Copy-paste location pages\n7. Waiting months for link building\n\nAvoid these and you’re ahead of 90% of new sites.\n\nMost competitors skip half this list.\nThat’s your advantage.\n\nNow go launch something.",

          "text": "Totally normal situation tbh. 7 months feels like a long time when you’re posting consistently, but in “Google time” it’s basically still early days, especially for lifestyle blogs where the niche is super crowded.\n\nAbout Adsense, it’s not *wrong* to use it. People over-dramatize this. The real issue is: if your traffic is low, Adsense will earn you basically nothing and it can make your site feel cluttered/cheap if you plaster ads everywhere. But a couple of well-placed ads won’t destroy trust. Bad design and spammy popups destroy trust, not the fact that ads exist.\n\nPinterest is also like that. It’s not a stable platform, it’s an algorithm casino. One month it loves you, next month it doesn’t. It’s not even always about you posting less, Pinterest just cycles content. The only way to “win” is to keep publishing fresh posts and fresh pins and treat it like a long game. Most Pinterest growth happens from older pins suddenly popping off months later.\n\nFor Google impressions, the harsh truth is: slow living / calm routines / journaling is a very broad space and a lot of your posts might be too “vibe-based” for Google. Google doesn’t rank vibes, it ranks answers. People search stuff like *“morning routine for anxiety”*, *“how to start journaling when you don’t know what to write”*, *“slow living routine for working women”*, *“self care Sunday checklist”*. If your posts are more like personal reflections, they’re great for readers but harder to rank.\n\nIf you want traffic, you need more search-intent posts. Not clickbait, but practical posts with clear titles and structure. Think less “My slow morning” and more “Slow morning routine ideas for busy people (realistic + calming)”.\n\nAlso lifestyle blogs make money late. Most people don’t make anything for 1–2 years unless they’re aggressively doing affiliate marketing or selling something.\n\nTopic-wise, what usually works best is anything that’s specific + solves a problem. Routines, checklists, habit building, journaling prompts, decluttering, cozy productivity, minimalism, self care plans, “how to” style content. Stuff that people can save, revisit, or follow.\n\nAnd honestly, if you’re not building an email list yet, start now. Pinterest and Google can drop anytime. Email is the only “slow living” platform that actually matches your niche because those readers love long-form content.\n\nYou’re probably not missing some secret trick. You’re just in the phase where the blog still doesn’t have enough content footprint + not enough search-focused posts yet. Keep going, but shift slightly toward searchable, practical topics and you’ll start seeing momentum.",

Meanwhile I’m pushing out 3-5 posts a week targeting low KD keywords and letting Google decide which ones take off.\nNot every post will rank. That’s fine. But if you’re consistently putting out content with solid keyword research behind it, some of those seeds WILL grow. It’s a numbers game on top of a strategy game.\nMy sweet spot: KD under 15, long-tail, at least some search volume. Publish, move on, revisit the winners later and make them even better.",

That hasn't worked for a while now. In fact things never really worked quite like that.\n\nYou can write the best blog post in the world, far better than everything else on the internet, and you still will not go to the top of the search results unless you have site authority and the backlinks to back it up.\n\nEven if you target longtail keywords that not many other people are covering then Google often will still not show your post for that keyword unless you have some level of domain authority and backlinks as since the rise of AI content tools that allow us to pump out 1,000s of posts around longtail keywords at the click of a button Google has been far more selective in the sites and posts they index and new sites are often sandboxed for an endless period of time or ignored completely favouring established sites even when their post doesn't entirely match the users search query.\n\nBlogging as a business model or a way to make money / passive income is an absolutely terrible choice in 2026 as there literally hasn't been a worse time in internet history to start a written blog - Google with their AI Overview Answers has wiped out between 60-100% of all blog traffic because they now answer most questions, in depth, directly in the SERPs and no one needs to click anywhere now.\n\nCombine that with the fact that between Sponsored Results, AI Answers, Google Shopping Carousels, Youtube Videos, People Also Ask Boxes, and Reddit threads that for anyone to even find an organic link to a blog in Google Search they'd have to scroll right to the bottom of page 1 or even page 2 these days and usually then it'll be a major media site rather than your independent blog.\n\nOn top of that you have ChatGPT and other tools that don't even link to websites, more people than ever directly searching on Reddit for answers to their queries, the huge increase in social media usage, Youtube being the worlds second biggest search engine after Google, and now short form video on Shorts, Reels, and TikTok reigning supreme which many Gen Z resort to directly to find information means blogs are no longer the main source of answers to questions.\n\nHardly anyone is visiting blogs in 2026 and no one is going to buy your Gumroad course on how you allegedly make $300 per month Rajesh, so please stop lying to people.",

Since launch, I’ve made around $500 through affiliate links. Google AdSense keeps rejecting my application.\n\nSo my questions for those of you who run a travel blog are:\n\n1. **Which type of posts bring you the most traffic?** “Where to stay” posts? Itineraries?Destination guides? Something else?\n2. **Which posts actually make you the most money?** And through which monetization methods? Affiliate links (ATM I'm using Travelpayouts)? Display ads? Other strategies?\n\nSome quick stats about my blog:\n\n* 12.2k clicks\n* 403k impressions\n* CTR \\~3%\n* Average position: 14\n* 46 published posts\n\nTraffic is steadily growing, but still relatively low:\n\n* \\~1,700 sessions/month\n* \\~2,200 pageviews/month\n* Summer peak last year: \\~4,000 sessions / \\~5,000 pageviews\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who’s willing to share their experience or advice, I really appreciate it!",

Even perfectly optimized, that level of traffic just can’t generate meaningful money. Most travel blogs only start making consistent income around 20k to 50k sessions per month. What usually works:\n\nFor traffic, itinerary posts and how to plan guides tend to rank best. Stuff like 3 days in X, best hikes near X, how to get to X, packing lists. These capture search intent. For money, hotel and booking content converts the best. Where to stay in X, best hotels for hikers in X, gear reviews, insurance, tours. These hit buyers, not just readers.\n\nAt your size, focus less on ads and more on high intent affiliate posts. AdSense rejecting you is honestly irrelevant right now. I’d double down on SEO. More posts targeting long tail keywords. 100 to 150 posts minimum. That’s usually when travel blogs start compounding.\n\nRight now you’re early stage. The game is volume and rankings, not monetization tricks. How many of your posts are targeting very specific keywords versus general travel inspiration pieces?",

Itineraries can work but are more competitive. \"Where to stay\" posts get decent traffic but lower intent unless you're ranking for specific hotels.\n2. **Money:** This is where it gets interesting. Most people optimize for traffic, but the posts that get clicks aren't always the posts that make money.\n\n**What actually converts:**\n\n* Gear recommendations (hiking boots, backpacks, etc.) - people ready to buy\n* Specific itinerary posts with booking links\n* \"Best time to visit\" posts with hotel/tour links\n\n**The problem with affiliate-only monetization:** You're probably making money on posts you don't even know about. Travelpayouts and most affiliate platforms show you total earnings but not which specific posts/content drove those sales.\n\nI actually built something for this exact problem (Buy Button Plus - buybuttonplus.dev). Originally made it for bloggers who wanted to sell their own products (like travel guides or itineraries as digital products) but the analytics piece is what people love. Shows you which posts generate revenue, not just traffic.\n\n**But honestly, for where you're at:**\n\n1. Keep building content (you need 80-100 posts minimum)\n2. Focus on gear reviews and \"best X for Y\" posts (higher buyer intent)\n3. Try Amazon Associates for Italy if you haven't (works better than Travelpayouts for gear)\n4. Consider creating a digital product (PDF hiking guide, itinerary template) to sell directly - you keep 100% vs affiliate commission\n\nThe $500 in a year from affiliates is actually pretty good for your traffic level. Most travel blogs don't hit profitability until 50k sessions/month with ads + affiliates.\n\nWhat kind of posts have made you the most so far? Curious what's working in the Italian market.",

I’ve made tons of bookings off of “where to park in x city” posts because people are literally looking for parking before they rent vs getting a place with parking included. Same goes for pool day passes or beach clubs in x city. In my opinion, these are people at the middle of the funnel, and it’s way way way easier to rank for than where to stay or things to do. These pages are also great for passing link juice to the pages you do want to rank eventually like where to stay or things to do. Please don’t use Adsense, or even mediavine, who I just ditched. It’s not worth tainting your beautiful site with that garbage and I am seeing a direct correlation ditching it with more bookings which I am chalking to trust. Install an app like Microsoft clarity to track where people go to on your page so that you can optimise it more. Put your cta and lead at th top of your page, always. You can do it again later but don’t miss that chance while you have them. Lastly, look at top sites, copy them, but vary  it to see what works for you ie text, buttons, colours etc. good luck!",

Pinterest seems popular, but I don’t think I have enough images to properly get that going, or maybe someone could explain how they’ve integrated it differently and what worked for them.\n\nInstagram, I’ve thought about it, but it’s mostly reels that perform well, not something I’m ready to do yet. I’ve been thinking about LinkedIn because it’s geared toward industries and companies, which would make sense for my industry related blog just don’t quite have the connections or setup to go through with it yet.\n\nHas Facebook worked for anyone? Like Facebook groups and communities centered around your blog, or even just posting on Facebook? I would try a YouTube channel to showcase case studies and experiments, but I don’t currently have the infrastructure, maybe in a year or two I can do that.\n\nOverall, for a brand new blog that started posting a month ago, I’ve managed to index my site and posts, and gain some good views and readers, which I’m proud of. It’s quite humbling and rewarding. I Would love to hear any tips or what’s actually bringing traffic for other people running niche industry related blogs.",

Some of what people are writing is interesting and I do think that its good for writers to have a space where they can earn money for their work if they have people who regularly want to read their work.\n\nHowever I think there is a slight issue with the ability to charge as well. Many, many people with literary aspirations write and post on Substack and either do charge of have an eye towards charging in general. As a result of this view towards professional writing their blog posts, because that is essentially what they are take on an odd, mannered style which is off putting. I often get the sense that I am not really hearing a genuine voice but from someone writing in a way that reflects what they imagine a writer should sound like and the kinds of things they ought to be writing about.\n\nFair enough I guess, everyone experiments and or mimics and its no crime. However as a reader its kind of boring. I think if it was just a blogging site where people were writing from where they really are in their natural voice rather than with an eye to monetizing their blog it would be a lot more interesting and readable and they might develop more of a unique voice and perspective over time which might actually be worth paying for.\n\nAnyone else noticed this?",

The ones with almost no views are basically invisible because they never matched a clear search signal.\n\nI still struggle sometimes too, but now when I do keyword research I actually use:  \n• typing my topic into the search bar and saving the autocomplete suggestions as real user queries  \n• looking at the colored keyword bubbles Pinterest gives after search to refine long-tails  \n• and most importantly, I use Pinterest Trends when I can to check if a term actually has momentum in a specific region\n\n",

Then use those exact phrases in your pin titles/descriptions.\n\nAlso, timing and saturation matter because if you post about something that everyone is already pinning, you're competing with thousands of pins.

First off, kudos to that guy for running each day at 3:30 when I am fast asleep.  He doesn't have a huge following (about 14 people) but what I found most inspirational were the daily posts.  It gets me engaged into his story and it really highlights how many different kind of bloggers are out there.

I know you said you don't know how to code but if you have the time you should try out something like Claude Code. Watch/Read a couple tutorials on it and see if you can get a basic blog project going. It'll probably be frustrating to get the hang of initially but if you learn how to use it I think you'll have a much better experience building something you truly want. It's gotten pretty good and even with a couple prompts you can have it build out a decent site.\n\nIf you want any help feel free to reach out, not here to sell you anything at all but I understand your frustration.

Most of our followers are residents of the capital and nearby towns. Our UGC is often picked up by news portals, usually with a mention of our Facebook page.\n\nWe’re now ready to take the next step and build our own website from scratch.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice on how to do this the “right way” in 2026. Specifically:\n\n1. In 2026, is the number of publications still one of the most important factors in a niche like ours?\n2. Are keywords still relevant, or have the algorithms changed in a way that makes them less important?\n3. What type of content works best now, and what should I avoid?\n\nAny insights, personal experiences, or resources you could share would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I recently updated my blog, and I wanted to share it here—not so much as a finished piece of writing, but as part of a process I’m committing to.\n\nThe blog is slowly becoming an online diary of sorts. I write about healing, processing woundedness, and trying to become a better, more honest version of myself. A lot of it is reflective—making sense of emotions that show up in everyday life, sitting with discomfort, and noticing how past experiences continue to shape who I am now.\n\nI’m trying to write more regularly, not to be polished or profound, but to show up consistently and tell the truth as I see it in the moment. Some entries are clearer than others. Some are messy. All of them are part of learning how to stay present with myself instead of rushing toward answers.\n\nI’m sharing this here because writing in public, even quietly, helps me stay accountable to the practice. If anyone else here uses writing as a way to process, heal, or simply make sense of life, I’d love to hear how you approach it.",

From an SEO perspective, Google doesn't penalize AI images, but they do care about image optimization (file size, alt text, relevance).
