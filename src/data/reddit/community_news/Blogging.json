          "text": "This is a great question, and from my experience, the simple answer is yes, blogging still makes sense in 2026, but the *way* we approach it has evolved.\n\nHere’s how I see it based on what actually works rather than marketing hype.\n\n**1. Search traffic still exists**  \nPeople still use search engines to find answers, how-tos, and deeper discussions. Video and social platforms are great for discovery and short lessons, but search remains the largest source of *intent-driven* traffic. A well-optimized blog post can continue to rank for years.\n\n**2. Blogs give you ownership**  \nPlatforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram can disappear, change their algorithm, or de-prioritize content. Your blog is a home you control. It becomes the anchor for your long-form ideas, and search engines help connect readers with those ideas over the long term.\n\n**3. Depth still matters**  \nFor topics that need structure, examples, and explanation, blog posts (and even longer formats like guides and ebooks) still outperform short content. I use tools like WordHero to generate clean drafts quickly, but I still need to refine and structure them for depth.\n\n**4. Blogging has evolved, not died**  \nBlogging today looks different from it did a decade ago:\n\n* SEO research and keyword intent matter more\n* Integration with other formats (video, social excerpts) is now common\n* Relying on AI for outlines and consistent drafting is mainstream\n\nFor longer projects, I also plan and expand content in long form, similar to how I approach guided writing workflows in tools like Aivolut Books, then break that content into multiple blog posts or downloadable guides. This approach leverages both blogging and long-form authority content.\n\n**5. Blogs support other media**  \nYouTube descriptions, podcast show notes, and newsletters all benefit from a strong blog backend. Social media might start the conversation; the blog *owns* it.  \n  \nBlogging is not dead. It is evolving into a format that works with search engines, social distribution, and multimedia ecosystems. If anything, blogs are more strategic now than ever, especially when paired with thoughtful use of AI.\n\nFor those still writing or reading blogs:  \nWhat role does blogging play in your overall content strategy in 2026?",

It is literally THE BEST way to keep track of yachts you meet in different places from even further away places. We are so bad at keeping ours up to date but I'm going through making ours again with Hugo to host ourselves vs using Wordpress like we do now because we are usually without internet and when we do have it its slow  and boy Wordpress is clunky.\n\n  \nI also read them on technology related stuff, the only way I'd've known how to remake our sailing blog is by reading other's technical blogs. So I keep one of those as well granted idk if anyone other than me has ever seen it lol",

          "text": "There are too many factors to account for with such a vague question. Consider \"how long did it take you to learn to swim, or walk\", and then correlate the answer.\n\nEach website or blog can be vastly different from another. The topic of choice for a blog alone can determine how fast traffic will spike.\n\nWhat topic are you writing about? Lifestyle? Psychology? or Micromanaging Bonsai trees for maximum growth potential?\n\nWho or what is the target audience that you are writing for? Is it a personal blog or a business blog? Cat lovers? Dog lovers? or \"revisiting the extinct species lists\"?\n\nThe point I would like to address is that you should have a purpose behind the process of building your blog. The more purposeful you create your blog, the greater the chances of traffic to that blog. If you are simply writing personal notes to the world, that's awesome, but not entirely \"calling people in\".\n\nIf your blog is actively solving problems that are highly needed throughout society, then it would be hard to stop the flow of traffic. People often read things that solve a problem for themselves.\n\nConsider this site, is all about receiving helpful insight. Users ask a question, in the hopes of getting useful answers. So there is a high likelihood that you come back to read the topic, and you have a direct interest in the outcome of the topic.\n\nDoes your blog fulfill this same need to your readers? If not, this becomes the most deterministic factor for how fast your blog will get traffic. We are in an era where a single post can travel the internet a million times overnight. Most of the time, this happens due to the nature of the topic, not where the topic originated.\n\nOnce you have more clearly defined the overall purpose of your content, then you can actively do more to enhance the shareability factors. There are things you will want to do. such as:\n\n* Writing long and short-form content,\n* uploading images to your blog,\n* creating engaging content posts,\n* encouraging feedback on your site\n* making sure your blog posts are curated\n* blog consistently\n* managing your SEO\n* internal and external linkbuild practices\n* social engagement\n* either a simple design or a good design\n* easy to read formatting\n* and a bunch more...\n\nThere is a lot that goes into \"creating\" a blog, least of all just posting. It should be treated as a business if you are trying to use it as a business. Your urgency to get traffic will not \"solve\" a traffic issue, trust me on that one. We've all been there before.\n\nConsider your blog as a community project, a living, growing environment where people will come to read for \"their benefit\", not yours. That's the key.",

Distribution tends to be the bigger bottleneck. Posts aren’t shared consistently, or the manual effort becomes unsustainable. Automating that step helps maintain momentum early on by ensuring every new article gets shared across selected platforms as soon as it’s published.

      "text": "I've been dipping into Substack recently as a reader and its interesting to see a space for longer form writing online that is open to all and is thriving. Some of what people are writing is interesting and I do think that its good for writers to have a space where they can earn money for their work if they have people who regularly want to read their work.\n\nHowever I think there is a slight issue with the ability to charge as well. Many, many people with literary aspirations write and post on Substack and either do charge of have an eye towards charging in general. As a result of this view towards professional writing their blog posts, because that is essentially what they are take on an odd, mannered style which is off putting. I often get the sense that I am not really hearing a genuine voice but from someone writing in a way that reflects what they imagine a writer should sound like and the kinds of things they ought to be writing about.\n\nFair enough I guess, everyone experiments and or mimics and its no crime. However as a reader its kind of boring. I think if it was just a blogging site where people were writing from where they really are in their natural voice rather than with an eye to monetizing their blog it would be a lot more interesting and readable and they might develop more of a unique voice and perspective over time which might actually be worth paying for.\n\nAnyone else noticed this?",

Pinterest seems popular, but I don’t think I have enough images to properly get that going, or maybe someone could explain how they’ve integrated it differently and what worked for them.\n\nInstagram, I’ve thought about it, but it’s mostly reels that perform well, not something I’m ready to do yet. I’ve been thinking about LinkedIn because it’s geared toward industries and companies, which would make sense for my industry related blog just don’t quite have the connections or setup to go through with it yet.\n\nHas Facebook worked for anyone? Like Facebook groups and communities centered around your blog, or even just posting on Facebook? I would try a YouTube channel to showcase case studies and experiments, but I don’t currently have the infrastructure, maybe in a year or two I can do that.\n\nOverall, for a brand new blog that started posting a month ago, I’ve managed to index my site and posts, and gain some good views and readers, which I’m proud of. It’s quite humbling and rewarding. I Would love to hear any tips or what’s actually bringing traffic for other people running niche industry related blogs.",

For me as a college student I can try to work with what I have, like diagrams, images school or work related, since my blog is program and field of interest related. Just I don’t want to accidentally take photos, and not be allowed to lol. I guess maybe it’s just about starting to take pictures now, and then slowly figuring out Pinterest, linking it to blog posts, and building from there. I don’t really know exactly how it works, that’s what I’m trying to figure out.",

With that traffic, I would call it decent for a new blog. \n\nIf anything, you should be posting more. Blogs often do better with more frequent posts. If you are worried that you will scare people off, don't be. Google likes to see that the site is active. They want to see engagement, such as comments. \n\nThis is why systems like Reddit are so valuable. just a constant flow of eyeballs and content generation. This causes Google to always be indexing the site pages. The Bots crawl constantly. \n\nIf you are using AI to help assist your blog posts, consider just upping the game to one a week, or 2 a week. Also, the content you are writing will make a difference. Topics with more common interest will spike based on how engaging the content is. Sites that are more \"academic\" in style often have slower traffic. So, topic choice will make a difference. Niche selection and overall keyword usage will play a big role as well. \n\nOverall, nice start.",

It gets me engaged into his story and it really highlights how many different kind of bloggers are out there.

          "text": "This is a very common problem, and you are right to be cautious. Generating a large volume of AI ideas without traffic validation usually leads to wasted effort, not growth.\n\nThe core issue is that most AI tools are good at producing topics, but weak at prioritizing demand and intent. A list of 200 ideas is meaningless unless you know which ones already attract real searches and why.\n\nA strategy that works more reliably looks like this.\n\nFirst, reverse the process. Instead of asking AI to invent topics, start with topics that are already proving demand.\n\nUse Google search itself. Type your main keyword and carefully read:\n\n* Autocomplete suggestions\n* “People also ask” questions\n* Related searches at the bottom\n\nThese reflect real queries, not hypothetical ones.\n\nNext, validate through search results, not keyword volume alone. Open the top 10 ranking pages and ask:\n\n* Are forums like Reddit or Quora ranking?\n* Are the articles thin, outdated, or poorly structured?\n* Are they missing clear answers, examples, or depth?\n\nIf Reddit threads are ranking, that is usually a strong signal of underserved intent. Google is telling you it cannot find a better page.\n\nOnly after that should AI come in.\n\nInstead of “Give me SEO blog ideas,” use prompts like:  \n“Based on this keyword and the current top-ranking pages, identify content gaps and unanswered questions. Suggest one article that would fully satisfy search intent better than existing results.”\n\nThis forces AI to work as an analyst, not a generator.\n\nAnother effective approach is topic clustering with intent tiers:\n\n* One core page targeting the main keyword\n* Several supporting posts answering very specific questions people ask before or after that query\n\nTraffic compounds when content supports other content.\n\nSome writers also use tools like WordHero specifically for expanding validated ideas rather than discovering them. It works best when you already know what you want to rank for and need help shaping outlines, sections, or variations without losing focus.\n\nThe most important mindset shift is this: fewer articles with proven demand outperform hundreds of speculative ones. One well-aligned post that matches intent precisely can outperform 50 generic SEO pieces.\n\nIf an idea cannot clearly answer “who is searching this and what are they trying to decide,” it is usually not worth writing yet.",
