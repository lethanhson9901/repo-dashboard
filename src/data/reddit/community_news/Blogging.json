          "text": "This is a great question, and from my experience, the simple answer is yes, blogging still makes sense in 2026, but the *way* we approach it has evolved.\n\nHere’s how I see it based on what actually works rather than marketing hype.\n\n**1. Search traffic still exists**  \nPeople still use search engines to find answers, how-tos, and deeper discussions. Video and social platforms are great for discovery and short lessons, but search remains the largest source of *intent-driven* traffic. A well-optimized blog post can continue to rank for years.\n\n**2. Blogs give you ownership**  \nPlatforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram can disappear, change their algorithm, or de-prioritize content. Your blog is a home you control. It becomes the anchor for your long-form ideas, and search engines help connect readers with those ideas over the long term.\n\n**3. Depth still matters**  \nFor topics that need structure, examples, and explanation, blog posts (and even longer formats like guides and ebooks) still outperform short content. I use tools like WordHero to generate clean drafts quickly, but I still need to refine and structure them for depth.\n\n**4. Blogging has evolved, not died**  \nBlogging today looks different from it did a decade ago:\n\n* SEO research and keyword intent matter more\n* Integration with other formats (video, social excerpts) is now common\n* Relying on AI for outlines and consistent drafting is mainstream\n\nFor longer projects, I also plan and expand content in long form, similar to how I approach guided writing workflows in tools like Aivolut Books, then break that content into multiple blog posts or downloadable guides. This approach leverages both blogging and long-form authority content.\n\n**5. Blogs support other media**  \nYouTube descriptions, podcast show notes, and newsletters all benefit from a strong blog backend. Social media might start the conversation; the blog *owns* it.  \n  \nBlogging is not dead. It is evolving into a format that works with search engines, social distribution, and multimedia ecosystems. If anything, blogs are more strategic now than ever, especially when paired with thoughtful use of AI.\n\nFor those still writing or reading blogs:  \nWhat role does blogging play in your overall content strategy in 2026?",

They're actively trying to get a job. That's valuable traffic.\n\n**What you could do:**\n\nInstead of showing them ads (making you $2.63 per 1000 views), sell them something directly:\n\n* Resume templates ($10-20)\n* Cover letter templates ($10)\n* Interview prep guides ($15-30)\n* Career coaching ($50-200)\n\nEven if only 0.5% of your 113k visitors bought a $15 template, that's $850. Not $298.\n\n**The shift:**\n\nRight now: Traffic → Ads → You get pennies  \nInstead: Traffic → Your product → You keep everything\n\nI'm not saying ditch AdSense completely. But test selling your own stuff alongside it. Your audience is literally searching for solutions you could package and sell.\n\nThe employee/career niche is perfect for this because people have urgent problems (need job NOW) and will pay to solve them.\n\nHave you thought about creating any digital products? With 113k monthly views you could easily do $1-2k/month selling templates or guides.",

Fast site, clean design, technical SEO, writing in a way I think people would like etc. I haven’t even thought about backlinks yet until I’m happy with the foundation being solid. \n\nFor example, most sites on this sub are using uncompressed PNG images when you can convert to WEBP and AVIF for 80 - 90% reduction with no quality loss. If someone has a several images that are larger than 1mb, that’s going to massively slow the site on load and people will close the site. Convert those, priority high the above the fold and lazy load the rest and suddenly you’ve got a 5mb load turning into 80kb. \n\nThat’s just one of many examples I’ve seen.",

Right now I’m averaging around position 21 with a CTR of 1.6%.  But the volume is a lot smaller given that I’m just over 30 days old. \n\nYeah agree on the smaller search engines, I’ve been holding rank 1 on 200 search terms and then 2 to 5 on another 250 years. 12% CTR from Bing alone (13k impressions). I have the same amount of traffic from DuckDuckGo too. \n\nEngagement on the site has been good (35% bounce rate and an average duration of 13 minutes) so hopefully when Google kicks in, I’ll have the numbers to back it to have the higher rank.

If a post solves a very specific problem with proof, screenshots, or firsthand experience, it can win even outside your main topic. That’s why personal, timely posts often outperform perfectly “on-niche” but generic content.",

Some of what people are writing is interesting and I do think that its good for writers to have a space where they can earn money for their work if they have people who regularly want to read their work.\n\nHowever I think there is a slight issue with the ability to charge as well. Many, many people with literary aspirations write and post on Substack and either do charge of have an eye towards charging in general. As a result of this view towards professional writing their blog posts, because that is essentially what they are take on an odd, mannered style which is off putting. I often get the sense that I am not really hearing a genuine voice but from someone writing in a way that reflects what they imagine a writer should sound like and the kinds of things they ought to be writing about.\n\nFair enough I guess, everyone experiments and or mimics and its no crime. However as a reader its kind of boring. I think if it was just a blogging site where people were writing from where they really are in their natural voice rather than with an eye to monetizing their blog it would be a lot more interesting and readable and they might develop more of a unique voice and perspective over time which might actually be worth paying for.\n\nAnyone else noticed this?",

It’s an Italian-language blog where I write about hiking/trekking, travel guides, and itineraries.\n\nRight now I’m struggling a bit with monetization. Since launch, I’ve made around $500 through affiliate links. Google AdSense keeps rejecting my application.\n\nSo my questions for those of you who run a travel blog are:\n\n1. **Which type of posts bring you the most traffic?** “Where to stay” posts? Itineraries?Destination guides? Something else?\n2. **Which posts actually make you the most money?** And through which monetization methods? Affiliate links (ATM I'm using Travelpayouts)? Display ads? Other strategies?\n\nSome quick stats about my blog:\n\n* 12.2k clicks\n* 403k impressions\n* CTR \\~3%\n* Average position: 14\n* 46 published posts\n\nTraffic is steadily growing, but still relatively low:\n\n* \\~1,700 sessions/month\n* \\~2,200 pageviews/month\n* Summer peak last year: \\~4,000 sessions / \\~5,000 pageviews\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who’s willing to share their experience or advice, I really appreciate it!",

Even perfectly optimized, that level of traffic just can’t generate meaningful money. Most travel blogs only start making consistent income around 20k to 50k sessions per month. What usually works:\n\nFor traffic, itinerary posts and how to plan guides tend to rank best. Stuff like 3 days in X, best hikes near X, how to get to X, packing lists. These capture search intent. For money, hotel and booking content converts the best. Where to stay in X, best hotels for hikers in X, gear reviews, insurance, tours. These hit buyers, not just readers.\n\nAt your size, focus less on ads and more on high intent affiliate posts. AdSense rejecting you is honestly irrelevant right now. I’d double down on SEO. More posts targeting long tail keywords. 100 to 150 posts minimum. That’s usually when travel blogs start compounding.\n\nRight now you’re early stage. The game is volume and rankings, not monetization tricks. How many of your posts are targeting very specific keywords versus general travel inspiration pieces?",

I’ve made tons of bookings off of “where to park in x city” posts because people are literally looking for parking before they rent vs getting a place with parking included. Same goes for pool day passes or beach clubs in x city. In my opinion, these are people at the middle of the funnel, and it’s way way way easier to rank for than where to stay or things to do. These pages are also great for passing link juice to the pages you do want to rank eventually like where to stay or things to do. Please don’t use Adsense, or even mediavine, who I just ditched. It’s not worth tainting your beautiful site with that garbage and I am seeing a direct correlation ditching it with more bookings which I am chalking to trust. Install an app like Microsoft clarity to track where people go to on your page so that you can optimise it more. Put your cta and lead at th top of your page, always. You can do it again later but don’t miss that chance while you have them. Lastly, look at top sites, copy them, but vary  it to see what works for you ie text, buttons, colours etc. good luck!",

He gets 5 million views a year and I would imagine in US dollars (and seeing that he’s mediavine)… he’s making a real income.  So still I'm saying… I think you need more posts.

          "text": "Hey, congrats on the growth so far. 1,700 sessions/month after a year is solid progress, especially in Italian (smaller market).\n\n**On your questions:**\n\n1. **Traffic:** Destination guides and \"things to do in X\" posts usually win for SEO. Itineraries can work but are more competitive. \"Where to stay\" posts get decent traffic but lower intent unless you're ranking for specific hotels.\n2. **Money:** This is where it gets interesting. Most people optimize for traffic, but the posts that get clicks aren't always the posts that make money.\n\n**What actually converts:**\n\n* Gear recommendations (hiking boots, backpacks, etc.) - people ready to buy\n* Specific itinerary posts with booking links\n* \"Best time to visit\" posts with hotel/tour links\n\n**The problem with affiliate-only monetization:** You're probably making money on posts you don't even know about. Travelpayouts and most affiliate platforms show you total earnings but not which specific posts/content drove those sales.\n\nI actually built something for this exact problem (Buy Button Plus - buybuttonplus.dev). Originally made it for bloggers who wanted to sell their own products (like travel guides or itineraries as digital products) but the analytics piece is what people love. Shows you which posts generate revenue, not just traffic.\n\n**But honestly, for where you're at:**\n\n1. Keep building content (you need 80-100 posts minimum)\n2. Focus on gear reviews and \"best X for Y\" posts (higher buyer intent)\n3. Try Amazon Associates for Italy if you haven't (works better than Travelpayouts for gear)\n4. Consider creating a digital product (PDF hiking guide, itinerary template) to sell directly - you keep 100% vs affiliate commission\n\nThe $500 in a year from affiliates is actually pretty good for your traffic level. Most travel blogs don't hit profitability until 50k sessions/month with ads + affiliates.\n\nWhat kind of posts have made you the most so far? Curious what's working in the Italian market.",

Reddit works best when I answer questions in my niche, and Twitter is slowly gaining momentum by views, not so much followers yet. I’m curious, what’s working for you? Pinterest seems popular, but I don’t think I have enough images to properly get that going, or maybe someone could explain how they’ve integrated it differently and what worked for them.\n\nInstagram, I’ve thought about it, but it’s mostly reels that perform well, not something I’m ready to do yet. I’ve been thinking about LinkedIn because it’s geared toward industries and companies, which would make sense for my industry related blog just don’t quite have the connections or setup to go through with it yet.\n\nHas Facebook worked for anyone? Like Facebook groups and communities centered around your blog, or even just posting on Facebook? I would try a YouTube channel to showcase case studies and experiments, but I don’t currently have the infrastructure, maybe in a year or two I can do that.\n\nOverall, for a brand new blog that started posting a month ago, I’ve managed to index my site and posts, and gain some good views and readers, which I’m proud of. It’s quite humbling and rewarding. I Would love to hear any tips or what’s actually bringing traffic for other people running niche industry related blogs.",

It's a search engine. \n\nThe pins that blow up are the ones Pinterest can actually associate with real search intent (keywords in titles/descriptions/profile/boards), so they get shown to people searching for those terms. The ones with almost no views are basically invisible because they never matched a clear search signal.\n\nI still struggle sometimes too, but now when I do keyword research I actually use:  \n• typing my topic into the search bar and saving the autocomplete suggestions as real user queries  \n• looking at the colored keyword bubbles Pinterest gives after search to refine long-tails  \n• and most importantly, I use Pinterest Trends when I can to check if a term actually has momentum in a specific region\n\n",

Miss the keywords, and it dies regardless of how good it looks.\n\nTrends tool seems to work better for seasonal stuff like recipes, holidays, fashion than evergreen content.\n\nThe Pinterest auto-suggests can give you ideas of popular searches. because they are what people are actually looking for. Then use those exact phrases in your pin titles/descriptions.\n\nAlso, timing and saturation matter because if you post about something that everyone is already pinning, you're competing with thousands of pins. Slightly different angles or long-tail keywords can make a difference e.g., \"easy Easter pasta recipes\" instead of \"pasta recipes\".",

It's definitely a writing style that I really have a fun time reading and it was fun to see his writing develop over the years.  What I liked most were his catchy titles, data to back up his points, and actual tips you could apply to your own life to save money.  \n\nThe other blogger that I really like is a runner that blogs each day about his 3:30 a.m. running journey.  First off, kudos to that guy for running each day at 3:30 when I am fast asleep.  He doesn't have a huge following (about 14 people) but what I found most inspirational were the daily posts.  It gets me engaged into his story and it really highlights how many different kind of bloggers are out there.  I also get inspired by how much he writes and it pushes me to write at least one a week.\n\nWhich bloggers have most inspired you through your writing and in which way was your writing inspired?

I am thankful to openAI and chatGPT for guiding me through all the processes including hosting, designing website, setting up various pages. Of course I did all the things myself, ChatGPT helped me to streamline the process. This was a game changer for me. \n\n  \nThen on 25th Nov ~~2026~~ 2025 I published 7 blogs. And then, I went back to my old ways. I did nothing till Jan end. In Jan end I published 15 more blogs. \n\nI write blogs with AI but with restricted sources. The blogs are informative in nature.\n\n  \nBelow are some stats till date. I don't know what to make of it.

You need to pay attention over there, too.",

With that traffic, I would call it decent for a new blog. \n\nIf anything, you should be posting more. Blogs often do better with more frequent posts. If you are worried that you will scare people off, don't be. Google likes to see that the site is active. They want to see engagement, such as comments. \n\nThis is why systems like Reddit are so valuable. just a constant flow of eyeballs and content generation. This causes Google to always be indexing the site pages. The Bots crawl constantly. \n\nIf you are using AI to help assist your blog posts, consider just upping the game to one a week, or 2 a week. Also, the content you are writing will make a difference. Topics with more common interest will spike based on how engaging the content is. Sites that are more \"academic\" in style often have slower traffic. So, topic choice will make a difference. Niche selection and overall keyword usage will play a big role as well. \n\nOverall, nice start.",

Specifically:\n\n1. In 2026, is the number of publications still one of the most important factors in a niche like ours?\n2. Are keywords still relevant, or have the algorithms changed in a way that makes them less important?\n3.

Both by sharing each others posts and looking to try and help link build too (although link 4 link isn’t always the best idea Google doesn’t like that).\n\nIs your theme SEO friendly? \n\nHave you checked competitive levels on the keywords you’re using?",

It's less about any single post and more about creating a familiar feeling or theme people recognize and want to return to. When your posts start feeling like different chapters of the same calm headspace, things usually click more naturally. Seven months in doesn't mean you picked the wrong niche. It usually just means that sense of \"this is my place\" is still forming.",

I have a shitload of posts about London on my blog, because I like it there. I am no professional blogger, so I only blog about my real travels. If I stay in the same place for a couple of days and have more inspiration, I write more ☺️",
