      "text": "It’s honestly insane how one single video can change a business.\n\nHere’s what one viral video did for us:\n\n\\- 800k+ views across social media (reposted by dozens of accounts)\n\n\\- Thousands of visits to our website\n\n\\- 500+ free trials started (with credit card)\n\n\\-150+ paying customers\n\n\\- $15k+ in new MRR\n\nBut that wasn’t even the most surprising part:\n\n\\- Dozens of VCs reached out\n\n\\- +70% month-over-month revenue growth\n\nWe immediately started preparing two more videos.\n\nThe launch strategy itself was actually very simple :\n\n\\- We coordinated with \\~10 friends who have solid Twitter/X accounts.\n\n\\- As soon as the video went live, they all reposted it at the same time.\n\nThat initial push gave the algorithm enough signal.\n\nAfter that, the video took off organically and went fully viral.\n\nJust distribution + timing.\n\nI’m dropping the link to the video just below if you’re curious.\n\n[Click here to see it](https://x.com/romanbuildsaas/status/2013909037218185612?s=20)\n\nHope you’ll enjoy it.\n\nCiao 👋",

      "text": "Hey, just wanted to share some notes after spending the last year launching products from \"original\" ideas - and why I've since pivoting to cloning instead. I thought I could find things people hadn't thought of, gaps in the market, ideas that fell through the cracks, etc.\n\nThat all changed when I watched a Starter Story interview with a guy who literally just... clones apps. He has 3 apps/services doing $30k+ MRR. He finds something already making money, makes it 1% better/different, and ships.\n\nThat video broke my brain a little. So I started researching. What apps are actually cloneable? How are they successful? Could a solo dev actually build these?\n\n166 ideas saved to my database later, these are my takeaways.\n\n**1. B2B wins, but not for the reason you think.**\n\n63% of profitable small-medium SaaS apps I found are B2B.\n\nBut it's not because B2B is \"easier to sell.\" It's because businesses have budgets. They don't agonize over $100/month the way consumers do over $5/mo. It does take longer to sell B2B, but it is stickier and the rewards are larger.\n\nThe average MRR in my data is \\~$25k/month. That's $300k/year from one person selling to other businesses.\n\n**2. The $5k-$50k/month sweet spot is wide open.**\n\n64% of the ideas I researched live in this range.\n\nBig enough to replace a salary, but small enough that nobody well-funded is coming after you. This is where small, bootstrapped teams/founders win.\n\n**3. Validated demand beats originality.**\n\nEvery idea in my database has verified MRR. Not \"I think this could work\" - actual proof that people already pay for this. This is a major point - knowing demand already exists is HUGE.\n\nStop trying to invent something new and find something that works and make it better for a specific audience.\n\n**4. You're more capable than you think.**\n\n92% of the apps I researched are solo-buildable. Not \"theoretically possible with 80-hour weeks\", but actually built and run by one person.\n\nI once heard someone say \"VC money is like rocket fuel. It's great if you're trying to launch into space, but it doesn't help if you're just trying to drive a car.\"\n\nMost of these apps are cars. Simple. Profitable. Built by normal developers solving boring problems.\n\n**5. Most of these can ship in a month.**\n\n44% of the ideas in my data are buildable in 4 weeks or less. 69% in 5 weeks or less.\n\nYou're not building Salesforce. You're building a focused tool that does one thing well.\n\n**6. People quit too early. People quit too late.**\n\nThe line between them is unfortunately thin.\n\nI have an app that helps students find off-campus housing. Started slow. Really slow. For a while I wondered if I should kill it. But the costs were low so I let it live. Today it outranks Zillow on Google for certain searches and I can sell to landlords for summer renters - something I never planned for.\n\nThe difference between \"quit\" and \"keep going\" was slight traction. Not massive traction. Just enough signal that people actually wanted it.\n\n**7. The boring ideas win.**\n\nEveryone's chasing AI. Meanwhile, my data shows there are many products quietly making money like:\n\n* SMS forwarding tools\n* Local file converters\n* AirPods finders\n* Calorie trackers\n* Supplement tracking apps\n* Alcohol consumption trackers\n\n\\---\n\nHope you enjoyed and happy cloning!",

The part about B2B budgets is also underrated, even a tiny workflow improvement can justify $50-$200/mo if it saves time or reduces risk. One thing I would add: the \"1% better\" often comes from sharper positioning and distribution, not just features (a clearer ICP, one channel you can win, and a simple onboarding that gets to value fast). If you are organizing your research and go-to-market notes somewhere, we are doing the same while building our own SaaS marketing tool at https://www.promarkia.com/ (feel free to poke around if useful).",

That doesn’t translate to real-world performance.\n\nPromptSpar fixes this by making prompt engineering practice-driven.\n\nUsers choose from 7 professional roles—Marketing, Sales, Non-Technical Founder, Legal, HR, Product Management, and Engineering. Each role has domain-specific missions and tasks, so users learn prompting in the exact context they work in.\n\nFor every module, users:\nLearn a prompting technique\nComplete a real task\nWrite a prompt\nReceive multi-dimensional scoring and feedback on clarity, constraints, reasoning, and output quality\nThere are 10 distinct prompting frameworks, and progress is measurable over time.\n\nThis creates three defensible advantages:\nSkill validation — prompting becomes observable and comparable\nHigh engagement — learning by doing, not watching\nEnterprise readiness — role-based training maps directly to job functions",

A dissimilar MHC region predicts a favorable odor, a similar MHC region predicts and unfavorable odor. This works because the MHC encodes for a different immune system, and the benefit would be to find dissimilar partners attractive so your offspring have more robust immune defenses. \n\nI want to build an app that allows users to upload their DNA files from AncestryDNA, 23AndMe, etc. and see which users are similar/disimilar to them. Kind of like a dating app but not really.\n\nMy only problem is accuracy. Consumer DNA tests are not fully accurate in some regions, so the score would have to be probabilistic and I'd have to do a lot of research on how each DNA company encodes these DNA files and in which regions they are accurate.",

Two of those are already automatable. The third is a coordination problem, not a talent problem.\n\n**Insight:** VCs have convinced LPs they're playing Moneyball. They're not. Most funds return within 1 standard deviation of the asset class. You're selling index exposure and calling it genius.\n\n**What we're building:**\n\n1. **Automated sourcing + screening.** Every fundable company, scored continuously, no warm intros required.\n2. **Actuarial underwriting models.** Pricing risk the way insurers do, not the way gamblers do.\n3. **LP-direct deployment.** Cut the GP. Keep the asset class.\n\n**Why now:**\n\n* Data on private companies is 10x richer than five years ago\n* LPs are fee-sensitive post-ZIRP\n* The \"access\" moat is collapsing. Everyone has deal flow now.\n* Nobody's said the quiet part loud yet\n\n**Business model:** We sell picks and shovels first (SaaS to existing funds), then go direct (LP-facing fund with 0.5-and-5 economics). Trojan horse.\n\n**Ask:** $5M seed to ship v1 and get three mid-tier VCs dependent on our infrastructure before they realize what we're building.\n\n**The question you should be asking yourself:** If 80% of your job can be systematized, and LPs figure that out, what's your plan?\n\n*We're not disrupting venture capital. We're just removing the costume.*\n\n*----------*\n\n*hahahahaha :) satire.*",

Meme stocks are highly volatile and present excellent gambling opportunities. Moreover, platforms to copy congressional trades, 13F filings, and others fail to point the user in a proper direction. They present a bunch of data instead of just directing the user on what was bought on what price point.\n\nThe target customer is the average [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user, gamblers. He wants data on what tickers are memes to either gain or lose money gambling on them. As of now, he scours reddit, is late on a meme stock rise, and then buys in. The goal of seeking tendies is to connect these gamblers to the information they need to make faster decisions on what to gamble on. \n\nMy problem is the following: how exactly would meme label on a ticker drive user growth? Would this product only work in bull markets? How is different from services like seeking alpha? I want to connect [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) gamblers to the tickers they need to make massive bets, but I'm not sure how to do so. Websites that track the most discussed tickers on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) already exist, so I'm not sure how my product would be different.",

This would be similar to a massage parlor but instead of focusing on muscles, the entire point would be gentle touches and focus on relaxing you.  If you are following trends, ASMR is just about the hottest trend right now, and a large amount of people watch ASMR videos to help them sleep.  So starting up a business to bring this experience into a safe tactile in person environment would be an easy hit.  Most of the women that get facials, nails, or any sort of pampering really do it for the personal attention. The other half that don't participate in these services really don't need the service, but they would enjoy it if it was just pampering with no strings attached to any special other service.  Men are a pretty big segment that are underserved by facials, nails, and in person salon's that offer some form of human interaction.  The pretext is off-putting enough that few men will walk in the door, but if the service was just generic pampering with no gimmick or any other value proposition, other than just relaxation, you would unlock a huge segment of customers.   There are already a handful of these types of in person ASMR services popping up.  But I have a scalable business plan and a unique spin on this that would take it to a new level.  Anyway, there is public pitch.  DM for more details.",

      "text": "Had a startup idea and was ready to spend 3 months building an MVP. Everyone says build fast and iterate, so I was planning to code first and validate later. Decided to flip that approach. Validated demand through organic search before writing a single line of code. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and proposed solution. Added an email signup for early access waitlist.\n\nThe validation strategy was purely organic. No paid ads to test demand because ad traffic disappears the moment you stop spending. Needed to see if people were actually searching for solutions to this problem naturally. Started with SEO foundation to get the landing page discoverable. Used [this tool to submit to startup and product directories](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) so the domain would have enough authority for content to rank. This took about 90 minutes of setup.\n\nThen published 5 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content about my solution but helpful posts about the problem space and current alternatives people were using. Week one through three showed minimal traffic. Directory listings went live slowly and blog posts didn't rank yet. Had 8 email signups, all from people I'd directly messaged. No organic validation yet.\n\nWeek four through six is when organic validation started appearing. Domain authority hit 15 and two blog posts moved to page two. Traffic reached 180 visitors with 22 email signups from people who found the content through search. Week seven through ten brought clear validation signals. Traffic hit 450 visitors and 67 email signups from organic search. These people actively searched for solutions to the problem, found my content, and wanted early access.\n\nHad conversations with 20 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried and why those failed. All this validation happened before building anything. Now starting development with clear product direction validated by real search demand. Those 67 signups aren't just random interest, they're people who have the problem severe enough to search for solutions.\n\nThe startup idea lesson is that organic validation gives better signal quality than paid ads. People finding you through search have real intent and active problems. Ad traffic can be curiosity clicks from people who don't actually need your solution. If you're about to spend months building, validate demand through organic search first. The channel keeps working after validation too, unlike paid validation that stops when budget runs out.",

Most agencies I know that were successful were started by people with deep industry connections and these connections gave them the \"in\" necessary to do sales.  Initial sales for an agency are one of the hardest parts - you have no rep.\n\nThe other way in, which I used for my agency, was to jump on the latest wave and offer services.  But this was easier for me because I\"m very technical. However, you can find a co-founder to handle the tech while you handle sales.\n\nSo you have two tasks:  \n1.

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months promoting my project on Reddit. Went viral, got removed by moderators, and everything in between.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n* **Launch posts (work)**: there are a ton of communities that let you showcase your product without getting banned, I made a list of subreddits with my target audience -> read the community guidelines on self-promotion -> checked if they have a dedicated flair or a designated day (usually on Saturday) -> shared my product. The first time it didn’t get any views/upvotes but I continued working on the copy until I found one that goes viral regularly. My best tips?\n   1. *Match the tone of the community*: this is what makes the difference between going viral and getting ignored (or banned).\n   2. *Subreddit size doesn’t matter that much*: people ignore smaller communities, but I had the same post go viral in a 95K subreddit and in a 9.5K one and got nearly the same visits to my project.\n   3. *Let Reddit help you*: if you’re struggling to find subreddits that match your product go to Reddit ads page -> setup your account -> click \"create campaign\" -> insert keywords related to your product and Reddit will auto suggest the most relevant subreddits.\n* **Shameless plugs (work, but probably I shouldn’t say it)**: general advice to write a comment to promote your product is something along the lines of *\"I had the same problem last year. Tried a bunch of solutions but found \\[tool\\] worked best for my use case. The key was \\[specific feature\\]. Went from \\[before state\\] to \\[after state\\] in about \\[timeframe\\]\"*. That’s a lot of work and not always needed. If your product is a direct answer to the question just share it, but make sure to disclose you’re the founder (proof: one of my shameless plugs got 25 upvotes and a couple hundred visitors to my project).\n* **“What are you building?” posts (don’t work)**: I’ve shared my project in a few “what are you building” posts. Results? Crickets. People are there to write comments, not to read the comments.\n* **Tracking conversations (works)**: I regularly track the visitors coming from reddit and their conversion rates. I don’t always have the time to leave a reply but just scrolling trought the comments helps me better understand users (I’ve already stolen a couple of ideas to improve my copy). If you have no idea about what to track, start with competitor mentions, keywords related to the problem/pain point you solve, or mentions of specific features.\n* **DMs (don’t scale)**: I’m not really a fan of DMs, Reddit is great at getting views and moving the conversation in 1vs1 won’t get you any. They only make sense when you fear your comment could be downvoted into oblivion.\n* **Content Strategy (not sure)**: I’ve shared me journey or growth experiments or just posts I thought would be interesting for my audience. (7 months of \"vibe coding\" a SaaS and here's what nobody tells you, You WILL Reach $10K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine),I studied 47 SaaS products that went from 0 to 10k MRR last year. Here's what they all did right),\n* for context my project is a [saas tool](https://brandled.app/) sometimes adding a link at the end or a softfer CTA inviting to check out my project. Some got a few thousand views, others were so bad that they didn’t even get AI-generated comments. However, none of them brought a significant spike in visitors (probably a skill issue on my side).\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 550k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips on marketing on Reddit.",

The exact same post can:\n\n* flop from a cold account\n* survive (or even stick) from someone who’s been commenting for weeks\n\nReddit rewards *continuity*, not just copy.\n\nAlso agree hard on smaller subreddits. They’re underrated because people chase upvotes instead of **qualified clicks**. A 10k sub where people actually read beats a 100k sub doomscrolling.\n\n550k impressions with this approach is no joke.

I left due to issues with my co founder.\n\nI then moved to Berlin and worked as EIR in a food delivery company, where I opened a new business unit that after a few months was generating 65k per month. I closed deals with companies like WeWork, Zalando, TomTom and King.\n\nWorking for others is not my thing. Today was my last day, I quit.\n\nI’m currently building a ERP that will be ready for the market next week, with two customers ready to buy. Still, I’m looking for something bigger, to work on a real dream.\n\nIf you’re building something cool in SF, reach out. I’m non technical, looking for people around my age with real hunger who have already built things.\n\nContact me on LinkedIn Darijan Ducic. If I don’t reply, it means I’m not interested.",
