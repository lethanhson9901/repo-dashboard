Let's assume this is your expertise and that you have the competencies. Look around: what do you see? A lot of paperwork, expensive drugs, insurance companies refusing to pay... Write down what you're unhappy with. Then ask people (doctors or patients—it depends on what you wrote down) if they perceive this as a problem? Are they willing to pay for its solution? If so, congratulations. You've passed the first level. \n\nI'm ready to look at your list of problems and help you move on to the second level :)",

That means there are millions of problems on Reddit\n\nThe number of people in each subreddit means the number of people seeking solutions, note these numbers are crazy large in some sub reddits and small in others(that tells you how high the demand for the solution of the problem is)\n\nNow imagine this, extrapolate each of those subreddit(problems), and people on them as people seeking solutions. Now imagine how many people that not on Reddit but have the problems of the subreddit(the rest of country or the world). That's a large audience \n\nNow use Google to find people looking for the main topic of each subreddit(example r/side hustle) Google \"I need a side hustle\" or \"looking for a side hustle\" \n\nNow you have problems to solve and people who are looking for solutions to that problem",

Startups are NOT for everyone, even though they’ve become a “fancy” thing to do.\n\nMost people who want to do startups approach it the wrong way. \nReal entrepreneurs usually never set out to “do a startup”. They were passionate about creating or obsessed with solving a problem and eventually realized they had no choice but to build something.\n\nSo shift your mindset. Ask yourself: can you create something people want or solve a real problem, preferably in a domain you understand? \nIf yes, just build a solution. Forget “startup”. Do not overthink. Just create a product.\n\nIf it works, great. Then evaluate milestones carefully and grow from there. If it doesn’t, you’ll still learn something valuable. You may discover that startups are not for you, but indie hacking, freelancing, or an agency model might be.\n\nDo not draw conclusions first and then try to justify them backwards. Do what you can do now, and let the journey unfold naturally.",

      "text": "\n\n\nEveryone shares their overnight success stories, nobody talks about the boring middle where growth is slow and you question everything weekly. Started working on my current product in August 2023, it's December 2024 now and I'm at $4.8K MRR. Took way longer than I hoped but thought sharing the real timeline might help someone else set realistic expectations.\n\nSpent first 6 weeks just talking to people in my target market, which is content creators struggling to repurpose their content across platforms. Had maybe 30 conversations total, mostly through cold DMs which had like a 15% response rate. Most conversations were helpful but didn't lead anywhere. About 8 people had the exact problem I was thinking of solving, and when I asked what they currently do, most said they just manually do it or hire a VA. Asked if they'd pay for a tool, got a lot of \"depends on price\" and \"maybe\" which I learned means no.\n\nBuilt an MVP anyway because I was impatient, took me 3 weeks using some starter code I bought for $100. Launched it on Product Hunt in October 2023, got 89 upvotes which felt good, 47 signups, 3 people upgraded to paid at $19/month. That $57 MRR felt incredible even though it was basically nothing. Next 4 months were brutal though, only grew to like $240 MRR by February, was seriously considering quitting.\n\nAround March I started writing blog posts because someone suggested it, honestly just trying anything at that point. Wrote about content repurposing strategies, not even mentioning my tool much. Posted them in Reddit communities and Medium. First few posts got maybe 20 views each, felt like a waste of time. But I kept doing it because what else was I going to do. Month 3 of consistent posting, one article randomly started ranking on Google and brought in 15 signups in a week. That gave me hope.\n\nKept writing 2-3 posts weekly through summer, sometimes wanted to quit because results felt so slow. But by August I was at $1.8K MRR mostly from organic search. September hit $2.4K, October $3.1K, November $3.9K, now at $4.8K in December. Growth is still not explosive, adding maybe 30-40 signups weekly with about 25% converting to paid. But it's steady and mostly autopilot now from SEO.\n\nThe honest truth is this took way longer than I wanted and I almost quit multiple times. The posts that inspired me to keep going came from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) where founders shared their actual month-by-month numbers including the boring middle, not just the highlights. Seeing that someone else was at $400 MRR in month 6 and eventually hit $20K made me realize my slow growth wasn't failure, just reality. If you're in the slow middle right now, you're not alone.",

      "text": "If you're looking for a sweaty startup to acquire rather than start from scratch, moving companies are insanely undervalued right now. Why? Most moving companies are run by guys who are GREAT at moving furniture but absolutely clueless about business fundamentals. I'm talking no real bookkeeping, zero marketing beyond a Facebook page, competing on price instead of value, and leaving money on the table everywhere.\n\nBought a struggling 2-truck operation for $45K last year. Owner was doing maybe $120K annual revenue, working 70-hour weeks, ready to quit. I looked under the hood and it was a goldmine of low-hanging fruit:\n\n* Ranked on page 4 of Google (aka invisible)\n* No email follow-up system for quotes\n* Pricing way below market\n* Zero upsells (packing, storage, supplies)\n* Terrible website that screamed \"I made this in 2009\"\n* No tracking of lead sources or conversion rates\n\nBasically printing money if you just ran it like an actual business.\n\nI fixed first (in order of impact) - marketing was the biggest lever. Most movers think Craigslist posts and yard signs are \"marketing.\" Nah. I partnered with [mover marketing AI](https://www.movermarketing.ai)  to handle SEO and Google Business Profile optimization - within 5 months we were ranking top 3 in the Map Pack. Lead volume went from maybe 20/month to 60+/month. That alone changed everything.\n\n\\+ implemented proper CRM, automated quote follow-ups, raised prices 25% (lost zero customers), added packing services as default upsells, hired better and paid more to retain good crews.\n\nCurrent numbers (month 16):\n\n* Revenue: $1.2M annualized\n* Profit margin: 18% (up from like 8%)\n* Working maybe 20 hours/week on the business\n* Listed it for sale last month at $380K\n\nAnd this works cause moving has high demand, low barrier to entry means lots of poorly-run companies to acquire cheap, and the fixes are straightforward if you know basic business principles. You're not reinventing the wheel - just applying competence to an industry that lacks it.\n\nYou gotta be willing to get your hands dirty initially. I drove trucks for the first 3 months to understand operations before delegating. Can't fix what you don't understand.\n\nAnyone else doing acquisition plays in traditional service industries? Feels like there's gold everywhere if you know where to look.",

      "text": "\nUsed to spend 4-6 months building each idea before showing it to anyone, then launching to complete silence. Did that twice over 2 years, wasted probably $7K and countless hours. Decided to completely change my approach and test ideas way faster before committing to building anything substantial. The new process was forcing myself to validate demand before touching code. For each idea I'd spend 2 weekends just researching, finding people actively complaining about the problem on Reddit and forums, DMing 15-20 of them asking about their current solutions and what frustrated them most. If fewer than 10 people responded or showed real interest, I'd kill it immediately and move to the next idea.\n\nIdea 1 was a scheduling tool for consultants. Found maybe 8 complaints total, got 3 DM responses, nobody seemed that bothered by current solutions. Killed it after one weekend. Idea 2 was a content calendar for small agencies. Found 25+ complaints, got 12 responses, but when I asked if they'd pay $39/month most said probably not or maybe $15. Pricing signal was too weak, killed it after weekend two. Idea 3 was invoice tracking for freelancers. Found 40+ complaints, DMed 30 people, got 18 responses with real frustration about losing track of unpaid invoices. When I asked about paying $19/month, 7 people said yes immediately. Built a landing page that weekend describing the solution, posted it back in those communities, got 32 email signups and 4 people actually paid upfront through Stripe giving me $76 before building anything. That validation felt completely different from the previous two.\n\nSpent 3 weeks building the simplest version, launched it to those 32 people, got 9 more paying in week one. That was 7 months ago, now at $2.1K monthly with 114 paying users. Growth is steady at 10-15% monthly, mostly from word of mouth and organic search from blog posts I started writing in month 3. The fast validation approach came from studying founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful people killed bad ideas in days not months. Saved me from wasting 8-12 months building ideas 1 and 2 that would've failed. Now I can test 3-4 ideas in the time it used to take me to build one wrong one.",

The app pins the exact location with the photo and an optional comment. Each post stays visible for 24 hours, and the marker changes color from green to red as time passes, indicating how recent the sighting is.\n\nI also added a separate “Lost Pets” tab where owners can publish their missing pets with a phone number and a direct WhatsApp link. This allows people to either search directly on the map or browse the list of reported lost pets. On the web version, everything can be viewed simultaneously.\n\nThe app is ready to be launched at any moment.\n\nI know similar ideas exist, but I couldn’t find one that works exactly like this, so I decided to build it myself.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.",

          "text": "Since you asked for it.\n\nThis is solving a problem that doesn't exist at scale, and the execution reveals fundamental misunderstandings about both lost pets and user behavior.\n\nFirst, the core premise is backwards. When someone loses a pet, they don't wander around hoping strangers spot it and upload photos to a niche app. They post on Facebook, Nextdoor, Instagram, and local community groups where millions of actual users already exist. Your app has zero users, which means zero sightings, which means zero value. You're asking people to download and check a ghost town app instead of using platforms they're already on.\n\nThe \"real-time photo upload\" feature is completely redundant. If someone sees a lost pet, they're already taking a photo and posting it to Facebook/Nextdoor with infinitely more reach. Why would they also download your app, create an account, and upload it again to your empty map? They wouldn't.\n\nThe 24-hour expiration is arbitrary and potentially harmful. Lost pets are often found days or weeks later. A sighting from 3 days ago is still valuable information about movement patterns and territory. You're deleting useful data for no reason except that you thought a color-changing timer sounded clever.\n\nThe separate \"Lost Pets\" tab completely undermines your own positioning. If owners are posting there with phone numbers and WhatsApp links, that's just a worse version of existing lost pet databases and Facebook groups. You haven't built anything new; you've built a fragmented, inferior clone of tools that already work.\n\n\"Ready to be launched at any moment\" but hasn't been launched tells me you know it won't gain traction. You're afraid to validate because deep down you understand nobody will use this. The app needs both pet owners AND random strangers to adopt it simultaneously to have any utility, which is a chicken-and-egg problem you have no strategy to solve.\n\nThe market has already decided this doesn't work. Similar apps exist and failed because lost pet recovery happens through network effects on existing social platforms, not through purpose-built apps with zero distribution. You've built a technically functional solution to a problem that's already better solved by posting in Facebook groups with actual community engagement.\n\nLaunch it if you want proof, but you'll get maybe 5 downloads from friends and then crickets. This isn't a startup, it's a portfolio piece pretending to be one.",

I am good with anything tech-related and can probably build quite anything with a little bit of time, app, saas, cybersecurity, CAD, AI pipeline/fine tune... (except obviously high cost technologies like building my own AI model) not to the level of a professional specialized developer but still enough for most cases. I think where I am the best is with science related things like maths, particle physics, mechanics, medicine, biology, finance... I consider that I have a very broad understanding of these disciplines, which let me learn specific subject deeply quite fast, I'm used to learning from the last research papers and applying to real world problems. I think however that while not being awful (I had an e-com business few years ago that was working great) I'm generally not good at prospection, marketing, communication, management... Still something I could do if needed.\n\nI am very motivated and willing to spend all the time and motivation I have on a startup as an associate figuring out and building solutions to real world problems with little means. The only thing I ask is someone in the same mindset, serious and really passionate about his project. If you need anyone, let's talk about it.\n\nEdit : As some people won't believe me when I saw famous uni, fuck my privacy, I'm at EPFL/ETHZ\n\nEdit 2 : Thank you everyone, I recieved a LOT of message, had really interesting discussion with a lot of differents people and today I don't have time to discuss with everyone in details about their project, however if you still have something and you think I would really fit with you, text me, I'll try to answer",

      "text": "Startup founder sharing unconventional timing strategy that worked. Started building backlinks and SEO foundation 90 days before product launch instead of waiting until launch day. Result was launching with 840 monthly organic visitors and DA 29 ready to convert versus competitors launching to empty room. The strategic insight was inverting typical startup timeline. Most founders perfect product then start distribution. But SEO takes 90-120 days to show results regardless of product quality. If we built backlink foundation during final beta months we'd have both ready simultaneously instead of launching then spending 4 months building distribution from zero.\n\nDay 1 of 90-day pre-launch period started SEO work. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to establish domain authority through 200+ placements. Published 3 foundational posts targeting buyer-intent keywords. Set up Analytics and Search Console. Domain authority: 0→11 in first 30 days.\n\nDays 1-45 built content library while finishing product. Published 12 blog posts total targeting problem-aware searches and comparison keywords. Domain authority reached 21 as directory backlinks indexed. Getting 240 monthly organic visitors to pre-launch landing page collecting 34 email signups.\n\nDays 46-90 showed acceleration into launch. Published 8 more posts (20 total). Updated earlier content with examples. Domain authority hit 29. Getting 840 monthly organic visitors. Collected 87 email signups from organic traffic. Ranking for 38 keywords with 14 in top 20 positions.\n\nLaunch day results showed advantage of pre-launch SEO. Had 840 monthly organic visitors ready to convert immediately, 87 waitlist signups from organic traffic to activate day one, domain authority 29 giving credibility for partnerships and press, ranking foundation for 38 keywords to optimize and scale.\n\nPost-launch month one hit $4200 MRR with 58% from organic versus competitors spending $8K+ on ads for similar revenue. The 90-day head start meant we were profitable month one while they burned cash catching up on distribution they should've built pre-launch.\n\nInvestment over 90 days was minimal. GetMoreBacklinks $127 one-time, hosting $18 monthly ($54 total), tools $35 monthly ($105 total), total $286 to establish foundation generating 840 monthly visitors. Compare to paid ads at $4-8 per visitor meaning $3360-6720 ad spend for same traffic. What worked specifically for pre-launch SEO was directory submissions establishing DA 0 to 21 in 45 days, publishing consistently even though product wasn't ready, targeting buyer-intent keywords showing commercial intent, collecting emails from organic visitors building launch list, optimizing for conversion since traffic was limited.\n\nFor other startups the playbook is start building backlinks 90 days before launch not after, use final beta period to establish domain authority and content, publish 15-20 posts targeting buyer keywords before launch, collect emails from organic traffic building launch audience, and launch with distribution ready not scrambling to build it. The mistake most startups make is sequential timeline: build product then distribution. Reality is both should happen in parallel. The 90-120 day SEO timeline fits perfectly with final beta phase. Starting early means launching with customers not launching to silence hoping to figure out distribution later when runway is burning.",

The product direction was clear, but choosing a name that felt distinctive, matched the vision, and wasn’t immediately blocked by domain issues turned into a bigger bottleneck than expected.\n\nI noticed that when naming, domain checks, and visual identity are handled separately, it’s easy to get stuck in endless loops of second-guessing. Seeing everything together seems to help some founders commit faster. I came across tools like BrandScoop that bundle name ideas with domain availability and basic visual direction, which made me think more about *process* than any specific tool.\n\nFor those who’ve been through this phase already: do you prioritize speed and iterate later, or do you believe getting naming and branding mostly right early on saves time downstream? I’d be interested in how different teams approach this tradeoff.",

In that case, the “better solution” would probably be a competitor app (not something in a different category like the camera example). \n\nBut that said, I just think I don’t have very many needs/problems that are solved by mobile apps!",

If this is for serious founders or prospective founders, isn’t safe to assume people will be serious and won’t be ghosting people? \n\nI only checked out your website very quickly but a few notes: \n\n- I think it’s a solid idea. I can’t see what a profile would look like because I don’t see anyone there yet of course. So how are people going to promote themselves? what level of details are they to go into to share experience levels and background? \n\n- what makes people want to use this over LinkedIn? Or Y-combinator matching or cofounderslab? It felt like maybe that was the 72 hours idea but if you were to ask me I’d sometimes go more than 3 days without replying to an email let alone a match. \n\nOther less important but good to point out: \n\n- the name is difficult in particular the URL having 3 same letters in a row. This is not very common and that’s cause it leads to human errors. \n\n- Orange and white are typically colours associated with a cheap/bargain feeling. I assume for a platform like this that’s not the feeling you wanna give. \n\nJust a few of my notes.",

Sharing media through personal chats gets messy fast, and many people don’t want to share their phone numbers with strangers just to exchange photos.\nAnother problem I noticed is that the best photos are often taken by visitors, not the event planners, and those moments usually get lost. Guests don’t know where to send them, and organizers never get access to the best content from their own events.\nSo far, we’ve had:\n✔️100+ users\n✔️30+ events created\n✔️300+ photos and videos shared\nAll of this has been organic. Right now, I’m still working on the revenue side and testing what people are actually willing to pay for.\nPosting here mainly to learn:\n📌 what monetization models could work for a product like this\n📌 how others turned early traction into revenue\n📌 mistakes to avoid at this stage\nHappy to share more details or a link if anyone’s interested.",

Not people whose kids’ names you have to remember or who you have to ask about their last vacation.

But I’m thinking minimal: topic selection, maybe a brief “what do you want to talk about?” Then you connect voice.\n\nOn the AI moderation side - I’m less worried about monitoring calls for scams and more interested in AI helping with better matching. Like, it asks you clarifying questions to get to what you actually want to talk about (not just surface level), then matches you with someone who’s in a similar place.\n\nThe tricky part is the transition: how do you go from “I selected ‘early stage startup idea’” to actually having a deep, meaningful conversation? \n\nI don’t have that figured out yet. Maybe the AI gives each person a brief summary of what the other wants to discuss? Or suggests conversation starters? Open to ideas.\n\nWhat made you think about this problem?",

You’ll never be matched with that person again automatically.\n\n\t3.\tReputation/trust system - like Reddit’s upvote/downvote but for behavior. If multiple people exit calls with you immediately or report you, your account gets flagged/suspended. This discourages people from being creepy because it affects their ability to use the platform.\n\n\t4.\tGradual access - maybe you can’t match immediately on day 1. Need some history/trust built first.\n\n\t5.\tMutual opt-in to reconnect - after a conversation, both people have to choose to connect again. One person can’t force continued contact.\n\nThe goal isn’t perfect security (impossible), but making it annoying enough for bad actors that they go elsewhere while keeping it easy for genuine people. Bad behavior has consequences.\n\nWhat else would make you feel safe using something like this?",

Based on that conversation (word choice, self-awareness, how they articulate problems), AI builds a matching profile.\nThis is similar to how TikTok learns what content you want without you telling it, except it’s learning what kind of PERSON you’d connect with based on how you communicate.\n\nYour event search approach is interesting.

Interests are fractal, and for needs into particular things small differences become chasms.\n\nHow people overcome those chasms is repeat interactions between the same people, which can only be achieved below the Dunbar number. \n\nAside from the fact that even with AI onboarding you won't be able to overcome the density problem of matching people at the exact moment that they want to talk.\n\nAnd that doesn't even mention the fact that people know they're talking to an AI and will lie to an extent, trying to confuse it and to trip up the AI to see if they can push it to say things you don't intend. You might assume that this isn't a problem, those people won't get matched, but:\n\n1. generative AI is not deterministic\n\n2. it's expensive, and these users haven't paid yet. \n\nCustomer service is a cost basis. Companies like the one you work for literally have to pay for it, either a person or an AI. But you're trying to monetise the cost basis after spending the money. That takes a lot of money, because you're banking on enough engagement (cost) to justify investment. \n\nBest case scenario for you is that you manage to stitch it together yourself, like Clubhouse, because you won't find a developer. Ask yourself why Clubhouse didn't do this? Audio social networks have been around for a while now. It's because of the density problem. Clubhouse were new enough that if generative AI made a difference it would have prevented them from failing.\n\nIn my view the only way to solve the loneliness and atomisation pandemic is by bringing people together in physical spaces, using LLMs to aggregate event data, which is then monetised like Substack and Patreon, but for event based creators (artists, teachers, organisers, speakers).",

But you just unlocked a massive B2B angle I hadn’t fully considered.\n\nThink about finding a realtor right now: you see a headshot, a phone number, maybe some reviews. Zero idea if you’ll actually vibe with them. So you either ask friends (limited options) or “date around” meeting 3-4 realtors in person (exhausting and awkward).\nWhat if you could have a 15-minute real-time conversation with available realtors who match your preference’s. Immediately know if they get your communication style, if they listen, if they’re pushy, whatever matters to you.\n\nSame for therapists (people “shop” for therapists constantly), financial advisors, wedding vendors, contractors, business coaches, really any professional service that’s relationship-based. The professional gets qualified leads who already like their vibe. The customer gets to filter for fit before wasting anyone’s time.\n\nIs that what you’re building for realtors? Or are you solving a different connection problem?\n\nAlso, what’s your unpopular programming method? I’m genuinely curious.\n\nYou’ve already helped me see this differently, if you think of more ways to collaborate or have other ideas, definitely let me know. Thanks for engaging!",

More “builder-mode.” In reality it cost months of work building the wrong thing really well. Code wasn’t the problem. Assumptions were.\n\nSecond close one was cheap talent or tools to move faster early. You don’t save money, you just defer the bill with interest. Rewrites, churn, lost trust, missed windows.\n\nThe pattern is pretty consistent. The stuff that feels uncomfortable upfront, talking to users, writing things down, paying for reliability, usually ends up being the cheapest path. The shortcuts mostly just hide the cost until it’s bigger and harder to unwind.",

What I’m looking for is someone who enjoys turning products into scalable businesses.\n\nThe Products\n\n\\-AI-powered SaaS and internal tools\n\n\\-Web-based, with some products suitable for mobile apps\n\n\\-Strong potential for B2B and bulk-usage pricing\n\n\\-MVPs complete or near-complete, ready for launch and iteration\n\n\\-Fully bootstrapped, no investors\n\n\\-What’s Already Done\n\n\\-Original software products\n\n\\-Landing pages, promo sites, and branding\n\n\\-Fast development cycle with multiple products in the pipeline\n\n**What I’m Looking For Help With**\n\nConnecting payments (Stripe or alternative, you must have an account)\n\nLaunching and managing the websites\n\nCustomer onboarding, basic support, and feedback loops\n\nMarketing experiments, distribution, and growth\n\nManaging subscriptions, users, and analytics\n\nSubmitting to marketplaces like AppSumo when the model fits\n\nBonus: Has experience working with investors or knows how to approach angels/VCs once traction is established.\n\n**Who You Are**\n\nReliable, responsive, and comfortable owning outcomes\n\nFamiliar with SaaS tooling: payments, hosting, analytics, funnels\n\nEntrepreneurial and self-directed (not looking for step-by-step instructions)\n\nSome experience with product launches, growth, or B2B marketing\n\nInterested in a long-term, equity-based partnership\n\nBonus if you’ve launched or scaled a SaaS product before\n\n**Structure**\n\nEquity-based (not a paid role)\n\nLong-term partnership\n\nI focus on building products; you focus on business, growth, and operations\n\nMultiple products over time, not a one-off project\n\nIf this sounds like a fit, send me a message with a bit about your background and what you’ve worked on.

One product, one ICP, one acquisition loop, one monetization path. When that’s clear, things like Stripe, onboarding, funnels, and distribution stop being vague tasks and start becoming levers you can actually pull.\n\nFrom experience, the fastest progress happens when someone owns that whole loop end-to-end instead of spreading it across “marketing + ops + vibes.” That’s usually where real momentum shows up.\n\nOut of curiosity, which of your products right now feels closest to having a clear buyer and repeatable use case?

Only posts from people with a real startup or MVP.\n2. Keep pitches short, clear, and honest.\n3. Investors should reach out via DM; no spammy comments.\n4. Be respectful and supportive.. this is about connecting, not criticizing.\n\nIf you’re a founder seeking funding or an investor looking for new opportunities, this subreddit is for you.

Especially if your product is b to c?\n\n- Because I hardly feel productive, I make posts, then I post on X, LinkedIn and reddit....sometimes peerlist.... (Doesn't take more then 1-2 hours, and sometimes worst thought post works best so there is even less correlation)\n\n- Majority of the launching platforms products are listed (just took 2-3 days), then what? \n\n- Send DM's to relevant users (1 hour )\n\n- SEO is already done so can't change everyday, as atleast 2-3 weeks we need time to understand if it's working....\n\n\nSo when you say focus on marketing 90% of the time, I just feel clueless like in 4-5 hours it's done....if I strech enough\n\nSo what do you do when you mention marketing aggressively and spend majority of the time marketing?

      "text": "Hi all, first thanks for reading this post. I am looking for a serious cofounder to continue the startup adventure with me.\n\nA little about me: I am already full time. I quitted my job a little over year ago with another cofounder. But after one unsuccessful pivot, my cofounder decided to leave. But I still don't want to give up yet. So here I am looking for similar minded folks!\n\nWhat I can offer as a cofounder:\n\n1. Technical skills. I was a ML scientist for Amazon and have a PhD in computational math before starting the adventure. So I have a solid foundation for coding (mostly backend). In my previous startup, me and my cofounder created two AI-based softwares from ground up and get some sales.\n2. Customer development. I am also the one who is doing all the cold outreach, customer interviews and help refine the product vision and refine the ICP\n3. Persistence and commitment. I like to invest in relationship. So if I decide to work with you, you don't have to worry I give up easily.\n4. Domain expertise in some area. Especially in education, tech, and finance (passed CFA II). So we can discuss some startup ideas in this area if you are interested. But I am open to other ideas\n\nWhat I want my cofounders to bring to the table\n\n1. Must be in Seattle area and willing to meet 3-4 times in person a week. I want to build a real relationship with my cofounders\n2. Must be already full time. Not against who is doing side hustles. Just based on my personal experience. I had tried to start a business with some one who only did the startup as a side hustle. It was a terrible mistake and invited a lot of frustrations and grudge against each other which I want to avoid again\n3. No specific preference for technical or nontechnical. But if you are non-technical, hope you are domain expert in the area that you want to start a startup in. My past year told me that founder-market fit is crucial.\n\nAgain thanks for reading and please feel free to DM me if you are interested!",

Or they’re built for inspiration, not hiring. So you either get spam or vibes, rarely clarity.\n\nA few of us started talking about this and realized something obvious in hindsight:  \nFor designers, platforms like Dribbble and Behance work because discovery comes first.  \nFor video editors, there isn’t really an equivalent that’s hiring-focused.\n\nSo we started building a small platform where:\n\n* Editors showcase their work properly, not just links dumped in DMs\n* Clients browse portfolios first, then reach out\n* Conversations stay on-platform, without everyone racing to exchange phone numbers\n* No bidding wars, no proposal spam\n\nNot trying to “disrupt” anything. Just trying to remove friction that shouldn’t exist in the first place.\n\nIt’s still early. Rough edges everywhere. A lot to learn.  \nBut the goal is simple: make hiring video editors feel calmer, clearer, and more professional for both sides.\n\nPosting this here mostly to share the idea and hear thoughts.  \nIf you’re an editor or someone who’s hired one before, you probably know the pain points better than anyone.\n\nSometimes the best products come from being quietly annoyed for a very long time.",

      "text": "Hiring still feels very resume and ATS driven. A lot of candidates feel they get filtered out early because of keywords, formatting, or not having the “right” experience on paper, even when they can actually do the job. This seems especially common for entry to mid level roles, career switchers, and self taught folks.\n\nOn the hiring side, recruiters and hiring managers get flooded with resumes. Many are heavily tailored or exaggerated, which makes it hard to quickly tell who’s genuinely capable and who just optimized their resume well. This feels even worse in high volume hiring.\n\nI’m exploring an idea for a skill first hiring platform where resumes aren’t used at the start. Instead, candidates would complete role relevant challenges like problem solving tasks, simulations, or quizzes. Candidates would be anonymous initially, and shortlisting would be based on performance. Resumes or profiles would only be shown later once candidates have already proven their skills.\n\nThe goal is to reduce resume bias, discourage fake or overly optimized resumes, and give capable candidates a fairer shot. This is very early, idea stage only, and I’m trying to validate whether this problem actually matters before building anything.\n\nCompanies would pay to hire through the platform. Candidates wouldn’t pay.\n\nFor people who’ve hired or applied recently, does this problem resonate or am I overestimating how broken resume screening is? Would you trust challenge based shortlisting before seeing resumes, or would you still want resumes upfront? And what would make you not use something like this? Cheating, fairness, stress on candidates, legal issues, time cost, or something else?\n\nLooking for honest and critical feedback. If this is a bad idea, I’d rather hear it now.",

This is how I hired the last few times I’ve hired - every applicant (except those from locations where we couldn’t hire) got a simple challenge, which we reviewed mostly anonymously. The challenges were very, very specific to the role, and designed to legitimately only take 10 minutes. I’m guessing some candidates took longer (like half an hour) to perfect it (but that didn’t make them more likely to pass). I designed my challenges to filter about 50% of candidates who submitted it (and maybe 50% ended up submitting, so this got us down to 25%). These challenges are hard to get right, and were very role specific, so the hard part in my view for you will be figuring out that part. The way I hire, I don’t really care as much about broad skills, so things like “good at Python” (I’m in software engineering) would not matter to me (so general challenges probably won’t work).\n\nAs a candidate I would be incredibly suspicious, but the market is terrible so I would probably do it. Generally these types of challenges are either really time-consuming or just stupid and don’t evaluate skills that I believe actually matter for the role. I took quite a few testgorilla assessments while I was applying, as a first step in some hiring processes, and I generally got the sense that these were not companies I wanted to work for, even though I passed them, because I didn’t think they understood the role they were hiring for and didn’t feel like they respected my time.",

The idea is to have a bit of money and something real to work with once I’m there.\n\nI’ve tried a few different ideas already and realised I should probably do something I actually know about, so I’ve decided on starting an \"education based business\". A few years ago, a guy who used to go to my school came back and talked about how he scaled his tuition business to six figures while he was in first year college. He basically hired high-scoring classmates and students from nearby schools as tutors.\n\nAcademically I’m doing well, so for anyone who’s going to say focus on school, dw that’s already a priority - but the thing is I gotta get this business stuff right so I don't waste time (which is where I could use some of y'alls guidance). There’s clearly a big demand for tutoring, especially from Asian parents, I can relate to that, but I don’t really want to start straight with tutoring right now cause tbh I don't really know how to - I mean I do have some friends who are first year college students who scored well on their exams but yeah....\n\nAtm its still early-stage. I’ve been making free guides on how to do well in my curriculum just to build some brand awareness. The curriculum I’m targeting is international, so I can reach students worldwide, not just locally. Even though I haven’t graduated yet, I still think there’s value in sharing what I’ve learned and turning that into guides and resources.\n\nI’ve also made a basic website and store using Payhip and I’m trying to promote it through Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBasically I’m asking how I should tackle this at my stage. What should I focus on, what should I avoid, and how do I turn this into something that’s actually worthwhile?",

Photo logging, restaurant finder (60+ cities), AI coach, meal planning.\n\n**Why:** Went plant-based in 2023 while traveling Southeast Asia. Existing apps like Cronometer and MFP are built for barcode scanning and packaged food. Logging a homemade meal with 8 ingredients was painful enough that I'd just... not do it.\n\n**The journey:**\n\n* Started building early 2024\n* Solo dev, no funding, bootstrapped\n* Been nomading through Thailand, Vietnam, Bali while building\n* Launched a few months ago\n* Current users: small but growing\n* Revenue: $0 (free for now, figuring out monetization)\n\n**What's working:**\n\n* Reddit discussion posts get engagement (90K views on one post about tracking frustrations)\n* Problem is validated - people relate to the pain\n* Restaurant database is a differentiator nobody else has\n\n**What's not working:**\n\n* Converting interest to signups\n* \"Link in profile\" gets almost zero clicks\n* Some vegan communities are hostile to AI (learned that the hard way)\n\n**Honest question for this community:** At what point do you start charging? I'm torn between growing users first vs validating willingness to pay early.\n\nSite: [nourii.app](https://nourii.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the tech, the grind, or the SEA nomad life.",

Specifically, it is a combination of tool I created and my expert knowledge in DevOps, with the help of which I generate detailed reports for cost savings, currently exclusively on the AWS cloud. In short, since this is what I do professionally, I often saw people overpaying for cloud services, so I gathered all the best practices and principles that I personally applied and recommended, and automated them a bit. In addition, I created a landing page and a blog, because I like to write, so I included that as part of this as well.\n\nSo my business model would be (in addition to the free option) that I offer anyway, that if I manage to find opportunities for savings, I charge for it, and if not, then I do not charge anything.\n\nLink to website: [costlyfy](https://www.costlyfy.com/)",
