      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed a pattern where many founders come up with a \"brand new\" idea, only to realize later that it was attempted (and burned through millions in VC funding) back in 2014.\n\nI actually enjoy digging through the history of the tech industry, so I started collecting data on closed-down startups and failed businesses going back to the dotcoms. It’s fascinating to see why they failed, sometimes it was bad timing, sometimes it was no product-market fit, and sometimes they just ran out of cash.\n\nI organized all this data into a searchable archive. If you are brainstorming a new venture, you might want to check if someone has already paid the \"tuition\" for learning that lesson so you don't have to.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.loot-drop.io\n\nI’d love to hear if you can find any \"ghosts\" of ideas you’re \n\ncurrently working on!",

I love sharing stories like this cause its just crazy how simple the idea was - two random dudes fix one annoying problem and accidentally create a whole multi-billion dollar category.\n\nInstagram was notorious for being bad with links. For years you were only be able to put like 1 or 2 links in your bio... and the way they were displayed was a complete turnoff. Nick and Anthony, a couple of Aussies with a marketing agency, spent 6 hours making a page where they can cram all their artist promo links under one roof. \n\nIt was a damn side project…\n\nQuickly they saw others in the space complaining about stuff like not being able to promote their gigs or merch, and decided to spread their lil solution. The \"homie try this\" hook, was all the validation they needed to press the gas. Brands started using it, creators adopting it, small businesses putting their hair salon locations on 1 stop homepages. \n\nThat was the birth of the \"link in bio\" market uprising. \n\nNot only did they completely shift focus from a small agency, to a 1 page - all link storefront named Linktree, they created an entirely new ecosystem that prints money for pretty much everyone. Tens of millions of users, billions of clicks every month, with a billion-plus valuation...\n\n...all because they made one tiny thing less annoying.\n\nPretty cool story ngl, but it doesn't stop there. The 'Link-in-bio\" market has created opportunities for almost everyone to make their business easier to sell. Companies like [Linkshop](http://linkshop.bio/) make it hella easy for small businesses to sell products without an entire store. If you don't have physical products but got sell digital courses/products to sell - [Stan store](http://stan.store/) was pretty much made for you. Beacons ai is also very popular among creators for like media kit sharing and brand tools. \n\nAnyways not to bore you but it's crazy how such a small blind spot Instagram failed to fix, a couple homies to make an entirely new internet economy. It doesn't take a crazy innovative idea to make millions, just do what other companies aren't willing to. ",

I was looking for a link-in-bio tool that didn't harvest user data or force you to sign up, but literally everything out there logs your info or paywalls the basic analytics. I couldn't find a single zero-log, completely free platform, so I just made one myself. It’s super minimal, dark mode, and you don’t even need an email to set up a page. I also just pushed an update for the stats and now every link on your bio tracks clicks for 24h, 7d, 30d, 1y, and all-time, completely free. Just trying to do what the big companies aren't willing to do anymore: keep it simple and actually respect privacy. I might add a buy me a coffee later on, but currently I just want to hear real feedback. [LNKFST | Link-in-Bio & URL Shortener](https://lnkfst.com)",

      "text": "Below is a breakdown of how the Plant Identifier app ecosystem works, the companies that are part of it, how they make their revenue and some takeaways for how to apply the same strategies. \n\n*Quick note: revenue estimates are from SensorTower and similar tools. They're directional, not exact - actual numbers could be higher or lower. The point is the pattern, not the precise figures.*\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → get name → see relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $27M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they got there first and went harder than anyone on paid acquisition. Were (allegedly) doing 300+ ads running on Meta at any given time.\n\nHow they set themselves apart:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" - biggest numbers in the space = perceived leader\n* Added a Latin pronunciation feature. Tiny thing, but it makes them feel like a serious botanical tool instead of a toy\n* $29.99/year pricing\n* Go hard on ASO - they rank #1 for basically every plant-related keyword\n\nI used it before LLMs were a thing and I remember being genuinely impressed. That initial \"wow this actually works\" reaction matters more than people think for word-of-mouth.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The lesson here is simple - be first and be willing to outspend everyone on marketing. Not groundbreaking advice, but it works.\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't try to out-feature PictureThis. They found audiences that PictureThis wasn't really serving and built for them instead.\n\n* Free for students and educators - creates a viral loop through universities and social media\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" - I honestly don't fully understand wtf this is, but apparently there's a whole community of astrology/spiritual gardeners.\n   * Side note: Sometimes slight differentiations like this are major unlocks to new markets/revenue\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature - human expert access, not just AI\n* Light meter tool (measures if your spot gets enough light) and water calculator - productivity features, not just identification\n\nThey're Ukraine-based, so lower operating costs, and they grew largely through organic/social instead of brute-forcing paid ads.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The move here is obvious in hindsight - don't compete on the same features. Find the audience the market leader isn't serving and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nThis one's interesting because they barely differentiated at all. Plantum is built by AIBY, a company that literally runs an app factory. They clone successful apps at scale, pour money into paid acquisition, and see what sticks.\n\nTheir playbook:\n\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes you don't need a clever angle. You just need solid distribution and a product that doesn't suck. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nThey launched in Turkish and regional markets first where there's way less competition, proved the model with cheaper user acquisition, then expanded to English-speaking markets once they had revenue.\n\n* Better multi-language support than the US-first competitors\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded the expansion\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone Lesson**: By the time they hit the US market, they'd already built a profitable business. Smart play that most founders never consider because everyone defaults to launching in English/US first.\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month (at one point - now closer to $20k)\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nBlossom played the social proof game better than anyone. They won a Webby Award and slap \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" on literally everything. Does a Webby Award actually mean the app is better? Probably not. But does it convert? 100%\n\nThey also carved out the \"edible gardening\" niche - vegetable gardens, herb gardens, garden planning calendars. The other apps were all focused on houseplants and identification. Blossom said \"what about people who grow food?\" and owned that corner.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: I don't know how hard Webby Awards are to win, but the strategy is clear: enter awards, get press, put badges everywhere. Social proof converts really well, even if the award itself is semi-meaningless.\n\n*Kind of reminds me of 30-under-30 being a \"this person is legit\" signal, though nowadays maybe not, since so many end up in jail.*\n\n# 6. Plantiaria - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nCyprus-based. Very little differentiation.\n\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n\n**Clone Lesson**: They're 8th place in a market this size and still clear $100K/month. You don't need to win. You just need to exist in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nThis one is playing a completely different game - completely free, no ads, no subscription. Open source, citizen science project.\n\nAnd it's NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification. 68% accuracy (second-best tested behind PictureThis).\n\nThey get funded through grants and academic partnerships. Scientists and serious botanists use it. Being free made them the default recommendation in every \"best plant app\" article.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They're not making subscription revenue, but their employees are getting paid through grants and the project has massive reach and prestige. Different game entirely.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30k/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nThe minimum viable clone.\n\n* Didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n* Low overhead\n\n$30K/month from what's essentially a side project. Proof that even 8th or 10th place in a massive market is still life-changing money for a small team.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs part of a recent pattern to pursue cloneable/pivotable apps instead of \"golden ideas\", I've been surprised by how little the actual differentiation matters technically. PlantIn's \"moon calendar\" isn't hard to build. Blossom's Webby Award has nothing to do with the product itself. PictureThis basically just claimed the biggest numbers and ran more ads than everyone. None of these are real moats.\n\n**Audience niching works.** PlantIn went after students. Blossom went after vegetable gardeners. Same core product, completely different positioning.\n\n**One small \"hook\" feature goes a long way.** Moon calendar, ask-a-botanist, edible garden planner, Latin pronunciation. None of these are technically impressive. But they signal \"this app is for YOU specifically\" to a certain type of user.\n\n**Social proof converts.** Awards, press, \"most accurate\" claims. It doesn't even matter if it's fully deserved. People see a badge and trust goes up.\n\n**You don't have to start in the US.** Plant App and Plantiaria proved you can build profitably in smaller markets first, then expand.\n\n**You don't need to win.** A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market. $30K-$100K/month from 8th place is still a very real business for a solo founder or small team\n\nLastly, \"competition\" in this space means 8+ apps all making $100K+/month, with the leader at $13M - there is a lot of room for multiple players.\n\nIf you liked this post and want to find your own cloneable products with real revenue, positioning angles, and competitor breakdowns.

The goal was simple: bring back that old-school vibe where you can just talk to strangers from anywhere in the world without all the chaos.\n\nDay one? Honestly, kind of disappointing. Hardly anyone showed up. But that was expected. Brand new site, no audience, nobody even knows it exists.\n\nDay two was completely different.\n\nWhen I opened the site, it actually started matching me with people pretty quickly. I ended up having some surprisingly long and genuine conversations. A few people gave me solid feedback, which honestly meant a lot. Some were shocked that a student built it. A couple even got slightly scared when I told them I made the site… and instantly disconnected 😂\n\nRight now it matches you with someone in under 60 seconds on average. That’ll improve as more people join.\n\nToday alone, around 200 unique users visited. It’s not a massive number, but for a 2-day-old project, it feels huge to me.\n\nI’m planning to add some unique features that current competitors don’t have, but I want to keep it clean, cozy, and safe - that classic simple random chat feel.\n\nIf you’re reading this, maybe give it a try. You might randomly match with me.\n\nAnd if you’ve got ideas, feedback, or want to collaborate - I’m all ears.",

      "text": "I'm 20 years old and today when I was stuck in traffic i noticed something.\nMost of the time when someone honks, the person who actually needs to hear it doesn’t hear it clearly. But everyone else around gets the noise. And honestly, horns feel like outdated tech at this point.\nSo I had an idea.\nWhat if instead of blasting sound outside, cars had a small device installed near the horn system. When you press the horn, it sends a short-range wireless signal (10–20 meters). Only the nearby cars receive it, and the horn sound plays inside their vehicle through their speakers.\nSo:\nNo external noise pollution\nOnly relevant drivers get the alert\nMore controlled and less chaotic traffic\nFeels futuristic\nEmergency vehicles could use a stronger signal that overrides music inside cars. That alone could reduce response times.\nOf course this would only work if cars adopt a common standard. Security and misuse would need to be handled with encryption.\nBut I’m curious:\nWould this actually make roads better?\nOr am I missing some obvious flaw?\nWould you want this in your car?\nLooking for honest feedback. Tear it apart if needed.\n\n\n**Please give your genuine advice to your this small brother** 🙏 wanna be elon musk\n\nBtw that's my 10th startup idea, working on 2",

          "text": "From the way you have explained it here, it seems pretty cool and simple to use: Screenshot a travel post and I get an itinerary for my vacation. This is what I though I would get on the website, but on the website there's a whole lot of things, I got a bit confused and was not able to share a screenshot or a few screenshots so that it could create my itinerary for me. Say I want to travel to Barcelona, would have been awesome to just share a screenshot right there on the landing page and have it create an itinerary and even suggest other places I could add, then include the stuff you said like hotel, activities etc.\n\nSimplify it so that what you sold here is exactly what I find on the landing page of your website, I share a screen shot and get an itinerary right there, no fluff. I'm not sure how well the AI can identify exactly where I want to go from a screenshot so maybe adding the ability to share the link to the post then it can extract more useful data from the url and description (just a suggestion so it can give me something more precise).\n\nThere are a few basic errors like on the sign up page, the login modal is floating right below the sign up one. Break up your project into steps so that you can build it step by step. If you try to build it all at once the AI will always end up giving you low effort products like the initial comment said.\n\nStart with the main functionality that you shared, screenshot to travel itinerary and that's it, right there on the landing page, no login or sign up until I need to customize my itinerary further. Have that main cool functionality that you built happen right there on the landing page (hero section) to hook people into then wanting to customize further then they can sign up.\n\nIt's a really cool idea that a lot of travel agencies can tap into to boost their marketing and customer acquisition efforts. Hope you keep building it, good luck💪",

Everyone wanted to try it, but the setup was a nightmare - you needed to mess with servers, API keys, all this technical stuff.\n\nI made a simple version where you just click a button and it works. That's it.\n\n**The journey:**\n\nLast year I spent months building 3 different apps. Made them perfect, added every feature I could think of.\n\nMade $0 from all of them.\n\nThis time I saw people complaining about OpenClaw being hard to set up, built something in 4 days while people still cared, and now 20+ people are paying me monthly.\n\n**What I learned:**\n\nDon't spend months making something perfect. Build it fast, ship it while people want it, fix it later.\n\nAlso turns out AI tools can help you build way faster than doing everything yourself.\n\n$500/month isn't huge, but after a year of making nothing, it feels amazing.",

I'm a full-stack web & mobile developer with deep expertise in automation, AI-powered systems, and lead generation.\n\nOver the past year+, I served as CTO of a project where we built AI employees and fully automated systems for businesses in industries like Real Estate, Home Services, and others. What I learned is that there's massive demand — people in these industries are genuinely ready to adopt smart systems that save them time and make them more money. The market is there.\n\nI know the tech stack inside and out. I know the marketing. I know the operations. What I'm missing is a partner — someone who brings complementary skills (sales, growth, ops, marketing, or even more technical muscle) and wants to build something real together.\n\nA few things worth noting: this isn't a \"we need $100K to get started\" kind of venture. Everything runs remotely, and the overhead is essentially a handful of software subscriptions. The barrier to entry is low — the execution is what matters.\n\nIf you're entrepreneurial, hungry, and interested in the AI/automation space, I'd love to chat. Feel free to DM me and let's see if there's a fit.",

Depending on what people encounter you get a finger print of fear \n\nSome are great in boosting, others are actually shy, but still pursue. Some like to boost their ideas while having nothing, while for others this is terrifying.\n\nFear is just a self-exciting pattern. Maybe more interesting is what tackles fear. What makes a person transform fear into action, into a smile.\n\nIf we learn to make connections, forget about it; then at a later point something might surface that gives you that smile and energy. Fear will melt away. The net profit is positive affirmative energy. Not the negative downward spiral. The trick is not to become overwhelmed by fear. Just adapt and find the path.",
