Validate your idea before you start building.\n2. Don't chase investors. Focus on getting users instead and investors will come knocking on your door.\n3. Don't be cheap when you hire an accountant, you'll save time and money by spending more.\n4. Inspiration is the design key when you're new. Don't build your own landing page from scratch, copy different sections from the tools you love the most and make it your own this way.\n5. Post online daily. X, Reddit, LinkedIn, TikTok, whatever suits you and your target audience.\n6. Solve your own problem and let this decide if you're B2B or B2C. Both come with pros and cons. Don't listen to people who try to paint a black/white picture of it.\n7. I'm bootstrapped and therefore highly recommend it. Work a 9-5 until you have 1-2 years of runway (living cheap), then go all in.\n8. You earn the right to paid ads by getting organic marketing to work first. Ads aren't $100 in, X customers out. You'll burn thousands just trying to learn it.\n9. Define your most important metrics and track them. They should be the pillars that guide all your decisions.\n10. Keep your product free at the start. Controversial opinion maybe, but it's how I did it and it got me feedback and testimonials that helped me grow fast and make a lot of money later on.\n11. The first few minutes of your app is a promise to the user: this app will help you achieve your goal. So put a lot of effort into the beginning to convert more people.\n12. Have an MVP mindset with everything you do. Get the minimal version out ASAP then use feedback to improve it.\n13. Just because someone else has done it, doesn't mean you can't compete. Execution is so important and you have no idea how well they're doing it.\n14. Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success.\n15. If you're not passionate about what you're building, it's going to be difficult to keep going through the early stage where you might not see results for months.\n16. Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product.\n17. Always refund people that want a refund.\n18. Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n19. Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far. Do things that don't scale to get them.\n20. Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want.",

Because it looks like the kind of shit a cult leader would post before the feds show up.\n\nYou probably tell people you are \"focused on the core loop\" when in reality you just have nothing of value to offer the world.\n\nIf your shipping speed is as fast as your design process, you probably finished this entire piece of shit in the time it took to take a particularly aggressive dump.\n\nI have seen more intellectual depth in a bowl of alphabet soup than in your entire value proposition.\n\nIt takes a monumental level of balls to put \"club\" in the URL when you are clearly the only member of this pathetic, one-man circle jerk.\n\nThe most impressive thing about this entire startup is that you managed to pay for the domain registration without accidentally choking on your own tongue.\n\nI actually admire how you have managed to make \"nothing\" look so incredibly arrogant.",

That likely means importing data with user permission and keeping it on-device rather than building a centralized data pipeline.\n\nThe challenge is doing it in a way that preserves privacy and simplicity, especially for people who are already overwhelmed during flares.

This helped me plug VideoMule organically by showing them what was possible.\n\n→ I also launched on 15 high-quality SaaS & AI directories, which will help us generate consistent inbound traffic over time.\n\nApart from Reddit, I experimented with manual LinkedIn outreach to founders:\n\n→ I made a list of founders who got funded by YC in the last 24 months.\n\n→ Reached out through LinkedIn InMail and connection requests with short,  \npersonalized messages\n\nHere's the stats for VideoMule so far:\n\n* 3,400+ total users\n* 12,000 website visitors\n\nFor those who have never heard of VideoMule, it works like this:\n\n* You upload a screen recording showing any of your SaaS features (no voice needed)\n* The app analyzes each frame of the video & writes a clean step-by-step script\n* Finally, the AI adds a humanlike voiceover & creates a polished product demo video\n\nYou can check it out here: [https://videomule.ai/](https://videomule.ai/)\n\nI'm glad for any feedback/suggestions/roasts in the comments.",

I’m actually building a tool that solves exactly that. Would you be open to checking it out? Totally fine if not.”\n\n→ if they’re interested, then I share the link\n\n→ if not, I just thank them and move on\n\nA few things I learned after months of using Reddit:\n\n→ Reddit DMs could have pretty night reply rate when they don’t feel spammy and the context is right\n\n→ Timing matters more than perfect copy\n\n→ Being helpful publicly first builds trust instantly\n\n→ Most people are actually open to trying new tools if you’re not pushy\n\nSo far, this approach has led to:\n\n100+ paying customers\n\n$5,000k+ total revenue\n\n$1,500+ MRR\n\n(here’s the tool if you want to check it out: [leadverse.ai](https://leadverse.ai))\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any part of this if it helps someone else here.",

That's impossible to learn from a signup form.\n\n\n\n20-30 real users iterating with you is infinitely more valuable than 500 people waiting. The \"no traction\" concern is a fear response, not a real risk. Investors and future users don't care how big your waitlist was at launch — they care about retention and engagement.\n\n\n\nOne thing I've seen work well: before opening access, run a few structured conversations with your waitlist users. Not surveys — actual 20-min calls. Ask them what they're currently using for customer support, what's painful about it, and what would make them switch. That gives you a sharper value prop going in.\n\n\n\nThe procrastinating-behind-validation instinct is real and dangerous. Ship it.",

      "text": "I've built too many apps that didn’t convert, so I went full spreadsheet goblin and analyzed the iOS App Store for \\*validated demand\\*. that means apps with 1 star reviews (or just in general below <3.0. I think with Claude you can deliver a >4.0 app in most cases tbh). paid apps with poor reviews with no alternative that have been abandoned.\n\nAnd what it boils down to: STAY AWAY FROM HIP MARKETS. I know the idea of creating that one, perfect to-do app is appealing, and if you just carve out 1% of the total traffic you're set. but honestly. You just see the top to-do apps and think: \"I could make it better\". The long-tail of to-do apps that didn't make it \\_are already there but you don't see them\\_. It's literally like a survivorship bias that's baked in already.\n\nThe weird, specific apps are where the air is thinner and there are \\*shockingly bad\\* ones. Examples I kept seeing: super-niche translators (hieroglyphics and stuff), hyper-specific utilities, bizarre-but-useful single-purpose tools.\n\nDisclosure: I made the dataset and I’m selling it as a one-time purchase. It includes 14,271 opportunities with revenue estimates + extracted top complaints (Google Sheet + CSV), distilled into 192 top picks.\n\nLink: [https://youcouldshipthis.com/](https://youcouldshipthis.com/)",

      "text": "I’ve built enough “cool” projects over the last year to realize cool doesn’t equal demand. Most of my early ideas were based on trends. If something was blowing up on X or Product Hunt, I’d convince myself there was an opportunity there. What I ignored was whether normal people were consistently asking for it.\n\nLately I’ve been flipping that approach. Instead of chasing hype, I’ve been looking for repeated friction, small problems that show up again and again in niche communities. Early 2026 feels like it’s rewarding that mindset. The opportunities I’m seeing aren’t massive, VC-style moonshots. They’re focused tools solving specific pain for clearly defined groups.\n\nA few that stand out:\n\nVery niche wellness tools. Not another general fitness app, but highly targeted solutions, managing jet lag for digital nomads, sleep optimisation for remote workers across time zones, even data tools for hobby gardeners tracking soil conditions. The narrower the audience, the clearer the value proposition.\n\nSustainability tools for small ecom brands. A lot of Etsy and Shopify sellers are confused about carbon reporting and “green” compliance, especially when selling into the EU. Enterprise software is too complex and expensive. A simple, affordable compliance tracker built specifically for small sellers feels like a realistic opportunity.\n\nInfrastructure for private hobby communities. Smaller groups (board games, niche repairs, maker communities, etc.) are growing outside major platforms, but they struggle with coordination. Tools that help with event management, moderation, or matching members by interests could add value without trying to become another social network.\n\nWhile trying to validate these patterns, I got tired of manually scanning hundreds of threads. I started using StartupIdeasDB since it compiles real startup pain points people post about. It helped surface recurring themes faster so I could see which problems kept showing up.\n\nAnother area that seems underbuilt: trade skill learning. Plumbing, welding, auto repair, there’s a clear labor shortage, but most training resources aren’t very modern or accessible. Short-form, mobile-first lessons tied to job matching could be a strong niche SaaS play.\n\nPrivacy-first creator analytics also looks promising. More creators are wary of giving platforms deeper access to their data. Transparent, secure dashboards that provide insights without harvesting everything could appeal to that shift.\n\nAnd outside large cities, there are still gaps in local infrastructure, tool sharing, small-town delivery coordination, community-based services. Most apps are designed for dense urban markets. There may be less competition in building for smaller regions.\n\nNone of these ideas are revolutionary. That’s kind of the point. They’re practical, repeat problems with visible demand and relatively manageable scope. The type of ideas you can test quickly without needing massive capital.\n\nWhat recurring problem have you noticed that feels buildable right now?",

The market is there.\n\nI know the tech stack inside and out. I know the marketing. I know the operations.

Everything runs remotely, and the overhead is essentially a handful of software subscriptions.

          "text": "The virality angle is actually the strongest part of this idea — shareable stats like \"my social battery is only 65%\" tap into something people genuinely relate to (introvert culture is huge online).\n\n\n\nThat said, the real question before investing time is whether people will actually log consistently. Habit-forming apps live or die on that. I'd run some scrappy tests first — even a Google Form or a simple spreadsheet shared in Discord servers/Reddit communities to see if people self-report this data voluntarily before building.\n\n\n\nThe idea itself resonates. The validation step is what determines if it's worth a full build. I went through something similar with my own tool and doing that manual validation first saved me months. Good luck!",
