      "text": "Here’s a simple and effective method to extract followers from any LinkedIn company page and turn them into leads\n\nI tested it yesterday and pulled over 75,000 profiles, results were solid.\n\nHere’s how it works :\n\nStep 1: Create a new LinkedIn account  \nStep 2: Start a free trial of Sales Navigator  \nStep 3: Add a job title on your profile like “Intern” at the company you want to target  \nStep 4: In Sales Navigator, use the filter “People following my company”, this becomes available since LinkedIn thinks you’re part of that company  \nStep 5: Export the list, enrich the data (email, role, etc), and use it in your outreach  \nStep 6: Remove the intern job, pick another company, repeat the process\n\nSuper useful to build targeted lists from pages that already gather your ideal audience\n\nCheers !\n\nBonus : Use [this free trial](https://gojiberry.ai) to get even more high intent leads :) ",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool [Brandled ](https://brandled.app/)(helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR.\n\nThen I became obsessed with one question: what separates SaaS products that make it from those that die at zero.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole. Studied 47 founders who went from $0 to $10k+ MRR in the last year. Watched their podcasts, red their tweets, and everything i could get my hands on.\n\nHere's what I learned from all of them, and what I was doing catastrophically wrong.\n\n**1. Frictionless signup isn't optional**\n\nEvery successful product had one-click social login. Google OAuth mostly.\n\nThe ones that died had email verification flows, password requirements, multi-step forms asking questions before showing any value.\n\nThe math is brutal. If you lose 30% of people at signup and you're getting 1000 visitors a month, that's 300 potential customers gone. At a 10% trial-to-paid conversion, that's 30 paying customers per month lost to signup friction alone.\n\nI started with magic link only. Completion rate was 45%. Added Google login. Jumped to 78% the next day.\n\nEvery percentage point of friction at signup costs you real revenue. Most founders don't even measure this.\n\n**2. They launched in weeks, not months**\n\nNone of them spent 6 months building in secret.\n\nAverage time from idea to first paying customer: 3-6 weeks. They launched with ONE core feature. Then spent most of their time marketing it.\n\nI did the opposite. Spent 3 months building features before launching. Content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, everything. Got 12 signups. Zero paying customers.\n\nConvinced myself the product wasn't good enough. Spent another month adding features. Still nothing.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. Nobody knew it existed.\n\nAfter I stopped building and started marketing, posting on Reddit, doing LinkedIn outreach, documenting on X, I hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nSame product. Different approach.\n\nPost-launch is 90% marketing, 10% product.\n\n**3. They were shameless about promotion**\n\nThe successful ones talked about their product everywhere. Not spammy. Just never hiding it.\n\nReddit threads. Twitter replies. Forum comments. Anywhere their audience hung out.\n\nThey'd give genuinely helpful advice first, then naturally mention their tool when relevant.\n\nStarted being shameless. Every relevant conversation where someone complained about the problem I solved, I'd help them first, then mention I built something for this.\n\nA few people definitely get mad but I feel the upside is worth it.\n\nYour product won't discover itself.\n\n**4. They asked churned users what went wrong**\n\nEvery successful product had a system for this. Automated email going out when someone cancels asking what didn't work.\n\nI was doing none of this. Saw cancellations in Stripe, felt rejected, moved on. Never asked why. Never learned anything.\n\nNow every cancelled user gets emails through and automated email sequence and the replies are done by me personally.\n\nResponse rate is 40%. The feedback is literally gold.\n\nEvery single one is fixable. But I only learned because I asked.\n\nChurned users tell you the real truth about your product.\n\n**5. They used their own product religiously**\n\nNot one successful founder was building something they didn't use daily. They were their own heaviest users.\n\nI wasn't doing this. Used my tool occasionally to \"test\" but wasn't relying on it daily.\n\nForced myself to create all my content through my own product for a week. Found 7 bugs in 30 minutes that never showed up in testing.\n\nGenerate button didn't work on mobile. Analytics took 8 seconds to load. Onboarding skipped steps if you refreshed.\n\nMy users were experiencing this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nIf you're not using your product daily as a real user, you're building blind.\n\n**6. They fixed retention before scaling acquisition**\n\nBiggest strategic difference.\n\nFailed products: 30-50% monthly churn, constantly chasing new users to replace ones leaving.\n\nSuccessful products: Fixed retention first, got churn to 10-20%, then scaled acquisition.\n\nThe math: At 40% churn, you acquire 40 customers to net 24. At 15% churn, you acquire 40 and net 34. Same effort, 42% better results.\n\nI was obsessed with new signups. Ignored my 40% churn rate. Got 10 new customers, lost 4. Net: 6.\n\nStopped all acquisition. Fixed onboarding from 8 steps to 3. Added email sequences. Built features retained users asked for. Churn dropped to 15%.\n\nSame acquisition effort, now net 8-9 customers instead of 6.\n\nRetention is the foundation. Acquisition is the multiplier.\n\n**7. They shipped MVPs with one feature**\n\nEvery successful product launched stupidly lean. One core feature done exceptionally well.\n\nI launched with 7 features: content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, SWOT, comments, hashtags.\n\nCodebase was a nightmare. Users were confused. I was maintaining features 3% of users touched.\n\nShould've launched with one thing: AI content that sounds human. Made that 10x better. Everything else later based on what paying customers asked for.\n\nYour MVP should make people say \"this solves my exact problem\" even if ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, so many features\" while solving nothing particularly well.\n\n**8. They priced based on value, not competition**\n\nNone of them raced to the bottom on pricing.\n\nThey looked at the value delivered. Hours saved. Revenue generated. Pain eliminated.\n\nThen priced a fraction of that value.\n\nI priced at $19/month because competitors were at $29-39. Thought I'd win on price. Just looked cheap and inferior.\n\nNeeded 263 customers to hit $5k MRR at $19 versus only 128 at $39.\n\nRaised price to $29-39. Conversions didn't drop. They improved slightly.\n\nHigher price signaled solving a valuable problem.\n\nPeople who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers. They'll churn for anything $3 cheaper.\n\n**9. They automated relationship building**\n\nEvery successful product had email sequences from day one. Not promotional. Actual value and engagement.\n\nWelcome emails. Feature education. Check-ins. Re-engagement for quiet users. Win-back for churned users.\n\nI was sending nothing after signup. Users signed up, got busy, forgot, churned.\n\nEngagement doesn't happen by accident. You engineer it.\n\n**10. They validated with money, not words**\n\nThe problem with feedback: it's free. People say nice things because it costs them nothing.\n\nI built features based on \"that would be helpful\" comments from users who weren't even paying. Wasted weeks on features nobody used.\n\nNow I only build what paying customers explicitly request.\n\nMoney is the only validation that matters. Words are cheap. Credit card numbers are truth.\n\n**The one thing they all had**\n\nThey didn't quit when it felt hopeless.\n\nThey all hit $0 for months. Got depressed. Questioned everything.

      "text": "Most startup advice says focus on product first, distribution later. We did both in parallel using one key resource for SEO foundation during beta. Five months later organic search drives 37% of our signups before we even have PMF.​\n\nThe startup timing strategy was recognizing SEO takes 4-6 months regardless of product quality. That timeline matches typical time to reach PMF. If we started SEO foundation day one alongside product development we'd have both solid product and organic traffic by month six instead of reaching PMF then starting distribution from zero.​ The specific resource we used was [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to automate directory submissions establishing baseline domain authority. This saved us 10-12 hours of manual work we couldn't afford during beta when building product. Got our DA from 0 to 14 within first month giving foundation for content to rank.​\n\nThe parallel execution timeline looked like month one submitted directories and published 4 foundational posts, months two and three focused on product iteration while publishing 2 posts weekly, month four product reached acceptable quality while SEO started showing results, and month five had 800 visitors with product ready to convert that traffic.​ Results at month five showed domain authority at 22, ranking for 28 keywords, generating 800 monthly organic visitors, 24 trial signups from organic monthly, and 8 converted to paying customers at $49/month giving $392 MRR from channel we built during beta.​\n\nWhat made this resource valuable for startups was automating time-consuming work during constrained early stage. As founder I had maybe 60 hours monthly for everything. Spending 12 hours on directory submissions wasn't option. The $127 bought me 11.5 hours to spend on product instead.​ For other startup founders the resource strategy is identify specialized services that automate high-volume low-skill work, evaluate cost versus founder time opportunity cost, use services aggressively during beta when time is most constrained, and focus founder hours on product and strategy not execution tasks.​\n\nThe mistake most startups make is trying to do everything in-house to \"save money\" when founder time is most expensive resource. Spending $127 to save 12 hours is obvious when those hours could ship features users want. The scrappiness should be in finding right resources not refusing to use them.​ The broader startup lesson is building distribution and product in parallel not sequentially. The 4-6 month SEO timeline aligns perfectly with time to PMF. Starting SEO during beta means you have both ready simultaneously instead of reaching PMF with zero distribution then spending another 6 months building organic channel.",

Podcasters and YouTubers need intros, and apparently this is a real enough problem that it's sustained for 3 years straight.\n\nAI prompt maker - 480 searches/month, 36-month streak, Meta-tool for helping people use AI better. I don't know much space / innovation there is left in this space.\n\nVoice to notes AI - 90 searches/month, 31-month streak,  Small numbers but 31 consecutive months of year-over-year growth. Still thinking as a society we're getting use to voice input potentially being a productivity move.\n\n# The year+ climbers:\n\nAI grading app - 480 searches/month, 14-month streak, Teachers hate grading. This is boring utility software that just keeps climbing.\n\nAI study guide generator - 720 searches/month, 15-month streak Students always need study help - clear use case, predictable demand.\n\nNewer but consistent:\n\nAI release notes generator - 140 searches/month, Every dev team hates writing these. Too boring for big AI companies to care about, which is probably why it's still got room.\n\nAI cash flow forecasting - 30 searches/month, $80.12 CPC This one's wild - only 30 monthly searches, but companies are paying $80 per click.\n\n# Why I think these matter:\n\nSmall search numbers might actually be the point here. You're building for 50-500 searches/month in niches that aren't interesting enough for well-funded startups to chase (which means you can actually get traction without competing with venture-backed teams).\n\nIf you want to see the full dataset, I'll leave it in the comments.",

We spent 6 months adding every feature we thought was \"essential\":\n\n* Fancy dashboard \n* 15+ integrations \n* Custom workflows \n* Beautiful onboarding \n\nTotal paying customers after 6 months: 0\n\nWe had 200+ signups. People would try it, say \"this is cool,\" and never come back.\n\nThe turning point came when I was manually doing customer development calls (should've done this from day 1). One engineering lead said something that hit hard:\n\n\"I don't need another dashboard. I need something that actually closes my Jira tickets while I sleep.\"\n\nThat one sentence changed everything.\n\nWe stripped out 70% of what we built. Focused on ONE thing: take a ticket, understand the codebase, submit a PR. That's it.\n\nWhat happened next:\n\n* First paying customer within 2 weeks\n* 5 more in the next month\n* Now at $2k MRR (small but real)\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n1. \"Cool\" ≠ valuable. People don't pay for cool. They pay for time saved.\n2. Talk to users before you build. I know everyone says this. I thought I was different. I wasn't.\n3. Narrow > Wide. Doing one thing exceptionally beats doing ten things okay.\n4. Your first 10 customers are hiding in conversations, not ads. Every early customer came from Reddit, Discord, or direct outreach.\n\nStill early and still figuring things out. But the difference between 0 customers and 5 customers feels massive mentally.\n\nFor those who've been through this: What was the moment you realized you were building the wrong thing? And how did you pivot without losing momentum?\n\n",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nToday, I wanted to share how our Y Combinator application process went.\n\nThis was our second time applying.  \nThe first time, two years ago, we were rejected instantly.\n\nThis time… a real surprise. We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

I’m building JarVisa — an AI-powered visa assistant for travelers with high-rejection passports (starting with the Philippines).\n\nProblem: applying for visas is confusing, expensive, and anxiety-inducing. People rely on shady agents or spend weeks guessing what to write.\nSolution: JarVisa helps users generate visa-ready documents (cover letters, itineraries, onward tickets), understand requirements, and practice interviews (e.g. US visa mock interview with AI consular personas).\n\nTraction so far:\n\t•\t1,200+ visa checks\n\t•\t500+ waitlist signups\n\t•\t300+ visa documents generated\n\t•\tUsers from PH, India, Nigeria, LATAM\n\t•\tGrowing mostly via word of mouth and communities\n\nBackground: I’m a Filipino product designer/engineer working at a YC-backed startup, building JarVisa solo because I’ve seen friends and family repeatedly rejected due to lack of guidance. Long-term vision is to become the default infrastructure for global mobility for people with “weak” passports.\n\nProduct: https://jarvisa.com\nHappy to DM and share more detail",

On the technical side, outside of coding, you have testing (so that you can verify everything works, and the project is maintainable) and devops (deploying your code where people can use it). Coding your app is about 1/5th of the technical side. The technical side is half the game. That's why you have a CEO and a CTO. The other half is business. The business side includes validation and marketing.\n\nI just want to help you put it in perspective.\n\nMy playbook is to first validate the idea to some degree - do similar things exist and how much competition is there. If they exist, then you can research those companies and get an objective idea money and effort wise.\n\nIf you think there's a gap \\*and it's something you're interested in pursuing\\* (who's motivated to do something they aren't interested in?), then you build a website that is just a single page - it should describe your \"thing\" and what it does. It should have a \"register interest\" form which is a great proxy for whether or not there is interest. This should cost you about $10-20 at this point.\n\nThen, you find your community and you get involved - talk to people, see what they think, revisit your assumptions and refine your idea.\n\nThen once you have a solid idea of \\*what\\* to build, you setup your code environment with git, linting rules and a CI/CD pipeline. You write tests for what you thing should be doing, then you build that functionality and document it. Then you lint, then you add to git, and viola - it's online.",

Many validation reports return “people liked it” or “they’d maybe pay,” which sets you up for a build trap without fail.\n\nWhat I would do now as a default (and wish I would’ve done instead).\n\nI cannot escape a more strict validation loop. \n\n1. You should make users signup for a behavior not an opinion. For example, create an email signup with a promise, a pre-order, or a “join waitlist for $X”. Even a fake Stripe link tells you more than interviews.\n\n2. Use one channel for one person, not broadly find people. Choose a platform where they regularly express their complaints, such as Reddit, Slack groups, or niche Twitter.\n\n3. Say the price before the pitch. Anyone who stays engaged after that is signal.\n\n4. Cap the experiment. Seven to ten days, fixed effort. You cease if nothing moves.\n\nCan you outsource part of this?  Certainly! I take thorough notes when I recruit people. However, I would still allow you to frame, question and make decisions.\n\nIt hurts when your ads fail, but at least they gave you a clear answer. Validation is more affordable, but only when it is formulated to conduct a “yes or no” test rather than a vibe check.",

I’ve been spending a lot of time on Reddit lately, reading founder posts, user complaints, and random comments where people casually describe problems they’d actually pay to solve.\n\nThat’s what pushed me to build [Rixly](https://www.userixly.com/)  \nIt turns Reddit conversations into clear signals for startups & businesses to convert warm leads into potential sales.\n\nInstead of just promoting my thing, I want this thread to be useful.\n\nWhat are **you** building or planning for 2026?  \nAn idea, MVP, landing page, or even a rough thought - all welcome.\n\nLet's make this thread a channel for you to promote your own startup idea, find opportunities, and partnerships.",
