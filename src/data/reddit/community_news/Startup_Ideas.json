Validate your idea before you start building.\n2. Don't chase investors. Focus on getting users instead and investors will come knocking on your door.\n3. Don't be cheap when you hire an accountant, you'll save time and money by spending more.\n4. Inspiration is the design key when you're new. Don't build your own landing page from scratch, copy different sections from the tools you love the most and make it your own this way.\n5. Post online daily. X, Reddit, LinkedIn, TikTok, whatever suits you and your target audience.\n6. Solve your own problem and let this decide if you're B2B or B2C. Both come with pros and cons. Don't listen to people who try to paint a black/white picture of it.\n7. I'm bootstrapped and therefore highly recommend it. Work a 9-5 until you have 1-2 years of runway (living cheap), then go all in.\n8. You earn the right to paid ads by getting organic marketing to work first. Ads aren't $100 in, X customers out. You'll burn thousands just trying to learn it.\n9. Define your most important metrics and track them. They should be the pillars that guide all your decisions.\n10. Keep your product free at the start. Controversial opinion maybe, but it's how I did it and it got me feedback and testimonials that helped me grow fast and make a lot of money later on.\n11. The first few minutes of your app is a promise to the user: this app will help you achieve your goal. So put a lot of effort into the beginning to convert more people.\n12. Have an MVP mindset with everything you do. Get the minimal version out ASAP then use feedback to improve it.\n13. Just because someone else has done it, doesn't mean you can't compete. Execution is so important and you have no idea how well they're doing it.\n14. Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success.\n15. If you're not passionate about what you're building, it's going to be difficult to keep going through the early stage where you might not see results for months.\n16. Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product.\n17. Always refund people that want a refund.\n18. Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n19. Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far. Do things that don't scale to get them.\n20. Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want.",

This helped me plug VideoMule organically by showing them what was possible.\n\n→ I also launched on 15 high-quality SaaS & AI directories, which will help us generate consistent inbound traffic over time.\n\nApart from Reddit, I experimented with manual LinkedIn outreach to founders:\n\n→ I made a list of founders who got funded by YC in the last 24 months.\n\n→ Reached out through LinkedIn InMail and connection requests with short,  \npersonalized messages\n\nHere's the stats for VideoMule so far:\n\n* 3,400+ total users\n* 12,000 website visitors\n\nFor those who have never heard of VideoMule, it works like this:\n\n* You upload a screen recording showing any of your SaaS features (no voice needed)\n* The app analyzes each frame of the video & writes a clean step-by-step script\n* Finally, the AI adds a humanlike voiceover & creates a polished product demo video\n\nYou can check it out here: [https://videomule.ai/](https://videomule.ai/)\n\nI'm glad for any feedback/suggestions/roasts in the comments.",

You literally created demo videos for founders who did not even ask for it. That is such a simple move but most of us would not take the time to do it. Showing instead of telling is underrated.\n\nThe Reddit angle makes sense too. Commenting early, being helpful first, then plugging your tool organically is way smarter than just dropping a link and disappearing. I have tried the lazy version before and yeah… it does not work.\n\n3k plus users in 60 days is solid. Not “Twitter hype” solid, but real traction solid.

Sleep quality, HRV, exertion, stress metrics next to flare intensity could tell a much clearer story than either one alone.\n\nIf we integrate wearables, the goal would be to keep it aligned with the same local-first philosophy. That likely means importing data with user permission and keeping it on-device rather than building a centralized data pipeline.\n\nThe challenge is doing it in a way that preserves privacy and simplicity, especially for people who are already overwhelmed during flares. But I agree, correlation tools between fitness data and symptoms are compelling and very much on the long-term radar.\n\nIf you’d be open to it, I’d love to hear what specific Garmin metrics you find most meaningful.",

Fresh momentum.\n\nWe’re always curious what founders are working on, whether you’re:\n\n* At the idea stage\n* Bootstrapping solo\n* Pre-launch\n* Already live and generating revenue\n\nShare a quick pitch below. One sentence is perfect. Link it if you’ve got one.\n\nWe’re especially excited about founders who aren’t afraid to go solo, build in public, and start raising small amounts early instead of waiting for a big VC round.\n\nBecause let’s be real...fundraising is exhausting!!  \nMonths refining a deck, chasing investors, sending cold emails with 1–2% reply rates, only to face silence or mismatched expectations. It drains time and energy that could be spent building.\n\nThat’s why we built **Preseedme** \\- a place where founders can share their startups early and get connected with micro-investors from the beginning of their journey.  \nThink of it as a matching layer between startups and early backers, running quietly in the background while you focus on building.\n\nWhat are you building this week? 🚀",

Both parties can connect directly through the platform without unnecessary intermediaries. All profiles are manually verified to ensure authenticity, and a built-in reporting and dispute system protects both creators and brands.  \nCreators receive payments within two weeks of content delivery, and brands are assured on-time posting. Personal dashboards allow both sides to track collaborations, deadlines, and ongoing projects efficiently.",

      "text": "For the past few months I’ve been in that weird founder limbo where you’re consuming everything, AI agents, automation, vertical SaaS plays, but not actually committing to anything. Every idea sounded impressive on paper, but when I asked myself, “Would someone urgently pay for this?” the answer was usually… maybe.\n\nThen I came across an idea on StartupIdeasDB that didn’t scream hype. It was almost quiet. And the more I sat with it, the more it made sense.\n\nThe core concept is an agentic AI SaaS focused on contract and compliance management for small and mid-sized businesses. Not just summarizing documents. Not just generating templates. An autonomous system that actually monitors obligations inside contracts, tracks renewal clauses, watches for regulatory changes in a specific industry, and proactively flags risks before they become expensive problems.\n\nMost SMBs don’t have full legal teams. They’re juggling vendor agreements, tax requirements, licensing rules, privacy policies, and they’re mostly reactive. They find out something changed when they’re already late or exposed. That’s stressful, and more importantly, it’s costly.\n\nWhat if instead there was an AI agent operating in the background that mapped out every obligation from uploaded contracts, tracked deadlines automatically, monitored relevant policy changes, and nudged the business owner before something slipped? Even drafting suggested updates or summaries for review. Less “AI assistant,” more “AI risk manager.”\n\nThe reason this stood out to me is because it’s tied to downside protection. Founders often chase growth tools, but tools that prevent loss can be just as powerful. If a marketing tool disappears, it’s inconvenient. If you miss a compliance requirement, that can mean fines, legal exposure, or damaged partnerships.\n\nI’ve started having early conversations in a couple of niche industries, and the pattern is consistent: people don’t want more dashboards. They want fewer surprises. If something could quietly reduce operational risk and mental load, that’s worth paying for.\n\nI’m still validating, but this feels different from the usual “AI for X” wave. It’s focused, specific, and anchored in a problem that already costs real money.\n\nWould something like this be valuable in your industry, or is compliance already handled smoothly where you are?",

I think with Claude you can deliver a >4.0 app in most cases tbh). paid apps with poor reviews with no alternative that have been abandoned.\n\nAnd what it boils down to: STAY AWAY FROM HIP MARKETS. I know the idea of creating that one, perfect to-do app is appealing, and if you just carve out 1% of the total traffic you're set. but honestly. You just see the top to-do apps and think: \"I could make it better\". The long-tail of to-do apps that didn't make it \\_are already there but you don't see them\\_. It's literally like a survivorship bias that's baked in already.\n\nThe weird, specific apps are where the air is thinner and there are \\*shockingly bad\\* ones.

      "text": "A few months ago I was helping a small pest control operation that had a classic problem: decent traffic, okay form conversions, but leads were ghosting between inquiry and booked job. They were spending real money on ads and losing it somewhere in the follow-up gap.\n\nIn this context I decided to make some \"basic\" automation like immediate SMS response to any form submission, email follow-up at 2h and 24h, and for leads that went cold on both - voicemail drops that left a short personalized message directly in voicemail without ringing the phone.\n\nBooking rate on inquiries went from around 31% to 56% over 8 weeks. The biggest mover was the voicemail segment - people who had ignored both the SMS and email but called back after getting the voicemail. Not all of them, but enough to shift the numbers significantly.\n\nWhat surprised me was how transferable the setup was. Ran a version of the same stack for a dental practice (appointment reminders + re-engagement for lapsed patients) and a solar installer (quote follow-up). Similar pattern each time - the voicemail touchpoint was pulling conversions from leads that every other channel had already written off.\n\nYou can do this for pest control, HVAC, dental, legal, solar - that handles the entire lead-response flow automatically. No technical setup, plug in a webhook or CRM, running in an afternoon + charge 15-20 local businesses $600-900/month to run this for them, hit $12–15k MRR, operate lean.\n\nSuggestions or improvements anyone?",

We are always seeking for some feedback on our idea and our tool as we are building.\n\nWe have talked to a lot of people. So it would be great, if you could share your thoughts on what we are working on. If you are a developer or cybersecurity expert (especially AppSec) we would like to have a very quick chat with you.\n\nYou would help us a lot! And maybe we could stay in touch, so we can give the tool to you for some time for free, for more feedback, if what we build is something that you are interested in.\n\n  \nThank you a lot! Just text beneath this post or DM me, if you would like to have a chat via Reddit, talk for a bit or something else. I am open for everything :D",

The  platform can handle the process of a B2B deal from when someone first asks for a quote to when the final product is delivered.\n\nWhat The platform does\n\nIt is a place where businesses can go to find what they need. It has requests for quotes, proposals and a build in SasS to manage businessfeom startto finish. This means businesses do not have to use lots of channels like WhatsApp and Email to get things done. They can do everything in a place where they can see all the data.\n\nCore Features\n\nThe platform is embedded with augmented intelligence. One one of which is RFQ Intent Ranking. This feature does not just look at keywords. It tries to understand what the buyer really wants. Then finds the vendors that are the best match. It does this by looking at how the vendors have done in the past and what they are capable of in different regions.\n\nAnother feature is Milestone Risk Prediction. This feature watches the stages of a project and warns us if something is likely to go wrong. This means we can stop problems before they start.\n\nThe platform also has Automated Escrow and Milestone Payments. This means that money is held safely until certain milestones are met. This gets rid of the worry that people have when they are paying for something.\n\nBusinesses can also make their storefronts or profiles, to serve as a way to show case their business and give more credibility.\n\nThe Benefits for Businesses\n\nThe platform removes the risk from trade. Buyers use it to compare verified vendors and price-check deals to avoid overpaying. Sellers get high-intent customers and secure, milestone-based payments. It’s a unified engine making business faster, safer, and fairer for everyone.\n\nThe platform is tailored for The regions need and compliance making business more trustworthy.\n\nCurrently fine-tuning the product to make it more secure and scalable, I seek investment to kickstart the product and open for equity share.",

      "text": "Years of hard work, struggle and pain. 7 failed projects\n\nLessons:\n\n* Solve real problems (e.g, save them time and effort, make them more money). Focus on the pain points of your target customers. Solve 1 problem and do it really well.\n* Prefer to use the tools that you already know. Don’t spend too much time thinking about what are the best tool to use. The best tool for you is the one you already know. Your customers won't care about the tools you used, what they care about is you're solving the problem that they have.\n* Start with the MVP. Don't get caught up in adding every feature you can think of. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves the core problem, then iterate based on user feedback.\n* Know your customer. Deeply understand who your customer is and what they need. Tailor your messaging, product features, and support to meet those needs specifically.\n* Fail fast. Validate immediately to see if people will pay for it then move on if not. Don't over-engineer. It doesn't need to be scalable initially.\n* Be ready to pivot. If your initial idea isn't working, don't be afraid to pivot. Sometimes the market needs something different than what you originally envisioned.\n* Data-driven decisions. Use data to guide your decisions. Whether it's user behavior, market trends, or feedback, rely on data to inform your next steps.\n* Iterate quickly. Speed is your friend. The faster you can iterate on feedback and improve your product, the better you can stay ahead of the competition.\n* Do lots of marketing. This is a must! Build it and they will come rarely succeeds.\n* Keep on shipping Many small bets instead of 1 big bet.\n\n**Playbook that what worked for me (will most likely work for you too)**\n\nThe great thing about this playbook is it will work even if you don't have an audience (e.g, close to 0 followers, no newsletter subscribers etc...).\n\n**1. Problem**\n\nCan be any of these:\n\n* Scratch your own itch.\n* Find problems worth solving. Read negative reviews + hang out on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.\n\n**2. MVP**\n\nSet an appetite (e.g, 1 day or 1 week to build your MVP).\n\nThis will force you to only build the core and really necessary features. Focus on things that will really benefit your users.\n\n**3. Validation**\n\n* Share your MVP on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.\n* Reply on posts complaining about your competitors, asking alternatives or recommendations.\n* Reply on posts where the author is encountering a problem that your product directly solves.\n* Do cold and warm DMs.\n\nOne of the best validation is when users pay for your MVP.\n\nWhen your product is free, when users subscribe using their email addresses and/or they keep on coming back to use it.\n\n**4. SEO**\n\nROI will take a while and this requires a lot of time and effort but this is still one of the most sustainable source of customers. 2 out of 3 of my projects are already benefiting from SEO. I'll start to do SEO on my latest project too.\n\nThat's it! Simple but not easy since it still requires a lot of effort but that's the reality when building a startup especially when you have no audience yet.\n\nPS: Right now I'm building v2 of my [product](https://brandled.app/), this time i am trying a different approach, I am basically following the waitlist + private beta strategy.\n\n→ Build a waitlist as soon as you have idea, [example](https://brandled.app/)  \n→ Start Marketing It everywhere  \n→ Once you have enough traction on it, build MVP within 72hrs  \n→ Ship it, collect feedback  \n→ Use that feedback to again ship in next 24 hrs, this time charge for it (50% of what you would normally charge)\n\nGet users in batches, provide them highly personalized experience and improve your product.\n\nLeave a comment if you have a question, I'll be happy to answer it.",
