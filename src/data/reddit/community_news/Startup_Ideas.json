      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed a pattern where many founders come up with a \"brand new\" idea, only to realize later that it was attempted (and burned through millions in VC funding) back in 2014.\n\nI actually enjoy digging through the history of the tech industry, so I started collecting data on closed-down startups and failed businesses going back to the dotcoms. It’s fascinating to see why they failed, sometimes it was bad timing, sometimes it was no product-market fit, and sometimes they just ran out of cash.\n\nI organized all this data into a searchable archive. If you are brainstorming a new venture, you might want to check if someone has already paid the \"tuition\" for learning that lesson so you don't have to.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.loot-drop.io\n\nI’d love to hear if you can find any \"ghosts\" of ideas you’re \n\ncurrently working on!",

I love sharing stories like this cause its just crazy how simple the idea was - two random dudes fix one annoying problem and accidentally create a whole multi-billion dollar category.\n\nInstagram was notorious for being bad with links. For years you were only be able to put like 1 or 2 links in your bio... and the way they were displayed was a complete turnoff. Nick and Anthony, a couple of Aussies with a marketing agency, spent 6 hours making a page where they can cram all their artist promo links under one roof. \n\nIt was a damn side project…\n\nQuickly they saw others in the space complaining about stuff like not being able to promote their gigs or merch, and decided to spread their lil solution. The \"homie try this\" hook, was all the validation they needed to press the gas. Brands started using it, creators adopting it, small businesses putting their hair salon locations on 1 stop homepages. \n\nThat was the birth of the \"link in bio\" market uprising. \n\nNot only did they completely shift focus from a small agency, to a 1 page - all link storefront named Linktree, they created an entirely new ecosystem that prints money for pretty much everyone. Tens of millions of users, billions of clicks every month, with a billion-plus valuation...\n\n...all because they made one tiny thing less annoying.\n\nPretty cool story ngl, but it doesn't stop there. The 'Link-in-bio\" market has created opportunities for almost everyone to make their business easier to sell. Companies like [Linkshop](http://linkshop.bio/) make it hella easy for small businesses to sell products without an entire store. If you don't have physical products but got sell digital courses/products to sell - [Stan store](http://stan.store/) was pretty much made for you. Beacons ai is also very popular among creators for like media kit sharing and brand tools. \n\nAnyways not to bore you but it's crazy how such a small blind spot Instagram failed to fix, a couple homies to make an entirely new internet economy. It doesn't take a crazy innovative idea to make millions, just do what other companies aren't willing to. ",

I was looking for a link-in-bio tool that didn't harvest user data or force you to sign up, but literally everything out there logs your info or paywalls the basic analytics. I couldn't find a single zero-log, completely free platform, so I just made one myself. It’s super minimal, dark mode, and you don’t even need an email to set up a page. I also just pushed an update for the stats and now every link on your bio tracks clicks for 24h, 7d, 30d, 1y, and all-time, completely free. Just trying to do what the big companies aren't willing to do anymore: keep it simple and actually respect privacy. I might add a buy me a coffee later on, but currently I just want to hear real feedback. [LNKFST | Link-in-Bio & URL Shortener](https://lnkfst.com)",

      "text": "I spend a lot of time around early rounds. Pre seed, seed, under $5M.  \nAnd the outreach founders use on Reddit, LinkedIn, X, email… it’s not just bad. It's horrendous.\n\nNot because investors are evil.  \nBut because investors actually have a standard that weeds out non-pros (imagine that).\n\nIt's so bad, I'm writing this post as a helpful rant. Cheers\n\nHere are the 3 biggest self-inflicted wounds I see. If this is you at all... pay attention\n\n**1. The public begging post**\n\nYou’ve all seen it. And it grinds on me every time\n\n“Hey everyone, building an AI platform for creators. Need $300k. DM if interested.”\n\nNo real investor touches that.  \nIt reads like someone trying to pay rent, not build a company.\n\nInvestors fund momentum, clarity, and control.  \nBegging posts signal the opposite.\n\nIf you’re going to post publicly, do this instead:\n\n* State the problem in a way that sounds lived, not researched\n* Show what you built that proves you’re serious\n* Give one traction signal, even if small\n* Ask a real question\n\nYou’re not asking for money.  \nYou’re creating gravity.\n\n**2. The comment section ambush**\n\nInvestor posts something thoughtful.  \nFounder replies: “We are doing this. Can you invest?”\n\nThat’s not outreach. That’s street panhandling.\n\nAs shocking as it is, try to actually provide useful info instead:\n\n* Add a sharp observation to the thread\n* Show you understand the space\n* Ask one intelligent question\n\nExample:\n\n“Are you seeing these as workflow wedges or data moat plays? Most teams I talk to confuse the two and waste a year.”\n\nNow you sound like an operator, not a lottery ticket hunter.\n\n**3. The catastrophic DM (by far the worst of all)**\n\nReal message I received:\n\n“Hi, I have a great idea. Can you invest $85,000?”\n\nThat’s not a pitch. That’s a red flag in sentence form.\n\nDMs are not for pitching.  \nDMs are for getting permission to pitch.\n\nHere’s the actual sequence I’ve seen work over and over for sub $5M rounds.\n\n**Step 1: Build a real target list**\n\nNot “early stage tech investors.”  \nThat’s how you waste three months.\n\nYou want investors who:\n\n* Write checks your size\n* Invest at your stage\n* Already backed companies in your space\n\nIf you can’t name three relevant portfolio companies, you’re guessing.\n\n**Step 2: Borrow credibility**\n\nIf you have no network, don’t start with investors.  \nStart with operators in their portfolio.\n\nDM founders they already backed.  \nAsk for one piece of advice.  \nHave a real conversation.\n\nWarmth travels through operators, not cold founders.\n\n**Step 3: Send a three-line opener**\n\nNo deck.  \nNo life story.  \nNo pitch.\n\nJust this structure:\n\nLine 1: Specific reference  \nLine 2: One sentence on what you built + one traction signal  \nLine 3: One question\n\nExample:\n\n“Saw your post on vertical AI. We built a dispatch tool for HVAC teams and our beta users are already routing jobs through it daily. Too early to be interesting for a seed check?”\n\nShort. Human. Non-desperate.\n\n**Step 4: One pager before the deck**\n\nDecks are for meetings.  \nOne pagers are for curiosity.\n\nYour one pager should cover:\n\n* Who the customer is\n* What hurts\n* What you built\n* Why you win\n* One traction signal\n* How much you’re raising and what it unlocks\n\nIf they want the deck, they’ll ask.\n\n**Step 5: Run a tight process**\n\nMost founders lose here.\n\nThey:\n\n* Talk to one investor at a time\n* Drag it out for months\n* Lose all momentum\n\nDo this instead:\n\n* 30 to 45 day fundraise window\n* Batch meetings into 2 weeks\n* Push everyone to the same timeline\n\nMomentum is not luck. It’s structure.\n\nI’m not saying this to be harsh.  \nBut a bad outreach pattern can kill a round before it even starts. And how to post on Reddit when raising capital is a whole other conversation.\n\nAnd honestly, I have literally thought about creating a course just for founders to learn etiquette for contacting investors successfully (instead of driving investors crazy with horrible outreach)  \n✌",

      "text": "The biggest startup myth is:  \n\n“Build it and they will come.”  \n\nThey won’t.\n\n[I’ve been documenting idea selection and validation frameworks on Toolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) while building my own projects, and I keep noticing the same mistake:  \n\nFounders validate the solution but fail to validate the problem.\n\nHere’s the framework I use before touching any code: 👇\n\n1️⃣ **Validate the Problem (Not Your Excitement)**\n\nBefore building anything, I check:  \n\n- Are people already paying for this?  \n\n- Are competitors charging real money?  \n\n- Are users actively complaining somewhere?\n\nIf competitors exist, that’s a good sign. New founders often think, “There’s too much competition.” Experienced founders think, “Good. There’s demand.”  \n\nNo competition usually means no money.\n\n2️⃣ **Look for These 5 Opportunity Signals**  \n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I look for:  \n\n- **UX Gaps**: Ugly or clunky tools in high-paying markets.  \n\n- **High Pricing**: If a tool charges $99/month, it indicates budget exists.  \n\n- **Missing Features**: Users often complain in reviews.  \n\n- **Over-Complexity**: Many tools try to do everything. There’s opportunity in doing one thing extremely well.  \n\n- **Market Frustration Intensity**: Is it a mild annoyance or “hair on fire” urgent?  \n\nIf the pain isn’t at least a 7/10, I move on.\n\n3️⃣ **Define WHO It’s For**  \n\nIf your answer is “everyone,” it’s already dead. Specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is better than broad appeal.\n\n**4️⃣ Check Paying Capacity**  \n\nWould this user realistically pay?  \n\nStudents complaining do not equal revenue. Agencies complaining signal potential revenue. There’s different market psychology at play.\n\n***5️⃣ Distribution Plan Before Product**\n\nIf you can’t answer, “How will I get my first 100 users?” don’t build yet.  \n\nA great product without a distribution plan is just a hobby.\n\n**How I Validate Before Building** \n\nHere’s my sequence:  \n\n- 5-10 user interviews (no Google Forms - real conversations)  \n\n- Create a landing page  \n\n- Small ad spend ($5-$20)  \n\n- Try to pre-sell  \n\n- THEN build the MVP  \n\nIf nobody pays before the MVP, that’s data. It’s cheaper to kill an idea early than to wait six months.\n\n**Hard Truth**  \n\nMost founders fall in love with building. Winning founders fall in love with reducing risk. Validation might not be glamorous, but it saves years.  \n\nIf you find this helpful, I’m happy to share the exact interview structure I use.",

There is already a successful startup in Italy doing this with a €1M ARR, but they haven't expanded to many mid-sized cities yet.\n\nThe Execution:\n\n• The MVP: I cloned their value proposition and website structure, using a Tally form to capture leads.\n\n• The Distribution: I posted in large \"dog lover\" Facebook groups. To keep it \"organic,\" I posted as a happy customer recommending the service.\n\n• The Result: The post went viral within the groups (approx. 10k views). People commented about their struggles with traditional groomers, but zero people filled out the form.\n\nMy Reflection:\n\nI’ve been re-reading Paul Graham’s “Do Things That Don’t Scale.” I suspect my funnel was too \"cold.\" Expecting someone to go from a Facebook comment to a lead form in seconds might be unrealistic for a service involving their pets.\n\nThe Question:\n\nFor those who have launched copycats: what is your go-to validation method? Was my \"fake customer\" angle the problem, or is the \"landing page + form\" approach dead for service-based startups?",

They pay anywhere from €150 to €500 just to post a single job ad on LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nMy thesis is that they are sitting on a goldmine they aren't using: their consultants' personal profiles.\n\nIf an agency has 10 recruiters, they likely have a combined network of 50k+ relevant candidates. Yet, they still pay for ads because coordinating 10 people to post the same job ad manually is a nightmare.\n\nSo I built a tool called **Copost** to solve exactly this \"distribution\" problem.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of buying a job slot, the agency writes the post once in my tool, and it pushes it to the personal profiles of the relevant recruiters.\n\nI added a specific feature to schedule the \"first comment\" automatically (so they can put the application link there without killing the reach in the main post). This way, not only do they save money on ads, but their recruiters actually build their personal brand and attract more candidates for the future.\n\nI managed to book 3 demos with actual recruitment firms for next week, so I feel like there is a real pain here regarding the cost of LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nDo you guys think this \"decentralized\" approach can actually replace paid job slots, or will companies always prefer the lazy option of paying LinkedIn?\n\nI’d love to know if this logic holds up.",

It seems more manufacturing-heavy compared to some other marketplaces, with a lot of listings focused on machinery, industrial equipment, construction materials, and OEM-type products rather than just consumer goods. That can be helpful depending on what you’re trying to source.\n\nI also noticed that many suppliers provide audit info, certifications, and factory details right on their profiles. While that doesn’t replace your own due diligence, it does make initial screening a bit easier.\n\nCurious how others approach this:\n\nDo you treat certain platforms differently than others when sourcing overseas?\n\nHave you had better luck finding factory-direct pricing on some versus others?\n\nAny red flags or tips to watch out for?\n\nJust trying to figure out which platforms are actually worth spending time on in 2026.

      "text": "Below is a breakdown of how the Plant Identifier app ecosystem works, the companies that are part of it, how they make their revenue and some takeaways for how to apply the same strategies. \n\n*Quick note: revenue estimates are from SensorTower and similar tools. They're directional, not exact - actual numbers could be higher or lower. The point is the pattern, not the precise figures.*\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → get name → see relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $27M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they got there first and went harder than anyone on paid acquisition. Were (allegedly) doing 300+ ads running on Meta at any given time.\n\nHow they set themselves apart:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" - biggest numbers in the space = perceived leader\n* Added a Latin pronunciation feature. Tiny thing, but it makes them feel like a serious botanical tool instead of a toy\n* $29.99/year pricing\n* Go hard on ASO - they rank #1 for basically every plant-related keyword\n\nI used it before LLMs were a thing and I remember being genuinely impressed. That initial \"wow this actually works\" reaction matters more than people think for word-of-mouth.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The lesson here is simple - be first and be willing to outspend everyone on marketing. Not groundbreaking advice, but it works.\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't try to out-feature PictureThis. They found audiences that PictureThis wasn't really serving and built for them instead.\n\n* Free for students and educators - creates a viral loop through universities and social media\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" - I honestly don't fully understand wtf this is, but apparently there's a whole community of astrology/spiritual gardeners.\n   * Side note: Sometimes slight differentiations like this are major unlocks to new markets/revenue\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature - human expert access, not just AI\n* Light meter tool (measures if your spot gets enough light) and water calculator - productivity features, not just identification\n\nThey're Ukraine-based, so lower operating costs, and they grew largely through organic/social instead of brute-forcing paid ads.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The move here is obvious in hindsight - don't compete on the same features. Find the audience the market leader isn't serving and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nThis one's interesting because they barely differentiated at all. Plantum is built by AIBY, a company that literally runs an app factory. They clone successful apps at scale, pour money into paid acquisition, and see what sticks.\n\nTheir playbook:\n\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes you don't need a clever angle. You just need solid distribution and a product that doesn't suck. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nThey launched in Turkish and regional markets first where there's way less competition, proved the model with cheaper user acquisition, then expanded to English-speaking markets once they had revenue.\n\n* Better multi-language support than the US-first competitors\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded the expansion\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone Lesson**: By the time they hit the US market, they'd already built a profitable business. Smart play that most founders never consider because everyone defaults to launching in English/US first.\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month (at one point - now closer to $20k)\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nBlossom played the social proof game better than anyone. They won a Webby Award and slap \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" on literally everything. Does a Webby Award actually mean the app is better? Probably not. But does it convert? 100%\n\nThey also carved out the \"edible gardening\" niche - vegetable gardens, herb gardens, garden planning calendars. The other apps were all focused on houseplants and identification. Blossom said \"what about people who grow food?\" and owned that corner.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: I don't know how hard Webby Awards are to win, but the strategy is clear: enter awards, get press, put badges everywhere. Social proof converts really well, even if the award itself is semi-meaningless.\n\n*Kind of reminds me of 30-under-30 being a \"this person is legit\" signal, though nowadays maybe not, since so many end up in jail.*\n\n# 6. Plantiaria - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nCyprus-based. Very little differentiation.\n\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n\n**Clone Lesson**: They're 8th place in a market this size and still clear $100K/month. You don't need to win. You just need to exist in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nThis one is playing a completely different game - completely free, no ads, no subscription. Open source, citizen science project.\n\nAnd it's NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification. 68% accuracy (second-best tested behind PictureThis).\n\nThey get funded through grants and academic partnerships. Scientists and serious botanists use it. Being free made them the default recommendation in every \"best plant app\" article.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They're not making subscription revenue, but their employees are getting paid through grants and the project has massive reach and prestige. Different game entirely.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30k/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nThe minimum viable clone.\n\n* Didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n* Low overhead\n\n$30K/month from what's essentially a side project. Proof that even 8th or 10th place in a massive market is still life-changing money for a small team.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs part of a recent pattern to pursue cloneable/pivotable apps instead of \"golden ideas\", I've been surprised by how little the actual differentiation matters technically. PlantIn's \"moon calendar\" isn't hard to build. Blossom's Webby Award has nothing to do with the product itself. PictureThis basically just claimed the biggest numbers and ran more ads than everyone. None of these are real moats.\n\n**Audience niching works.** PlantIn went after students. Blossom went after vegetable gardeners. Same core product, completely different positioning.\n\n**One small \"hook\" feature goes a long way.** Moon calendar, ask-a-botanist, edible garden planner, Latin pronunciation. None of these are technically impressive. But they signal \"this app is for YOU specifically\" to a certain type of user.\n\n**Social proof converts.** Awards, press, \"most accurate\" claims. It doesn't even matter if it's fully deserved. People see a badge and trust goes up.\n\n**You don't have to start in the US.** Plant App and Plantiaria proved you can build profitably in smaller markets first, then expand.\n\n**You don't need to win.** A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market. $30K-$100K/month from 8th place is still a very real business for a solo founder or small team\n\nLastly, \"competition\" in this space means 8+ apps all making $100K+/month, with the leader at $13M - there is a lot of room for multiple players.\n\nIf you liked this post and want to find your own cloneable products with real revenue, positioning angles, and competitor breakdowns.

The goal was simple: bring back that old-school vibe where you can just talk to strangers from anywhere in the world without all the chaos.\n\nDay one? Honestly, kind of disappointing. Hardly anyone showed up. But that was expected. Brand new site, no audience, nobody even knows it exists.\n\nDay two was completely different.\n\nWhen I opened the site, it actually started matching me with people pretty quickly. I ended up having some surprisingly long and genuine conversations. A few people gave me solid feedback, which honestly meant a lot. Some were shocked that a student built it. A couple even got slightly scared when I told them I made the site… and instantly disconnected 😂\n\nRight now it matches you with someone in under 60 seconds on average. That’ll improve as more people join.\n\nToday alone, around 200 unique users visited. It’s not a massive number, but for a 2-day-old project, it feels huge to me.\n\nI’m planning to add some unique features that current competitors don’t have, but I want to keep it clean, cozy, and safe - that classic simple random chat feel.\n\nIf you’re reading this, maybe give it a try. You might randomly match with me.\n\nAnd if you’ve got ideas, feedback, or want to collaborate - I’m all ears.",

But everyone else around gets the noise. And honestly, horns feel like outdated tech at this point.\nSo I had an idea.\nWhat if instead of blasting sound outside, cars had a small device installed near the horn system. When you press the horn, it sends a short-range wireless signal (10–20 meters). Only the nearby cars receive it, and the horn sound plays inside their vehicle through their speakers.\nSo:\nNo external noise pollution\nOnly relevant drivers get the alert\nMore controlled and less chaotic traffic\nFeels futuristic\nEmergency vehicles could use a stronger signal that overrides music inside cars. That alone could reduce response times.\nOf course this would only work if cars adopt a common standard. Security and misuse would need to be handled with encryption.\nBut I’m curious:\nWould this actually make roads better?\nOr am I missing some obvious flaw?\nWould you want this in your car?\nLooking for honest feedback. Tear it apart if needed.\n\n\n**Please give your genuine advice to your this small brother** 🙏 wanna be elon musk\n\nBtw that's my 10th startup idea, working on 2",

This is what I though I would get on the website, but on the website there's a whole lot of things, I got a bit confused and was not able to share a screenshot or a few screenshots so that it could create my itinerary for me. Say I want to travel to Barcelona, would have been awesome to just share a screenshot right there on the landing page and have it create an itinerary and even suggest other places I could add, then include the stuff you said like hotel, activities etc.\n\nSimplify it so that what you sold here is exactly what I find on the landing page of your website, I share a screen shot and get an itinerary right there, no fluff. I'm not sure how well the AI can identify exactly where I want to go from a screenshot so maybe adding the ability to share the link to the post then it can extract more useful data from the url and description (just a suggestion so it can give me something more precise).\n\nThere are a few basic errors like on the sign up page, the login modal is floating right below the sign up one. Break up your project into steps so that you can build it step by step. If you try to build it all at once the AI will always end up giving you low effort products like the initial comment said.\n\nStart with the main functionality that you shared, screenshot to travel itinerary and that's it, right there on the landing page, no login or sign up until I need to customize my itinerary further. Have that main cool functionality that you built happen right there on the landing page (hero section) to hook people into then wanting to customize further then they can sign up.\n\nIt's a really cool idea that a lot of travel agencies can tap into to boost their marketing and customer acquisition efforts. Hope you keep building it, good luck💪",
