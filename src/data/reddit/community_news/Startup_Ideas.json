      "text": "* 80%+ of people prefer Google sign in\n* Removing all branding/formatting from emails and sending them from a real name increases open rate\n* You won’t know when you have PMF but a good sign is that people buy and tell their friends about your product\n* 99.9% of people that approach you with some offer are a waste of time\n* Sponsoring creators is cheaper but takes more time than paid ads\n* Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want\n* Once you become successful there will be lots of copy cats but they only achieve a fraction of what you do. You are the source to their success\n* I would never be able to build a good product if I didn’t use it myself\n* Always monitor logs after pushing new updates\n* Bugs are fine as long as you fix them fast\n* People love good design\n* Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far\n* Always refund people that want a refund\n* Asking where people heard about you during onboarding makes marketing 10x easier\n* Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n* Don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more\n* A surprising amount of users are willing to get on a call to talk about your product and it’s super helpful\n* Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product\n* Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success\n* Even when things are going well you’ll have moments when you doubt everything, just have to shut that voice out and keep going\n\nFor context, [my app](https://buildpad.io) guides users through ideation and idea validation.",

      "text": "Hello guys,\n\nIn theory, when launching a SaaS, you validate the need first.\n\nIf potential clients pay, you build.\n\nIn practice? We all make the same rookie mistake: We start with an idea, then try to find someone to sell it to.\n\nIt’s usually a disaster.\n\nIn 2023, I did exactly that.\n\nActually, I did worse.\n\nI copied someone else’s idea for my market without knowing if it would work.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nIt's 2023. I’m new to SaaS, naive, and I think \"YCombinator model = Guaranteed Success.\"\n\nI spot a company called OneText. They do \"text-to-buy\" for e-commerce in the USA.\n\nI think: \"Let's bring this to Europe! But with WhatsApp.\"\n\nI spend 6 months building a clone.\n\nResult? We launch the MVP. Nobody wants it.\n\nNOBODY.\n\nEurope wasn't ready for text-based purchasing.\n\nA total zero. 6 months of work thrown in the trash.\n\nSo, I pivot.\n\nNew logic: \"Let's find companies already selling WhatsApp tools in Europe making real money, and just copy them.\"\n\nI find Shopify apps making $2-3M.\n\nNot a creative idea but at least there is a market.\n\nWe clone the MVP features in 2 weeks. I try to sell it... and miracle.\n\nClients. Happy clients. Retention.\n\nIn 6 months, we grew from $0 to $50k MRR almost exclusively through cold outreach.\n\nWe had no vision. We didn't love the project, and we didn't know how to innovate.\n\nSo, we contacted buyers and sold the SaaS for 7 figures in just a few weeks.\n\n(This was early 2025).\n\n[Here is the SaaS I sold and the proof](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremyhorowitz1_after-45-yrs-352-deals-5-lost-lois-i-activity-7297946777532391424-x-zZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6Qr-cBuSULRKCL1d1JL7e1LIgV7c6UZ3c)\n\nA few months ago, I launched a new SaaS. This time, before writing ONE LINE of code, I sold the solution using a PowerPoint deck. We hit $7k MRR before coding a single feature.\n\nToday, we are over $30k/month.\n\nThe lesson: Don't waste time. SELL BEFORE YOU CODE.\n\nDon't be a donkey like I was and waste 6 months of your life.\n\nBTW, [here is what I’m building now](https://gojiberry.ai) (I hope we will reach $1m ARR very soon)\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR before I figured out what actually matters.\n\nHere's everything I learned the hard way. Wish someone had told me this on day one.\n\n**1. Offer Google/social login. Seriously.**\n\nI started with the magic link only. (cause i adopted ship fast mentality on the wrong things)\n\nMy signup completion rate was 45%.\n\nAdded Google OAuth. It jumped to 78% overnight.\n\nFriction at signup is invisible revenue loss. Every extra step costs you 20-30% of potential users.\n\nTakes like 1 hour to implement. \n\n**2. Post-launch is 80% marketing, 20% product. Maybe even 90/10.**\n\nI spent 3 months building features.\n\nThen I \"launched.\"\n\nGot 12 signups. 0 paying customer.\n\nI thought: \"The product isn't good enough yet. Let me add more features.\"\n\nSpent another week building.\n\nBut still got no results.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. The problem was nobody knew it existed.\n\nHere's the truth: your product only needs to solve ONE problem well. That's it. Everything else is marketing.\n\nI know founders with worse products than mine making $50k MRR because they're good at marketing.\n\nI know founders with better products than mine making $0 because they suck at marketing.\n\nPost-launch, you should spend 80% of your time getting eyeballs on your product and 20% improving it based on paying customer feedback.\n\nNot the other way around.\n\n**3. Market shamelessly. Talk about your product everywhere.**\n\nI was terrified of being \"salesy.\"\n\nSo I'd post about \"building in public\" but never actually mention my product.\n\nI'd write valuable content on Reddit but never link to my tool.\n\nSo I was staring $0 MRR every day.\n\nThen I started being shameless and mentioning my product everywhere.\n\nNobody will discover your product by accident. You have to put it in their face. Repeatedly.\n\nThe people who get offended by promotion weren't going to buy anyway.\n\n**4. Respect the ones who churn. They're giving you honest feedback.**\n\nWhen users churn, I used to feel rejected.\n\nNow I have an automated email that asks: \"What made you unsubscribe?\"\n\nThe responses are gold.  \n  \nA lot of times, I was able to get them back by just guiding them or fixing some minor issue in the tool.\n\n**5. Use your own product every single day. Not once a week. Every. Day.**\n\nI built Brandled but wasn't using it consistently for my own content.\n\nOne day I forced myself to use it like a real user would.\n\nFound 7 bugs in 30 minutes. Things I never noticed in testing.\n\nMy users were experiencing all of this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nNow I use Brandled for everything.\n\nI catch problems before my users do. And I understand their workflow because I live it.\n\nIf you're not using your own product daily, you're building blind.\n\n**6. Retention > acquisition.**\n\nI was obsessed with getting new signups.\n\nRan ads. Did outreach. Posted everywhere.\n\nMeanwhile, my churn rate was 40% per month.\n\nI'd get 10 new customers and lose 4 old ones.\n\nNet growth: 6.\n\nI was filling a leaky bucket.\n\nThen I focused on retention:\n\n* Fixed onboarding\n* Added email sequences to keep users engaged\n* Built features existing customers actually asked for\n* Checked in with users who went quiet\n\nChurn dropped to 15%.\n\nNow when I get 10 new customers, I only lose 2-3.\n\nNet growth: 7-8.\n\nSame marketing effort, but better results.\n\n\n\n**7. Your MVP should only have the must-haves. Actually stick to MoSCoW.**\n\nI know everyone says this. But I didn't listen.\n\nMy \"MVP\" had:\n\n* Content generation\n* Analytics dashboard\n* Post scheduling\n* Competitor tracking\n* SWOT analysis\n* Comment assistant\n* Hashtag research\n\nThat's not an MVP.\n\nI should've launched with ONE feature: AI content generation that sounds like you.\n\nThat's it.\n\nEverything else should've come after people paid for that one thing.\n\nHere's how MoSCoW actually works:\n\n* **Must have:** The ONE thing that solves the core problem\n* **Should have:** Stuff you add after the first 10 paying customers ask for it\n* **Could have:** Nice-to-haves that you build if you have extra time (you won't)\n* **Won't have:** Everything else (most of your ideas belong here)\n\nYour MVP should make people go \"holy shit, this solves my problem\" even if it's ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, this has so many features\" while not solving anything particularly well.\n\n**8. Price based on value, not competition.**\n\nI looked at my competitors:\n\n* Taplio: $39/month\n* SuperX: $29/month\n* Hypefury: $29/month\n\nI priced Brandled at $19/month to \"undercut the market.\"\n\nBig mistake.\n\nLow price signals low value. People assumed I was inferior.\n\nPlus, at $19/month, I needed 263 customers to hit $5k MRR.\n\nAt $39/month, I need 128.\n\nHalf the customers for the same revenue.\n\nThen I realized: my tool saves people 10+ hours per week. That's worth $500-$700/month atleast for most founders.\n\nI wasn't competing on price. I was competing on value.\n\nRaised my price to $29/month - $39/month. Conversions actually IMPROVED.\n\nBecause the people who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers anyway.\n\nYour best customers care about results, not price.\n\nPrice for the value you deliver, not for what your competitors charge.\n\n**The Truth Most SaaS Founders Don't Want to Hear:**\n\nMost SaaS founders don't fail because of bad ideas.\n\nThey fail because they give up too early.\n\n90% of SaaS products are gone within 2 years.\n\nNot because they couldn't work.\n\nBecause the founder quit before they figured out what works.\n\nI almost quit at month 5. I was depressed. Burnt out. Convinced I was wasting my time.\n\nThen I changed my approach and hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nStill small. But it's proof the model works.\n\nNow it's just about staying consistent and not quitting when shit gets hard (which it will).\n\n**Here's my commitment:**\n\nI'm building this to $10k MRR minimum. No matter how long it takes.\n\nI'm documenting everything on X and LinkedIn.\n\nNot the highlight reel. The real shit. The mistakes. The failures. The small wins.\n\nIf you're building something, my advice: stay in the game.\n\nMost people quit right before things start working.\n\nDon't be most people.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any of this.\n\n",

WLKMe allows you to create an elegant **Digital Guide** that centralizes everything in one mobile-first place.\n\nOur philosophy is that technology should \"disappear\" so the focus remains on the human essence of welcoming. We have launched a **Free Forever tier** for essential guest onboarding because we want to empower every Host to deliver hotel-level experiences without the operational burden.\n\nI’d really appreciate your perspective on how this idea could better elevate the guest journey. I’ve been finding it challenging to validate the concept early on, especially when it comes to encouraging people to take a look and share honest feedback before I invest more development time.\n\nAs we get closer to launch, I’m realizing that my main difficulty isn’t the product itself, but how to present it in a way that invites curiosity and engagement. I currently have fewer than 300 people on the waiting list, even though everyone I’ve had the chance to walk through the idea with felt it made sense for the target audience.\n\nIf anyone has tips on validating or communicating an early-stage product more effectively, I’d love to learn from your experience.",

      "text": "\nUsed to spend 4-6 months building each idea before showing it to anyone, then launching to complete silence. Did that twice over 2 years, wasted probably $7K and countless hours. Decided to completely change my approach and test ideas way faster before committing to building anything substantial. The new process was forcing myself to validate demand before touching code. For each idea I'd spend 2 weekends just researching, finding people actively complaining about the problem on Reddit and forums, DMing 15-20 of them asking about their current solutions and what frustrated them most. If fewer than 10 people responded or showed real interest, I'd kill it immediately and move to the next idea.\n\nIdea 1 was a scheduling tool for consultants. Found maybe 8 complaints total, got 3 DM responses, nobody seemed that bothered by current solutions. Killed it after one weekend. Idea 2 was a content calendar for small agencies. Found 25+ complaints, got 12 responses, but when I asked if they'd pay $39/month most said probably not or maybe $15. Pricing signal was too weak, killed it after weekend two. Idea 3 was invoice tracking for freelancers. Found 40+ complaints, DMed 30 people, got 18 responses with real frustration about losing track of unpaid invoices. When I asked about paying $19/month, 7 people said yes immediately. Built a landing page that weekend describing the solution, posted it back in those communities, got 32 email signups and 4 people actually paid upfront through Stripe giving me $76 before building anything. That validation felt completely different from the previous two.\n\nSpent 3 weeks building the simplest version, launched it to those 32 people, got 9 more paying in week one. That was 7 months ago, now at $2.1K monthly with 114 paying users. Growth is steady at 10-15% monthly, mostly from word of mouth and organic search from blog posts I started writing in month 3. The fast validation approach came from studying founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful people killed bad ideas in days not months. Saved me from wasting 8-12 months building ideas 1 and 2 that would've failed. Now I can test 3-4 ideas in the time it used to take me to build one wrong one.",

Startups are NOT for everyone, even though they’ve become a “fancy” thing to do.\n\nMost people who want to do startups approach it the wrong way. \nReal entrepreneurs usually never set out to “do a startup”. They were passionate about creating or obsessed with solving a problem and eventually realized they had no choice but to build something.\n\nSo shift your mindset. Ask yourself: can you create something people want or solve a real problem, preferably in a domain you understand? \nIf yes, just build a solution. Forget “startup”. Do not overthink. Just create a product.\n\nIf it works, great. Then evaluate milestones carefully and grow from there. If it doesn’t, you’ll still learn something valuable. You may discover that startups are not for you, but indie hacking, freelancing, or an agency model might be.\n\nDo not draw conclusions first and then try to justify them backwards. Do what you can do now, and let the journey unfold naturally.",

Based on the 17 trials, I project gaining 6 paid clients.\n\nTotal Revenue Impact: \\~$600 MRR.\n\nLet's be honest, for almost 2 million views, 6 clients isn't huge.\n\nThe massive drop-off happened because I advertised the SaaS in the thread (posts 2 and 3) rather than the main post.\n\nThe fall from 1.9M to 78k views killed the conversion momentum.\n\nNext time, I’m going to pitch the product directly in the first post/video to capture that initial traffic, rather than relying on them clicking through a thread.\n\nOverall, $600 MRR is not life-changing, but it’s profitable and validates that the attention is there. I'm definitely doing it again.\n\n[Here is the tweet](https://x.com/romanbuildsaas/status/2006974222300831980?s=20)\n\nCheers!",

I've been a full time gig worker for 5+ years now and I've used every tool there is on the market and I've worked on most delivery apps along with running my own medical courier service. I have a strong sense of the market and I believe there to be a white space for an app such as Fleats to come in and potentially disrupt the industry. I am currently in a live PWA phase right now. \n\nLong story short I'm building a tool that delivery drivers need, and one I frankly wish I had years ago. I'm able to build on a super lean budget. I have great documentation. I'm not afraid of AI, but I value human effort and creativity. Just a fella trying to build an honest tool for an honest price and make it last.\n\nCheck Fleats out here: [https://www.fleatsdelivery.com](https://www.fleatsdelivery.com) (100 users max during our pwa test) *Development is active and ongoing so you might experience some issues as you navigate the app.*",

The product (by far the most important) Improve it constantly. Every small improvement chips away a few more % of churn. Rework your customer flow, ask users what frustrates them, accelerate the aha moment, and remove every friction point you can.\n\nWe do 5+ hours of customer calls every week just to understand how people actually use the product.\n\n2) Smart cancellation flow  \nWhen a user wants to cancel, we show a short survey (3 options max).  \nBased on the reason, we offer:\n\n* to pause the subscription\n* a coupon for the next month\n* or a call with an expert (me)\n\nThis alone saves 1 out of 4 users who want to leave, and gives insanely precise feedback on why people churn.  \nNo external tools needed. \\~1 hour of dev.  \nWe don’t block anyone, they can still cancel freely.\n\nIf someone cancels during the trial, we also offer 7 extra days if they just need more time.\n\n3) Failed payment recovery  \nStrong system with email reminders + in-app banners when a payment fails to recover unpaid subscriptions.\n\nResult: –30% churn → and a lot more room to grow.\n\nHope this helps someone.\n\nPlease don't buy costly tool to reduce churn, it's useless.",

However, this approach has mostly led me to ideas that feel either non-profitable or extremely niche. Maybe I’m misjudging their potential, or maybe I’m not thinking big enough—but it often seems hard to turn these ideas into something scalable.\n\nAnother approach I’ve experimented with (and I know this might be controversial) is using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. I provided it with my background (CV), the geographic area where I’d like to build the startup, my budget constraints, and my risk tolerance, hoping it could help identify relevant problems and possible solutions. I’m curious to hear what you think about this method—useful tool, or a trap?\n\nHow do you personally approach idea generation? Are there frameworks, habits, or paths you’ve found particularly effective?\n\nThanks in advance for your advices.",

It is also quite difficult. \n\nMy perspective, soon after COVID, so many senior people left their professions and decided to become consultants, selling their \"expertise\".

      "text": "\nAfter building and selling two SaaS companies and starting my third, I've learned what tools actually matter versus what just burns cash. My starter stack costs $73 monthly and stays the same for every new project until past $10K MRR. Then I upgrade based on real needs, not blog recommendations.\n\nCore stack: Railway at $20/month for hosting everything including database, simple and reliable. Postmark at $10/month for transactional emails with great deliverability. ConvertKit at $29/month for all marketing emails and simple automation. Stripe for payments. Plausible at $9/month for lightweight analytics. GitHub at $4/month. That's it. Everything else is free tier or manual work until revenue justifies more.\n\nWhat I specifically avoid early: Complex analytics platforms when conversion rate and revenue are the only metrics that matter, CRM software when spreadsheet works fine under 200 customers, monitoring tools beyond free tier when you're small enough to notice issues immediately, live chat when email support builds better relationships, marketing automation beyond basic sequences, any tool with enterprise features I won't use.\n\nThe pattern from both exits was clear: tool complexity grew with revenue, not before it. First company I wasted $8K on premature tools, learned my lesson. Second company I stayed lean until $15K MRR then upgraded methodically. Reached exit faster with lower burn. Third company I'm starting with the proven minimal stack and won't add anything until hitting clear pain points.\n\nStudied this approach across 300+ founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org), successful exits almost always came from lean operations and focus on revenue, not sophisticated tool stacks. Failed companies often had beautiful infrastructure and zero customers. Tools should solve problems you currently have, not problems you might have at scale you haven't reached. Start minimal, upgrade deliberately based on actual pain.",

The app pins the exact location with the photo and an optional comment.

This allows people to either search directly on the map or browse the list of reported lost pets. On the web version, everything can be viewed simultaneously.\n\nThe app is ready to be launched at any moment.\n\nI know similar ideas exist, but I couldn’t find one that works exactly like this, so I decided to build it myself.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.",

          "text": "Since you asked for it.\n\nThis is solving a problem that doesn't exist at scale, and the execution reveals fundamental misunderstandings about both lost pets and user behavior.\n\nFirst, the core premise is backwards. When someone loses a pet, they don't wander around hoping strangers spot it and upload photos to a niche app. They post on Facebook, Nextdoor, Instagram, and local community groups where millions of actual users already exist. Your app has zero users, which means zero sightings, which means zero value. You're asking people to download and check a ghost town app instead of using platforms they're already on.\n\nThe \"real-time photo upload\" feature is completely redundant. If someone sees a lost pet, they're already taking a photo and posting it to Facebook/Nextdoor with infinitely more reach. Why would they also download your app, create an account, and upload it again to your empty map? They wouldn't.\n\nThe 24-hour expiration is arbitrary and potentially harmful. Lost pets are often found days or weeks later. A sighting from 3 days ago is still valuable information about movement patterns and territory. You're deleting useful data for no reason except that you thought a color-changing timer sounded clever.\n\nThe separate \"Lost Pets\" tab completely undermines your own positioning. If owners are posting there with phone numbers and WhatsApp links, that's just a worse version of existing lost pet databases and Facebook groups. You haven't built anything new; you've built a fragmented, inferior clone of tools that already work.\n\n\"Ready to be launched at any moment\" but hasn't been launched tells me you know it won't gain traction. You're afraid to validate because deep down you understand nobody will use this. The app needs both pet owners AND random strangers to adopt it simultaneously to have any utility, which is a chicken-and-egg problem you have no strategy to solve.\n\nThe market has already decided this doesn't work. Similar apps exist and failed because lost pet recovery happens through network effects on existing social platforms, not through purpose-built apps with zero distribution. You've built a technically functional solution to a problem that's already better solved by posting in Facebook groups with actual community engagement.\n\nLaunch it if you want proof, but you'll get maybe 5 downloads from friends and then crickets. This isn't a startup, it's a portfolio piece pretending to be one.",

For example, if a meal contains 40g of protein, the product could suggest other dishes to consume during the day to help them reach, say, a 50g protein target.

Launch completely flopped and I couldn't figure out why for weeks. Looking back now 8 months later with clearer perspective and $3.4K MRR from relaunch, the mistakes were painfully obvious. Biggest mistake was building for 4 months without talking to a single potential user about their actual problems. Had an idea that seemed logical in my head, assumed people would want it because I would use it, coded in complete isolation. Never validated the problem was actually painful enough for people to pay money solving it. Never asked anyone what they currently use or what specifically frustrates them about existing solutions. Just built what I thought was cool and innovative. Launch failed because I built a solution for a problem that wasn't urgent or painful enough for anyone to care.\n\n  \nSecond mistake was treating launch as one single day event. Posted on Product Hunt, got my upvotes and moment of validation, then sat back waiting for organic growth that never came. Should've launched systematically across 20+ platforms over 2 focused weeks. Should've spent weeks before launch building authentic relationships in communities where target users actually hang out. Should've created helpful content explaining the problem I solve. Instead I just showed up launch day expecting instant traction from nowhere.\n\n  \nWhat I'd do differently starting today: spend 2-3 weeks only having conversations with 20-30 people who actually have the problem I think exists, ask what they currently use and why it frustrates them specifically, build only if 10+ people describe urgent pain and show clear willingness to pay real money. Launch systematically across every relevant platform over 2 weeks, not betting everything on one Product Hunt day. Start publishing genuinely helpful content weeks before launch building trust and visibility. Manually onboard first 20 users learning everything about their actual needs versus my assumptions. Reading failed launch stories in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) showed this exact pattern everywhere: flops came from building in isolation then expecting launch day magic, successes came from validating continuously and launching systematically. One perfect launch day won't make your business, consistent execution over months will.",

Few founders stop to ask whether the direction itself truly fits who they are and what they want to build.\n\r\nThe problem is not lack of intelligence or ambition. It is the absence of structure at a moment where everything feels possible and overwhelming at the same time. Business plans are often treated as formalities, yet they are meant to create alignment between vision, values, and execution.\n\r\nWhen that alignment is missing, progress can still happen, but energy slowly drains. Many founders only realize this much later, once changing direction becomes expensive.\n\r\nSome platforms like ember.do are exploring ways to help founders structure their thinking early, before momentum locks them into paths that do not feel right.\n\r\nHow do you personally decide when instinct is enough and when structure becomes necessary?\r\n",

Seeing everything together seems to help some founders commit faster. I came across tools like BrandScoop that bundle name ideas with domain availability and basic visual direction, which made me think more about *process* than any specific tool.\n\nFor those who’ve been through this phase already: do you prioritize speed and iterate later, or do you believe getting naming and branding mostly right early on saves time downstream?

Finding trusted sellers, buyers, reliable farming knowledge, or even market access is still largely informal and inefficient.\nWhat Poultry Market Kenya is\nPoultry Market Kenya is a community-driven digital platform built to support the entire poultry value chain:\nFarmers selling chicken, eggs, and poultry products\nCompanies supplying chicks, feeds, incubators, cages, and equipment\nBuyers looking for verified sellers\nKnowledge sharing through blogs and community content\nWhat makes it different\nAI poultry assistant trained on extensive poultry books and trusted resources to help with farming questions, disease guidance, and even image analysis\nMarketplace where verified sellers and companies can list products and reach buyers directly\nBlogging platform where farmers and experts share practical poultry knowledge\nSupport system for writers, allowing readers to support blog authors (withdrawals via local and global methods)\nTech stack (for the builders here)\nBackend: Python, FastAPI\nAI: LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini, RAG pipelines\nFrontend: Next.js\nFocused on production-grade workflows, observability, and scalability\nWhy I’m sharing\nThe platform is live, and I’m actively looking for:\nFeedback from farmers, founders, and builders\nSuggestions on improving the marketplace and AI workflows\nIdeas from anyone who’s worked on agri-tech, marketplaces, or AI assistants\nLive links\nWebsite & signup: https://poultrymarketke.vercel.app/auth/register\nAI assistant: https://poultrymarketke.vercel.app/chatbot\nBlog platform: https://poultrymarketke.vercel.app/blog\nThis is still early, but the goal is long-term: digitize poultry farming, improve market access, and make reliable knowledge accessible to small and medium-scale farmers.\nHappy to answer questions or hear your thoughts.",

In that case, the “better solution” would probably be a competitor app (not something in a different category like the camera example). \n\nBut that said, I just think I don’t have very many needs/problems that are solved by mobile apps!",

Sharing media through personal chats gets messy fast, and many people don’t want to share their phone numbers with strangers just to exchange photos.\nAnother problem I noticed is that the best photos are often taken by visitors, not the event planners, and those moments usually get lost. Guests don’t know where to send them, and organizers never get access to the best content from their own events.\nSo far, we’ve had:\n✔️100+ users\n✔️30+ events created\n✔️300+ photos and videos shared\nAll of this has been organic. Right now, I’m still working on the revenue side and testing what people are actually willing to pay for.\nPosting here mainly to learn:\n📌 what monetization models could work for a product like this\n📌 how others turned early traction into revenue\n📌 mistakes to avoid at this stage\nHappy to share more details or a link if anyone’s interested.",

              "text": "If I am allowed to be blunt, I think your pricing is too generous. The free tier already covers almost every family I know. Unlimited artworks and up to three children removes most practical reasons to ever upgrade. The paid plan does not meaningfully reduce friction or unlock enough additional value to justify spending money.\n\nRight now the free tier is not a teaser. It is the product. That makes monetization very hard unless you assume a user behavior that realistically will not happen.\n\nI also think your competitor comparison is weak. A family that wants to store their kids' artwork does not really need child-based tagging. They create folders per child. That already scales indefinitely. With basic image compression, cloud storage like Google Photos or Dropbox can handle this at very low cost and with almost no friction.\n\nMore importantly, I am not convinced the core problem is as strong as you assume. I do not think most parents actively want to track their kids' drawings over time. Not because they do not care, but because the value is in the moment. Seeing an old drawing later rarely recreates that feeling, except for very specific milestones, which are rare.\n\nSpeaking as a father of two, I do not remember most of the artwork my kids made when they were younger. Not because it was unimportant, but because it was a long time ago and did not carry lasting context. What I remember are the moments when something truly stood out.\n\nIn German kindergartens, kids often come home with new artwork almost daily. Or, in other cases, you are handed a full box at the end of the year. At that point, the drawings are disconnected from time, story, and context. You were not there when they were created. That makes archiving them less meaningful.\n\nIf anything, this feels less like a storage problem and more like a social or storytelling problem. A private, parent-focused sharing app where artwork is tied to stories, explanations, or short narratives about what the child said or felt in that moment would be more compelling. Something closer to a private Instagram for kids' art, focused on interaction and context rather than long-term archival.\n\nAs it stands, the product gives away too much for free, solves a weak problem for many parents, and competes against generic storage solutions that are already good enough.",

It's a Reddit marketing tool that generates leads for you and helps people get customers from Reddit. It has basically been my primary marketing method, and it's been working great for me.  \nIt's literally just enter your product description → wait 30 seconds → dozens of potential customers.\n\nI launched it 45 days ago.\n\nToday:\n\n\\- 5000 visited the site  \n\\- 212 signed up  \n\\- 11 paid  \n\\- $277 earned in total\n\nNot life-changing money. But it feels amazing.  \nIt's proof that people will pay for something I made. That *I can be a founder*.\n\nIt’s been hard watching others go viral while I stayed invisible. But over the past month and a half, I think I've learned that consistency beats going viral.\n\nTo anyone who’s building something and feeling stuck: keep posting. Keep iterating. Consistency is everything.\n\nIt's how I've grown and how I plan to keep growing.",

      "text": "As a techie who loves traveling across India, especially to historical and cultural places, I often feel a disconnect when visiting them because it’s hard to understand the mythology, local stories, and history of the place in one simple way. Usually I end up Googling, opening multiple blogs or Wikipedia pages, and still don’t get a complete picture. I’m wondering if others face the same problem — what if there was an app that automatically uses your location and shows you curated history, mythology, and local stories about the exact place you’re visiting? Before building anything, I’d like to validate this with the community: is this a real problem for you, how do you currently learn about places you visit, and would you consider using or paying for an app like this? We can expand this idea with a map like interface and add AR to make it engaging.",

The output is genuinely impressive for prototyping.\n\nBut after doing 500+ code reviews over my career, I keep seeing the same patterns when these apps need to go live:\n\nWhat vibe-coded MVPs typically miss:\n\n1. Security basics - No input validation, SQL injection vulnerabilities, exposed API keys in frontend code, missing rate limiting\n2. Error handling - Works great on the happy path. First unexpected input? Crashes with a cryptic error.\n3. Authentication gaps - \"It has login\" ≠ secure auth. Missing session management, no CSRF protection, weak password policies.\n4. Database sins - No indexes, N+1 queries, no migrations. Fine with 10 users. Falls over at 100.\n5. No separation of concerns - Business logic mixed with UI. Makes every change a game of Jenga.\n\nThe thing is: none of this matters for validation.\n\nIf you're testing whether people want your product, vibe-coded is perfect. Ship it. Get feedback.  \nBut there's a predictable moment usually when you get your first 50-100 real users where these issues start compounding. And fixing them in a messy codebase is 3x harder than building right from scratch.\n\nMy honest take: Vibe-code your prototype. Validate fast. But budget for a technical cleanup before you scale. It's not starting over it's graduating from prototype to product.\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall? What was the breaking point for you?",

Calls come in 24/7 from all over the world. There’s always someone available. I keep thinking about that system but for real human connection.\n\nWhat if you could open an app at any time, see who’s available to talk about things you’re actually interested in - startups, entrepreneurship, philosophy, whatever and just connect?\nNot people you know. Not people whose kids’ names you have to remember or who you have to ask about their last vacation. Just someone who shares your interest and is willing to be real.\n\nHot take: I think social media is dying. It’s turned into a 24/7 commercial where everyone’s performing. It’s exhausting.\n\nI think real conversation is about to make a comeback, but it’ll look different with technology. Like that call shadowing system but for connection: see who’s online, what they want to talk about, click, talk.\n\nNo followers, profiles to curate, or pretending. Just: “I want to talk about X with someone right now” → see who’s available → connect for 20 minutes → done.\n\nI want to build this. Looking for:\n\t∙\tTechnical co-founder/developer interested in this space\n\t∙\tPeople who want to help validate/test early versions\n\t∙\tAnyone who thinks this is worth building\n\nNot looking for:\n\t∙\tFunding (I can fund development)\n\t∙\tIdeas guys (I have the vision)\n\nWould you use this?

Ofc the AI will have certain arguments passed to it like the topic, subtopic, and then the chat will continue as normal, however with the AI listening, it can detect any scammerish behavior and officially ban or kick person B after for example the person hits a certain score that triggers the kick.",

Text-based scams work because people have time to craft responses and pretend. On a live call? Much harder to fake.\n\nThere will be some text exchange before the call - you need to know what you’re getting into. But I’m thinking minimal: topic selection, maybe a brief “what do you want to talk about?” Then you connect voice.\n\nOn the AI moderation side - I’m less worried about monitoring calls for scams and more interested in AI helping with better matching. Like, it asks you clarifying questions to get to what you actually want to talk about (not just surface level), then matches you with someone who’s in a similar place.\n\nThe tricky part is the transition: how do you go from “I selected ‘early stage startup idea’” to actually having a deep, meaningful conversation? \n\nI don’t have that figured out yet. Maybe the AI gives each person a brief summary of what the other wants to discuss? Or suggests conversation starters? Open to ideas.\n\nWhat made you think about this problem?",

Scammers won’t bother if there’s friction upfront.\n\n\t2.\tInstant exit with no explanation needed - if you get on a call and feel uncomfortable, you just hang up. No explanation, no awkwardness. You’ll never be matched with that person again automatically.\n\n\t3.\tReputation/trust system - like Reddit’s upvote/downvote but for behavior. If multiple people exit calls with you immediately or report you, your account gets flagged/suspended. This discourages people from being creepy because it affects their ability to use the platform.\n\n\t4.\tGradual access - maybe you can’t match immediately on day 1. Need some history/trust built first.\n\n\t5.\tMutual opt-in to reconnect - after a conversation, both people have to choose to connect again. One person can’t force continued contact.\n\nThe goal isn’t perfect security (impossible), but making it annoying enough for bad actors that they go elsewhere while keeping it easy for genuine people. Bad behavior has consequences.\n\nWhat else would make you feel safe using something like this?",

And there are lots of LARPers. Identifying genuine people into any given thing is a really hard problem.\n\nThis kind of thing has been done many times before, this is basically how the tertiary education system works, or how Google indexed the web. You need to think like a game designer, but not to optimise for engagement and time on device, but for consensus and an accurate reflection of the real hierarchy in that domain, with high-fidelity to the perception of that community.\n\nI'm working on this, but not in the media format you want to connect people in, which I think is way down stream from the ground-level problem you have to solve before it would become viable.\n\nI'm focused on event search, which will provide the data layer for interest-based reputation. Unless you can use your paradigm to boot load the reputation system, which I doubt because of the cold-start problem, I wouldn't throw your money at this.",

But I think AI solves the cold-start problem you’re pointing out.\n\nInstead of relying on external data (like event attendance), the AI would have an onboarding conversation with each user, not a quiz, but a natural back-and-forth to understand what they’re actually looking for and what depth they operate at. Based on that conversation (word choice, self-awareness, how they articulate problems), AI builds a matching profile.\nThis is similar to how TikTok learns what content you want without you telling it, except it’s learning what kind of PERSON you’d connect with based on how you communicate.\n\nYour event search approach is interesting. Are you solving a similar connection problem through a different format? Curious how you’re thinking about it.",

Interests are fractal, and for needs into particular things small differences become chasms.\n\nHow people overcome those chasms is repeat interactions between the same people, which can only be achieved below the Dunbar number. \n\nAside from the fact that even with AI onboarding you won't be able to overcome the density problem of matching people at the exact moment that they want to talk.\n\nAnd that doesn't even mention the fact that people know they're talking to an AI and will lie to an extent, trying to confuse it and to trip up the AI to see if they can push it to say things you don't intend. You might assume that this isn't a problem, those people won't get matched, but:\n\n1. generative AI is not deterministic\n\n2. it's expensive, and these users haven't paid yet. \n\nCustomer service is a cost basis. Companies like the one you work for literally have to pay for it, either a person or an AI. But you're trying to monetise the cost basis after spending the money. That takes a lot of money, because you're banking on enough engagement (cost) to justify investment. \n\nBest case scenario for you is that you manage to stitch it together yourself, like Clubhouse, because you won't find a developer. Ask yourself why Clubhouse didn't do this? Audio social networks have been around for a while now. It's because of the density problem. Clubhouse were new enough that if generative AI made a difference it would have prevented them from failing.\n\nIn my view the only way to solve the loneliness and atomisation pandemic is by bringing people together in physical spaces, using LLMs to aggregate event data, which is then monetised like Substack and Patreon, but for event based creators (artists, teachers, organisers, speakers).",

Basically saves a fixed batch of test inputs so I can re-run the same data set each time I tweak the prompt.\n\nAlso runs multiple models at once and compares speed/cost/quality outputs.

      "text": "Hi all, first thanks for reading this post. I am looking for a serious cofounder to continue the startup adventure with me.\n\nA little about me: I am already full time. I quitted my job a little over year ago with another cofounder. But after one unsuccessful pivot, my cofounder decided to leave. But I still don't want to give up yet. So here I am looking for similar minded folks!\n\nWhat I can offer as a cofounder:\n\n1. Technical skills. I was a ML scientist for Amazon and have a PhD in computational math before starting the adventure. So I have a solid foundation for coding (mostly backend). In my previous startup, me and my cofounder created two AI-based softwares from ground up and get some sales.\n2. Customer development. I am also the one who is doing all the cold outreach, customer interviews and help refine the product vision and refine the ICP\n3. Persistence and commitment. I like to invest in relationship. So if I decide to work with you, you don't have to worry I give up easily.\n4. Domain expertise in some area. Especially in education, tech, and finance (passed CFA II). So we can discuss some startup ideas in this area if you are interested. But I am open to other ideas\n\nWhat I want my cofounders to bring to the table\n\n1. Must be in Seattle area and willing to meet 3-4 times in person a week. I want to build a real relationship with my cofounders\n2. Must be already full time. Not against who is doing side hustles. Just based on my personal experience. I had tried to start a business with some one who only did the startup as a side hustle. It was a terrible mistake and invited a lot of frustrations and grudge against each other which I want to avoid again\n3. No specific preference for technical or nontechnical. But if you are non-technical, hope you are domain expert in the area that you want to start a startup in. My past year told me that founder-market fit is crucial.\n\nAgain thanks for reading and please feel free to DM me if you are interested!",
