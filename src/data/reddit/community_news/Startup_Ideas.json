      "text": "* 80%+ of people prefer Google sign in\n* Removing all branding/formatting from emails and sending them from a real name increases open rate\n* You won’t know when you have PMF but a good sign is that people buy and tell their friends about your product\n* 99.9% of people that approach you with some offer are a waste of time\n* Sponsoring creators is cheaper but takes more time than paid ads\n* Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want\n* Once you become successful there will be lots of copy cats but they only achieve a fraction of what you do. You are the source to their success\n* I would never be able to build a good product if I didn’t use it myself\n* Always monitor logs after pushing new updates\n* Bugs are fine as long as you fix them fast\n* People love good design\n* Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far\n* Always refund people that want a refund\n* Asking where people heard about you during onboarding makes marketing 10x easier\n* Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n* Don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more\n* A surprising amount of users are willing to get on a call to talk about your product and it’s super helpful\n* Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product\n* Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success\n* Even when things are going well you’ll have moments when you doubt everything, just have to shut that voice out and keep going\n\nFor context, [my app](https://buildpad.io) guides users through ideation and idea validation.",

I built SignalScouter to find Reddit threads where folks ask for solutions and auto-generate founder‑style replies, which helps with getting first customers; it drove 89 waitlist signups in 2 days and 10k post views.

That means there are millions of problems on Reddit\n\nThe number of people in each subreddit means the number of people seeking solutions, note these numbers are crazy large in some sub reddits and small in others(that tells you how high the demand for the solution of the problem is)\n\nNow imagine this, extrapolate each of those subreddit(problems), and people on them as people seeking solutions. Now imagine how many people that not on Reddit but have the problems of the subreddit(the rest of country or the world). That's a large audience \n\nNow use Google to find people looking for the main topic of each subreddit(example r/side hustle) Google \"I need a side hustle\" or \"looking for a side hustle\" \n\nNow you have problems to solve and people who are looking for solutions to that problem",

Startups are NOT for everyone, even though they’ve become a “fancy” thing to do.\n\nMost people who want to do startups approach it the wrong way. \nReal entrepreneurs usually never set out to “do a startup”. They were passionate about creating or obsessed with solving a problem and eventually realized they had no choice but to build something.\n\nSo shift your mindset. Ask yourself: can you create something people want or solve a real problem, preferably in a domain you understand? \nIf yes, just build a solution. Forget “startup”. Do not overthink. Just create a product.\n\nIf it works, great. Then evaluate milestones carefully and grow from there. If it doesn’t, you’ll still learn something valuable. You may discover that startups are not for you, but indie hacking, freelancing, or an agency model might be.\n\nDo not draw conclusions first and then try to justify them backwards. Do what you can do now, and let the journey unfold naturally.",

      "text": "\nUsed to spend 4-6 months building each idea before showing it to anyone, then launching to complete silence. Did that twice over 2 years, wasted probably $7K and countless hours. Decided to completely change my approach and test ideas way faster before committing to building anything substantial. The new process was forcing myself to validate demand before touching code. For each idea I'd spend 2 weekends just researching, finding people actively complaining about the problem on Reddit and forums, DMing 15-20 of them asking about their current solutions and what frustrated them most. If fewer than 10 people responded or showed real interest, I'd kill it immediately and move to the next idea.\n\nIdea 1 was a scheduling tool for consultants. Found maybe 8 complaints total, got 3 DM responses, nobody seemed that bothered by current solutions. Killed it after one weekend. Idea 2 was a content calendar for small agencies. Found 25+ complaints, got 12 responses, but when I asked if they'd pay $39/month most said probably not or maybe $15. Pricing signal was too weak, killed it after weekend two. Idea 3 was invoice tracking for freelancers. Found 40+ complaints, DMed 30 people, got 18 responses with real frustration about losing track of unpaid invoices. When I asked about paying $19/month, 7 people said yes immediately. Built a landing page that weekend describing the solution, posted it back in those communities, got 32 email signups and 4 people actually paid upfront through Stripe giving me $76 before building anything. That validation felt completely different from the previous two.\n\nSpent 3 weeks building the simplest version, launched it to those 32 people, got 9 more paying in week one. That was 7 months ago, now at $2.1K monthly with 114 paying users. Growth is steady at 10-15% monthly, mostly from word of mouth and organic search from blog posts I started writing in month 3. The fast validation approach came from studying founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful people killed bad ideas in days not months. Saved me from wasting 8-12 months building ideas 1 and 2 that would've failed. Now I can test 3-4 ideas in the time it used to take me to build one wrong one.",

Based on the 17 trials, I project gaining 6 paid clients.\n\nTotal Revenue Impact: \\~$600 MRR.\n\nLet's be honest, for almost 2 million views, 6 clients isn't huge.\n\nThe massive drop-off happened because I advertised the SaaS in the thread (posts 2 and 3) rather than the main post.\n\nThe fall from 1.9M to 78k views killed the conversion momentum.\n\nNext time, I’m going to pitch the product directly in the first post/video to capture that initial traffic, rather than relying on them clicking through a thread.\n\nOverall, $600 MRR is not life-changing, but it’s profitable and validates that the attention is there. I'm definitely doing it again.\n\n[Here is the tweet](https://x.com/romanbuildsaas/status/2006974222300831980?s=20)\n\nCheers!",

The app pins the exact location with the photo and an optional comment. Each post stays visible for 24 hours, and the marker changes color from green to red as time passes, indicating how recent the sighting is.\n\nI also added a separate “Lost Pets” tab where owners can publish their missing pets with a phone number and a direct WhatsApp link. This allows people to either search directly on the map or browse the list of reported lost pets. On the web version, everything can be viewed simultaneously.\n\nThe app is ready to be launched at any moment.\n\nI know similar ideas exist, but I couldn’t find one that works exactly like this, so I decided to build it myself.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.",

          "text": "Since you asked for it.\n\nThis is solving a problem that doesn't exist at scale, and the execution reveals fundamental misunderstandings about both lost pets and user behavior.\n\nFirst, the core premise is backwards. When someone loses a pet, they don't wander around hoping strangers spot it and upload photos to a niche app. They post on Facebook, Nextdoor, Instagram, and local community groups where millions of actual users already exist. Your app has zero users, which means zero sightings, which means zero value. You're asking people to download and check a ghost town app instead of using platforms they're already on.\n\nThe \"real-time photo upload\" feature is completely redundant. If someone sees a lost pet, they're already taking a photo and posting it to Facebook/Nextdoor with infinitely more reach. Why would they also download your app, create an account, and upload it again to your empty map? They wouldn't.\n\nThe 24-hour expiration is arbitrary and potentially harmful. Lost pets are often found days or weeks later. A sighting from 3 days ago is still valuable information about movement patterns and territory. You're deleting useful data for no reason except that you thought a color-changing timer sounded clever.\n\nThe separate \"Lost Pets\" tab completely undermines your own positioning. If owners are posting there with phone numbers and WhatsApp links, that's just a worse version of existing lost pet databases and Facebook groups. You haven't built anything new; you've built a fragmented, inferior clone of tools that already work.\n\n\"Ready to be launched at any moment\" but hasn't been launched tells me you know it won't gain traction. You're afraid to validate because deep down you understand nobody will use this. The app needs both pet owners AND random strangers to adopt it simultaneously to have any utility, which is a chicken-and-egg problem you have no strategy to solve.\n\nThe market has already decided this doesn't work. Similar apps exist and failed because lost pet recovery happens through network effects on existing social platforms, not through purpose-built apps with zero distribution. You've built a technically functional solution to a problem that's already better solved by posting in Facebook groups with actual community engagement.\n\nLaunch it if you want proof, but you'll get maybe 5 downloads from friends and then crickets. This isn't a startup, it's a portfolio piece pretending to be one.",

But you don't know who those people are, they're just percentages to you.\n\nSo you need to marketing this app to an entire country, state, city etc. The smaller the area, the less people you'll get on it, and the less useful the app will be in general.\n\nSo, what's your marketing budget? Without it, you'll have no users, and with no users, you'll have no pets reported, and without that, no one will use it to look for their pets.\n\nCritical mass, chicken and egg, all the cliched sayings are applicable here (as they are in most app launches, tbh). You are ENTIRELY dependent on a huge amount of active (installed, willing, vigilant to potential missing animal sightings) users to make your app work - it does not scale down very far at all.\n\nBasically, no one reporting pets means no one will check for missing pets, and to get enough people reporting missing pets for it to be useful, you need a HUGE marketing campaign.\n\n\"7 people in \\[a small town in the middle of nowhere\\] spotted what might be a missing animal in th last month\" is not much of a strap line.\n\nOnce you have it installed on tens of thousands of devices, THEN you just need to figure out how to make it super quick to open and snap a picture.

I am currently in a live PWA phase right now. \n\nLong story short I'm building a tool that delivery drivers need, and one I frankly wish I had years ago. I'm able to build on a super lean budget.

      "text": "Hello everyone,  \nI’m an engineering university student and aspiring entrepreneur, and I’m currently struggling with one of the most common questions: where do scalable and profitable startup ideas actually come from?\n\nI’ve tried starting from problems I personally face in everyday life and thinking about how to solve them in a way that could benefit others. However, this approach has mostly led me to ideas that feel either non-profitable or extremely niche. Maybe I’m misjudging their potential, or maybe I’m not thinking big enough—but it often seems hard to turn these ideas into something scalable.\n\nAnother approach I’ve experimented with (and I know this might be controversial) is using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. I provided it with my background (CV), the geographic area where I’d like to build the startup, my budget constraints, and my risk tolerance, hoping it could help identify relevant problems and possible solutions. I’m curious to hear what you think about this method—useful tool, or a trap?\n\nHow do you personally approach idea generation? Are there frameworks, habits, or paths you’ve found particularly effective?\n\nThanks in advance for your advices.",

There's going to be compliance, security reviews, and other things.  Also, you have to have worked in a real company and observe the challenges people.\n\nIf it's a consumer problem you're trying to solve, join their Facebook communities, read the chats, ask questions about the problems, find out if people are willing to pay for a solution.  It is also quite difficult. \n\nMy perspective, soon after COVID, so many senior people left their professions and decided to become consultants, selling their \"expertise\".  Most of them struggle and fail because there are too many consultants.  Now with vibecoding, everyone thinks they can write an app and strike it rich. Also a pipe dream for most.  Unless you have financial cushion to work on it for years, the chances of success are low.\n\nI don't want to pour cold water on you, I think I'm being brutally honest from my perspective.",

There are already quite a few tools that calculate calorie counts and suggest recipes.\n\nOne suggestion would be to add health tags like healthy / not healthy using the data already available to the user (protein, carbs, calories, etc.).\n\nIf a dish is marked as not healthy, the product could suggest ingredient swaps or additions to make it healthier.\n\nAdditionally, if a user’s protein intake is below the recommended level. For example, if a meal contains 40g of protein, the product could suggest other dishes to consume during the day to help them reach, say, a 50g protein target. This could work as an AI-based protein or nutrition suggester, helping users balance their daily intake rather than just track it.",

The product direction was clear, but choosing a name that felt distinctive, matched the vision, and wasn’t immediately blocked by domain issues turned into a bigger bottleneck than expected.\n\nI noticed that when naming, domain checks, and visual identity are handled separately, it’s easy to get stuck in endless loops of second-guessing. Seeing everything together seems to help some founders commit faster. I came across tools like BrandScoop that bundle name ideas with domain availability and basic visual direction, which made me think more about *process* than any specific tool.\n\nFor those who’ve been through this phase already: do you prioritize speed and iterate later, or do you believe getting naming and branding mostly right early on saves time downstream?

In that case, the “better solution” would probably be a competitor app (not something in a different category like the camera example). \n\nBut that said, I just think I don’t have very many needs/problems that are solved by mobile apps!",

I built SignalScouter, a founder-led SaaS that finds Reddit posts with active prospects and drafts founder-style replies so you can validate and engage the unorganized sector faster, we got 89 signups in 2 days and 10k+ post views, would love any feedback or love to connect if you try it out — good luck!",

Maybe you come up with a solution and no I didn't wit 60 days until I give up, I had no energie and no response for my offer, the freebie I made and I prepared email and others things so it can go on but it never happened and yes as a side I tried other mechanics to get clients but that didn't work either so, pls stop telling me I need to solve anything, when no one want the solution from me",

I keep thinking about that system but for real human connection.\n\nWhat if you could open an app at any time, see who’s available to talk about things you’re actually interested in - startups, entrepreneurship, philosophy, whatever and just connect?\nNot people you know. Not people whose kids’ names you have to remember or who you have to ask about their last vacation. Just someone who shares your interest and is willing to be real.\n\nHot take: I think social media is dying. It’s turned into a 24/7 commercial where everyone’s performing. It’s exhausting.\n\nI think real conversation is about to make a comeback, but it’ll look different with technology. Like that call shadowing system but for connection: see who’s online, what they want to talk about, click, talk.\n\nNo followers, profiles to curate, or pretending. Just: “I want to talk about X with someone right now” → see who’s available → connect for 20 minutes → done.\n\nI want to build this.

Text-based scams work because people have time to craft responses and pretend. On a live call? Much harder to fake.\n\nThere will be some text exchange before the call - you need to know what you’re getting into. But I’m thinking minimal: topic selection, maybe a brief “what do you want to talk about?” Then you connect voice.\n\nOn the AI moderation side - I’m less worried about monitoring calls for scams and more interested in AI helping with better matching. Like, it asks you clarifying questions to get to what you actually want to talk about (not just surface level), then matches you with someone who’s in a similar place.\n\nThe tricky part is the transition: how do you go from “I selected ‘early stage startup idea’” to actually having a deep, meaningful conversation? \n\nI don’t have that figured out yet. Maybe the AI gives each person a brief summary of what the other wants to discuss? Or suggests conversation starters? Open to ideas.\n\nWhat made you think about this problem?",

You’ll never be matched with that person again automatically.\n\n\t3.\tReputation/trust system - like Reddit’s upvote/downvote but for behavior. If multiple people exit calls with you immediately or report you, your account gets flagged/suspended. This discourages people from being creepy because it affects their ability to use the platform.\n\n\t4.\tGradual access - maybe you can’t match immediately on day 1. Need some history/trust built first.\n\n\t5.\tMutual opt-in to reconnect - after a conversation, both people have to choose to connect again. One person can’t force continued contact.\n\nThe goal isn’t perfect security (impossible), but making it annoying enough for bad actors that they go elsewhere while keeping it easy for genuine people. Bad behavior has consequences.\n\nWhat else would make you feel safe using something like this?",

And there are lots of LARPers. Identifying genuine people into any given thing is a really hard problem.\n\nThis kind of thing has been done many times before, this is basically how the tertiary education system works, or how Google indexed the web. You need to think like a game designer, but not to optimise for engagement and time on device, but for consensus and an accurate reflection of the real hierarchy in that domain, with high-fidelity to the perception of that community.\n\nI'm working on this, but not in the media format you want to connect people in, which I think is way down stream from the ground-level problem you have to solve before it would become viable.\n\nI'm focused on event search, which will provide the data layer for interest-based reputation.

Based on that conversation (word choice, self-awareness, how they articulate problems), AI builds a matching profile.\nThis is similar to how TikTok learns what content you want without you telling it, except it’s learning what kind of PERSON you’d connect with based on how you communicate.\n\nYour event search approach is interesting. Are you solving a similar connection problem through a different format? Curious how you’re thinking about it.",

Interests are fractal, and for needs into particular things small differences become chasms.\n\nHow people overcome those chasms is repeat interactions between the same people, which can only be achieved below the Dunbar number. \n\nAside from the fact that even with AI onboarding you won't be able to overcome the density problem of matching people at the exact moment that they want to talk.\n\nAnd that doesn't even mention the fact that people know they're talking to an AI and will lie to an extent, trying to confuse it and to trip up the AI to see if they can push it to say things you don't intend. You might assume that this isn't a problem, those people won't get matched, but:\n\n1. generative AI is not deterministic\n\n2. it's expensive, and these users haven't paid yet. \n\nCustomer service is a cost basis. Companies like the one you work for literally have to pay for it, either a person or an AI. But you're trying to monetise the cost basis after spending the money. That takes a lot of money, because you're banking on enough engagement (cost) to justify investment. \n\nBest case scenario for you is that you manage to stitch it together yourself, like Clubhouse, because you won't find a developer. Ask yourself why Clubhouse didn't do this? Audio social networks have been around for a while now. It's because of the density problem. Clubhouse were new enough that if generative AI made a difference it would have prevented them from failing.\n\nIn my view the only way to solve the loneliness and atomisation pandemic is by bringing people together in physical spaces, using LLMs to aggregate event data, which is then monetised like Substack and Patreon, but for event based creators (artists, teachers, organisers, speakers).",

      "text": "Hi all, first thanks for reading this post. I am looking for a serious cofounder to continue the startup adventure with me.\n\nA little about me: I am already full time. I quitted my job a little over year ago with another cofounder. But after one unsuccessful pivot, my cofounder decided to leave. But I still don't want to give up yet. So here I am looking for similar minded folks!\n\nWhat I can offer as a cofounder:\n\n1. Technical skills. I was a ML scientist for Amazon and have a PhD in computational math before starting the adventure. So I have a solid foundation for coding (mostly backend). In my previous startup, me and my cofounder created two AI-based softwares from ground up and get some sales.\n2. Customer development. I am also the one who is doing all the cold outreach, customer interviews and help refine the product vision and refine the ICP\n3. Persistence and commitment. I like to invest in relationship. So if I decide to work with you, you don't have to worry I give up easily.\n4. Domain expertise in some area. Especially in education, tech, and finance (passed CFA II). So we can discuss some startup ideas in this area if you are interested. But I am open to other ideas\n\nWhat I want my cofounders to bring to the table\n\n1. Must be in Seattle area and willing to meet 3-4 times in person a week. I want to build a real relationship with my cofounders\n2. Must be already full time. Not against who is doing side hustles. Just based on my personal experience. I had tried to start a business with some one who only did the startup as a side hustle. It was a terrible mistake and invited a lot of frustrations and grudge against each other which I want to avoid again\n3. No specific preference for technical or nontechnical. But if you are non-technical, hope you are domain expert in the area that you want to start a startup in. My past year told me that founder-market fit is crucial.\n\nAgain thanks for reading and please feel free to DM me if you are interested!",
