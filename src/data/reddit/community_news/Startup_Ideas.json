      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed a pattern where many founders come up with a \"brand new\" idea, only to realize later that it was attempted (and burned through millions in VC funding) back in 2014.\n\nI actually enjoy digging through the history of the tech industry, so I started collecting data on closed-down startups and failed businesses going back to the dotcoms. It’s fascinating to see why they failed, sometimes it was bad timing, sometimes it was no product-market fit, and sometimes they just ran out of cash.\n\nI organized all this data into a searchable archive. If you are brainstorming a new venture, you might want to check if someone has already paid the \"tuition\" for learning that lesson so you don't have to.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.loot-drop.io\n\nI’d love to hear if you can find any \"ghosts\" of ideas you’re \n\ncurrently working on!",

Start shipping.\" is the most overused, brain-dead, derivative piece of advice since \"live, laugh, love\" for tech-bro assholes.\n\nYou literally have three words on the page. That is not a \"minimalist aesthetic.\" That is you being too goddamn lazy to actually explain what you are selling.\n\nAre you a directory, a community, or just a placeholder for your own crumbling ego? Because right now it looks like a goddamn digital tombstone for a concept that died in the womb.\n\nYou are trying to sell a \"philosophy\" because you clearly do not have the technical talent to build an actual goddamn product.\n\nThis website has the same energy as a guy in a gym who yells \"no pain no gain\" while doing zero actual fucking reps.\n\nIs this supposed to be a landing page or a cry for help? Because it looks like the kind of shit a cult leader would post before the feds show up.\n\nYou probably tell people you are \"focused on the core loop\" when in reality you just have nothing of value to offer the world.\n\nIf your shipping speed is as fast as your design process, you probably finished this entire piece of shit in the time it took to take a particularly aggressive dump.\n\nI have seen more intellectual depth in a bowl of alphabet soup than in your entire value proposition.\n\nIt takes a monumental level of balls to put \"club\" in the URL when you are clearly the only member of this pathetic, one-man circle jerk.\n\nThe most impressive thing about this entire startup is that you managed to pay for the domain registration without accidentally choking on your own tongue.\n\nI actually admire how you have managed to make \"nothing\" look so incredibly arrogant.",

That likely means importing data with user permission and keeping it on-device rather than building a centralized data pipeline.\n\nThe challenge is doing it in a way that preserves privacy and simplicity, especially for people who are already overwhelmed during flares. But I agree, correlation tools between fitness data and symptoms are compelling and very much on the long-term radar.\n\nIf you’d be open to it, I’d love to hear what specific Garmin metrics you find most meaningful.",

Trust in this space is fragile, and we are not interested in repeating that pattern.\n\nThat said, I do believe there is real value in shared knowledge over time. If we ever build something along those lines, it would be based on clear and voluntary participation. For example, someone could choose to contribute an anonymous insight like a specific stretch helping a specific type of pain to a public knowledge library.\n\nBut nothing would ever be collected or redistributed without explicit consent.

I’m actually building a tool that solves exactly that. Would you be open to checking it out? Totally fine if not.”\n\n→ if they’re interested, then I share the link\n\n→ if not, I just thank them and move on\n\nA few things I learned after months of using Reddit:\n\n→ Reddit DMs could have pretty night reply rate when they don’t feel spammy and the context is right\n\n→ Timing matters more than perfect copy\n\n→ Being helpful publicly first builds trust instantly\n\n→ Most people are actually open to trying new tools if you’re not pushy\n\nSo far, this approach has led to:\n\n100+ paying customers\n\n$5,000k+ total revenue\n\n$1,500+ MRR\n\n(here’s the tool if you want to check it out: [leadverse.ai](https://leadverse.ai))\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any part of this if it helps someone else here.",

The goal was simple: bring back that old-school vibe where you can just talk to strangers from anywhere in the world without all the chaos.\n\nDay one? Honestly, kind of disappointing. Hardly anyone showed up. But that was expected. Brand new site, no audience, nobody even knows it exists.\n\nDay two was completely different.\n\nWhen I opened the site, it actually started matching me with people pretty quickly. I ended up having some surprisingly long and genuine conversations. A few people gave me solid feedback, which honestly meant a lot. Some were shocked that a student built it. A couple even got slightly scared when I told them I made the site… and instantly disconnected 😂\n\nRight now it matches you with someone in under 60 seconds on average. That’ll improve as more people join.\n\nToday alone, around 200 unique users visited. It’s not a massive number, but for a 2-day-old project, it feels huge to me.\n\nI’m planning to add some unique features that current competitors don’t have, but I want to keep it clean, cozy, and safe - that classic simple random chat feel.\n\nIf you’re reading this, maybe give it a try. You might randomly match with me.\n\nAnd if you’ve got ideas, feedback, or want to collaborate - I’m all ears.",

      "text": "I'm 20 years old and today when I was stuck in traffic i noticed something.\nMost of the time when someone honks, the person who actually needs to hear it doesn’t hear it clearly. But everyone else around gets the noise. And honestly, horns feel like outdated tech at this point.\nSo I had an idea.\nWhat if instead of blasting sound outside, cars had a small device installed near the horn system. When you press the horn, it sends a short-range wireless signal (10–20 meters). Only the nearby cars receive it, and the horn sound plays inside their vehicle through their speakers.\nSo:\nNo external noise pollution\nOnly relevant drivers get the alert\nMore controlled and less chaotic traffic\nFeels futuristic\nEmergency vehicles could use a stronger signal that overrides music inside cars. That alone could reduce response times.\nOf course this would only work if cars adopt a common standard. Security and misuse would need to be handled with encryption.\nBut I’m curious:\nWould this actually make roads better?\nOr am I missing some obvious flaw?\nWould you want this in your car?\nLooking for honest feedback. Tear it apart if needed.\n\n\n**Please give your genuine advice to your this small brother** 🙏 wanna be elon musk\n\nBtw that's my 10th startup idea, working on 2",

That's it.\n\n**The journey:**\n\nLast year I spent months building 3 different apps. Made them perfect, added every feature I could think of.\n\nMade $0 from all of them.\n\nThis time I saw people complaining about OpenClaw being hard to set up, built something in 4 days while people still cared, and now 20+ people are paying me monthly.\n\n**What I learned:**\n\nDon't spend months making something perfect. Build it fast, ship it while people want it, fix it later.\n\nAlso turns out AI tools can help you build way faster than doing everything yourself.\n\n$500/month isn't huge, but after a year of making nothing, it feels amazing.",

That's impossible to learn from a signup form.\n\n\n\n20-30 real users iterating with you is infinitely more valuable than 500 people waiting. The \"no traction\" concern is a fear response, not a real risk. Investors and future users don't care how big your waitlist was at launch — they care about retention and engagement.\n\n\n\nOne thing I've seen work well: before opening access, run a few structured conversations with your waitlist users. Not surveys — actual 20-min calls. Ask them what they're currently using for customer support, what's painful about it, and what would make them switch. That gives you a sharper value prop going in.\n\n\n\nThe procrastinating-behind-validation instinct is real and dangerous. Ship it.",

      "text": "I’ve built enough “cool” projects over the last year to realize cool doesn’t equal demand. Most of my early ideas were based on trends. If something was blowing up on X or Product Hunt, I’d convince myself there was an opportunity there. What I ignored was whether normal people were consistently asking for it.\n\nLately I’ve been flipping that approach. Instead of chasing hype, I’ve been looking for repeated friction, small problems that show up again and again in niche communities. Early 2026 feels like it’s rewarding that mindset. The opportunities I’m seeing aren’t massive, VC-style moonshots. They’re focused tools solving specific pain for clearly defined groups.\n\nA few that stand out:\n\nVery niche wellness tools. Not another general fitness app, but highly targeted solutions, managing jet lag for digital nomads, sleep optimisation for remote workers across time zones, even data tools for hobby gardeners tracking soil conditions. The narrower the audience, the clearer the value proposition.\n\nSustainability tools for small ecom brands. A lot of Etsy and Shopify sellers are confused about carbon reporting and “green” compliance, especially when selling into the EU. Enterprise software is too complex and expensive. A simple, affordable compliance tracker built specifically for small sellers feels like a realistic opportunity.\n\nInfrastructure for private hobby communities. Smaller groups (board games, niche repairs, maker communities, etc.) are growing outside major platforms, but they struggle with coordination. Tools that help with event management, moderation, or matching members by interests could add value without trying to become another social network.\n\nWhile trying to validate these patterns, I got tired of manually scanning hundreds of threads. I started using StartupIdeasDB since it compiles real startup pain points people post about. It helped surface recurring themes faster so I could see which problems kept showing up.\n\nAnother area that seems underbuilt: trade skill learning. Plumbing, welding, auto repair, there’s a clear labor shortage, but most training resources aren’t very modern or accessible. Short-form, mobile-first lessons tied to job matching could be a strong niche SaaS play.\n\nPrivacy-first creator analytics also looks promising. More creators are wary of giving platforms deeper access to their data. Transparent, secure dashboards that provide insights without harvesting everything could appeal to that shift.\n\nAnd outside large cities, there are still gaps in local infrastructure, tool sharing, small-town delivery coordination, community-based services. Most apps are designed for dense urban markets. There may be less competition in building for smaller regions.\n\nNone of these ideas are revolutionary. That’s kind of the point. They’re practical, repeat problems with visible demand and relatively manageable scope. The type of ideas you can test quickly without needing massive capital.\n\nWhat recurring problem have you noticed that feels buildable right now?",

I'm a full-stack web & mobile developer with deep expertise in automation, AI-powered systems, and lead generation.\n\nOver the past year+, I served as CTO of a project where we built AI employees and fully automated systems for businesses in industries like Real Estate, Home Services, and others. What I learned is that there's massive demand — people in these industries are genuinely ready to adopt smart systems that save them time and make them more money. The market is there.\n\nI know the tech stack inside and out. I know the marketing. I know the operations. What I'm missing is a partner — someone who brings complementary skills (sales, growth, ops, marketing, or even more technical muscle) and wants to build something real together.\n\nA few things worth noting: this isn't a \"we need $100K to get started\" kind of venture. Everything runs remotely, and the overhead is essentially a handful of software subscriptions. The barrier to entry is low — the execution is what matters.\n\nIf you're entrepreneurial, hungry, and interested in the AI/automation space, I'd love to chat.

What matters more is execution, timing, and distribution.\n\nPersonally, I’d validate an idea in a few practical steps:\n\nFirst, I check if the problem is painful enough. Are people actively trying to solve it already? Are they spending money, time, or using workarounds? If yes, that’s a strong signal.\n\nSecond, I talk to potential users before building anything. Not asking “would you use this?” but understanding how they currently handle the problem and what frustrates them.\n\nThird, I try to test demand cheaply. A landing page, a waitlist, a small prototype, even manual service delivery. If nobody signs up or cares, that’s data.\n\nRegarding competition, I actually see it as validation. If others are building in the space, it means demand exists. The real question becomes: can you differentiate on speed, niche, positioning, or user experience?\n\nIn early stages, I don’t try to prove the idea is perfect. I try to disprove it fast. If it survives real conversations and small tests, then it’s worth committing time to.\n\nCurious how others approach this too.",

My validation approach is almost stupidly simple and I wasted months before I figured it out. Talk to people who you think have the problem. Not a survey, not a landing page with an email capture, an actual conversation where you mostly shut up. Let them describe what their day looks like. If they start getting specific about the pain then you're onto something real. The thing that tripped me up early was treating \"cool idea\" feedback as validation. It's really not, People are polite, well British people are haha. The signal is when someone describes your product back to you without knowing it exists. That happened to us and I still almost didn't act on it because I assumed someone else had already built it.",

Execution is everything, but validation is the only thing that saves you from wasting six months on a product nobody wants.\n\nIf you're moving from a raw concept to a real project, here is the framework to use right now:\n\n1. The \"Hair-on-Fire\" Test (Problem Validation)\n\nStop asking friends, \"Is this a good idea?\" They’ll lie to be nice. Instead, ask potential users: \"How are you solving this right now?\"\n\nThe Rule: If they aren't already spending money or hacking together a messy manual solution to fix the problem, the pain isn't deep enough.\n\nThe Goal: Find the \"hair-on-fire\" problem, not a \"nice-to-have\" vitamin.\n\n2. The \"Feature vs. Platform\" Audit\n\nIf your startup can be replaced by a single OpenAI or Google update, you don't have a business—you have a plugin.\n\nBuild a Moat: Your value must come from proprietary data, deep workflow integration, or industry-specific compliance that big tech can’t easily replicate.\n\n3. The \"Fake Door\" Smoke Test\n\nDon’t write a single line of code until you’ve tested the market.\n\nThe Move: Build a high-fidelity landing page (use Framer/Webflow) and run $100 in targeted ads.\n\nThe Metric: If <10% of visitors hit the \"Join Waitlist\" or \"Pre-order\" button, pivot. You just saved yourself 6 months of wasted dev time.\n\nThe Competitive Intelligence Stack\n\n|Tool|Best For...|\n|:-|:-|\n|Crunchbase / PitchBook|Sniffing out VC-backed \"stealth\" startups.|\n|IdeaProof / ProductGapHunt|AI-powered gap analysis to find what competitors missed.|\n|Perplexity / Gemini|Deep-searching \"Companies doing \\[X\\] for \\[Y\\] niche.\"|\n\nThe Golden Rule for 2026: Execution > Ideas. Finding a competitor isn't a death sentence; it’s market validation. Don't be afraid of the competition; find the \"white space\" they are ignoring and out-execute them there.\n\n",
