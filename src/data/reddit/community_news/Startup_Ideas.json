As long as your sell is tailored towards the users and isn't pushy to the point that people get annoyed with you, there is a lot of opportunity. I've previously also used Reddit ads for my products (which allows you to target specific subs) and i've found this to be useful, though it depends on the product and the amount that you are charging for it eg If you are selling something for $10 the ads might cost more than the revenue.\n\nInstagram is great too and i've personally had loads of success in DMing specific people who my products might be relevent too. As an example my main project is manufacturing wooden jigsaw puzzles. I have my own commercial range, but started manufacturing third party puzzles for small artists who wanted their artwork converting in to puzzle form. I built up a database of over 1000 artists and then dm'd them gradually asking if they'd be interested. As my targeting was very specific the process was amazing and even rejections were still complimentaty and not like bashing your head against a wall.\n\nWithout giving the game away what is your rough idea classification? service, product, website etc",

The reason for that is, at least in the US, personal training isn't quite so regulated as a profession. There's not an equivalent to the bar exam you'd have to pass to practice law, for example. So what makes a trainer \"legitimate?\" Having any certification? Having an accredited certification? A degree in sports science? And any trainer with years of experience would tell you that the certification you have has little bearing on how good of a coach you'll actually be.\n\nI want the platform to be as truthful as I can make it, and I haven't yet come up with a way, with the tech stack I have, that would actually verify \"legitimacy\" in a way that's meaningful to a user. I've seen some similar websites that have a \"verified\" or \"background checked\" badge on profiles, but with what I know about the training industry, those don't really mean much to me, and may just be paid features to stand out more. For now, I just have trainers enter what certifications they have during onboarding.\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to approach that, feel free to DM me! I'm building this solo, so it's nice to have a fresh set of yes on it.",

      "text": "Hey founders 👋\n\nI’m looking to sponsor / invest (call it what you like) in an MVP-ready product that’s stuck in the 0→1 phase.\n\nI know how hard it is to get momentum early on — building, validating, shipping, and then hitting a wall due to lack of cash or support. I want to help founders with good ideas get unstuck and moving forward.\n\nTo be upfront:  \n💰 The amount is **USD $3,000**.  \nI know it’s not a lot — and if that feels too small for you, totally okay. This post is specifically for founders who could genuinely use a small boost to get things going (cover infra, polish MVP, launch, test, etc.).\n\nI’m not just looking to provide money — I’m also happy to contribute ideas, feedback, and support where relevant.\n\n# What I’m looking for\n\n* MVP already built (or very close)\n* Clear problem being solved\n* Thoughtful founder(s)\n* Any industry is fine\n\n# How to pitch me (keep it simple)\n\nPlease reply or DM with:\n\n1. **Your name**\n2. **Country**\n3. **What your product does (MVP link if available)**\n4. **The problem you’re trying to solve**\n5. **What you’d use the $3,000 for**\n\nI’ll review all submissions and select one project that resonates with me to sponsor/invest in.\n\nHopefully this small step can turn into something great 🚀\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you’re building.",

It wasn’t about scaling at all. It was about clearing one specific blocker so momentum could restart—hosting, some design polish, or just buying time to talk to users without stressing over every expense.\n\nThe early mistake I made was assuming bigger checks were the answer. They weren’t. What actually mattered was clarity: knowing exactly what the next 30–60 days were supposed to prove. Without that, even $3k can disappear quietly.\n\nOne thing I’d encourage founders replying to you to do—mostly for their own sake—is to be very concrete about the decision this money unlocks. Not “we’ll launch faster,” but “by X date, we’ll know whether this is worth continuing.”\n\nAlso, respect for being upfront about the amount. That alone filters for people who are actually at the right stage.\n\nOut of curiosity—when you’ve seen early projects stall, is it usually a lack of capital, or a lack of focus on what to test next?",

      "text": "The new indie hacker playbook:\n\n\n\n* Open source the sexy experiments,\n* Monetize the boring problems,\n* Free builds credibility,\n* Paid solves real pain,\n\n\n\nMost people do it backwards.\n\n\n\nHad a startup idea and needed to validate if people actually cared about the problem I was solving.\n\n\n\nMost advice says run paid ads to test demand but I didn't want to spend money validating something that might not work.\n\n\n\nThe approach I took was building organic distribution before building the full product. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and the proposed solution.\n\n\n\nAdded an email signup for early access. Then focused on getting organic traffic to see if anyone would actually sign up.\n\n\n\nStarted with SEO foundation because paid social traffic disappears the moment you stop spending.\n\n\n\nNeeded a channel that would compound over time instead of requiring constant cash.\n\n\n\nUsed [directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the landing page to 200+ startup and product directories so the domain would have some authority.\n\n\n\nWeek one and two looked like nothing was happening. A few directory listings went live but no traffic. This is the scary part of organic validation because you're not getting the immediate feedback that paid ads provide.\n\n\n\nWeek three is when Search Console started showing the domain getting crawled more frequently. Published 3 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content, just helpful posts about the problem space.\n\n\n\nWeek four through eight the traffic started building. Domain authority went from zero to 18. Started ranking for longtail keywords around the problem I was solving. Traffic hit 500 organic visitors and I had 40 email signups from people who found the landing page through search.\n\n\n\nThe validation part worked better than expected. These 40 people didn't stumble onto the page through an ad, they actively searched for solutions to this problem. That's way stronger signal than paid traffic where people click out of curiosity but don't actually care.\n\n\n\nHad conversations with 15 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried. All of this validation happened without spending anything on ads.\n\n\n\nThe startup idea lesson: organic distribution takes longer to build but gives you better validation data. People finding you through search have real intent. They're actively looking for solutions right now, not just casually browsing their feed.\n\n\n\nIf you're validating a startup idea and have more time than money, build organic channels first. It's slower but the signal quality is higher and the distribution keeps working even when you're not actively promoting.\n\n\n\nSmall advice, from founder to founder -\n\n\n\nStop chasing AI trends.\n\n\n\nBuild for problems that existed before AI:\n\n\n\n* people want to look good,\n* people want to make money,\n* people want to be productive,\n* people want to remember things,\n* people want to eat better,\n* people want better relationships,\n\n\n\nAI is just the tool.\n\n\n\nThe problem is timeless.\n\n\n\nNobody pays for \"AI features\"\n\n\n\nThey pay to fix their actual life.\n\n\n\nPick a real problem.\n\n\n\nAdd AI to solve it faster.",

I am currently building a few small but very different projects, mostly as experiments around expression, focus, and simplicity.\n\nThe main one is [prakakura](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prakakura.twa)\nIt is an anonymous canvas where people can leave short messages or longer journal entries. The idea is to create a quiet space for expression without likes, comments, or public validation. Recently I have been experimenting with retention by adding private “resonances,” which are short messages readers can send to journal writers that only the writer can see. No ads, no feeds, just expression and subtle human connection.\n\nThe second project is [dhuwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhuwa.twa)\nDhuwa is a mindful smoking reduction app, focused more on awareness than pressure to quit instantly.\n\nThe third project is https://onemovepuzzle.com.\nThis is a small logic puzzle game built around a single move mechanic. It is more playful than the other two and was built as an experiment in focus and constraint. One problem, one move, no distractions.\n\nNone of these are polished startups. They are all evolving through daily iterations and real user behavior. I am especially interested in how people interact with products that are emotional, quiet, or intentionally minimal.\n\nIf you are building something similar or have thoughts on retention without ads or social mechanics, I would love to hear your perspective.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Some send me weekly PayPal invoices, some bill through Upwork. \n\nI've looked at more than a dozen tools to bring them together, and tested some like HubStaff and Time Doctor but they all focus on a different set of problems.\n\nMy goal is simple and unified automatic time tracking with payments. Contractor hits \"play\" on a desktop application and it starts recording time. They hit pause when they are done. At the end of the week, it automatically sends them money from my credit card.\n\nI don't want to approve time sheets or anything. Hubstaff/TimeDoctor are mainly for that, time tracking and approvals. My contractors have been working for me for years, I dont need to approve anything. I don't micromanage unless there's issues and there's never issues.\n\nUpwork offers this, but it's not their core product and it charges me 5% and my contractors 10%.\n\nRun the math on $8k a month and it's like $400 for me, but more importantly $800 for my contractors, so I pay them an extra $1200 per month just to compensate for fees. HubStaff fees are like $12 a seat, so I'm kind of interested in a solution that is in between. Any dollar under $1200 is a dollar saved and worth switching.\n\nUpwork is primarily for finding talent. I actually already have the talent. So I end up bringing my own contractors there and paying the high fees, as if they found them for me. \n\nI don't want two tools to track and pay. I don't want to lift a finger. That's the benefit of Upwork. I set it up and it's done, I never have to do anything and I can focus on real work.\n\nThrowing this out there for anyone looking for a startup idea. ",

For those who don't know what clipping is, it's when you turn interesting moments from live streams into reels, TikTok's and shorts.\n\nIf you go on Twitch or Kick, you can save videos from popular streamers.\n\nMy basic setup:\n\n1. Create one themed account across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram (don’t niche-hop, make separate accounts for different niches).\n2. Grab videos from popular streamers on Kick relevant to your niche.\n3. Drop the video link into [Quso](https://quso.ai?via=7xdq2x) - it auto-generates 10+ short clips and even predicts which one has the best viral potential.\n4. Use [Repurpose](https://repurpose.io?fpr=578363) to post a few clips per day across all platforms.\n5. Repost the best performing clips on Facebook + relevant subreddits for extra reach.\n\nOnce a clip crosses ~1M views, the payouts from YouTube + TikTok can be surprisingly solid. Last month this setup brought in just under $3k. It's scalable too because as you see results you can start making more accounts in different niches to post more clips.\n\nIf you get big enough you might start getting sponsorship offers on some accounts. I've had a few from gambling websites where they just wanted me to watermark the posts with their website. They normally pay on a month to month basis, I didn't include that revenue in the $2970 though.\n\nNot saying it’s guaranteed, but it’s way easier than people make it out to be.",

It seems like the platforms themselves are just tools, the real challenge is figuring out who you can actually rely on.\n\nWebsites like [Made-in-China.com](http://Made-in-China.com)  list thousands of suppliers across industries, but the experiences people have vary widely. Some businesses try small trial orders, some work with agents, and others take a more hands on approach to verify suppliers. It’s interesting to see how strategies differ depending on the type of business and products.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with international sourcing. \n\nWhat surprised you most? \n\nWhat would you do differently next time? \n\nHow do you decide if a supplier is actually trustworthy?\n\nSharing stories could help others understand what works and what doesn’t.",

We’ve built estimating software specifically for SME construction companies – focused on pricing jobs properly, protecting margins, and reducing the time builders spend stuck behind a laptop at night.\n\nThe product launched last year and is now doing \\~£2k MRR with paying users. It’s already becoming a core operational tool for many of them (not a “nice to have”), and the feedback has been strong. The fundamentals are solid, churn is low, and paid acquisition via Google and Meta is running consistently.\n\nThis year, the goal is to scale meaningfully – targeting £10k+ MRR – and I’m at the point where I don’t want to do that alone.\n\nI’m looking to speak with either:\n\n**1. A partner / collaborator**  \nSomeone entrepreneurial who wants to help grow a real, working product in a defined niche. This could be commercial, content-led, or strategic, depending on fit.\n\n**2. A content-first operator / creator**  \nIdeally someone comfortable being the *face and voice* of the product on social platforms (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.). The content itself is intentionally simple: short, practical videos talking to builders about pricing jobs, common estimating mistakes, margins, overheads, and running a more profitable construction business. No over-produced influencer stuff – just clarity, consistency, and credibility.\n\nI’ve spent years in marketing and know the construction industry extremely well, so you wouldn’t be guessing what to say or who you’re speaking to. I can provide structure, topics, direction, and support. There’s also scope to build tutorial and walkthrough content as the product continues to expand.\n\nThis is very much an open conversation at this stage – I’m interested in finding the *right working relationship*, not forcing a predefined role. Equity, commercial arrangements, or paid + upside models are all on the table depending on experience and involvement.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, feel free to reply or DM me. Happy to answer questions and share more detail about the product, traction, and roadmap.\n\nCheers.\n\n[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1qkq7cy)\n\n",

I realized early marketing pain is mostly about signal, not reach. I didn’t need more channels. I needed tighter feedback loops. Who’s reacting, why, and where they’re getting confused.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot (and definitely made myself) is trying to “build a marketing engine” before there’s a repeatable story. Without that, everything feels random and draining.\n\nOne small change that helped a lot: instead of asking “how do we get more eyeballs?”, I started asking “what question do people ask right before they decide this isn’t for them?” Fixing that did more for momentum than any campaign ever did.\n\nCurious if others here struggle more with distribution—or with knowing what to say once you actually have attention. \\~",

Not exaggerating when I say I've started and abandoned maybe 15 different projects. Some I spent months on. Most never got a single user outside of people I personally asked to try it.\n\nLast month I launched [this new app](https://join.meetaugust.ai/?c=ZtVvAK). Nothing fancy, just solving a small problem I personally had. Didn't tell anyone about it really. Put it out there and kind of forgot about it because I was busy with other stuff.\n\nOpened my analytics dashboard today for the first time in a week. There were bars on the chart. Small ones, but they were there. Like 5 - 6 people over the past few days who found my app somehow and actually completed the whole onboarding flow.\n\nI know this sounds stupid to get excited about. But if you've ever stared at a flat zero line for months, you know what this feels like. These aren't friends I begged. These aren't my mom testing it. These are strangers who found it on their own and decided it was worth their time.\n\n Is this what the beginning looks like?",

What surprised me is how often the “admin” stuff shows up before they even care about the product. I’ve had prospects ask things like “Do you have a US entity?”, “Can you send a W-9?”, “What’s your business address?”, or “Can we pay you like a normal vendor?”\n\nI’m not trying to play startup theater, but I also don’t want to lose good leads because I look “unofficial” on paper.\n\nFor people who’ve been here: did setting up a US LLC/address/banking early genuinely increase close rates, or did it just waste time you wish you’d spent on the product and distribution?",

          "text": "I’ve seen it go both ways, but the pattern is pretty consistent:\n\nIf you are selling to US companies that have any kind of AP or procurement process, a US setup often does increase close rates. Not because it “creates trust” in a fluffy way, but because it removes vendor onboarding friction: W-9 requests, ACH payments, “what’s your remit-to address,” and basic compliance checkboxes. When those questions come up before they care about the product, it usually means they are already imagining buying, and the admin is the blocker.\n\nOn the flip side, it is a distraction if you do it before you have a repeatable signal that it is needed. An LLC means ongoing chores: state fees, annual reports, bookkeeping, and if you are non-US owned you may have extra IRS filings even with no US tax due. That time tax is real.\n\nA practical rule: if you have 3 to 5 live deals that are stalled or slowed specifically due to “US vendor” requirements, set it up. If it is just one-off questions, keep selling and use stopgaps (invoice normally, use W-8BEN-E if you are foreign, offer card payments, etc.) until the friction becomes a theme.\n\nAffiliation note: I work with BusinessAnywhere, and this exact vendor-friction issue is one of the common reasons founders use a US entity + address + banking stack early.",
