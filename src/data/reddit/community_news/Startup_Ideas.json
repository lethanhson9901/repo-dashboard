Two of those are already automatable. The third is a coordination problem, not a talent problem.\n\n**Insight:** VCs have convinced LPs they're playing Moneyball. They're not. Most funds return within 1 standard deviation of the asset class. You're selling index exposure and calling it genius.\n\n**What we're building:**\n\n1. **Automated sourcing + screening.** Every fundable company, scored continuously, no warm intros required.\n2. **Actuarial underwriting models.** Pricing risk the way insurers do, not the way gamblers do.\n3. **LP-direct deployment.** Cut the GP. Keep the asset class.\n\n**Why now:**\n\n* Data on private companies is 10x richer than five years ago\n* LPs are fee-sensitive post-ZIRP\n* The \"access\" moat is collapsing. Everyone has deal flow now.\n* Nobody's said the quiet part loud yet\n\n**Business model:** We sell picks and shovels first (SaaS to existing funds), then go direct (LP-facing fund with 0.5-and-5 economics). Trojan horse.\n\n**Ask:** $5M seed to ship v1 and get three mid-tier VCs dependent on our infrastructure before they realize what we're building.\n\n**The question you should be asking yourself:** If 80% of your job can be systematized, and LPs figure that out, what's your plan?\n\n*We're not disrupting venture capital. We're just removing the costume.*\n\n*----------*\n\n*hahahahaha :) satire.*",

The unrealized income potential can still elevate the value regardless of when (or if ever) a future owner decides to transition the property to a business. \n\nEssentially we turn your regular home into a vacation rental business right before you sell, which elevates the value. Financial projections, legal, permits, marketing etc, all prepared for the next potential owner. The seller never actually operates the business but gets the benefit for its potential upon sale. Revenue model is based on traditional realtor commissions plus if the homes is run as a business we also profit from the likely annual management contract. Typical clients are selling $2-6M properties in wine country or along the Sonoma coast. \n\nI am a real estate agent and sales team leader in the Bay Area currently partnered with a luxury vacation property management firm that will be the first to offer this type of listing approach in Sonoma county.

Basically the goal is that I can send anything to it, connect my notetaking apps, or ChatGPT, and whenever I find something I wanna remember, I can send it to the agent, and it should break it down into micro learning, progressive quizzes, and apply spaced repetition to it. So then you can just practice for 5 minutes a day and it will help you remember the things you wanted to. The quizzes and reviews will get progressively harder or easier, more often or less often depending on performance. Good thing is there will be a free (add supported version) to use cuz u can integrate with ChatGPT, and paid version for more advanced features and models. Website in progress: [MemSurf](https://memsurf.com) we are going to be running a closed beta in the next two weeks, from an organic ware list that has 20 people just from 2-3 Reddit posts in total.",

Do you actually know what your money will be worth – or what you’ll be able to buy with it – in 40 years?\n\nNobody is crazy enough to build a platform that truly answers those questions. And for good reason: it’s huge and incredibly complex. But hey, I’m German. A few years ago, we even created a small national standard for financial consulting. Yeah – only a German would come up with a consulting standard. The development took years, and it’s insane. I’ve worked with it, and I loved it.\n\nThe big question is: people keep saying we have AI. But as a former financial consultant with a background in economics – and a developer since childhood – I can say it’s not possible to use AI for this. Not even close. That’s why I’m not planning to implement any AI features in the near future.\n\nCurrent status: I started developing the platform a few days ago after working on the concept for many months.There’s nothing special to show yet – I’m just collecting feedback, building a network and laying the groundwork.",

That small design choice breaks checkout. No saved passwords, no new tabs, and manual input everywhere. Most carts disappear here.\n\n**Solution**: Our SaaS redirects every visitor out of in-app browsers to their native browser, where customers get access to their saved info and new tabs to have an undisturbed shopping experience. And brands get to retarget their customers more precisely as cookies stay in normal browsers. \n\n**Current Stage:** Early-Revenue (We have paying customers), 500k+ redirects completed, $70k+ in assisted revenue to our customers",

Meme stocks are highly volatile and present excellent gambling opportunities. Moreover, platforms to copy congressional trades, 13F filings, and others fail to point the user in a proper direction. They present a bunch of data instead of just directing the user on what was bought on what price point.\n\nThe target customer is the average [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user, gamblers. He wants data on what tickers are memes to either gain or lose money gambling on them. As of now, he scours reddit, is late on a meme stock rise, and then buys in. The goal of seeking tendies is to connect these gamblers to the information they need to make faster decisions on what to gamble on. \n\nMy problem is the following: how exactly would meme label on a ticker drive user growth? Would this product only work in bull markets? How is different from services like seeking alpha? I want to connect [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) gamblers to the tickers they need to make massive bets, but I'm not sure how to do so. Websites that track the most discussed tickers on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) already exist, so I'm not sure how my product would be different.",

Apps helped with booking and pricing but didn’t fix the physical service. Vehicle condition, driver behavior, and reliability are still outside the platform’s control. This is an operational problem more than a technical one.\n\nThe insight is operational control before scale. Instead of aggregating thousands of autos, we run a small, branded fleet with clear standards clean vehicles, trained drivers, predictable routes, and fixed hubs.\n\nThis trades early scale for consistency, with the goal of proving unit economics first, then expanding selectively as Indian cities densify and rider expectations rise.\n\nIf it works, it becomes a standardized last-mile layer where reliability matters more than coverage.",

I would need more machinery and working cap for that but I do believe I can scale it to 100 cr in about 4 years if giving my all to it.\nPoint 2: Since my manufacturing,designing,printing etc is in house, we can also launch our own Athleisure Brand entering D2C model + offline stores in near future but that would require good amount of funds + A good team for performance marketing + Brand setup.\n\nSo if you think this profitable business aligns with you then please let me know if you can help us grow it.",

      "text": "Hey, just wanted to share some notes after spending the last year launching products from \"original\" ideas - and why I've since pivoting to cloning instead. I thought I could find things people hadn't thought of, gaps in the market, ideas that fell through the cracks, etc.\n\nThat all changed when I watched a Starter Story interview with a guy who literally just... clones apps. He has 3 apps/services doing $30k+ MRR. He finds something already making money, makes it 1% better/different, and ships.\n\nThat video broke my brain a little. So I started researching. What apps are actually cloneable? How are they successful? Could a solo dev actually build these?\n\n166 ideas saved to my database later, these are my takeaways.\n\n**1. B2B wins, but not for the reason you think.**\n\n63% of profitable small-medium SaaS apps I found are B2B.\n\nBut it's not because B2B is \"easier to sell.\" It's because businesses have budgets. They don't agonize over $100/month the way consumers do over $5/mo. It does take longer to sell B2B, but it is stickier and the rewards are larger.\n\nThe average MRR in my data is \\~$25k/month. That's $300k/year from one person selling to other businesses.\n\n**2. The $5k-$50k/month sweet spot is wide open.**\n\n64% of the ideas I researched live in this range.\n\nBig enough to replace a salary, but small enough that nobody well-funded is coming after you. This is where small, bootstrapped teams/founders win.\n\n**3. Validated demand beats originality.**\n\nEvery idea in my database has verified MRR. Not \"I think this could work\" - actual proof that people already pay for this. This is a major point - knowing demand already exists is HUGE.\n\nStop trying to invent something new and find something that works and make it better for a specific audience.\n\n**4. You're more capable than you think.**\n\n92% of the apps I researched are solo-buildable. Not \"theoretically possible with 80-hour weeks\", but actually built and run by one person.\n\nI once heard someone say \"VC money is like rocket fuel. It's great if you're trying to launch into space, but it doesn't help if you're just trying to drive a car.\"\n\nMost of these apps are cars. Simple. Profitable. Built by normal developers solving boring problems.\n\n**5. Most of these can ship in a month.**\n\n44% of the ideas in my data are buildable in 4 weeks or less. 69% in 5 weeks or less.\n\nYou're not building Salesforce. You're building a focused tool that does one thing well.\n\n**6. People quit too early. People quit too late.**\n\nThe line between them is unfortunately thin.\n\nI have an app that helps students find off-campus housing. Started slow. Really slow. For a while I wondered if I should kill it. But the costs were low so I let it live. Today it outranks Zillow on Google for certain searches and I can sell to landlords for summer renters - something I never planned for.\n\nThe difference between \"quit\" and \"keep going\" was slight traction. Not massive traction. Just enough signal that people actually wanted it.\n\n**7. The boring ideas win.**\n\nEveryone's chasing AI. Meanwhile, my data shows there are many products quietly making money like:\n\n* SMS forwarding tools\n* Local file converters\n* AirPods finders\n* Calorie trackers\n* Supplement tracking apps\n* Alcohol consumption trackers\n\n\\---\n\nHope you enjoyed and happy cloning!",

      "text": "Most founders think scaling to $20k MRR requires a massive team and 12 months of coding. \n\nIt doesn't. \n\nIn 2026, the \"magic formula\" is 200 customers paying $100/month, and the fastest way to get there is by using AI Agents to replace manual growth and validation.\n\nI’ve scaled to $500k ARR before, and I’m doing it again right now. \n\nHere is exactly how you can use AI to skip the grunt work and hit $20k MRR FAST with surgical precision.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n# Lesson 1 : Don't Build Ghosts\n\nThe biggest mistake you can make is building a SaaS nobody wants.\n\nAI allows you to pivot before you waste a single cent on development. \n\nInstead of getting stuck on an initial idea, like an AI note-taker that people like but won't pay for, you can use AI to analyze competitor pain points across Reddit and LinkedIn.\n\nBy using AI to scan the market, you can pinpoint exactly where the real money is, such as high-intent lead generation. \n\nIf you can't get a \"yes\" from a prospect during a 15-minute demo, your AI agents shouldn't even be hunting in that niche.\n\n# Lesson 2 :Target High Intent Leads\n\nIf you want to be a SaaS founder winning in 2026, you need to stop doing cold outreach; it’s a 1% response rate game.\n\nYou should be using intent signals instead. \n\nYou deploy AI agents to monitor your competitors 24/7 so that when a lead comments \"Interested\" on a competitor’s post or starts a new role at a target company, your AI flags them immediately.\n\nYou aren't cold calling; you're joining a conversation they already started. \n\nThis is how you jump your response rates from 2% to 40%.\n\n# Lesson 3 :Scale Human Connections\n\nIf you want to stay lean as a solo founder, you have to realize that managing 500 conversations is impossible, but robotic AI kills deals.\n\nYou use LLMs to research the lead’s profile first to identify their specific challenges. \n\nYour sequence is simple: a 23-word opening question about their biggest struggle, followed by a personalized Loom video once they reply.\n\nBy letting AI handle the research and drafting while you maintain the strategy, you stay human at scale. \n\nThis is how you book 20 meetings and close your first 10 paying users in weeks.\n\n# Lesson 4 :Go Omnichannel \n\nTo hit $20k MRR, you must transform every network into a pillar of your growth machine. \n\nInstead of generic marketing, you need to orchestrate your channels to capture active attention and funnel it directly toward your trial.\n\nLinkedIn:  Stop manual prospecting. \n\nUse agents to scrape hot leads, specifically those engaging with competitors or industry-specific triggers. \n\nWhen you reach out, adopt a problem-first approach in their DMs. \n\nYour goal is not to pitch your product immediately, but to prove you understand their specific friction better than anyone else.\n\nReddit:  Post raw case studies and value-heavy stories. \n\nDo not just participate; dominate niches with data-backed narratives. \n\nThis ensures your insights are indexed by Google and LLMs like ChatGPT. When your target audience asks an AI for a solution in your category, your specific framework should be the one it recommends.\n\nCold Email: Scale your outreach by tracking intent signals. \n\nUse tools like Instantly to ramp up to 1,000 emails per day once your domains are fully warmed. \n\nBy targeting individuals who are already exhibiting signs of needing your solution, you transform cold outreach into a predictable, high-volume pipeline.\n\nYouTube:  Leverage YouTube for long-term dividends. \n\nFilm simple product walkthroughs that address specific user pain points. \n\nThese videos act as a 24/7 sales team, capturing long-tail search traffic and building the technical trust necessary to move a prospect from curiosity to a trial signup.\n\n# Lesson 5 : Try different pricing \n\nAI founders often overprice because the tech is powerful, or underprice because they're scared. I tried $499, but the churn was too high. \n\nI tried $297, but it required too many manual sales calls. \n\nThe AI SaaS sweet spot for us is $99/month with a 7-day trial. \n\nThis allows for a self-serve funnel where the AI does the prospecting, the landing page does the selling, and the MRR compounds on autopilot.\n\n# Your Next 48 Hours\n\nStop coding and create a simple landing page for one core feature. \n\nDeploy agents to find 300 leads interacting with your competitors right now. \n\nInitiate 50 curiosity-based DMs and install a chat bubble to handle support.\n\nThe technology is ready, you just need to stop doing manual work and start building the machine.\n\nIf you are a business owner ready to implement AI for high-intent lead generation and automated outreach, you need to set up your infrastructure at [gojiberry.ai](http://gojiberry.ai)\n\nInstead of manually chasing prospects, you can use the platform to identify high-intent signals and automate your acquisition machine.\n\nGood luck !  \n\nPierre-Eliott",

This would be similar to a massage parlor but instead of focusing on muscles, the entire point would be gentle touches and focus on relaxing you.  If you are following trends, ASMR is just about the hottest trend right now, and a large amount of people watch ASMR videos to help them sleep.  So starting up a business to bring this experience into a safe tactile in person environment would be an easy hit.  Most of the women that get facials, nails, or any sort of pampering really do it for the personal attention. The other half that don't participate in these services really don't need the service, but they would enjoy it if it was just pampering with no strings attached to any special other service.  Men are a pretty big segment that are underserved by facials, nails, and in person salon's that offer some form of human interaction.  The pretext is off-putting enough that few men will walk in the door, but if the service was just generic pampering with no gimmick or any other value proposition, other than just relaxation, you would unlock a huge segment of customers.   There are already a handful of these types of in person ASMR services popping up.  But I have a scalable business plan and a unique spin on this that would take it to a new level.  Anyway, there is public pitch.  DM for more details.",

      "text": "Had a startup idea and was ready to spend 3 months building an MVP. Everyone says build fast and iterate, so I was planning to code first and validate later. Decided to flip that approach. Validated demand through organic search before writing a single line of code. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and proposed solution. Added an email signup for early access waitlist.\n\nThe validation strategy was purely organic. No paid ads to test demand because ad traffic disappears the moment you stop spending. Needed to see if people were actually searching for solutions to this problem naturally. Started with SEO foundation to get the landing page discoverable. Used [this tool to submit to startup and product directories](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) so the domain would have enough authority for content to rank. This took about 90 minutes of setup.\n\nThen published 5 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content about my solution but helpful posts about the problem space and current alternatives people were using. Week one through three showed minimal traffic. Directory listings went live slowly and blog posts didn't rank yet. Had 8 email signups, all from people I'd directly messaged. No organic validation yet.\n\nWeek four through six is when organic validation started appearing. Domain authority hit 15 and two blog posts moved to page two. Traffic reached 180 visitors with 22 email signups from people who found the content through search. Week seven through ten brought clear validation signals. Traffic hit 450 visitors and 67 email signups from organic search. These people actively searched for solutions to the problem, found my content, and wanted early access.\n\nHad conversations with 20 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried and why those failed. All this validation happened before building anything. Now starting development with clear product direction validated by real search demand. Those 67 signups aren't just random interest, they're people who have the problem severe enough to search for solutions.\n\nThe startup idea lesson is that organic validation gives better signal quality than paid ads. People finding you through search have real intent and active problems. Ad traffic can be curiosity clicks from people who don't actually need your solution. If you're about to spend months building, validate demand through organic search first. The channel keeps working after validation too, unlike paid validation that stops when budget runs out.",

      "text": "Three of us started companies in January 2024. All technical founders, all had $15K saved, all building B2B SaaS tools. One year later one friend is at $24,000 MRR with 340 customers. Second friend shut down at $1,800 MRR after 11 months. I quit at $940 MRR after 9 months, went back to job. The difference wasn't talent, luck, or idea quality. It was strategy from day one. Friend who succeeded (let's call him Alex) started with distribution research. Spent first 3 weeks identifying where target customers gathered online, what keywords they searched, what problems they discussed repeatedly. Found 6 active communities and 25 searchable keywords. Validated he could reach 5,000+ potential customers organically before writing single line of code. Then built exactly what they needed.\n\nFriend who failed (call him Ben) and I both started with product. Spent 2-3 months building \"perfect MVP\" in isolation. Launched to communities we found after building. Hoped people would want what we made. Classic build-it-and-they-will-come trap. Ben had better product than Alex technically. Mine had more features. Neither mattered because we couldn't reach customers efficiently.\n\nAlex followed [framework from FounderToolkit database studying successful founders](http://foundertoolkit.org). Built minimal product in 4 weeks using no-code and boilerplates. Spent next 8 months purely on distribution. Posted in those 6 communities daily providing value. Submitted to 110+ directories. Ranked for target keywords within 7 weeks. First month brought 23 customers at $79/month. Month 12 hit 340 customers at $70 average.\n\nBen and I spent months adding features hoping they'd attract users. Tried paid ads we couldn't afford. Posted randomly hoping for traction. Burned through savings with no distribution system. Quit when money ran out and growth stayed flat. Hard lesson that product quality doesn't matter if nobody knows you exist.​\n\nThe brutal truth is most founders fail not because they built bad products but because they had no systematic way to reach customers. Distribution isn't something you figure out after building. It's the first thing you validate before building anything. Alex knew exactly how to reach 5,000 potential customers on day one. Ben and I hoped we'd figure it out later.​ Start with distribution access, then build products for audiences you can reach. Not the other way around.\n\nHow many founders here started with product instead of distribution strategy?",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months promoting my project on Reddit. Went viral, got removed by moderators, and everything in between.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n* **Launch posts (work)**: there are a ton of communities that let you showcase your product without getting banned, I made a list of subreddits with my target audience -> read the community guidelines on self-promotion -> checked if they have a dedicated flair or a designated day (usually on Saturday) -> shared my product. The first time it didn’t get any views/upvotes but I continued working on the copy until I found one that goes viral regularly. My best tips?\n   1. *Match the tone of the community*: this is what makes the difference between going viral and getting ignored (or banned).\n   2. *Subreddit size doesn’t matter that much*: people ignore smaller communities, but I had the same post go viral in a 95K subreddit and in a 9.5K one and got nearly the same visits to my project.\n   3. *Let Reddit help you*: if you’re struggling to find subreddits that match your product go to Reddit ads page -> setup your account -> click \"create campaign\" -> insert keywords related to your product and Reddit will auto suggest the most relevant subreddits.\n* **Shameless plugs (work, but probably I shouldn’t say it)**: general advice to write a comment to promote your product is something along the lines of *\"I had the same problem last year. Tried a bunch of solutions but found \\[tool\\] worked best for my use case. The key was \\[specific feature\\]. Went from \\[before state\\] to \\[after state\\] in about \\[timeframe\\]\"*. That’s a lot of work and not always needed. If your product is a direct answer to the question just share it, but make sure to disclose you’re the founder (proof: one of my shameless plugs got 25 upvotes and a couple hundred visitors to my project).\n* **“What are you building?” posts (don’t work)**: I’ve shared my project in a few “what are you building” posts. Results? Crickets. People are there to write comments, not to read the comments.\n* **Tracking conversations (works)**: I regularly track the visitors coming from reddit and their conversion rates. I don’t always have the time to leave a reply but just scrolling trought the comments helps me better understand users (I’ve already stolen a couple of ideas to improve my copy). If you have no idea about what to track, start with competitor mentions, keywords related to the problem/pain point you solve, or mentions of specific features.\n* **DMs (don’t scale)**: I’m not really a fan of DMs, Reddit is great at getting views and moving the conversation in 1vs1 won’t get you any. They only make sense when you fear your comment could be downvoted into oblivion.\n* **Content Strategy (not sure)**: I’ve shared me journey or growth experiments or just posts I thought would be interesting for my audience. (7 months of \"vibe coding\" a SaaS and here's what nobody tells you, You WILL Reach $10K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine),I studied 47 SaaS products that went from 0 to 10k MRR last year. Here's what they all did right),\n* for context my project is a [saas tool](https://brandled.app/) sometimes adding a link at the end or a softfer CTA inviting to check out my project. Some got a few thousand views, others were so bad that they didn’t even get AI-generated comments. However, none of them brought a significant spike in visitors (probably a skill issue on my side).\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 550k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips on marketing on Reddit.",

The exact same post can:\n\n* flop from a cold account\n* survive (or even stick) from someone who’s been commenting for weeks\n\nReddit rewards *continuity*, not just copy.\n\nAlso agree hard on smaller subreddits. They’re underrated because people chase upvotes instead of **qualified clicks**. A 10k sub where people actually read beats a 100k sub doomscrolling.\n\n550k impressions with this approach is no joke. The hard part now isn’t more tactics — it’s turning Reddit insight into better positioning off-platform.\n\nSolid breakdown.

I left due to issues with my co founder.\n\nI then moved to Berlin and worked as EIR in a food delivery company, where I opened a new business unit that after a few months was generating 65k per month. I closed deals with companies like WeWork, Zalando, TomTom and King.\n\nWorking for others is not my thing. Today was my last day, I quit.\n\nI’m currently building a ERP that will be ready for the market next week, with two customers ready to buy. Still, I’m looking for something bigger, to work on a real dream.\n\nIf you’re building something cool in SF, reach out. I’m non technical, looking for people around my age with real hunger who have already built things.\n\nContact me on LinkedIn Darijan Ducic. If I don’t reply, it means I’m not interested.",

I’m coachable, I execute, and I’m willing to pay for structured help or do a value trade (product strategy, execution support, technical AI knowledge, etc.).\n\nIf you read this far, just thank you for triying to help!",

You have spent seven years starting things and zero years finishing them because you are optimised for the excitement of a launch rather than the boredom of a scale. In product terms you have no product market fit with your own career because you keep pivoting before the data is in. Stop looking for a big idea and look for a big problem. A billion dollar company is just a small company that solved a critical problem and didn't stop. If you cannot build a five million dollar business you will never build a billion dollar one because you lack the discipline to handle the middle years of the journey. Pick the problem you are most willing to suffer for over the next decade and delete every other tab on your browser.",
