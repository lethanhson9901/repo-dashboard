      "text": "Here’s a simple and effective method to extract followers from any LinkedIn company page and turn them into leads\n\nI tested it yesterday and pulled over 75,000 profiles, results were solid.\n\nHere’s how it works :\n\nStep 1: Create a new LinkedIn account  \nStep 2: Start a free trial of Sales Navigator  \nStep 3: Add a job title on your profile like “Intern” at the company you want to target  \nStep 4: In Sales Navigator, use the filter “People following my company”, this becomes available since LinkedIn thinks you’re part of that company  \nStep 5: Export the list, enrich the data (email, role, etc), and use it in your outreach  \nStep 6: Remove the intern job, pick another company, repeat the process\n\nSuper useful to build targeted lists from pages that already gather your ideal audience\n\nCheers !\n\nBonus : Use [this free trial](https://gojiberry.ai) to get even more high intent leads :) ",

You drop in your content, and MarketMind gives you clear feedback on what’s working, what isn’t, and what to adjust. It also helps you plan ahead, stay consistent, and not feel like you’re always behind or guessing what to do next. It’s built for people who are just starting out or who can’t justify spending a lot on marketing, but still want real direction and insight. The goal is to make that kind of help affordable and practical for everyday business owners who don’t have the time to do all this themselves. It’s meant to feel less like a tool, and more like having someone in your corner who understands the process and keeps things organized.",

It’s a broken cycle.\n\n**The Solution:** I built a search engine that bypasses the middlemen. It scrapes **direct application links** from official company career pages.\n\n**Current Status:** This is an **early MVP**. I currently have **2,300+ active jobs** indexed. I am pushing updates daily to fix bugs, improve the UI, and optimize the scrapers, but I wanted to show the direction I'm taking.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* **No Third Parties:** Indexes *only* official company pages.\n* **Direct Access:** You search for a role, and we give you the direct link to the official portal (Workday, Taleo, etc.).\n\n**Link:** [https://luminajobs.vercel.app/](https://luminajobs.vercel.app/) (Feedback is very welcome!)",

First, communication: it keeps everyone aligned by turning messy project updates, risks, and blockers into clear, role-specific summaries so PMs and leaders don’t spend half their time chasing status. Second, data analytics: Mika looks at timelines, dependencies, velocity, and risk signals to flag issues early, before a project slips instead of after the fact. Third, process and compliance: it helps teams follow the right workflows, approvals, and audit trails without adding more overhead.\nWe’re not trying to replace PMs or build yet another task tracker. The idea is to offload the coordination, analysis, and process policing to AI so humans can focus on judgment, decisions, and actually leading teams.\n\nWe are still in the MVP stage. Looking for investors.  I can also send a pitch deck",

          "text": "Solo founder, bootstrapping a two-sided marketplace in recruiting.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nHiring takes forever. Global average time-to-hire is 44 days, 60+ for complex roles. Factor in notice periods and onboarding, you're looking at 6-12 months before a new hire creates real value. Unfilled roles cost up to 3x monthly salary per month in lost productivity.\n\nThe recruiting industry that's supposed to solve this is a mess. Top 10 agencies hold just 21% of global revenue. The rest is hundreds of thousands of small shops. Employers can't tell which ones are reliable, specialized, or compliant. Fees range 15-25% with no standardization. Many employers end up working with multiple agencies just to get enough candidate coverage, which multiplies the administrative burden.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller agencies and independent recruiters struggle to scale. They can't compete on tech, compliance infrastructure, or payment terms. They're stuck chasing individual client contracts.\n\n**My solution:**\n\nA marketplace connecting employers directly to pre-vetted recruiters and agencies competing on the same roles. Employers set success fees, post roles once, get access to a collective network of candidate sources. Recruiters get deal flow without needing to land clients individually, plus reliable payments and shared tooling.\n\nTaliro takes a cut of success fees. One platform for hiring, payments, compliance, collaboration.\n\n**The bet:**\n\nAggregating fragmented supply (recruiters) creates value for demand (employers) through reach and competition. Aggregating fragmented demand creates value for supply through predictable deal flow and reduced sales overhead.",

I’m currently building a Pokémon Red demo where an agent completes the game using my engine. Main goal is to be viral, but it also functions as a rigorous proving ground: real-time decision-making, limited resources, long-term planning, resync/recovery, and a fully auditable action surface.",

But with the amount of posts companies have been pumping out, this can take several days till it gets processed. We're changing that.\n\nMost automated compliance platforms completely neglect the huge marketing industry in the GCC. They also completely disregard SMEs and purely offer entreprise packages.\n\nWe're building the platform that tells you whether or not your post is compliant in seconds. It will highlight offending elements, and suggested replacements that stay true to your ad's message. And while everyone's focused on huge marketing agencies and firms, we want to give the small guys the peace of mind when they post their next Black Friday special.\n\nI'm a Technical Product Manager at a recently funded Series A Startup in the middle east that's making accounting and tax compliance easy for SMEs.

          "text": "Hi, founder here. I’m building at the intersection of behavior, expression, and play. Sharing three early stage products I’m actively working on.\n\nDhuwa.com\nDhuwa is a mindful quitting platform for smoking and other impulsive habits. It focuses on awareness and understanding triggers rather than streak pressure, fear, or guilt.\nThis idea comes directly from my own struggle with impulsive behaviors. Most habit apps felt mechanical and shame driven.\n\nDhuwa is designed to help people slow down, observe urges, and build self trust instead of fighting themselves.\n\nStatus: early prototype and concept validation. Clear path toward subscriptions, wellness partnerships, and behavior change programs.\n\nOneMovePuzzle.com\nOne Move Puzzle is a minimal logic game where each level has a single perfect solution. It is simple to understand, deeply satisfying to solve, and designed for high replayability.\nI built it as a response to attention draining games. This format works extremely well for short form content, daily challenges, and viral distribution, with monetization through ads, premium levels, and sponsorships.\n\nStatus: playable MVP is live with strong early engagement from testers.\n\nPrakakura.com\nPrakakura is an anonymous public canvas where people can leave messages that live permanently on a shared digital space. Think of it as digital graffiti for thoughts, gratitude, grief, and human presence.\n\nThis project is deeply personal. It came from periods of loss, failure, and instability where expression mattered more than visibility or likes. The platform is live, has real users, and an Android app is already published. Payments are not enabled yet, but the engagement and emotional resonance are strong.\n\nFounder background\nI come from a growth and paid advertising background and have worked on multiple products across marketing and tech. I left my job to build independently, tried a physical business that failed, went through financial pressure, and kept building anyway. I’m technical, product focused, and very distribution aware.\n\nI’m not testing ideas for fun. I’m committed to building long term and would love to explore alignment if Forum supports founders with strong narratives, execution bias, and unconventional products.\n\nHappy to share metrics or continue the conversation over DM.\nPrabin",

It’d be an app where users can meet at Costco and split items down. A buddy of mine does this with a group of his disc golf group. They meet up at Costco or one of their houses after a Costco run and split the items they bought in bulk. I think a ton of millennials would want to split on bulk items.",

We ended up training a lightweight YOLO model using synthetic data, and its been running in production for a year with an error rate of just a few in a thousand. I realized that if we had a dedicated tool for this back then - the whole training set would have cost us about a few bucks and taken 15 minutes to generate.\n\nSo that is what we building now. We are currently in private beta, but the goal is to kill the \"book a demo\" requirement for good. We want this to be accessible to everyone, whether it's a tech-savvy farmer tracking crops or a mobile dev building an app to find dropped AirPods, not just enterprises with big budgets.",

      "text": "The new indie hacker playbook:\n\n\n\n* Open source the sexy experiments,\n* Monetize the boring problems,\n* Free builds credibility,\n* Paid solves real pain,\n\n\n\nMost people do it backwards.\n\n\n\nHad a startup idea and needed to validate if people actually cared about the problem I was solving.\n\n\n\nMost advice says run paid ads to test demand but I didn't want to spend money validating something that might not work.\n\n\n\nThe approach I took was building organic distribution before building the full product. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and the proposed solution.\n\n\n\nAdded an email signup for early access. Then focused on getting organic traffic to see if anyone would actually sign up.\n\n\n\nStarted with SEO foundation because paid social traffic disappears the moment you stop spending.\n\n\n\nNeeded a channel that would compound over time instead of requiring constant cash.\n\n\n\nUsed [directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the landing page to 200+ startup and product directories so the domain would have some authority.\n\n\n\nWeek one and two looked like nothing was happening. A few directory listings went live but no traffic. This is the scary part of organic validation because you're not getting the immediate feedback that paid ads provide.\n\n\n\nWeek three is when Search Console started showing the domain getting crawled more frequently. Published 3 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content, just helpful posts about the problem space.\n\n\n\nWeek four through eight the traffic started building. Domain authority went from zero to 18. Started ranking for longtail keywords around the problem I was solving. Traffic hit 500 organic visitors and I had 40 email signups from people who found the landing page through search.\n\n\n\nThe validation part worked better than expected. These 40 people didn't stumble onto the page through an ad, they actively searched for solutions to this problem. That's way stronger signal than paid traffic where people click out of curiosity but don't actually care.\n\n\n\nHad conversations with 15 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried. All of this validation happened without spending anything on ads.\n\n\n\nThe startup idea lesson: organic distribution takes longer to build but gives you better validation data. People finding you through search have real intent. They're actively looking for solutions right now, not just casually browsing their feed.\n\n\n\nIf you're validating a startup idea and have more time than money, build organic channels first. It's slower but the signal quality is higher and the distribution keeps working even when you're not actively promoting.\n\n\n\nSmall advice, from founder to founder -\n\n\n\nStop chasing AI trends.\n\n\n\nBuild for problems that existed before AI:\n\n\n\n* people want to look good,\n* people want to make money,\n* people want to be productive,\n* people want to remember things,\n* people want to eat better,\n* people want better relationships,\n\n\n\nAI is just the tool.\n\n\n\nThe problem is timeless.\n\n\n\nNobody pays for \"AI features\"\n\n\n\nThey pay to fix their actual life.\n\n\n\nPick a real problem.\n\n\n\nAdd AI to solve it faster.",

I am currently building a few small but very different projects, mostly as experiments around expression, focus, and simplicity.\n\nThe main one is [prakakura](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prakakura.twa)\nIt is an anonymous canvas where people can leave short messages or longer journal entries. The idea is to create a quiet space for expression without likes, comments, or public validation. Recently I have been experimenting with retention by adding private “resonances,” which are short messages readers can send to journal writers that only the writer can see. No ads, no feeds, just expression and subtle human connection.\n\nThe second project is [dhuwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhuwa.twa)\nDhuwa is a mindful smoking reduction app, focused more on awareness than pressure to quit instantly.\n\nThe third project is https://onemovepuzzle.com.\nThis is a small logic puzzle game built around a single move mechanic. It is more playful than the other two and was built as an experiment in focus and constraint. One problem, one move, no distractions.\n\nNone of these are polished startups. They are all evolving through daily iterations and real user behavior. I am especially interested in how people interact with products that are emotional, quiet, or intentionally minimal.\n\nIf you are building something similar or have thoughts on retention without ads or social mechanics, I would love to hear your perspective.\n\nThanks for reading.",

As long as your sell is tailored towards the users and isn't pushy to the point that people get annoyed with you, there is a lot of opportunity. I've previously also used Reddit ads for my products (which allows you to target specific subs) and i've found this to be useful, though it depends on the product and the amount that you are charging for it eg If you are selling something for $10 the ads might cost more than the revenue.\n\nInstagram is great too and i've personally had loads of success in DMing specific people who my products might be relevent too. As an example my main project is manufacturing wooden jigsaw puzzles. I have my own commercial range, but started manufacturing third party puzzles for small artists who wanted their artwork converting in to puzzle form. I built up a database of over 1000 artists and then dm'd them gradually asking if they'd be interested. As my targeting was very specific the process was amazing and even rejections were still complimentaty and not like bashing your head against a wall.\n\nWithout giving the game away what is your rough idea classification? service, product, website etc",

I almost cried lol.\n\nBackstory: I built this cause I was tired of buying productivity books and retaining nothing. Spent money on courses I never finished. My brain just cant handle long content anymore.\n\nSo I made a 2-min micro-learning app that teaches meta life skills. Communication, confidence, decision making, career growth - stuff you need everyday but nobody teaches.\n\nThe difference is it explains the psychology FIRST (why you procrastinate, why you avoid conflict) then gives you solutions. \n\nSo you actually understand whats happening instead of just following tips.\n\nLaunched last month. Got a few paid users. Now I need to know if this is actually valuable or if I just got lucky.\n\nBig ask: Would love if you guys could download it and leave honest App Store reviews. Need real feedback from people who aren't my friends lol.\n\nGood reviews, bad reviews, whatever - I just need data to know if I should keep building this or pivot.\n\nLink in comments.

On the technical side, outside of coding, you have testing (so that you can verify everything works, and the project is maintainable) and devops (deploying your code where people can use it). Coding your app is about 1/5th of the technical side. The technical side is half the game. That's why you have a CEO and a CTO. The other half is business. The business side includes validation and marketing.\n\nI just want to help you put it in perspective.\n\nMy playbook is to first validate the idea to some degree - do similar things exist and how much competition is there. If they exist, then you can research those companies and get an objective idea money and effort wise.\n\nIf you think there's a gap \\*and it's something you're interested in pursuing\\* (who's motivated to do something they aren't interested in?), then you build a website that is just a single page - it should describe your \"thing\" and what it does. It should have a \"register interest\" form which is a great proxy for whether or not there is interest. This should cost you about $10-20 at this point.\n\nThen, you find your community and you get involved - talk to people, see what they think, revisit your assumptions and refine your idea.\n\nThen once you have a solid idea of \\*what\\* to build, you setup your code environment with git, linting rules and a CI/CD pipeline. You write tests for what you thing should be doing, then you build that functionality and document it. Then you lint, then you add to git, and viola - it's online.",

Many validation reports return “people liked it” or “they’d maybe pay,” which sets you up for a build trap without fail.\n\nWhat I would do now as a default (and wish I would’ve done instead).\n\nI cannot escape a more strict validation loop. \n\n1. You should make users signup for a behavior not an opinion. For example, create an email signup with a promise, a pre-order, or a “join waitlist for $X”. Even a fake Stripe link tells you more than interviews.\n\n2. Use one channel for one person, not broadly find people. Choose a platform where they regularly express their complaints, such as Reddit, Slack groups, or niche Twitter.\n\n3. Say the price before the pitch. Anyone who stays engaged after that is signal.\n\n4. Cap the experiment. Seven to ten days, fixed effort. You cease if nothing moves.\n\nCan you outsource part of this?  Certainly! I take thorough notes when I recruit people. However, I would still allow you to frame, question and make decisions.\n\nIt hurts when your ads fail, but at least they gave you a clear answer. Validation is more affordable, but only when it is formulated to conduct a “yes or no” test rather than a vibe check.",

      "text": "I’ve spent a long time reading and observing startup discussions in Indian communities, and this post is not meant to discourage anyone. It’s simply an attempt to share patterns I’ve repeatedly seen, including mistakes I’ve personally made and learned from.\n\nMany startup ideas here are genuinely well intentioned, but they often come from a fixed-salary mindset rather than a business mindset. You can see this in how people approach risk, capital, and timelines. There is a strong desire to minimize uncertainty, start with almost no investment, and reach predictable income quickly. That’s understandable, especially given economic pressure, but it often clashes with how real businesses actually work.\n\nMost ideas are shaped by exposure rather than deep problem ownership. Engineers build tools similar to what they used at work. Professionals try to “simplify” platforms they interacted with. This isn’t wrong, but without strong domain depth or direct customer pain, these ideas struggle to move beyond prototypes.\n\nAnother common pattern is confusing online content consumption with market research. Reading Reddit posts, LinkedIn threads, or startup Twitter can be informative, but it doesn’t replace talking to customers, hearing objections, discussing pricing, or understanding buying behavior. Real research often feels uncomfortable and slow, which is why many people unconsciously avoid it.\n\nWhen ideas don’t work out, people often conclude that startups are not for everyone or that business is mostly luck. While those statements are partially true, they sometimes prevent deeper reflection on execution, sales effort, and cash flow planning.\n\nInterestingly, some of the most reliable businesses in India are not considered “startup ideas” at all. Sales operations, customer support services, call centers, compliance and back-office services continue to exist because they solve ongoing problems and generate consistent cash flow. They may not feel exciting, but they are grounded in demand.\n\nNone of this means app or SaaS ideas are bad. Many succeed. But they succeed when they are backed by patience, capital, sales capability, and willingness to adapt to reality rather than protect comfort.\n\nThis post isn’t about right or wrong choices. Employment is a valid path. Business is a different one. Confusion happens when we mix expectations from one world into the other.\n\nIf this helps even one person think more clearly before investing time or money, it has done its job.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a UK-based early-stage founder with a live SaaS product in the construction space. We’ve built estimating software specifically for SME construction companies – focused on pricing jobs properly, protecting margins, and reducing the time builders spend stuck behind a laptop at night.\n\nThe product launched last year and is now doing \\~£2k MRR with paying users. It’s already becoming a core operational tool for many of them (not a “nice to have”), and the feedback has been strong. The fundamentals are solid, churn is low, and paid acquisition via Google and Meta is running consistently.\n\nThis year, the goal is to scale meaningfully – targeting £10k+ MRR – and I’m at the point where I don’t want to do that alone.\n\nI’m looking to speak with either:\n\n**1. A partner / collaborator**  \nSomeone entrepreneurial who wants to help grow a real, working product in a defined niche. This could be commercial, content-led, or strategic, depending on fit.\n\n**2. A content-first operator / creator**  \nIdeally someone comfortable being the *face and voice* of the product on social platforms (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.). The content itself is intentionally simple: short, practical videos talking to builders about pricing jobs, common estimating mistakes, margins, overheads, and running a more profitable construction business. No over-produced influencer stuff – just clarity, consistency, and credibility.\n\nI’ve spent years in marketing and know the construction industry extremely well, so you wouldn’t be guessing what to say or who you’re speaking to. I can provide structure, topics, direction, and support. There’s also scope to build tutorial and walkthrough content as the product continues to expand.\n\nThis is very much an open conversation at this stage – I’m interested in finding the *right working relationship*, not forcing a predefined role. Equity, commercial arrangements, or paid + upside models are all on the table depending on experience and involvement.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, feel free to reply or DM me. Happy to answer questions and share more detail about the product, traction, and roadmap.\n\nCheers.\n\n[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1qkq7cy)\n\n",
