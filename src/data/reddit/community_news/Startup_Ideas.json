[ScreenSorts](https://screensorts.app/) hit 20 paying users in just 3 days... I know that might seem like a small number to some, but to me, it’s everything.\n\nThis started as just another \"is this even a good idea?\" post on this sub, and today it’s a real product that people are actually willing to pay for. You guys gave me the reality check I needed. You pushed me to double down on the macOS experience and keep everything local for privacy. Honestly, that’s the only reason this worked. And to my surprise, the app was ranked #12 on ProductHunt 😭\n\nFor anyone who missed the original thread, ScreenSorts uses local AI to turn your mac's screenshot graveyard into a searchable database. No cloud, no subscriptions, just fixing the mess.\n\nI just wanted to come back and say thank you 🥹 If I hadn’t posted here and listened to the \"tough love\" feedback, I’d still be staring at an empty VS Code window.\n\nIf you’re currently in the \"is this even a good idea?\" phase, please keep going. Listen to this community, take the critiques, and just build the thing.\n\nAMA if you want to know about the tech stack or how the launch went!",

Because you'd have to go code it yourself, build a team, and raise money. That's hard. So hard < 1% of people could do it with a 90% failure rate.\n\nNow AI is here. Now AI can build it for 1% of the money in 1% of the time. Your ideas you share publicly can get legitimate competition from legititimate people very easily -- including from VC's.\n\nAI\n\nI've said publicly on reddit that from my experience with Forum Ventures, I think they're a very shady organization, and now I'm proving it to you. But I dont think theres anything unorigal about what Im saying. This can go for many orgs and people.",

I'm now doing between 8 to 10 demos per day.   \n  \nMy goal is to get people to start a free trial.   \n  \nI only take calls with people who can spend a minimum of $500 with us.  \n  \nWe just hired a sales rep to help me out.  \n  \nc) More content  \n  \nMore LinkedIn posts, more posts on X, more blog articles, more Reddit posts.   \n  \nWe hired more influencers and bought more ad space in newsletters.  \n  \nThe more we post, the more money we make. So we scale.   \n  \nWe are also trying to work harder on the quality of the content we post.  \n  \n2) We got lucky  \n  \nSeveral events played in our favor:  \n  \na) RTs from Marc lou and Tibo on X (thanks guys!)   \n  \nb) A feature on Starter Story (+35k views)   \n  \nc) An article on IndieHackers's blog (thousands of views)   \n  \nd) A viral video that made us blow up on Twitter (830k+ views)   \n  \n  \n3) More customer support  \n  \nWe recruited an extra person for support.   \n  \nNow, every member (even on a free trial) can book a 15-minute call.   \n  \nIt’s time-consuming, but the customer feedback is excellent.  \n  \n4) Ads  \n  \nWe launched retargeting and we are about to launch cold ads.   \n  \nFacebook retargeting is already bringing in quite a few people.  \n  \nThere is no real magic, just a huge amount of work.   \nWe try to structure everything.  \n  \nFor those interested, I operate on a \"cooking recipe\" principle:  \n  \nDuring my day, I have to bake the most beautiful cake.   \n  \nEach ingredient is a task: post on LinkedIn, post on Twitter, etc.  \n  \nSo every day, I have my list of ingredients that I must work on as best as possible.  \n  \nThat's how, at the end of the day, I have a magnificent cake.  \n  \nGood luck everyone!  \n\n\nproof : [https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v](https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v)",

No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

      "text": "Everyone obsesses over finding the perfect SaaS idea. Spent 8 months rapidly testing concepts using frameworks from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) database tracking 1,000+ profitable founders. Tested 23 different ideas. 21 got zero traction. 2 now generate $14K monthly combined. The difference wasn't idea brilliance, it was applying Kunal Shah's Delta 4 framework before building anything.\n\nDelta 4 framework breaks down like this. Rate your current solution (Delta 1) versus your proposed solution (Delta 4) on efficiency from 1-10. If the difference is 4 or more, you've got something irreversible. People won't go back to the old way. Example - booking train tickets at station (Delta 1 = 2/10 efficiency) versus IRCTC online booking (Delta 4 = 8/10 efficiency). That's a 6-point gap. Irreversible behavior unlocked.\n\nMy 21 failed ideas weren't bad problems. They were Delta 2 improvements at best. Built a better project management tool (existing ones rated 6/10, mine was 7/10). Delta of 1. Nobody switched. Built an email scheduler with slightly nicer UI (existing rated 5/10, mine 6/10). Delta of 1. Crickets. I was solving problems people could tolerate, not problems burning them daily.\n\nThe 2 ideas that worked both had Delta 4+ gaps. First idea was content repurposing tool turning long-form into 10 formats instantly (old way was 3 hours manual work rated 2/10, new way was 5 minutes automated rated 8/10). Second was directory submission tracker automating 100+ submissions (old way was 8 hours manual rated 1/10, new way was 20 minutes automated rated 9/10). Both solved hair-on-fire problems with 6+ point efficiency jumps.\n\nBefore building anything now, I validate using this approach. Create landing page on ConvertKit describing the Delta 4 solution, run $50 in Google ads targeting the problem keywords, get 10-15 people on calls asking about their current pain (Delta 1) and if proposed solution (Delta 4) excites them. If I can't get 50+ interested emails in 5 days, I kill the idea. This [validation method from FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) saved me months building products nobody wants.\n\nThe controversial truth is most SaaS ideas fail because founders build Delta 1 to Delta 2 improvements. Incremental changes don't create irreversible behavior. You need 4+ point efficiency gaps. Rate your idea honestly. If it's not making someone's life dramatically better, it's not worth building.\n\nStop chasing \"good\" ideas. Start hunting for Delta 4+ efficiency gaps. Incremental improvements don't build businesses. Irreversible behavior changes do.\n\nWhat's your idea's Delta score? Be honest, is it really 4+ or are you lying to yourself?",

      "text": "I spend a lot of time around early rounds. Pre seed, seed, under $5M.  \nAnd the outreach founders use on Reddit, LinkedIn, X, email… it’s not just bad. It's horrendous.\n\nNot because investors are evil.  \nBut because investors actually have a standard that weeds out non-pros (imagine that).\n\nIt's so bad, I'm writing this post as a helpful rant. Cheers\n\nHere are the 3 biggest self-inflicted wounds I see. If this is you at all... pay attention\n\n**1. The public begging post**\n\nYou’ve all seen it. And it grinds on me every time\n\n“Hey everyone, building an AI platform for creators. Need $300k. DM if interested.”\n\nNo real investor touches that.  \nIt reads like someone trying to pay rent, not build a company.\n\nInvestors fund momentum, clarity, and control.  \nBegging posts signal the opposite.\n\nIf you’re going to post publicly, do this instead:\n\n* State the problem in a way that sounds lived, not researched\n* Show what you built that proves you’re serious\n* Give one traction signal, even if small\n* Ask a real question\n\nYou’re not asking for money.  \nYou’re creating gravity.\n\n**2. The comment section ambush**\n\nInvestor posts something thoughtful.  \nFounder replies: “We are doing this. Can you invest?”\n\nThat’s not outreach. That’s street panhandling.\n\nAs shocking as it is, try to actually provide useful info instead:\n\n* Add a sharp observation to the thread\n* Show you understand the space\n* Ask one intelligent question\n\nExample:\n\n“Are you seeing these as workflow wedges or data moat plays? Most teams I talk to confuse the two and waste a year.”\n\nNow you sound like an operator, not a lottery ticket hunter.\n\n**3. The catastrophic DM (by far the worst of all)**\n\nReal message I received:\n\n“Hi, I have a great idea. Can you invest $85,000?”\n\nThat’s not a pitch. That’s a red flag in sentence form.\n\nDMs are not for pitching.  \nDMs are for getting permission to pitch.\n\nHere’s the actual sequence I’ve seen work over and over for sub $5M rounds.\n\n**Step 1: Build a real target list**\n\nNot “early stage tech investors.”  \nThat’s how you waste three months.\n\nYou want investors who:\n\n* Write checks your size\n* Invest at your stage\n* Already backed companies in your space\n\nIf you can’t name three relevant portfolio companies, you’re guessing.\n\n**Step 2: Borrow credibility**\n\nIf you have no network, don’t start with investors.  \nStart with operators in their portfolio.\n\nDM founders they already backed.  \nAsk for one piece of advice.  \nHave a real conversation.\n\nWarmth travels through operators, not cold founders.\n\n**Step 3: Send a three-line opener**\n\nNo deck.  \nNo life story.  \nNo pitch.\n\nJust this structure:\n\nLine 1: Specific reference  \nLine 2: One sentence on what you built + one traction signal  \nLine 3: One question\n\nExample:\n\n“Saw your post on vertical AI. We built a dispatch tool for HVAC teams and our beta users are already routing jobs through it daily. Too early to be interesting for a seed check?”\n\nShort. Human. Non-desperate.\n\n**Step 4: One pager before the deck**\n\nDecks are for meetings.  \nOne pagers are for curiosity.\n\nYour one pager should cover:\n\n* Who the customer is\n* What hurts\n* What you built\n* Why you win\n* One traction signal\n* How much you’re raising and what it unlocks\n\nIf they want the deck, they’ll ask.\n\n**Step 5: Run a tight process**\n\nMost founders lose here.\n\nThey:\n\n* Talk to one investor at a time\n* Drag it out for months\n* Lose all momentum\n\nDo this instead:\n\n* 30 to 45 day fundraise window\n* Batch meetings into 2 weeks\n* Push everyone to the same timeline\n\nMomentum is not luck. It’s structure.\n\nI’m not saying this to be harsh.  \nBut a bad outreach pattern can kill a round before it even starts. And how to post on Reddit when raising capital is a whole other conversation.\n\nAnd honestly, I have literally thought about creating a course just for founders to learn etiquette for contacting investors successfully (instead of driving investors crazy with horrible outreach)  \n✌",

      "text": "The biggest startup myth is:  \n\n“Build it and they will come.”  \n\nThey won’t.\n\n[I’ve been documenting idea selection and validation frameworks on Toolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) while building my own projects, and I keep noticing the same mistake:  \n\nFounders validate the solution but fail to validate the problem.\n\nHere’s the framework I use before touching any code: 👇\n\n1️⃣ **Validate the Problem (Not Your Excitement)**\n\nBefore building anything, I check:  \n\n- Are people already paying for this?  \n\n- Are competitors charging real money?  \n\n- Are users actively complaining somewhere?\n\nIf competitors exist, that’s a good sign. New founders often think, “There’s too much competition.” Experienced founders think, “Good. There’s demand.”  \n\nNo competition usually means no money.\n\n2️⃣ **Look for These 5 Opportunity Signals**  \n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I look for:  \n\n- **UX Gaps**: Ugly or clunky tools in high-paying markets.  \n\n- **High Pricing**: If a tool charges $99/month, it indicates budget exists.  \n\n- **Missing Features**: Users often complain in reviews.  \n\n- **Over-Complexity**: Many tools try to do everything. There’s opportunity in doing one thing extremely well.  \n\n- **Market Frustration Intensity**: Is it a mild annoyance or “hair on fire” urgent?  \n\nIf the pain isn’t at least a 7/10, I move on.\n\n3️⃣ **Define WHO It’s For**  \n\nIf your answer is “everyone,” it’s already dead. Specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is better than broad appeal.\n\n**4️⃣ Check Paying Capacity**  \n\nWould this user realistically pay?  \n\nStudents complaining do not equal revenue. Agencies complaining signal potential revenue. There’s different market psychology at play.\n\n***5️⃣ Distribution Plan Before Product**\n\nIf you can’t answer, “How will I get my first 100 users?” don’t build yet.  \n\nA great product without a distribution plan is just a hobby.\n\n**How I Validate Before Building** \n\nHere’s my sequence:  \n\n- 5-10 user interviews (no Google Forms - real conversations)  \n\n- Create a landing page  \n\n- Small ad spend ($5-$20)  \n\n- Try to pre-sell  \n\n- THEN build the MVP  \n\nIf nobody pays before the MVP, that’s data. It’s cheaper to kill an idea early than to wait six months.\n\n**Hard Truth**  \n\nMost founders fall in love with building. Winning founders fall in love with reducing risk. Validation might not be glamorous, but it saves years.  \n\nIf you find this helpful, I’m happy to share the exact interview structure I use.",

Simple tool, solves a real problem and makes money from day one.\n\nAnd honestly, the more I build, the more I believe micro SaaS > venture-backed startups. I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

They pay anywhere from €150 to €500 just to post a single job ad on LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nMy thesis is that they are sitting on a goldmine they aren't using: their consultants' personal profiles.\n\nIf an agency has 10 recruiters, they likely have a combined network of 50k+ relevant candidates. Yet, they still pay for ads because coordinating 10 people to post the same job ad manually is a nightmare.\n\nSo I built a tool called **Copost** to solve exactly this \"distribution\" problem.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of buying a job slot, the agency writes the post once in my tool, and it pushes it to the personal profiles of the relevant recruiters.\n\nI added a specific feature to schedule the \"first comment\" automatically (so they can put the application link there without killing the reach in the main post). This way, not only do they save money on ads, but their recruiters actually build their personal brand and attract more candidates for the future.\n\nI managed to book 3 demos with actual recruitment firms for next week, so I feel like there is a real pain here regarding the cost of LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nDo you guys think this \"decentralized\" approach can actually replace paid job slots, or will companies always prefer the lazy option of paying LinkedIn?\n\nI’d love to know if this logic holds up.",

It seems more manufacturing-heavy compared to some other marketplaces, with a lot of listings focused on machinery, industrial equipment, construction materials, and OEM-type products rather than just consumer goods. That can be helpful depending on what you’re trying to source.\n\nI also noticed that many suppliers provide audit info, certifications, and factory details right on their profiles. While that doesn’t replace your own due diligence, it does make initial screening a bit easier.\n\nCurious how others approach this:\n\nDo you treat certain platforms differently than others when sourcing overseas?\n\nHave you had better luck finding factory-direct pricing on some versus others?\n\nAny red flags or tips to watch out for?\n\nJust trying to figure out which platforms are actually worth spending time on in 2026.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve decided to become a \"serial failer.\" My strategy is to launch \"Copycat\" startups in Italy, taking business models already validated abroad (or locally in different regions) and executing them fast.\n\nThe Experiment:\n\nI chose a mobile pet grooming service. There is already a successful startup in Italy doing this with a €1M ARR, but they haven't expanded to many mid-sized cities yet.\n\nThe Execution:\n\n• The MVP: I cloned their value proposition and website structure, using a Tally form to capture leads.\n\n• The Distribution: I posted in large \"dog lover\" Facebook groups. To keep it \"organic,\" I posted as a happy customer recommending the service.\n\n• The Result: The post went viral within the groups (approx. 10k views). People commented about their struggles with traditional groomers, but zero people filled out the form.\n\nMy Reflection:\n\nI’ve been re-reading Paul Graham’s “Do Things That Don’t Scale.” I suspect my funnel was too \"cold.\" Expecting someone to go from a Facebook comment to a lead form in seconds might be unrealistic for a service involving their pets.\n\nThe Question:\n\nFor those who have launched copycats: what is your go-to validation method? Was my \"fake customer\" angle the problem, or is the \"landing page + form\" approach dead for service-based startups?",

      "text": "Been working with early-stage founders on customer acquisition for a while now. Most of them are pre-product, pre-funding and honestly pre-everything.  \nThe question I hear again and again is: *“How do I get my first 10 customers without ads or an audience?”*\n\nMy answer is almost always the same.  \nOutbound.\n\nHere’s the exact framework I walk them through.\n\n**why outbound before you build**\n\nMost founders build first and try to sell later. That’s backwards.\n\nOutbound lets you validate whether people are actually struggling with the problem. It helps you understand what the market truly needs, not what you assume they need. It also gives you a chance to get paid before you build through simple pre-sales, and it teaches you the real words and language your customers use to describe their pain.\n\nI tell every founder one simple rule: have at least 20 real conversations before writing a single line of code. No shortcuts.\n\n**the 3 questions that validate any idea**\n\nWhen you reach out to potential customers, there are only three questions that really matter.\n\nFirst, ask them what they are currently doing to solve this problem.  \nIf the answer is “nothing”, the pain is probably not strong enough. If they mention competitors, it means demand already exists. If they describe a messy or hacky workaround, that is usually a very strong signal that they would pay for a better solution.\n\nSecond, ask them what the most annoying part of their current setup is.  \nThis tells you what features actually matter and what does not.\n\nThird, ask them what a perfect solution would look like for them.  \nLet them describe their ideal world in their own words. That description should guide what you build.\n\nThese three questions alone can save you months of building the wrong product.\n\n**the outreach framework**\n\nThe first step is to find people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nNot people who might face it someday. People who are actively struggling with it.\n\nThe easiest places to spot them are posts on Reddit asking for tools, complaints on Twitter, discussions inside communities and negative reviews of competitor products.\n\nThe second step is to reach out with curiosity, not with a pitch.\n\nReference their exact situation, show that you understand what they are dealing with, and make it clear that you are trying to learn, not sell.\n\nA simple message like this works very well:\n\n“I saw your post about struggling with X. I’ve been researching this problem and already spoke to around 15 people facing the same issue. I’d love to understand how you’re handling it today. No pitch. Just trying to learn before I build anything.”\n\nMessages like this regularly get very high reply rates, because people genuinely enjoy talking about their problems.\n\nThe third step is to listen. Not to sell.\n\nIn your first three or four conversations, your only job is to listen, take notes and understand their reality.\n\nAfter that, you can say something like:  \n“Based on what you shared, I’m thinking of building X. Would that actually help you?”\n\nIf they say yes, then ask one more direct question:  \n“Would you pay Y for this?”\n\nIf that answer is also yes, you can move to pre-selling and ask if you can build it with them as your first customer. That is real validation, not opinions.\n\n**the numbers**\n\nWhat I see very consistently is this.\n\nAfter about 20 conversations, founders start to clearly understand the problem.  \nAfter around 50 conversations, they usually know exactly what to build.  \nAfter roughly 100 conversations, many are able to get 5 to 10 pre-sales or early customers.\n\nMost founders do zero conversations.  \nIf you do just 20, you are already ahead of almost everyone.\n\n**what makes it work**\n\nThe first thing that really matters is specificity.  \nGeneric outreach gets ignored. Referencing their exact words, their exact post and their exact situation is what makes people respond.\n\nThe second is genuine curiosity.  \nPeople can easily tell when you are trying to learn versus when you are trying to push a product. Approach these conversations like a researcher, not like a salesperson.\n\nThe third is consistency.  \nIf you speak to five people a day for four weeks, that is already 100 conversations.\n\nThe fourth is speed.  \nReach out to people who posted within the last seven days. After that, the problem is no longer fresh in their mind.\n\n**the founders who win**\n\nEvery successful early-stage founder I’ve worked with shares one common trait.\n\nThey talked to more people than their competitors.\n\nNot because they were smarter.  \nNot because they were better coders.  \nNot because they had more funding.\n\nThey simply had more real conversations.\n\nOutbound is the fastest shortcut to those conversations.\n\n**tldr**\n\nHave at least 20 conversations before you build anything.  \nFind people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nAsk the three validation questions.  \nListen more than you talk.  \nPre-sell before you build.  \nFive conversations a day is enough to reach 100 in a month.\n\nIf you’re early-stage, start this week.  \nFive real conversations will teach you more than five weeks of building alone.\n\nWhat’s been your experience with outbound so far? I’m curious how others are doing this.",

I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. **Warm DMs:** Nope I didn't blasted thousands of cold dms and messages instead I engaged with my ICPs posts and content and then warm dm them asking them to try out my product and give me some feedback (this was the biggest growth lever)\n3. **Word of mouth:** I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. **SEO:** I went into SEO from day 1, not targeting broad keywords and instead focussed on Bottom of Funnel keywords (alternatives pages, reviews pages, comparision pages), it basically allows you to steal traffic from your competitors\n5. **Removing all formatting from my emails:** I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\n**What didn’t work:**\n\n**1. Building free tools:** The tools that received most traffic are usually pretty generic (posts downloader, video extractor etc.) so the audience is pretty cold and it's almost impossible to convert them\n\n**2. Affiliate system:** I’ve had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it’s extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n\n**3. Building features no one wants (obviously):** I’ve wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I’m not going to try any new marketing channels until I’m doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can’t stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won’t talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

      "text": "Im in my mid 20s (Male), recently graduated and hopping between jobs. Ive done various kind of jobs to know that working for someone is not where i find my peace.\n\n  \nSo, the idea of having a business someday has been with me for a year but recently bothering me every single breath i take. But I do not know how or where to start a business. I get few \"aha\" moments for business ideas but that's it. \n\nI am a first-generation university graduate and been doing good for what i was given but i dont know if its greed or my unsatiating hunger to do better for myself. I have been voraciously reading business books, listen podcasts and i love it. I like solving problems and understanding businesses and how they operate; it's fascinating.  \n\nI remember Rick Ruben who said in a podcast \" Until the time for the thing to exist hasnt come, it cannot exist\". For now, I am dwindling between three thoughts i.e. 1) I do not understand anything and should keep on searching answers and when i get the idea, i execute right away. 2) I get into a business even when i know its not perfect to understand business and learn. \n\nAnd the final dark thought \" Maybe I'm just an admirer of businesses and entrepreneurship and not meant to become one\" \n\nTherefore, I want to ask entrepreneur who started their first startup,\n\nAre these normal thoughts? I know I'm overthinking, but what do you think am I missing? How often do you get new ideas? How did you navigate your thoughts to just do it? ",
