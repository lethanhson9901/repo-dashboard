The reason for that is, at least in the US, personal training isn't quite so regulated as a profession. There's not an equivalent to the bar exam you'd have to pass to practice law, for example. So what makes a trainer \"legitimate?\" Having any certification? Having an accredited certification? A degree in sports science? And any trainer with years of experience would tell you that the certification you have has little bearing on how good of a coach you'll actually be.\n\nI want the platform to be as truthful as I can make it, and I haven't yet come up with a way, with the tech stack I have, that would actually verify \"legitimacy\" in a way that's meaningful to a user. I've seen some similar websites that have a \"verified\" or \"background checked\" badge on profiles, but with what I know about the training industry, those don't really mean much to me, and may just be paid features to stand out more. For now, I just have trainers enter what certifications they have during onboarding.\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to approach that, feel free to DM me! I'm building this solo, so it's nice to have a fresh set of yes on it.",

Winning variations get promoted to control and new challengers are automatically generated. If it detects winning concepts it leans into those while also leaving room for new exploration. Currently looking for feedback if you’re interested.",

I want to help founders with good ideas get unstuck and moving forward.\n\nTo be upfront:  \n💰 The amount is **USD $3,000**.  \nI know it’s not a lot — and if that feels too small for you, totally okay. This post is specifically for founders who could genuinely use a small boost to get things going (cover infra, polish MVP, launch, test, etc.).\n\nI’m not just looking to provide money — I’m also happy to contribute ideas, feedback, and support where relevant.\n\n# What I’m looking for\n\n* MVP already built (or very close)\n* Clear problem being solved\n* Thoughtful founder(s)\n* Any industry is fine\n\n# How to pitch me (keep it simple)\n\nPlease reply or DM with:\n\n1. **Your name**\n2. **Country**\n3. **What your product does (MVP link if available)**\n4. **The problem you’re trying to solve**\n5. **What you’d use the $3,000 for**\n\nI’ll review all submissions and select one project that resonates with me to sponsor/invest in.\n\nHopefully this small step can turn into something great 🚀\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you’re building.",

It wasn’t about scaling at all. It was about clearing one specific blocker so momentum could restart—hosting, some design polish, or just buying time to talk to users without stressing over every expense.\n\nThe early mistake I made was assuming bigger checks were the answer. They weren’t. What actually mattered was clarity: knowing exactly what the next 30–60 days were supposed to prove. Without that, even $3k can disappear quietly.\n\nOne thing I’d encourage founders replying to you to do—mostly for their own sake—is to be very concrete about the decision this money unlocks. Not “we’ll launch faster,” but “by X date, we’ll know whether this is worth continuing.”\n\nAlso, respect for being upfront about the amount. That alone filters for people who are actually at the right stage.\n\nOut of curiosity—when you’ve seen early projects stall, is it usually a lack of capital, or a lack of focus on what to test next?",

Some send me weekly PayPal invoices, some bill through Upwork. \n\nI've looked at more than a dozen tools to bring them together, and tested some like HubStaff and Time Doctor but they all focus on a different set of problems.\n\nMy goal is simple and unified automatic time tracking with payments. Contractor hits \"play\" on a desktop application and it starts recording time. They hit pause when they are done. At the end of the week, it automatically sends them money from my credit card.\n\nI don't want to approve time sheets or anything. Hubstaff/TimeDoctor are mainly for that, time tracking and approvals. My contractors have been working for me for years, I dont need to approve anything. I don't micromanage unless there's issues and there's never issues.\n\nUpwork offers this, but it's not their core product and it charges me 5% and my contractors 10%.\n\nRun the math on $8k a month and it's like $400 for me, but more importantly $800 for my contractors, so I pay them an extra $1200 per month just to compensate for fees. HubStaff fees are like $12 a seat, so I'm kind of interested in a solution that is in between. Any dollar under $1200 is a dollar saved and worth switching.\n\nUpwork is primarily for finding talent. I actually already have the talent. So I end up bringing my own contractors there and paying the high fees, as if they found them for me. \n\nI don't want two tools to track and pay. I don't want to lift a finger. That's the benefit of Upwork. I set it up and it's done, I never have to do anything and I can focus on real work.\n\nThrowing this out there for anyone looking for a startup idea. ",

      "text": "Had a startup idea and was ready to spend 3 months building an MVP. Everyone says build fast and iterate, so I was planning to code first and validate later. Decided to flip that approach. Validated demand through organic search before writing a single line of code. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and proposed solution. Added an email signup for early access waitlist.\n\nThe validation strategy was purely organic. No paid ads to test demand because ad traffic disappears the moment you stop spending. Needed to see if people were actually searching for solutions to this problem naturally. Started with SEO foundation to get the landing page discoverable. Used [this tool to submit to startup and product directories](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) so the domain would have enough authority for content to rank. This took about 90 minutes of setup.\n\nThen published 5 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content about my solution but helpful posts about the problem space and current alternatives people were using. Week one through three showed minimal traffic. Directory listings went live slowly and blog posts didn't rank yet. Had 8 email signups, all from people I'd directly messaged. No organic validation yet.\n\nWeek four through six is when organic validation started appearing. Domain authority hit 15 and two blog posts moved to page two. Traffic reached 180 visitors with 22 email signups from people who found the content through search. Week seven through ten brought clear validation signals. Traffic hit 450 visitors and 67 email signups from organic search. These people actively searched for solutions to the problem, found my content, and wanted early access.\n\nHad conversations with 20 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried and why those failed. All this validation happened before building anything. Now starting development with clear product direction validated by real search demand. Those 67 signups aren't just random interest, they're people who have the problem severe enough to search for solutions.\n\nThe startup idea lesson is that organic validation gives better signal quality than paid ads. People finding you through search have real intent and active problems. Ad traffic can be curiosity clicks from people who don't actually need your solution. If you're about to spend months building, validate demand through organic search first. The channel keeps working after validation too, unlike paid validation that stops when budget runs out.",

      "text": "I see people overcomplicating this, so I figured I’d share what actually worked for me. If you want a super easy side hustle then you should give clipping a try. For those who don't know what clipping is, it's when you turn interesting moments from live streams into reels, TikTok's and shorts.\n\nIf you go on Twitch or Kick, you can save videos from popular streamers.\n\nMy basic setup:\n\n1. Create one themed account across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram (don’t niche-hop, make separate accounts for different niches).\n2. Grab videos from popular streamers on Kick relevant to your niche.\n3. Drop the video link into [Quso](https://quso.ai?via=7xdq2x) - it auto-generates 10+ short clips and even predicts which one has the best viral potential.\n4. Use [Repurpose](https://repurpose.io?fpr=578363) to post a few clips per day across all platforms.\n5. Repost the best performing clips on Facebook + relevant subreddits for extra reach.\n\nOnce a clip crosses ~1M views, the payouts from YouTube + TikTok can be surprisingly solid. Last month this setup brought in just under $3k. It's scalable too because as you see results you can start making more accounts in different niches to post more clips.\n\nIf you get big enough you might start getting sponsorship offers on some accounts. I've had a few from gambling websites where they just wanted me to watermark the posts with their website. They normally pay on a month to month basis, I didn't include that revenue in the $2970 though.\n\nNot saying it’s guaranteed, but it’s way easier than people make it out to be.",

      "text": "Hey, just wanted to share some notes after spending the last year launching products from \"original\" ideas - and why I've since pivoting to cloning instead. I thought I could find things people hadn't thought of, gaps in the market, ideas that fell through the cracks, etc.\n\nThat all changed when I watched a Starter Story interview with a guy who literally just... clones apps. He has 3 apps/services doing $30k+ MRR. He finds something already making money, makes it 1% better/different, and ships.\n\nThat video broke my brain a little. So I started researching. What apps are actually cloneable? How are they successful? Could a solo dev actually build these?\n\n166 ideas saved to my database later, these are my takeaways.\n\n**1. B2B wins, but not for the reason you think.**\n\n63% of profitable small-medium SaaS apps I found are B2B.\n\nBut it's not because B2B is \"easier to sell.\" It's because businesses have budgets. They don't agonize over $100/month the way consumers do over $5/mo. It does take longer to sell B2B, but it is stickier and the rewards are larger.\n\nThe average MRR in my data is \\~$25k/month. That's $300k/year from one person selling to other businesses.\n\n**2. The $5k-$50k/month sweet spot is wide open.**\n\n64% of the ideas I researched live in this range.\n\nBig enough to replace a salary, but small enough that nobody well-funded is coming after you. This is where small, bootstrapped teams/founders win.\n\n**3. Validated demand beats originality.**\n\nEvery idea in my database has verified MRR. Not \"I think this could work\" - actual proof that people already pay for this. This is a major point - knowing demand already exists is HUGE.\n\nStop trying to invent something new and find something that works and make it better for a specific audience.\n\n**4. You're more capable than you think.**\n\n92% of the apps I researched are solo-buildable. Not \"theoretically possible with 80-hour weeks\", but actually built and run by one person.\n\nI once heard someone say \"VC money is like rocket fuel. It's great if you're trying to launch into space, but it doesn't help if you're just trying to drive a car.\"\n\nMost of these apps are cars. Simple. Profitable. Built by normal developers solving boring problems.\n\n**5. Most of these can ship in a month.**\n\n44% of the ideas in my data are buildable in 4 weeks or less. 69% in 5 weeks or less.\n\nYou're not building Salesforce. You're building a focused tool that does one thing well.\n\n**6. People quit too early. People quit too late.**\n\nThe line between them is unfortunately thin.\n\nI have an app that helps students find off-campus housing. Started slow. Really slow. For a while I wondered if I should kill it. But the costs were low so I let it live. Today it outranks Zillow on Google for certain searches and I can sell to landlords for summer renters - something I never planned for.\n\nThe difference between \"quit\" and \"keep going\" was slight traction. Not massive traction. Just enough signal that people actually wanted it.\n\n**7. The boring ideas win.**\n\nEveryone's chasing AI. Meanwhile, my data shows there are many products quietly making money like:\n\n* SMS forwarding tools\n* Local file converters\n* AirPods finders\n* Calorie trackers\n* Supplement tracking apps\n* Alcohol consumption trackers\n\n\\---\n\nHope you enjoyed and happy cloning!",

Some businesses manage to find steady, trustworthy suppliers, while others run into delays, inconsistent quality, or confusing communication. It seems like the platforms themselves are just tools, the real challenge is figuring out who you can actually rely on.\n\nWebsites like [Made-in-China.com](http://Made-in-China.com)  list thousands of suppliers across industries, but the experiences people have vary widely. Some businesses try small trial orders, some work with agents, and others take a more hands on approach to verify suppliers. It’s interesting to see how strategies differ depending on the type of business and products.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with international sourcing. \n\nWhat surprised you most? \n\nWhat would you do differently next time? \n\nHow do you decide if a supplier is actually trustworthy?\n\nSharing stories could help others understand what works and what doesn’t.",

I know I'm good at sales cuz i made a shit load of money from commissions which I paid off my student loans with.

There are tons and tons of digital nomads like yourself running agencies out of asia.  \n\nYou can either start your own or join one doing sales if you are good. There are very few agencies that will say no to someone who can PROVE that they can do sales (especially if you are just on commission).\n\nThe issue with Agencies is they tend to struggle without connections. Most agencies I know that were successful were started by people with deep industry connections and these connections gave them the \"in\" necessary to do sales.  Initial sales for an agency are one of the hardest parts - you have no rep.\n\nThe other way in, which I used for my agency, was to jump on the latest wave and offer services.  But this was easier for me because I\"m very technical. However, you can find a co-founder to handle the tech while you handle sales.\n\nSo you have two tasks:  \n1. Find the market that you can address  \n2. Possibly, find a co-founder who has the skills to address it while you do the sales.",

Not exaggerating when I say I've started and abandoned maybe 15 different projects. Some I spent months on. Most never got a single user outside of people I personally asked to try it.\n\nLast month I launched [this new app](https://join.meetaugust.ai/?c=ZtVvAK). Nothing fancy, just solving a small problem I personally had. Didn't tell anyone about it really. Put it out there and kind of forgot about it because I was busy with other stuff.\n\nOpened my analytics dashboard today for the first time in a week. There were bars on the chart. Small ones, but they were there. Like 5 - 6 people over the past few days who found my app somehow and actually completed the whole onboarding flow.\n\nI know this sounds stupid to get excited about. But if you've ever stared at a flat zero line for months, you know what this feels like. These aren't friends I begged. These aren't my mom testing it. These are strangers who found it on their own and decided it was worth their time.\n\n Is this what the beginning looks like?",

I realized early marketing pain is mostly about signal, not reach. I didn’t need more channels. I needed tighter feedback loops. Who’s reacting, why, and where they’re getting confused.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot (and definitely made myself) is trying to “build a marketing engine” before there’s a repeatable story. Without that, everything feels random and draining.\n\nOne small change that helped a lot: instead of asking “how do we get more eyeballs?”, I started asking “what question do people ask right before they decide this isn’t for them?” Fixing that did more for momentum than any campaign ever did.\n\nCurious if others here struggle more with distribution—or with knowing what to say once you actually have attention. \\~",

I left due to issues with my co founder.\n\nI then moved to Berlin and worked as EIR in a food delivery company, where I opened a new business unit that after a few months was generating 65k per month. I closed deals with companies like WeWork, Zalando, TomTom and King.\n\nWorking for others is not my thing. Today was my last day, I quit.\n\nI’m currently building a ERP that will be ready for the market next week, with two customers ready to buy. Still, I’m looking for something bigger, to work on a real dream.\n\nIf you’re building something cool in SF, reach out.

I have 8 years of marketing experience specializing in CRO and ads, I have worked with multiple startups, have made multiple landing pages, so all that experience and frameworks have been put into my prompts. But also, there is a chain of LLMs, certain parts are taken care by OpenAI, certain parts are taken by Claude, and something by Gemini, which makes it slightly difficult for a normal user to do to and fro. And that's the reason analysis loading takes a lot of time too.",
