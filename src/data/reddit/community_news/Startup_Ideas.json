The reason for that is, at least in the US, personal training isn't quite so regulated as a profession. There's not an equivalent to the bar exam you'd have to pass to practice law, for example. So what makes a trainer \"legitimate?\" Having any certification? Having an accredited certification? A degree in sports science? And any trainer with years of experience would tell you that the certification you have has little bearing on how good of a coach you'll actually be.\n\nI want the platform to be as truthful as I can make it, and I haven't yet come up with a way, with the tech stack I have, that would actually verify \"legitimacy\" in a way that's meaningful to a user. I've seen some similar websites that have a \"verified\" or \"background checked\" badge on profiles, but with what I know about the training industry, those don't really mean much to me, and may just be paid features to stand out more. For now, I just have trainers enter what certifications they have during onboarding.\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to approach that, feel free to DM me! I'm building this solo, so it's nice to have a fresh set of yes on it.",

Winning variations get promoted to control and new challengers are automatically generated. If it detects winning concepts it leans into those while also leaving room for new exploration. Currently looking for feedback if you’re interested.",

      "text": "Hey, just wanted to share some notes after spending the last year launching products from \"original\" ideas - and why I've since pivoting to cloning instead. I thought I could find things people hadn't thought of, gaps in the market, ideas that fell through the cracks, etc.\n\nThat all changed when I watched a Starter Story interview with a guy who literally just... clones apps. He has 3 apps/services doing $30k+ MRR. He finds something already making money, makes it 1% better/different, and ships.\n\nThat video broke my brain a little. So I started researching. What apps are actually cloneable? How are they successful? Could a solo dev actually build these?\n\n166 ideas saved to my database later, these are my takeaways.\n\n**1. B2B wins, but not for the reason you think.**\n\n63% of profitable small-medium SaaS apps I found are B2B.\n\nBut it's not because B2B is \"easier to sell.\" It's because businesses have budgets. They don't agonize over $100/month the way consumers do over $5/mo. It does take longer to sell B2B, but it is stickier and the rewards are larger.\n\nThe average MRR in my data is \\~$25k/month. That's $300k/year from one person selling to other businesses.\n\n**2. The $5k-$50k/month sweet spot is wide open.**\n\n64% of the ideas I researched live in this range.\n\nBig enough to replace a salary, but small enough that nobody well-funded is coming after you. This is where small, bootstrapped teams/founders win.\n\n**3. Validated demand beats originality.**\n\nEvery idea in my database has verified MRR. Not \"I think this could work\" - actual proof that people already pay for this. This is a major point - knowing demand already exists is HUGE.\n\nStop trying to invent something new and find something that works and make it better for a specific audience.\n\n**4. You're more capable than you think.**\n\n92% of the apps I researched are solo-buildable. Not \"theoretically possible with 80-hour weeks\", but actually built and run by one person.\n\nI once heard someone say \"VC money is like rocket fuel. It's great if you're trying to launch into space, but it doesn't help if you're just trying to drive a car.\"\n\nMost of these apps are cars. Simple. Profitable. Built by normal developers solving boring problems.\n\n**5. Most of these can ship in a month.**\n\n44% of the ideas in my data are buildable in 4 weeks or less. 69% in 5 weeks or less.\n\nYou're not building Salesforce. You're building a focused tool that does one thing well.\n\n**6. People quit too early. People quit too late.**\n\nThe line between them is unfortunately thin.\n\nI have an app that helps students find off-campus housing. Started slow. Really slow. For a while I wondered if I should kill it. But the costs were low so I let it live. Today it outranks Zillow on Google for certain searches and I can sell to landlords for summer renters - something I never planned for.\n\nThe difference between \"quit\" and \"keep going\" was slight traction. Not massive traction. Just enough signal that people actually wanted it.\n\n**7. The boring ideas win.**\n\nEveryone's chasing AI. Meanwhile, my data shows there are many products quietly making money like:\n\n* SMS forwarding tools\n* Local file converters\n* AirPods finders\n* Calorie trackers\n* Supplement tracking apps\n* Alcohol consumption trackers\n\n\\---\n\nHope you enjoyed and happy cloning!",

      "text": "I work for a Fortune 500. I have a series of contractors in different countries. I pay them hourly by credit card. Some send me weekly PayPal invoices, some bill through Upwork. \n\nI've looked at more than a dozen tools to bring them together, and tested some like HubStaff and Time Doctor but they all focus on a different set of problems.\n\nMy goal is simple and unified automatic time tracking with payments. Contractor hits \"play\" on a desktop application and it starts recording time. They hit pause when they are done. At the end of the week, it automatically sends them money from my credit card.\n\nI don't want to approve time sheets or anything. Hubstaff/TimeDoctor are mainly for that, time tracking and approvals. My contractors have been working for me for years, I dont need to approve anything. I don't micromanage unless there's issues and there's never issues.\n\nUpwork offers this, but it's not their core product and it charges me 5% and my contractors 10%.\n\nRun the math on $8k a month and it's like $400 for me, but more importantly $800 for my contractors, so I pay them an extra $1200 per month just to compensate for fees. HubStaff fees are like $12 a seat, so I'm kind of interested in a solution that is in between. Any dollar under $1200 is a dollar saved and worth switching.\n\nUpwork is primarily for finding talent. I actually already have the talent. So I end up bringing my own contractors there and paying the high fees, as if they found them for me. \n\nI don't want two tools to track and pay. I don't want to lift a finger. That's the benefit of Upwork. I set it up and it's done, I never have to do anything and I can focus on real work.\n\nThrowing this out there for anyone looking for a startup idea. ",

This would be similar to a massage parlor but instead of focusing on muscles, the entire point would be gentle touches and focus on relaxing you.  If you are following trends, ASMR is just about the hottest trend right now, and a large amount of people watch ASMR videos to help them sleep.  So starting up a business to bring this experience into a safe tactile in person environment would be an easy hit.  Most of the women that get facials, nails, or any sort of pampering really do it for the personal attention. The other half that don't participate in these services really don't need the service, but they would enjoy it if it was just pampering with no strings attached to any special other service.  Men are a pretty big segment that are underserved by facials, nails, and in person salon's that offer some form of human interaction.  The pretext is off-putting enough that few men will walk in the door, but if the service was just generic pampering with no gimmick or any other value proposition, other than just relaxation, you would unlock a huge segment of customers.   There are already a handful of these types of in person ASMR services popping up.  But I have a scalable business plan and a unique spin on this that would take it to a new level.  Anyway, there is public pitch.  DM for more details.",

      "text": "Had a startup idea and was ready to spend 3 months building an MVP. Everyone says build fast and iterate, so I was planning to code first and validate later. Decided to flip that approach. Validated demand through organic search before writing a single line of code. Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and proposed solution. Added an email signup for early access waitlist.\n\nThe validation strategy was purely organic. No paid ads to test demand because ad traffic disappears the moment you stop spending. Needed to see if people were actually searching for solutions to this problem naturally. Started with SEO foundation to get the landing page discoverable. Used [this tool to submit to startup and product directories](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) so the domain would have enough authority for content to rank. This took about 90 minutes of setup.\n\nThen published 5 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content about my solution but helpful posts about the problem space and current alternatives people were using. Week one through three showed minimal traffic. Directory listings went live slowly and blog posts didn't rank yet. Had 8 email signups, all from people I'd directly messaged. No organic validation yet.\n\nWeek four through six is when organic validation started appearing. Domain authority hit 15 and two blog posts moved to page two. Traffic reached 180 visitors with 22 email signups from people who found the content through search. Week seven through ten brought clear validation signals. Traffic hit 450 visitors and 67 email signups from organic search. These people actively searched for solutions to the problem, found my content, and wanted early access.\n\nHad conversations with 20 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried and why those failed. All this validation happened before building anything. Now starting development with clear product direction validated by real search demand. Those 67 signups aren't just random interest, they're people who have the problem severe enough to search for solutions.\n\nThe startup idea lesson is that organic validation gives better signal quality than paid ads. People finding you through search have real intent and active problems. Ad traffic can be curiosity clicks from people who don't actually need your solution. If you're about to spend months building, validate demand through organic search first. The channel keeps working after validation too, unlike paid validation that stops when budget runs out.",

Some businesses manage to find steady, trustworthy suppliers, while others run into delays, inconsistent quality, or confusing communication. It seems like the platforms themselves are just tools, the real challenge is figuring out who you can actually rely on.\n\nWebsites like [Made-in-China.com](http://Made-in-China.com)  list thousands of suppliers across industries, but the experiences people have vary widely. Some businesses try small trial orders, some work with agents, and others take a more hands on approach to verify suppliers. It’s interesting to see how strategies differ depending on the type of business and products.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with international sourcing. \n\nWhat surprised you most? \n\nWhat would you do differently next time? \n\nHow do you decide if a supplier is actually trustworthy?\n\nSharing stories could help others understand what works and what doesn’t.",

There are very few agencies that will say no to someone who can PROVE that they can do sales (especially if you are just on commission).\n\nThe issue with Agencies is they tend to struggle without connections. Most agencies I know that were successful were started by people with deep industry connections and these connections gave them the \"in\" necessary to do sales.  Initial sales for an agency are one of the hardest parts - you have no rep.\n\nThe other way in, which I used for my agency, was to jump on the latest wave and offer services.  But this was easier for me because I\"m very technical. However, you can find a co-founder to handle the tech while you handle sales.\n\nSo you have two tasks:  \n1. Find the market that you can address  \n2. Possibly, find a co-founder who has the skills to address it while you do the sales.",

Website, socials, messaging, funnels. I spent weeks polishing things that felt productive but didn’t really move anything forward.\n\nThe shift came after a few quiet launches. I realized early marketing pain is mostly about signal, not reach. I didn’t need more channels. I needed tighter feedback loops. Who’s reacting, why, and where they’re getting confused.\n\nThe mistake I see a lot (and definitely made myself) is trying to “build a marketing engine” before there’s a repeatable story. Without that, everything feels random and draining.\n\nOne small change that helped a lot: instead of asking “how do we get more eyeballs?”, I started asking “what question do people ask right before they decide this isn’t for them?” Fixing that did more for momentum than any campaign ever did.\n\nCurious if others here struggle more with distribution—or with knowing what to say once you actually have attention. \\~",

My brain? kinda fried.\n\nNow I need someone who’s already survived SaaS life and didn’t die.  \nLooking for a SaaS advisor who can help with pricing, GTM, funnels, mistakes I’m about to make twice.\n\nCan’t pay cash. Can pay equity + honesty + stress.  \nIf you’ve scaled or failed fast before, you’re already overqualified.\n\nDMs open. Roast also accepted.",

Even if you provide us a list, when we go through a detailed assessment, we will have different findings. It happens every time. So the best suggestion would be to go through an offline assessment (it takes 30 minutes) and then we can have two 45 minutes sessions to come up with a health report, and help you develop a roadmap. We could then discuss any additional arrangements. Would love to keep all options on the table. Please feel free to DM me.",
