[ScreenSorts](https://screensorts.app/) hit 20 paying users in just 3 days... I know that might seem like a small number to some, but to me, it’s everything.\n\nThis started as just another \"is this even a good idea?\" post on this sub, and today it’s a real product that people are actually willing to pay for. You guys gave me the reality check I needed. You pushed me to double down on the macOS experience and keep everything local for privacy. Honestly, that’s the only reason this worked. And to my surprise, the app was ranked #12 on ProductHunt 😭\n\nFor anyone who missed the original thread, ScreenSorts uses local AI to turn your mac's screenshot graveyard into a searchable database. No cloud, no subscriptions, just fixing the mess.\n\nI just wanted to come back and say thank you 🥹 If I hadn’t posted here and listened to the \"tough love\" feedback, I’d still be staring at an empty VS Code window.\n\nIf you’re currently in the \"is this even a good idea?\" phase, please keep going. Listen to this community, take the critiques, and just build the thing.\n\nAMA if you want to know about the tech stack or how the launch went!",

CoreML, or something like ONNX running locally? And how are you handling the image indexing/search? (I'm guessing vector embeddings but curious about the implementation)\n\n\\*\\*Pricing psychology:\\*\\* You mentioned \"no subscriptions\" - was that a deliberate choice based on feedback here, or did you always plan one-time purchase? Curious how that decision has worked out.\n\n\\*\\*Next steps:\\*\\* Now that you've got initial traction, what's your plan for retention?

I'm now doing between 8 to 10 demos per day.   \n  \nMy goal is to get people to start a free trial.   \n  \nI only take calls with people who can spend a minimum of $500 with us.  \n  \nWe just hired a sales rep to help me out.  \n  \nc) More content  \n  \nMore LinkedIn posts, more posts on X, more blog articles, more Reddit posts.   \n  \nWe hired more influencers and bought more ad space in newsletters.  \n  \nThe more we post, the more money we make. So we scale.   \n  \nWe are also trying to work harder on the quality of the content we post.  \n  \n2) We got lucky  \n  \nSeveral events played in our favor:  \n  \na) RTs from Marc lou and Tibo on X (thanks guys!)   \n  \nb) A feature on Starter Story (+35k views)   \n  \nc) An article on IndieHackers's blog (thousands of views)   \n  \nd) A viral video that made us blow up on Twitter (830k+ views)   \n  \n  \n3) More customer support  \n  \nWe recruited an extra person for support.   \n  \nNow, every member (even on a free trial) can book a 15-minute call.   \n  \nIt’s time-consuming, but the customer feedback is excellent.  \n  \n4) Ads  \n  \nWe launched retargeting and we are about to launch cold ads.   \n  \nFacebook retargeting is already bringing in quite a few people.  \n  \nThere is no real magic, just a huge amount of work.   \nWe try to structure everything.  \n  \nFor those interested, I operate on a \"cooking recipe\" principle:  \n  \nDuring my day, I have to bake the most beautiful cake.   \n  \nEach ingredient is a task: post on LinkedIn, post on Twitter, etc.  \n  \nSo every day, I have my list of ingredients that I must work on as best as possible.  \n  \nThat's how, at the end of the day, I have a magnificent cake.  \n  \nGood luck everyone!  \n\n\nproof : [https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v](https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v)",

For years you were only be able to put like 1 or 2 links in your bio... and the way they were displayed was a complete turnoff. Nick and Anthony, a couple of Aussies with a marketing agency, spent 6 hours making a page where they can cram all their artist promo links under one roof. \n\nIt was a damn side project…\n\nQuickly they saw others in the space complaining about stuff like not being able to promote their gigs or merch, and decided to spread their lil solution. The \"homie try this\" hook, was all the validation they needed to press the gas. Brands started using it, creators adopting it, small businesses putting their hair salon locations on 1 stop homepages. \n\nThat was the birth of the \"link in bio\" market uprising. \n\nNot only did they completely shift focus from a small agency, to a 1 page - all link storefront named Linktree, they created an entirely new ecosystem that prints money for pretty much everyone. Tens of millions of users, billions of clicks every month, with a billion-plus valuation...\n\n...all because they made one tiny thing less annoying.\n\nPretty cool story ngl, but it doesn't stop there. The 'Link-in-bio\" market has created opportunities for almost everyone to make their business easier to sell. Companies like [Linkshop](http://linkshop.bio/) make it hella easy for small businesses to sell products without an entire store. If you don't have physical products but got sell digital courses/products to sell - [Stan store](http://stan.store/) was pretty much made for you. Beacons ai is also very popular among creators for like media kit sharing and brand tools. \n\nAnyways not to bore you but it's crazy how such a small blind spot Instagram failed to fix, a couple homies to make an entirely new internet economy. It doesn't take a crazy innovative idea to make millions, just do what other companies aren't willing to. ",

I’ve been tinkering with voice synthesis for a while, and I finally built something good enough to share:\n\n[imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/) — a voice cloning tool that can clone a voice from a short audio sample.\n\nThe workflow is simple:\n\n• Upload or record a voice clip (even a few seconds can work)  \n• The app transcribes it automatically  \n• Enter the text you want spoken  \n• Click generate, and get cloned audio back in seconds\n\nI’ve been genuinely surprised by how well it performs, even with short inputs. No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

      "text": "I spend a lot of time around early rounds. Pre seed, seed, under $5M.  \nAnd the outreach founders use on Reddit, LinkedIn, X, email… it’s not just bad. It's horrendous.\n\nNot because investors are evil.  \nBut because investors actually have a standard that weeds out non-pros (imagine that).\n\nIt's so bad, I'm writing this post as a helpful rant. Cheers\n\nHere are the 3 biggest self-inflicted wounds I see. If this is you at all... pay attention\n\n**1. The public begging post**\n\nYou’ve all seen it. And it grinds on me every time\n\n“Hey everyone, building an AI platform for creators. Need $300k. DM if interested.”\n\nNo real investor touches that.  \nIt reads like someone trying to pay rent, not build a company.\n\nInvestors fund momentum, clarity, and control.  \nBegging posts signal the opposite.\n\nIf you’re going to post publicly, do this instead:\n\n* State the problem in a way that sounds lived, not researched\n* Show what you built that proves you’re serious\n* Give one traction signal, even if small\n* Ask a real question\n\nYou’re not asking for money.  \nYou’re creating gravity.\n\n**2. The comment section ambush**\n\nInvestor posts something thoughtful.  \nFounder replies: “We are doing this. Can you invest?”\n\nThat’s not outreach. That’s street panhandling.\n\nAs shocking as it is, try to actually provide useful info instead:\n\n* Add a sharp observation to the thread\n* Show you understand the space\n* Ask one intelligent question\n\nExample:\n\n“Are you seeing these as workflow wedges or data moat plays? Most teams I talk to confuse the two and waste a year.”\n\nNow you sound like an operator, not a lottery ticket hunter.\n\n**3. The catastrophic DM (by far the worst of all)**\n\nReal message I received:\n\n“Hi, I have a great idea. Can you invest $85,000?”\n\nThat’s not a pitch. That’s a red flag in sentence form.\n\nDMs are not for pitching.  \nDMs are for getting permission to pitch.\n\nHere’s the actual sequence I’ve seen work over and over for sub $5M rounds.\n\n**Step 1: Build a real target list**\n\nNot “early stage tech investors.”  \nThat’s how you waste three months.\n\nYou want investors who:\n\n* Write checks your size\n* Invest at your stage\n* Already backed companies in your space\n\nIf you can’t name three relevant portfolio companies, you’re guessing.\n\n**Step 2: Borrow credibility**\n\nIf you have no network, don’t start with investors.  \nStart with operators in their portfolio.\n\nDM founders they already backed.  \nAsk for one piece of advice.  \nHave a real conversation.\n\nWarmth travels through operators, not cold founders.\n\n**Step 3: Send a three-line opener**\n\nNo deck.  \nNo life story.  \nNo pitch.\n\nJust this structure:\n\nLine 1: Specific reference  \nLine 2: One sentence on what you built + one traction signal  \nLine 3: One question\n\nExample:\n\n“Saw your post on vertical AI. We built a dispatch tool for HVAC teams and our beta users are already routing jobs through it daily. Too early to be interesting for a seed check?”\n\nShort. Human. Non-desperate.\n\n**Step 4: One pager before the deck**\n\nDecks are for meetings.  \nOne pagers are for curiosity.\n\nYour one pager should cover:\n\n* Who the customer is\n* What hurts\n* What you built\n* Why you win\n* One traction signal\n* How much you’re raising and what it unlocks\n\nIf they want the deck, they’ll ask.\n\n**Step 5: Run a tight process**\n\nMost founders lose here.\n\nThey:\n\n* Talk to one investor at a time\n* Drag it out for months\n* Lose all momentum\n\nDo this instead:\n\n* 30 to 45 day fundraise window\n* Batch meetings into 2 weeks\n* Push everyone to the same timeline\n\nMomentum is not luck. It’s structure.\n\nI’m not saying this to be harsh.  \nBut a bad outreach pattern can kill a round before it even starts. And how to post on Reddit when raising capital is a whole other conversation.\n\nAnd honestly, I have literally thought about creating a course just for founders to learn etiquette for contacting investors successfully (instead of driving investors crazy with horrible outreach)  \n✌",

There’s demand.”  \n\nNo competition usually means no money.\n\n2️⃣ **Look for These 5 Opportunity Signals**  \n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I look for:  \n\n- **UX Gaps**: Ugly or clunky tools in high-paying markets.  \n\n- **High Pricing**: If a tool charges $99/month, it indicates budget exists.  \n\n- **Missing Features**: Users often complain in reviews.  \n\n- **Over-Complexity**: Many tools try to do everything. There’s opportunity in doing one thing extremely well.  \n\n- **Market Frustration Intensity**: Is it a mild annoyance or “hair on fire” urgent?  \n\nIf the pain isn’t at least a 7/10, I move on.\n\n3️⃣ **Define WHO It’s For**  \n\nIf your answer is “everyone,” it’s already dead. Specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is better than broad appeal.\n\n**4️⃣ Check Paying Capacity**  \n\nWould this user realistically pay?  \n\nStudents complaining do not equal revenue. Agencies complaining signal potential revenue. There’s different market psychology at play.\n\n***5️⃣ Distribution Plan Before Product**\n\nIf you can’t answer, “How will I get my first 100 users?” don’t build yet.  \n\nA great product without a distribution plan is just a hobby.\n\n**How I Validate Before Building** \n\nHere’s my sequence:  \n\n- 5-10 user interviews (no Google Forms - real conversations)  \n\n- Create a landing page  \n\n- Small ad spend ($5-$20)  \n\n- Try to pre-sell  \n\n- THEN build the MVP  \n\nIf nobody pays before the MVP, that’s data. It’s cheaper to kill an idea early than to wait six months.\n\n**Hard Truth**  \n\nMost founders fall in love with building. Winning founders fall in love with reducing risk. Validation might not be glamorous, but it saves years.  \n\nIf you find this helpful, I’m happy to share the exact interview structure I use.",

It’s fascinating to see why they failed, sometimes it was bad timing, sometimes it was no product-market fit, and sometimes they just ran out of cash.\n\nI organized all this data into a searchable archive. If you are brainstorming a new venture, you might want to check if someone has already paid the \"tuition\" for learning that lesson so you don't have to.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.loot-drop.io\n\nI’d love to hear if you can find any \"ghosts\" of ideas you’re \n\ncurrently working on!",

I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you?

There is already a successful startup in Italy doing this with a €1M ARR, but they haven't expanded to many mid-sized cities yet.\n\nThe Execution:\n\n• The MVP: I cloned their value proposition and website structure, using a Tally form to capture leads.\n\n• The Distribution: I posted in large \"dog lover\" Facebook groups. To keep it \"organic,\" I posted as a happy customer recommending the service.\n\n• The Result: The post went viral within the groups (approx. 10k views). People commented about their struggles with traditional groomers, but zero people filled out the form.\n\nMy Reflection:\n\nI’ve been re-reading Paul Graham’s “Do Things That Don’t Scale.” I suspect my funnel was too \"cold.\" Expecting someone to go from a Facebook comment to a lead form in seconds might be unrealistic for a service involving their pets.\n\nThe Question:\n\nFor those who have launched copycats: what is your go-to validation method? Was my \"fake customer\" angle the problem, or is the \"landing page + form\" approach dead for service-based startups?",

      "text": "I’ve been looking at how recruitment agencies spend money, and it’s insane. They pay anywhere from €150 to €500 just to post a single job ad on LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nMy thesis is that they are sitting on a goldmine they aren't using: their consultants' personal profiles.\n\nIf an agency has 10 recruiters, they likely have a combined network of 50k+ relevant candidates. Yet, they still pay for ads because coordinating 10 people to post the same job ad manually is a nightmare.\n\nSo I built a tool called **Copost** to solve exactly this \"distribution\" problem.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of buying a job slot, the agency writes the post once in my tool, and it pushes it to the personal profiles of the relevant recruiters.\n\nI added a specific feature to schedule the \"first comment\" automatically (so they can put the application link there without killing the reach in the main post). This way, not only do they save money on ads, but their recruiters actually build their personal brand and attract more candidates for the future.\n\nI managed to book 3 demos with actual recruitment firms for next week, so I feel like there is a real pain here regarding the cost of LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nDo you guys think this \"decentralized\" approach can actually replace paid job slots, or will companies always prefer the lazy option of paying LinkedIn?\n\nI’d love to know if this logic holds up.",

While that doesn’t replace your own due diligence, it does make initial screening a bit easier.\n\nCurious how others approach this:\n\nDo you treat certain platforms differently than others when sourcing overseas?\n\nHave you had better luck finding factory-direct pricing on some versus others?\n\nAny red flags or tips to watch out for?\n\nJust trying to figure out which platforms are actually worth spending time on in 2026.

      "text": "Been working with early-stage founders on customer acquisition for a while now. Most of them are pre-product, pre-funding and honestly pre-everything.  \nThe question I hear again and again is: *“How do I get my first 10 customers without ads or an audience?”*\n\nMy answer is almost always the same.  \nOutbound.\n\nHere’s the exact framework I walk them through.\n\n**why outbound before you build**\n\nMost founders build first and try to sell later. That’s backwards.\n\nOutbound lets you validate whether people are actually struggling with the problem. It helps you understand what the market truly needs, not what you assume they need. It also gives you a chance to get paid before you build through simple pre-sales, and it teaches you the real words and language your customers use to describe their pain.\n\nI tell every founder one simple rule: have at least 20 real conversations before writing a single line of code. No shortcuts.\n\n**the 3 questions that validate any idea**\n\nWhen you reach out to potential customers, there are only three questions that really matter.\n\nFirst, ask them what they are currently doing to solve this problem.  \nIf the answer is “nothing”, the pain is probably not strong enough. If they mention competitors, it means demand already exists. If they describe a messy or hacky workaround, that is usually a very strong signal that they would pay for a better solution.\n\nSecond, ask them what the most annoying part of their current setup is.  \nThis tells you what features actually matter and what does not.\n\nThird, ask them what a perfect solution would look like for them.  \nLet them describe their ideal world in their own words. That description should guide what you build.\n\nThese three questions alone can save you months of building the wrong product.\n\n**the outreach framework**\n\nThe first step is to find people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nNot people who might face it someday. People who are actively struggling with it.\n\nThe easiest places to spot them are posts on Reddit asking for tools, complaints on Twitter, discussions inside communities and negative reviews of competitor products.\n\nThe second step is to reach out with curiosity, not with a pitch.\n\nReference their exact situation, show that you understand what they are dealing with, and make it clear that you are trying to learn, not sell.\n\nA simple message like this works very well:\n\n“I saw your post about struggling with X. I’ve been researching this problem and already spoke to around 15 people facing the same issue. I’d love to understand how you’re handling it today. No pitch. Just trying to learn before I build anything.”\n\nMessages like this regularly get very high reply rates, because people genuinely enjoy talking about their problems.\n\nThe third step is to listen. Not to sell.\n\nIn your first three or four conversations, your only job is to listen, take notes and understand their reality.\n\nAfter that, you can say something like:  \n“Based on what you shared, I’m thinking of building X. Would that actually help you?”\n\nIf they say yes, then ask one more direct question:  \n“Would you pay Y for this?”\n\nIf that answer is also yes, you can move to pre-selling and ask if you can build it with them as your first customer. That is real validation, not opinions.\n\n**the numbers**\n\nWhat I see very consistently is this.\n\nAfter about 20 conversations, founders start to clearly understand the problem.  \nAfter around 50 conversations, they usually know exactly what to build.  \nAfter roughly 100 conversations, many are able to get 5 to 10 pre-sales or early customers.\n\nMost founders do zero conversations.  \nIf you do just 20, you are already ahead of almost everyone.\n\n**what makes it work**\n\nThe first thing that really matters is specificity.  \nGeneric outreach gets ignored. Referencing their exact words, their exact post and their exact situation is what makes people respond.\n\nThe second is genuine curiosity.  \nPeople can easily tell when you are trying to learn versus when you are trying to push a product. Approach these conversations like a researcher, not like a salesperson.\n\nThe third is consistency.  \nIf you speak to five people a day for four weeks, that is already 100 conversations.\n\nThe fourth is speed.  \nReach out to people who posted within the last seven days. After that, the problem is no longer fresh in their mind.\n\n**the founders who win**\n\nEvery successful early-stage founder I’ve worked with shares one common trait.\n\nThey talked to more people than their competitors.\n\nNot because they were smarter.  \nNot because they were better coders.  \nNot because they had more funding.\n\nThey simply had more real conversations.\n\nOutbound is the fastest shortcut to those conversations.\n\n**tldr**\n\nHave at least 20 conversations before you build anything.  \nFind people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nAsk the three validation questions.  \nListen more than you talk.  \nPre-sell before you build.  \nFive conversations a day is enough to reach 100 in a month.\n\nIf you’re early-stage, start this week.  \nFive real conversations will teach you more than five weeks of building alone.\n\nWhat’s been your experience with outbound so far? I’m curious how others are doing this.",

They're directional, not exact - actual numbers could be higher or lower. The point is the pattern, not the precise figures.*\n\n# THE LANDSCAPE\n\nAll of these apps do the same core thing: Point camera at plant → get name → see relevant plant info + other bells and whistles.\n\nSame tech, same business model (subscription), same audience.\n\nCombined revenue: $27M+/month (rough estimation)\n\n# 1. PictureThis - $8-13M/month\n\n**The \"category king\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't invent plant identification, but they got there first and went harder than anyone on paid acquisition. Were (allegedly) doing 300+ ads running on Meta at any given time.\n\nHow they set themselves apart:\n\n* Claimed \"98% accuracy\" and \"400,000 species\" - biggest numbers in the space = perceived leader\n* Added a Latin pronunciation feature. Tiny thing, but it makes them feel like a serious botanical tool instead of a toy\n* $29.99/year pricing\n* Go hard on ASO - they rank #1 for basically every plant-related keyword\n\nI used it before LLMs were a thing and I remember being genuinely impressed. That initial \"wow this actually works\" reaction matters more than people think for word-of-mouth.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The lesson here is simple - be first and be willing to outspend everyone on marketing. Not groundbreaking advice, but it works.\n\n# 2. PlantIn - $900K-2M/month\n\n**The \"niche audience\" strategy**\n\nThey didn't try to out-feature PictureThis. They found audiences that PictureThis wasn't really serving and built for them instead.\n\n* Free for students and educators - creates a viral loop through universities and social media\n* \"Moon planting calendar\" - I honestly don't fully understand wtf this is, but apparently there's a whole community of astrology/spiritual gardeners.\n   * Side note: Sometimes slight differentiations like this are major unlocks to new markets/revenue\n* \"Ask a botanist\" feature - human expert access, not just AI\n* Light meter tool (measures if your spot gets enough light) and water calculator - productivity features, not just identification\n\nThey're Ukraine-based, so lower operating costs, and they grew largely through organic/social instead of brute-forcing paid ads.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: The move here is obvious in hindsight - don't compete on the same features. Find the audience the market leader isn't serving and build for them.\n\n# 3. Plantum - $700K/month\n\n**The \"app factory\" strategy**\n\nThis one's interesting because they barely differentiated at all. Plantum is built by AIBY, a company that literally runs an app factory. They clone successful apps at scale, pour money into paid acquisition, and see what sticks.\n\nTheir playbook:\n\n* Solid ASO\n* Good enough product\n* Paid ads\n* Volume. AIBY runs dozens of apps. Some hit.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes you don't need a clever angle. You just need solid distribution and a product that doesn't suck. If you can acquire users profitably, you win.\n\n# 4. Plant App - $400K/month\n\n**The \"geographic arbitrage\" strategy**\n\nThey launched in Turkish and regional markets first where there's way less competition, proved the model with cheaper user acquisition, then expanded to English-speaking markets once they had revenue.\n\n* Better multi-language support than the US-first competitors\n* Lower CAC in non-US markets funded the expansion\n* Operational costs way lower than US competitors\n\n**Clone Lesson**: By the time they hit the US market, they'd already built a profitable business. Smart play that most founders never consider because everyone defaults to launching in English/US first.\n\n# 5. Blossom - $100K/month (at one point - now closer to $20k)\n\n**The \"social proof\" strategy**\n\nBlossom played the social proof game better than anyone. They won a Webby Award and slap \"People's Voice Winner 2022\" on literally everything. Does a Webby Award actually mean the app is better? Probably not. But does it convert? 100%\n\nThey also carved out the \"edible gardening\" niche - vegetable gardens, herb gardens, garden planning calendars. The other apps were all focused on houseplants and identification. Blossom said \"what about people who grow food?\" and owned that corner.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: I don't know how hard Webby Awards are to win, but the strategy is clear: enter awards, get press, put badges everywhere. Social proof converts really well, even if the award itself is semi-meaningless.\n\n*Kind of reminds me of 30-under-30 being a \"this person is legit\" signal, though nowadays maybe not, since so many end up in jail.*\n\n# 6. Plantiaria - $100K/month\n\n**The \"just ship it\" strategy**\n\nCyprus-based. Very little differentiation.\n\n* Slightly better UX than some competitors\n* Consistent updates\n* $11 revenue per download (premium positioning)\n\n**Clone Lesson**: They're 8th place in a market this size and still clear $100K/month. You don't need to win. You just need to exist in a big enough market.\n\n# 7. PlantNet - FREE (non-profit)\n\n**The \"open source\" strategy**\n\nThis one is playing a completely different game - completely free, no ads, no subscription. Open source, citizen science project.\n\nAnd it's NYT Wirecutter's #1 pick for plant identification. 68% accuracy (second-best tested behind PictureThis).\n\nThey get funded through grants and academic partnerships. Scientists and serious botanists use it. Being free made them the default recommendation in every \"best plant app\" article.\n\n**Clone Lesson**: Sometimes \"free\" is a business model. They're not making subscription revenue, but their employees are getting paid through grants and the project has massive reach and prestige. Different game entirely.\n\n# 8. LeafSnap - $30k/month\n\n**The \"minimum viable clone\" strategy**\n\nThe minimum viable clone.\n\n* Didn't try to compete with the big players\n* Focused on specific plant types\n* Lower price point\n* Low overhead\n\n$30K/month from what's essentially a side project. Proof that even 8th or 10th place in a massive market is still life-changing money for a small team.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAs part of a recent pattern to pursue cloneable/pivotable apps instead of \"golden ideas\", I've been surprised by how little the actual differentiation matters technically. PlantIn's \"moon calendar\" isn't hard to build. Blossom's Webby Award has nothing to do with the product itself. PictureThis basically just claimed the biggest numbers and ran more ads than everyone. None of these are real moats.\n\n**Audience niching works.** PlantIn went after students. Blossom went after vegetable gardeners. Same core product, completely different positioning.\n\n**One small \"hook\" feature goes a long way.** Moon calendar, ask-a-botanist, edible garden planner, Latin pronunciation. None of these are technically impressive. But they signal \"this app is for YOU specifically\" to a certain type of user.\n\n**Social proof converts.** Awards, press, \"most accurate\" claims. It doesn't even matter if it's fully deserved. People see a badge and trust goes up.\n\n**You don't have to start in the US.** Plant App and Plantiaria proved you can build profitably in smaller markets first, then expand.\n\n**You don't need to win.** A mediocre app in a great market beats a great app in a mediocre market. $30K-$100K/month from 8th place is still a very real business for a solo founder or small team\n\nLastly, \"competition\" in this space means 8+ apps all making $100K+/month, with the leader at $13M - there is a lot of room for multiple players.\n\nIf you liked this post and want to find your own cloneable products with real revenue, positioning angles, and competitor breakdowns.

They argue, suggest features, and even push back on the founder. That friction makes the product stronger.

The goal was simple: bring back that old-school vibe where you can just talk to strangers from anywhere in the world without all the chaos.\n\nDay one? Honestly, kind of disappointing. Hardly anyone showed up. But that was expected. Brand new site, no audience, nobody even knows it exists.\n\nDay two was completely different.\n\nWhen I opened the site, it actually started matching me with people pretty quickly. I ended up having some surprisingly long and genuine conversations. A few people gave me solid feedback, which honestly meant a lot. Some were shocked that a student built it. A couple even got slightly scared when I told them I made the site… and instantly disconnected 😂\n\nRight now it matches you with someone in under 60 seconds on average. That’ll improve as more people join.\n\nToday alone, around 200 unique users visited. It’s not a massive number, but for a 2-day-old project, it feels huge to me.\n\nI’m planning to add some unique features that current competitors don’t have, but I want to keep it clean, cozy, and safe - that classic simple random chat feel.\n\nIf you’re reading this, maybe give it a try. You might randomly match with me.\n\nAnd if you’ve got ideas, feedback, or want to collaborate - I’m all ears.",
