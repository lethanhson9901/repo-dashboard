      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool [Brandled ](https://brandled.app/)(helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR.\n\nThen I became obsessed with one question: what separates SaaS products that make it from those that die at zero.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole. Studied 47 founders who went from $0 to $10k+ MRR in the last year. Watched their podcasts, red their tweets, and everything i could get my hands on.\n\nHere's what I learned from all of them, and what I was doing catastrophically wrong.\n\n**1. Frictionless signup isn't optional**\n\nEvery successful product had one-click social login. Google OAuth mostly.\n\nThe ones that died had email verification flows, password requirements, multi-step forms asking questions before showing any value.\n\nThe math is brutal. If you lose 30% of people at signup and you're getting 1000 visitors a month, that's 300 potential customers gone. At a 10% trial-to-paid conversion, that's 30 paying customers per month lost to signup friction alone.\n\nI started with magic link only. Completion rate was 45%. Added Google login. Jumped to 78% the next day.\n\nEvery percentage point of friction at signup costs you real revenue. Most founders don't even measure this.\n\n**2. They launched in weeks, not months**\n\nNone of them spent 6 months building in secret.\n\nAverage time from idea to first paying customer: 3-6 weeks. They launched with ONE core feature. Then spent most of their time marketing it.\n\nI did the opposite. Spent 3 months building features before launching. Content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, everything. Got 12 signups. Zero paying customers.\n\nConvinced myself the product wasn't good enough. Spent another month adding features. Still nothing.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. Nobody knew it existed.\n\nAfter I stopped building and started marketing, posting on Reddit, doing LinkedIn outreach, documenting on X, I hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nSame product. Different approach.\n\nPost-launch is 90% marketing, 10% product.\n\n**3. They were shameless about promotion**\n\nThe successful ones talked about their product everywhere. Not spammy. Just never hiding it.\n\nReddit threads. Twitter replies. Forum comments. Anywhere their audience hung out.\n\nThey'd give genuinely helpful advice first, then naturally mention their tool when relevant.\n\nStarted being shameless. Every relevant conversation where someone complained about the problem I solved, I'd help them first, then mention I built something for this.\n\nA few people definitely get mad but I feel the upside is worth it.\n\nYour product won't discover itself.\n\n**4. They asked churned users what went wrong**\n\nEvery successful product had a system for this. Automated email going out when someone cancels asking what didn't work.\n\nI was doing none of this. Saw cancellations in Stripe, felt rejected, moved on. Never asked why. Never learned anything.\n\nNow every cancelled user gets emails through and automated email sequence and the replies are done by me personally.\n\nResponse rate is 40%. The feedback is literally gold.\n\nEvery single one is fixable. But I only learned because I asked.\n\nChurned users tell you the real truth about your product.\n\n**5. They used their own product religiously**\n\nNot one successful founder was building something they didn't use daily. They were their own heaviest users.\n\nI wasn't doing this. Used my tool occasionally to \"test\" but wasn't relying on it daily.\n\nForced myself to create all my content through my own product for a week. Found 7 bugs in 30 minutes that never showed up in testing.\n\nGenerate button didn't work on mobile. Analytics took 8 seconds to load. Onboarding skipped steps if you refreshed.\n\nMy users were experiencing this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nIf you're not using your product daily as a real user, you're building blind.\n\n**6. They fixed retention before scaling acquisition**\n\nBiggest strategic difference.\n\nFailed products: 30-50% monthly churn, constantly chasing new users to replace ones leaving.\n\nSuccessful products: Fixed retention first, got churn to 10-20%, then scaled acquisition.\n\nThe math: At 40% churn, you acquire 40 customers to net 24. At 15% churn, you acquire 40 and net 34. Same effort, 42% better results.\n\nI was obsessed with new signups. Ignored my 40% churn rate. Got 10 new customers, lost 4. Net: 6.\n\nStopped all acquisition. Fixed onboarding from 8 steps to 3. Added email sequences. Built features retained users asked for. Churn dropped to 15%.\n\nSame acquisition effort, now net 8-9 customers instead of 6.\n\nRetention is the foundation. Acquisition is the multiplier.\n\n**7. They shipped MVPs with one feature**\n\nEvery successful product launched stupidly lean. One core feature done exceptionally well.\n\nI launched with 7 features: content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, SWOT, comments, hashtags.\n\nCodebase was a nightmare. Users were confused. I was maintaining features 3% of users touched.\n\nShould've launched with one thing: AI content that sounds human. Made that 10x better. Everything else later based on what paying customers asked for.\n\nYour MVP should make people say \"this solves my exact problem\" even if ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, so many features\" while solving nothing particularly well.\n\n**8. They priced based on value, not competition**\n\nNone of them raced to the bottom on pricing.\n\nThey looked at the value delivered. Hours saved. Revenue generated. Pain eliminated.\n\nThen priced a fraction of that value.\n\nI priced at $19/month because competitors were at $29-39. Thought I'd win on price. Just looked cheap and inferior.\n\nNeeded 263 customers to hit $5k MRR at $19 versus only 128 at $39.\n\nRaised price to $29-39. Conversions didn't drop. They improved slightly.\n\nHigher price signaled solving a valuable problem.\n\nPeople who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers. They'll churn for anything $3 cheaper.\n\n**9. They automated relationship building**\n\nEvery successful product had email sequences from day one. Not promotional. Actual value and engagement.\n\nWelcome emails. Feature education. Check-ins. Re-engagement for quiet users. Win-back for churned users.\n\nI was sending nothing after signup. Users signed up, got busy, forgot, churned.\n\nEngagement doesn't happen by accident. You engineer it.\n\n**10. They validated with money, not words**\n\nThe problem with feedback: it's free. People say nice things because it costs them nothing.\n\nI built features based on \"that would be helpful\" comments from users who weren't even paying. Wasted weeks on features nobody used.\n\nNow I only build what paying customers explicitly request.\n\nMoney is the only validation that matters. Words are cheap. Credit card numbers are truth.\n\n**The one thing they all had**\n\nThey didn't quit when it felt hopeless.\n\nThey all hit $0 for months. Got depressed. Questioned everything. Wanted to shut it down.\n\nBut didn't.\n\nThe difference between $0 and success wasn't talent or luck. It was not quitting before they figured out what works.\n\n90% of SaaS products die not because they couldn't work. Because the founder quit too early.\n\nIf you're stuck at $0, study the people who've made it. Not the outliers. The normal founders who went from $0 to $10k.\n\nThey're not special. They just did specific things that compound and didn't quit when it got hard.\n\nThe playbook is right there. You just have to execute it.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this.",

I’m building JarVisa — an AI-powered visa assistant for travelers with high-rejection passports (starting with the Philippines).\n\nProblem: applying for visas is confusing, expensive, and anxiety-inducing. People rely on shady agents or spend weeks guessing what to write.\nSolution: JarVisa helps users generate visa-ready documents (cover letters, itineraries, onward tickets), understand requirements, and practice interviews (e.g. US visa mock interview with AI consular personas).\n\nTraction so far:\n\t•\t1,200+ visa checks\n\t•\t500+ waitlist signups\n\t•\t300+ visa documents generated\n\t•\tUsers from PH, India, Nigeria, LATAM\n\t•\tGrowing mostly via word of mouth and communities\n\nBackground: I’m a Filipino product designer/engineer working at a YC-backed startup, building JarVisa solo because I’ve seen friends and family repeatedly rejected due to lack of guidance. Long-term vision is to become the default infrastructure for global mobility for people with “weak” passports.\n\nProduct: https://jarvisa.com\nHappy to DM and share more detail",

Sharing three early stage products I’m actively working on.\n\nDhuwa.com\nDhuwa is a mindful quitting platform for smoking and other impulsive habits. It focuses on awareness and understanding triggers rather than streak pressure, fear, or guilt.\nThis idea comes directly from my own struggle with impulsive behaviors. Most habit apps felt mechanical and shame driven.\n\nDhuwa is designed to help people slow down, observe urges, and build self trust instead of fighting themselves.\n\nStatus: early prototype and concept validation. Clear path toward subscriptions, wellness partnerships, and behavior change programs.\n\nOneMovePuzzle.com\nOne Move Puzzle is a minimal logic game where each level has a single perfect solution. It is simple to understand, deeply satisfying to solve, and designed for high replayability.\nI built it as a response to attention draining games. This format works extremely well for short form content, daily challenges, and viral distribution, with monetization through ads, premium levels, and sponsorships.\n\nStatus: playable MVP is live with strong early engagement from testers.\n\nPrakakura.com\nPrakakura is an anonymous public canvas where people can leave messages that live permanently on a shared digital space. Think of it as digital graffiti for thoughts, gratitude, grief, and human presence.\n\nThis project is deeply personal. It came from periods of loss, failure, and instability where expression mattered more than visibility or likes. The platform is live, has real users, and an Android app is already published. Payments are not enabled yet, but the engagement and emotional resonance are strong.\n\nFounder background\nI come from a growth and paid advertising background and have worked on multiple products across marketing and tech. I left my job to build independently, tried a physical business that failed, went through financial pressure, and kept building anyway. I’m technical, product focused, and very distribution aware.\n\nI’m not testing ideas for fun. I’m committed to building long term and would love to explore alignment if Forum supports founders with strong narratives, execution bias, and unconventional products.\n\nHappy to share metrics or continue the conversation over DM.\nPrabin",

We ended up training a lightweight YOLO model using synthetic data, and its been running in production for a year with an error rate of just a few in a thousand. I realized that if we had a dedicated tool for this back then - the whole training set would have cost us about a few bucks and taken 15 minutes to generate.\n\nSo that is what we building now. We are currently in private beta, but the goal is to kill the \"book a demo\" requirement for good. We want this to be accessible to everyone, whether it's a tech-savvy farmer tracking crops or a mobile dev building an app to find dropped AirPods, not just enterprises with big budgets.",

You drop in your content, and MarketMind gives you clear feedback on what’s working, what isn’t, and what to adjust. It also helps you plan ahead, stay consistent, and not feel like you’re always behind or guessing what to do next. It’s built for people who are just starting out or who can’t justify spending a lot on marketing, but still want real direction and insight. The goal is to make that kind of help affordable and practical for everyday business owners who don’t have the time to do all this themselves. It’s meant to feel less like a tool, and more like having someone in your corner who understands the process and keeps things organized.",

It scrapes **direct application links** from official company career pages.\n\n**Current Status:** This is an **early MVP**. I currently have **2,300+ active jobs** indexed. I am pushing updates daily to fix bugs, improve the UI, and optimize the scrapers, but I wanted to show the direction I'm taking.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* **No Third Parties:** Indexes *only* official company pages.\n* **Direct Access:** You search for a role, and we give you the direct link to the official portal (Workday, Taleo, etc.).\n\n**Link:** [https://luminajobs.vercel.app/](https://luminajobs.vercel.app/) (Feedback is very welcome!)",

First, communication: it keeps everyone aligned by turning messy project updates, risks, and blockers into clear, role-specific summaries so PMs and leaders don’t spend half their time chasing status. Second, data analytics: Mika looks at timelines, dependencies, velocity, and risk signals to flag issues early, before a project slips instead of after the fact. Third, process and compliance: it helps teams follow the right workflows, approvals, and audit trails without adding more overhead.\nWe’re not trying to replace PMs or build yet another task tracker. The idea is to offload the coordination, analysis, and process policing to AI so humans can focus on judgment, decisions, and actually leading teams.\n\nWe are still in the MVP stage.

No browsing. No spiral. Just “press play.” Think of it as a calm remote for your brain, not another content platform.\n\nIt doesn’t stream or replace Netflix—it sits above your existing services and removes the hardest part: deciding.\n\nEarly signal: organic traction on Reddit and social, dozens of qualitative interviews, and people repeatedly saying “I wish something would just choose for me.”\n\nBusiness model: consumer subscription (low monthly fee) once the experience is dialed in.\n\nI’m early, but the pain is loud, emotional, and daily.

Created a simple landing page explaining the problem and the proposed solution.\n\n\n\nAdded an email signup for early access. Then focused on getting organic traffic to see if anyone would actually sign up.\n\n\n\nStarted with SEO foundation because paid social traffic disappears the moment you stop spending.\n\n\n\nNeeded a channel that would compound over time instead of requiring constant cash.\n\n\n\nUsed [directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the landing page to 200+ startup and product directories so the domain would have some authority.\n\n\n\nWeek one and two looked like nothing was happening. A few directory listings went live but no traffic. This is the scary part of organic validation because you're not getting the immediate feedback that paid ads provide.\n\n\n\nWeek three is when Search Console started showing the domain getting crawled more frequently. Published 3 blog posts targeting problem-based searches related to the startup idea. Not promotional content, just helpful posts about the problem space.\n\n\n\nWeek four through eight the traffic started building. Domain authority went from zero to 18. Started ranking for longtail keywords around the problem I was solving. Traffic hit 500 organic visitors and I had 40 email signups from people who found the landing page through search.\n\n\n\nThe validation part worked better than expected. These 40 people didn't stumble onto the page through an ad, they actively searched for solutions to this problem. That's way stronger signal than paid traffic where people click out of curiosity but don't actually care.\n\n\n\nHad conversations with 15 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried. All of this validation happened without spending anything on ads.\n\n\n\nThe startup idea lesson: organic distribution takes longer to build but gives you better validation data. People finding you through search have real intent. They're actively looking for solutions right now, not just casually browsing their feed.\n\n\n\nIf you're validating a startup idea and have more time than money, build organic channels first. It's slower but the signal quality is higher and the distribution keeps working even when you're not actively promoting.\n\n\n\nSmall advice, from founder to founder -\n\n\n\nStop chasing AI trends.\n\n\n\nBuild for problems that existed before AI:\n\n\n\n* people want to look good,\n* people want to make money,\n* people want to be productive,\n* people want to remember things,\n* people want to eat better,\n* people want better relationships,\n\n\n\nAI is just the tool.\n\n\n\nThe problem is timeless.\n\n\n\nNobody pays for \"AI features\"\n\n\n\nThey pay to fix their actual life.\n\n\n\nPick a real problem.\n\n\n\nAdd AI to solve it faster.",

I am currently building a few small but very different projects, mostly as experiments around expression, focus, and simplicity.\n\nThe main one is [prakakura](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prakakura.twa)\nIt is an anonymous canvas where people can leave short messages or longer journal entries. The idea is to create a quiet space for expression without likes, comments, or public validation. Recently I have been experimenting with retention by adding private “resonances,” which are short messages readers can send to journal writers that only the writer can see. No ads, no feeds, just expression and subtle human connection.\n\nThe second project is [dhuwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhuwa.twa)\nDhuwa is a mindful smoking reduction app, focused more on awareness than pressure to quit instantly.\n\nThe third project is https://onemovepuzzle.com.\nThis is a small logic puzzle game built around a single move mechanic. It is more playful than the other two and was built as an experiment in focus and constraint. One problem, one move, no distractions.\n\nNone of these are polished startups. They are all evolving through daily iterations and real user behavior. I am especially interested in how people interact with products that are emotional, quiet, or intentionally minimal.\n\nIf you are building something similar or have thoughts on retention without ads or social mechanics, I would love to hear your perspective.\n\nThanks for reading.",

We spent 6 months adding every feature we thought was \"essential\":\n\n* Fancy dashboard \n* 15+ integrations \n* Custom workflows \n* Beautiful onboarding \n\nTotal paying customers after 6 months: 0\n\nWe had 200+ signups. People would try it, say \"this is cool,\" and never come back.\n\nThe turning point came when I was manually doing customer development calls (should've done this from day 1). One engineering lead said something that hit hard:\n\n\"I don't need another dashboard. I need something that actually closes my Jira tickets while I sleep.\"\n\nThat one sentence changed everything.\n\nWe stripped out 70% of what we built. Focused on ONE thing: take a ticket, understand the codebase, submit a PR. That's it.\n\nWhat happened next:\n\n* First paying customer within 2 weeks\n* 5 more in the next month\n* Now at $2k MRR (small but real)\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n1. \"Cool\" ≠ valuable. People don't pay for cool. They pay for time saved.\n2. Talk to users before you build. I know everyone says this. I thought I was different. I wasn't.\n3. Narrow > Wide. Doing one thing exceptionally beats doing ten things okay.\n4. Your first 10 customers are hiding in conversations, not ads. Every early customer came from Reddit, Discord, or direct outreach.\n\nStill early and still figuring things out. But the difference between 0 customers and 5 customers feels massive mentally.\n\nFor those who've been through this: What was the moment you realized you were building the wrong thing? And how did you pivot without losing momentum?\n\n",

I almost cried lol.\n\nBackstory: I built this cause I was tired of buying productivity books and retaining nothing. Spent money on courses I never finished. My brain just cant handle long content anymore.\n\nSo I made a 2-min micro-learning app that teaches meta life skills. Communication, confidence, decision making, career growth - stuff you need everyday but nobody teaches.\n\nThe difference is it explains the psychology FIRST (why you procrastinate, why you avoid conflict) then gives you solutions. \n\nSo you actually understand whats happening instead of just following tips.\n\nLaunched last month. Got a few paid users. Now I need to know if this is actually valuable or if I just got lucky.\n\nBig ask: Would love if you guys could download it and leave honest App Store reviews. Need real feedback from people who aren't my friends lol.\n\nGood reviews, bad reviews, whatever - I just need data to know if I should keep building this or pivot.\n\nLink in comments.

On the technical side, outside of coding, you have testing (so that you can verify everything works, and the project is maintainable) and devops (deploying your code where people can use it). Coding your app is about 1/5th of the technical side. The technical side is half the game. That's why you have a CEO and a CTO. The other half is business. The business side includes validation and marketing.\n\nI just want to help you put it in perspective.\n\nMy playbook is to first validate the idea to some degree - do similar things exist and how much competition is there. If they exist, then you can research those companies and get an objective idea money and effort wise.\n\nIf you think there's a gap \\*and it's something you're interested in pursuing\\* (who's motivated to do something they aren't interested in?), then you build a website that is just a single page - it should describe your \"thing\" and what it does. It should have a \"register interest\" form which is a great proxy for whether or not there is interest. This should cost you about $10-20 at this point.\n\nThen, you find your community and you get involved - talk to people, see what they think, revisit your assumptions and refine your idea.\n\nThen once you have a solid idea of \\*what\\* to build, you setup your code environment with git, linting rules and a CI/CD pipeline. You write tests for what you thing should be doing, then you build that functionality and document it. Then you lint, then you add to git, and viola - it's online.",

Paying someone to interview people can work, but only if they talk to the exact buyer and ask uncomfortable questions about money and switching costs. Most validation stops at opinions.\n\nThe hard part is not the calls. It’s hearing I wouldn’t pay for that and not rationalizing it away. I’d still do a lightweight version myself first. Ten short conversations beats any report.\n\nWhat were people actually doing instead of your product when you ran the ads?",

          "text": "I have experienced both skipping validation and over-correcting, and the uncomfortable truth I landed on is: outsourcing validation only works if you already know what “good signals” look like. \\~ \n\nPaying someone $1K to talk to users saves time but does not eliminate the core risk of misinterpreting polite interest as demand. Many validation reports return “people liked it” or “they’d maybe pay,” which sets you up for a build trap without fail.\n\nWhat I would do now as a default (and wish I would’ve done instead).\n\nI cannot escape a more strict validation loop. \n\n1. You should make users signup for a behavior not an opinion. For example, create an email signup with a promise, a pre-order, or a “join waitlist for $X”. Even a fake Stripe link tells you more than interviews.\n\n2. Use one channel for one person, not broadly find people. Choose a platform where they regularly express their complaints, such as Reddit, Slack groups, or niche Twitter.\n\n3. Say the price before the pitch. Anyone who stays engaged after that is signal.\n\n4. Cap the experiment. Seven to ten days, fixed effort. You cease if nothing moves.\n\nCan you outsource part of this?  Certainly! I take thorough notes when I recruit people. However, I would still allow you to frame, question and make decisions.\n\nIt hurts when your ads fail, but at least they gave you a clear answer. Validation is more affordable, but only when it is formulated to conduct a “yes or no” test rather than a vibe check.",

Free advice: Do a competitive analysis of all direct competitors, substitutes and alternatives. I use a mindmap to do so. I put the three major messages on their website in blocks under each one. Strategy is usually communicated via messaging. How is your strategy differentiated? How does that play out in product. Also, do a 'brand ladder' or other simiilar analysis. Deeply interrogate your ideal customer and what their pain is and isn't. Who are they? What are their affinities and psychology? Etc.

The idea is to combine the convenience of Facebook Marketplace with better trust, cleaner UX, and features that actually help people find what they need instead of endlessly scrolling.\n\nCore features today:\n• Post items to sell, rent, or lend\n• A “Seek” system where users post what they’re looking for and local supply comes to them\n• Local discovery instead of algorithm spam\n• Built-in chat and safety-focused controls\n\nThe product is built and evolving quickly. If you’re open to it, I’m happy to share the pitch deck and give a short walkthrough.\n\n[Download](https://brrowapp.com/download) on the app store.",
