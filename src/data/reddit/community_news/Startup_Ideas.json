      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool [Brandled ](https://brandled.app/)(helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR.\n\nThen I became obsessed with one question: what separates SaaS products that make it from those that die at zero.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole. Studied 47 founders who went from $0 to $10k+ MRR in the last year. Watched their podcasts, red their tweets, and everything i could get my hands on.\n\nHere's what I learned from all of them, and what I was doing catastrophically wrong.\n\n**1. Frictionless signup isn't optional**\n\nEvery successful product had one-click social login. Google OAuth mostly.\n\nThe ones that died had email verification flows, password requirements, multi-step forms asking questions before showing any value.\n\nThe math is brutal. If you lose 30% of people at signup and you're getting 1000 visitors a month, that's 300 potential customers gone. At a 10% trial-to-paid conversion, that's 30 paying customers per month lost to signup friction alone.\n\nI started with magic link only. Completion rate was 45%. Added Google login. Jumped to 78% the next day.\n\nEvery percentage point of friction at signup costs you real revenue. Most founders don't even measure this.\n\n**2. They launched in weeks, not months**\n\nNone of them spent 6 months building in secret.\n\nAverage time from idea to first paying customer: 3-6 weeks. They launched with ONE core feature. Then spent most of their time marketing it.\n\nI did the opposite. Spent 3 months building features before launching. Content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, everything. Got 12 signups. Zero paying customers.\n\nConvinced myself the product wasn't good enough. Spent another month adding features. Still nothing.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. Nobody knew it existed.\n\nAfter I stopped building and started marketing, posting on Reddit, doing LinkedIn outreach, documenting on X, I hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nSame product. Different approach.\n\nPost-launch is 90% marketing, 10% product.\n\n**3. They were shameless about promotion**\n\nThe successful ones talked about their product everywhere. Not spammy. Just never hiding it.\n\nReddit threads. Twitter replies. Forum comments. Anywhere their audience hung out.\n\nThey'd give genuinely helpful advice first, then naturally mention their tool when relevant.\n\nStarted being shameless. Every relevant conversation where someone complained about the problem I solved, I'd help them first, then mention I built something for this.\n\nA few people definitely get mad but I feel the upside is worth it.\n\nYour product won't discover itself.\n\n**4. They asked churned users what went wrong**\n\nEvery successful product had a system for this. Automated email going out when someone cancels asking what didn't work.\n\nI was doing none of this. Saw cancellations in Stripe, felt rejected, moved on. Never asked why. Never learned anything.\n\nNow every cancelled user gets emails through and automated email sequence and the replies are done by me personally.\n\nResponse rate is 40%. The feedback is literally gold.\n\nEvery single one is fixable. But I only learned because I asked.\n\nChurned users tell you the real truth about your product.\n\n**5. They used their own product religiously**\n\nNot one successful founder was building something they didn't use daily. They were their own heaviest users.\n\nI wasn't doing this. Used my tool occasionally to \"test\" but wasn't relying on it daily.\n\nForced myself to create all my content through my own product for a week. Found 7 bugs in 30 minutes that never showed up in testing.\n\nGenerate button didn't work on mobile. Analytics took 8 seconds to load. Onboarding skipped steps if you refreshed.\n\nMy users were experiencing this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nIf you're not using your product daily as a real user, you're building blind.\n\n**6. They fixed retention before scaling acquisition**\n\nBiggest strategic difference.\n\nFailed products: 30-50% monthly churn, constantly chasing new users to replace ones leaving.\n\nSuccessful products: Fixed retention first, got churn to 10-20%, then scaled acquisition.\n\nThe math: At 40% churn, you acquire 40 customers to net 24. At 15% churn, you acquire 40 and net 34. Same effort, 42% better results.\n\nI was obsessed with new signups. Ignored my 40% churn rate. Got 10 new customers, lost 4. Net: 6.\n\nStopped all acquisition. Fixed onboarding from 8 steps to 3. Added email sequences. Built features retained users asked for. Churn dropped to 15%.\n\nSame acquisition effort, now net 8-9 customers instead of 6.\n\nRetention is the foundation. Acquisition is the multiplier.\n\n**7. They shipped MVPs with one feature**\n\nEvery successful product launched stupidly lean. One core feature done exceptionally well.\n\nI launched with 7 features: content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, SWOT, comments, hashtags.\n\nCodebase was a nightmare. Users were confused. I was maintaining features 3% of users touched.\n\nShould've launched with one thing: AI content that sounds human. Made that 10x better. Everything else later based on what paying customers asked for.\n\nYour MVP should make people say \"this solves my exact problem\" even if ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, so many features\" while solving nothing particularly well.\n\n**8. They priced based on value, not competition**\n\nNone of them raced to the bottom on pricing.\n\nThey looked at the value delivered. Hours saved. Revenue generated. Pain eliminated.\n\nThen priced a fraction of that value.\n\nI priced at $19/month because competitors were at $29-39. Thought I'd win on price. Just looked cheap and inferior.\n\nNeeded 263 customers to hit $5k MRR at $19 versus only 128 at $39.\n\nRaised price to $29-39. Conversions didn't drop. They improved slightly.\n\nHigher price signaled solving a valuable problem.\n\nPeople who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers. They'll churn for anything $3 cheaper.\n\n**9. They automated relationship building**\n\nEvery successful product had email sequences from day one. Not promotional. Actual value and engagement.\n\nWelcome emails. Feature education. Check-ins. Re-engagement for quiet users. Win-back for churned users.\n\nI was sending nothing after signup. Users signed up, got busy, forgot, churned.\n\nEngagement doesn't happen by accident. You engineer it.\n\n**10. They validated with money, not words**\n\nThe problem with feedback: it's free. People say nice things because it costs them nothing.\n\nI built features based on \"that would be helpful\" comments from users who weren't even paying. Wasted weeks on features nobody used.\n\nNow I only build what paying customers explicitly request.\n\nMoney is the only validation that matters. Words are cheap. Credit card numbers are truth.\n\n**The one thing they all had**\n\nThey didn't quit when it felt hopeless.\n\nThey all hit $0 for months. Got depressed. Questioned everything. Wanted to shut it down.\n\nBut didn't.\n\nThe difference between $0 and success wasn't talent or luck. It was not quitting before they figured out what works.\n\n90% of SaaS products die not because they couldn't work. Because the founder quit too early.\n\nIf you're stuck at $0, study the people who've made it. Not the outliers. The normal founders who went from $0 to $10k.\n\nThey're not special. They just did specific things that compound and didn't quit when it got hard.\n\nThe playbook is right there. You just have to execute it.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this.",

They also completely disregard SMEs and purely offer entreprise packages.\n\nWe're building the platform that tells you whether or not your post is compliant in seconds.

And while everyone's focused on huge marketing agencies and firms, we want to give the small guys the peace of mind when they post their next Black Friday special.\n\nI'm a Technical Product Manager at a recently funded Series A Startup in the middle east that's making accounting and tax compliance easy for SMEs.

Founders post what they’re building + the next concrete deliverable; investors back execution, not vibes.\n\n**Why now:** AI is creating a surge of solo/bootstrapped founders who can ship real MVPs fast — but pre-seed fundraising is still slow, gated, and increasingly bimodal. On the investor side, more people want to invest earlier (operators, founders, eventually retail), and small checks let them build diversified portfolios of high-upside bets instead of needing to “lead or pass.”\n\n**What’s different:** we’re not another startup directory — the core unit is a **milestone** (clear scope + timeline + amount). Founders share progress as they ship, building credibility in public. That gives investors a feed of **proven execution**, not just ideas. Then we surface the **hottest + most reliable** startups based on each investor’s criteria — basically Tinder for startups/investors, but with the heavy lifting: early signal + lightweight diligence baked in.\n\n**Who it’s for:**\n\n* Founders who move fast and want oxygen to ship\n* Micro-investors who want early access + direct relationships\n* VCs who want the earliest execution-driven funnel before the round is “priced in\"\n\n\\---\n\nWe’re a senior SF-based team of ex-founders and tech execs building this.",

Sharing three early stage products I’m actively working on.\n\nDhuwa.com\nDhuwa is a mindful quitting platform for smoking and other impulsive habits. It focuses on awareness and understanding triggers rather than streak pressure, fear, or guilt.\nThis idea comes directly from my own struggle with impulsive behaviors. Most habit apps felt mechanical and shame driven.\n\nDhuwa is designed to help people slow down, observe urges, and build self trust instead of fighting themselves.\n\nStatus: early prototype and concept validation. Clear path toward subscriptions, wellness partnerships, and behavior change programs.\n\nOneMovePuzzle.com\nOne Move Puzzle is a minimal logic game where each level has a single perfect solution. It is simple to understand, deeply satisfying to solve, and designed for high replayability.\nI built it as a response to attention draining games. This format works extremely well for short form content, daily challenges, and viral distribution, with monetization through ads, premium levels, and sponsorships.\n\nStatus: playable MVP is live with strong early engagement from testers.\n\nPrakakura.com\nPrakakura is an anonymous public canvas where people can leave messages that live permanently on a shared digital space. Think of it as digital graffiti for thoughts, gratitude, grief, and human presence.\n\nThis project is deeply personal. It came from periods of loss, failure, and instability where expression mattered more than visibility or likes. The platform is live, has real users, and an Android app is already published. Payments are not enabled yet, but the engagement and emotional resonance are strong.\n\nFounder background\nI come from a growth and paid advertising background and have worked on multiple products across marketing and tech. I left my job to build independently, tried a physical business that failed, went through financial pressure, and kept building anyway. I’m technical, product focused, and very distribution aware.\n\nI’m not testing ideas for fun. I’m committed to building long term and would love to explore alignment if Forum supports founders with strong narratives, execution bias, and unconventional products.\n\nHappy to share metrics or continue the conversation over DM.\nPrabin",

Like, January 2024 beats January 2023, February 2024 beats February 2023, and that just keeps going for years. Which is... actually quite rare when you look at the data.\n\n# The opportunities with proper multi-year streaks:\n\nAI jingle generator - 480 searches/month, 36-month growth streak,  This one's been beating the previous year every single month since late 2021. Podcasters and YouTubers need intros, and apparently this is a real enough problem that it's sustained for 3 years straight.\n\nAI prompt maker - 480 searches/month, 36-month streak, Meta-tool for helping people use AI better. I don't know much space / innovation there is left in this space.\n\nVoice to notes AI - 90 searches/month, 31-month streak,  Small numbers but 31 consecutive months of year-over-year growth. Still thinking as a society we're getting use to voice input potentially being a productivity move.\n\n# The year+ climbers:\n\nAI grading app - 480 searches/month, 14-month streak, Teachers hate grading. This is boring utility software that just keeps climbing.\n\nAI study guide generator - 720 searches/month, 15-month streak Students always need study help - clear use case, predictable demand.\n\nNewer but consistent:\n\nAI release notes generator - 140 searches/month, Every dev team hates writing these. Too boring for big AI companies to care about, which is probably why it's still got room.\n\nAI cash flow forecasting - 30 searches/month, $80.12 CPC This one's wild - only 30 monthly searches, but companies are paying $80 per click.\n\n# Why I think these matter:\n\nSmall search numbers might actually be the point here. You're building for 50-500 searches/month in niches that aren't interesting enough for well-funded startups to chase (which means you can actually get traction without competing with venture-backed teams).\n\nIf you want to see the full dataset, I'll leave it in the comments.",

The niches that converted for me had two additional characteristics.\n\nIncluded in an existing workflow (grading, release notes, cash flow). There's no need to teach it again if it happens weekly.\n\nWork that is bothersome. Bright people gladly outsource those things they dislike (grading, intros, forecasting) even when the tool is “boring”.\n\nI would play safe.\n\nAn AI prompt maker feels like a meta tool and is less willing to pay. People show interest but they churn fast once they ‘get it.\n\nWhile I enjoy the idea of voice to notes, I’d want to validate where it lives (meetings, field work, therapy notes) before building any generic solution.\n\nTo me, the most interesting is AI release notes. Small in stature but great on impact, often brightly colored! That generally refers to budgets and repeated use.\n\n\"Here’s a quick validation hack that’s worked for me in similar niches.\"\n\nDon't inquire whether one would utilize this. ”.\n\nWhat will break if this doesn’t get done this week?”.\n\nIf the response is \"nothing\", it is probably a nice to have. \n\nYou know you have a real wedge if you hear “customers complain / boss asks / compliance issue.\n\nI’d be curious to learn if you looked at who is searching (solo vs teams), or just raw volume?

We spent 6 months adding every feature we thought was \"essential\":\n\n* Fancy dashboard \n* 15+ integrations \n* Custom workflows \n* Beautiful onboarding \n\nTotal paying customers after 6 months: 0\n\nWe had 200+ signups. People would try it, say \"this is cool,\" and never come back.\n\nThe turning point came when I was manually doing customer development calls (should've done this from day 1). One engineering lead said something that hit hard:\n\n\"I don't need another dashboard. I need something that actually closes my Jira tickets while I sleep.\"\n\nThat one sentence changed everything.\n\nWe stripped out 70% of what we built. Focused on ONE thing: take a ticket, understand the codebase, submit a PR. That's it.\n\nWhat happened next:\n\n* First paying customer within 2 weeks\n* 5 more in the next month\n* Now at $2k MRR (small but real)\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n1. \"Cool\" ≠ valuable. People don't pay for cool. They pay for time saved.\n2. Talk to users before you build. I know everyone says this. I thought I was different. I wasn't.\n3. Narrow > Wide. Doing one thing exceptionally beats doing ten things okay.\n4. Your first 10 customers are hiding in conversations, not ads. Every early customer came from Reddit, Discord, or direct outreach.\n\nStill early and still figuring things out. But the difference between 0 customers and 5 customers feels massive mentally.\n\nFor those who've been through this: What was the moment you realized you were building the wrong thing?

We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

On the technical side, outside of coding, you have testing (so that you can verify everything works, and the project is maintainable) and devops (deploying your code where people can use it). Coding your app is about 1/5th of the technical side. The technical side is half the game. That's why you have a CEO and a CTO. The other half is business. The business side includes validation and marketing.\n\nI just want to help you put it in perspective.\n\nMy playbook is to first validate the idea to some degree - do similar things exist and how much competition is there. If they exist, then you can research those companies and get an objective idea money and effort wise.\n\nIf you think there's a gap \\*and it's something you're interested in pursuing\\* (who's motivated to do something they aren't interested in?), then you build a website that is just a single page - it should describe your \"thing\" and what it does. It should have a \"register interest\" form which is a great proxy for whether or not there is interest. This should cost you about $10-20 at this point.\n\nThen, you find your community and you get involved - talk to people, see what they think, revisit your assumptions and refine your idea.\n\nThen once you have a solid idea of \\*what\\* to build, you setup your code environment with git, linting rules and a CI/CD pipeline. You write tests for what you thing should be doing, then you build that functionality and document it. Then you lint, then you add to git, and viola - it's online.",

Many validation reports return “people liked it” or “they’d maybe pay,” which sets you up for a build trap without fail.\n\nWhat I would do now as a default (and wish I would’ve done instead).\n\nI cannot escape a more strict validation loop. \n\n1. You should make users signup for a behavior not an opinion. For example, create an email signup with a promise, a pre-order, or a “join waitlist for $X”. Even a fake Stripe link tells you more than interviews.\n\n2. Use one channel for one person, not broadly find people. Choose a platform where they regularly express their complaints, such as Reddit, Slack groups, or niche Twitter.\n\n3. Say the price before the pitch. Anyone who stays engaged after that is signal.\n\n4. Cap the experiment. Seven to ten days, fixed effort. You cease if nothing moves.\n\nCan you outsource part of this?  Certainly! I take thorough notes when I recruit people. However, I would still allow you to frame, question and make decisions.\n\nIt hurts when your ads fail, but at least they gave you a clear answer. Validation is more affordable, but only when it is formulated to conduct a “yes or no” test rather than a vibe check.",

I grew it to over 700 users simply by posting updates about it here on Reddit. There was only one thing casting a bit of a shadow on it: Lots of people would sign up but never actually upload an app or test another app. On top of that, I didn't have much time during the Christmas Holidays and so I didn't post for like two to three weeks and the platform basically went dead to the point where there were only like 10-20 visitors per day.\n\nHowever, to understand how I brought back life to the platform, you need to first understand how the platform works:\n\n* You can **earn credits** by testing indie apps (fun + you help other makers)\n* You can **use credits to get your own app tested by real people**\n* No fake accounts -> all testers are **real users**\n* Test more apps -> earn more credits -> your app will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users\n\nIt's called IndieAppCircle and you can check it out here: [https://www.indieappcircle.com/](https://www.indieappcircle.com/)\n\nAs a first step, I disabled the shop so now people can't buy credits anymore but they have to earn them which actually led to more testing engagement. Also, I implemented lots of small new features that were suggested under my posts and people instantly noticed and thanked me for it. Like for example being able to sort the apps by newness.\n\nI'm really curious where this will go. Of course, I currently don't earn any money but that's fine because I want to treat this more like a learning journey and I think the platform is more valuable for users and that will pay off in the long run!\n\nI would appreciate your feedback in the comments!

      "text": "I’ve spent a long time reading and observing startup discussions in Indian communities, and this post is not meant to discourage anyone. It’s simply an attempt to share patterns I’ve repeatedly seen, including mistakes I’ve personally made and learned from.\n\nMany startup ideas here are genuinely well intentioned, but they often come from a fixed-salary mindset rather than a business mindset. You can see this in how people approach risk, capital, and timelines. There is a strong desire to minimize uncertainty, start with almost no investment, and reach predictable income quickly. That’s understandable, especially given economic pressure, but it often clashes with how real businesses actually work.\n\nMost ideas are shaped by exposure rather than deep problem ownership. Engineers build tools similar to what they used at work. Professionals try to “simplify” platforms they interacted with. This isn’t wrong, but without strong domain depth or direct customer pain, these ideas struggle to move beyond prototypes.\n\nAnother common pattern is confusing online content consumption with market research. Reading Reddit posts, LinkedIn threads, or startup Twitter can be informative, but it doesn’t replace talking to customers, hearing objections, discussing pricing, or understanding buying behavior. Real research often feels uncomfortable and slow, which is why many people unconsciously avoid it.\n\nWhen ideas don’t work out, people often conclude that startups are not for everyone or that business is mostly luck. While those statements are partially true, they sometimes prevent deeper reflection on execution, sales effort, and cash flow planning.\n\nInterestingly, some of the most reliable businesses in India are not considered “startup ideas” at all. Sales operations, customer support services, call centers, compliance and back-office services continue to exist because they solve ongoing problems and generate consistent cash flow. They may not feel exciting, but they are grounded in demand.\n\nNone of this means app or SaaS ideas are bad. Many succeed. But they succeed when they are backed by patience, capital, sales capability, and willingness to adapt to reality rather than protect comfort.\n\nThis post isn’t about right or wrong choices. Employment is a valid path. Business is a different one. Confusion happens when we mix expectations from one world into the other.\n\nIf this helps even one person think more clearly before investing time or money, it has done its job.",

Got a few paid users. Now I need to know if this is actually valuable or if I just got lucky.\n\nBig ask: Would love if you guys could download it and leave honest App Store reviews. Need real feedback from people who aren't my friends lol.\n\nGood reviews, bad reviews, whatever - I just need data to know if I should keep building this or pivot.\n\nLink in comments. Appreciate anyone who takes the time.",
