Let's assume this is your expertise and that you have the competencies. Look around: what do you see? A lot of paperwork, expensive drugs, insurance companies refusing to pay... Write down what you're unhappy with. Then ask people (doctors or patients—it depends on what you wrote down) if they perceive this as a problem? Are they willing to pay for its solution? If so, congratulations. You've passed the first level. \n\nI'm ready to look at your list of problems and help you move on to the second level :)",

That means there are millions of problems on Reddit\n\nThe number of people in each subreddit means the number of people seeking solutions, note these numbers are crazy large in some sub reddits and small in others(that tells you how high the demand for the solution of the problem is)\n\nNow imagine this, extrapolate each of those subreddit(problems), and people on them as people seeking solutions. Now imagine how many people that not on Reddit but have the problems of the subreddit(the rest of country or the world). That's a large audience \n\nNow use Google to find people looking for the main topic of each subreddit(example r/side hustle) Google \"I need a side hustle\" or \"looking for a side hustle\" \n\nNow you have problems to solve and people who are looking for solutions to that problem",

Startups are NOT for everyone, even though they’ve become a “fancy” thing to do.\n\nMost people who want to do startups approach it the wrong way. \nReal entrepreneurs usually never set out to “do a startup”. They were passionate about creating or obsessed with solving a problem and eventually realized they had no choice but to build something.\n\nSo shift your mindset. Ask yourself: can you create something people want or solve a real problem, preferably in a domain you understand? \nIf yes, just build a solution. Forget “startup”. Do not overthink. Just create a product.\n\nIf it works, great. Then evaluate milestones carefully and grow from there. If it doesn’t, you’ll still learn something valuable. You may discover that startups are not for you, but indie hacking, freelancing, or an agency model might be.\n\nDo not draw conclusions first and then try to justify them backwards. Do what you can do now, and let the journey unfold naturally.",

      "text": "If you're looking for a sweaty startup to acquire rather than start from scratch, moving companies are insanely undervalued right now. Why? Most moving companies are run by guys who are GREAT at moving furniture but absolutely clueless about business fundamentals. I'm talking no real bookkeeping, zero marketing beyond a Facebook page, competing on price instead of value, and leaving money on the table everywhere.\n\nBought a struggling 2-truck operation for $45K last year. Owner was doing maybe $120K annual revenue, working 70-hour weeks, ready to quit. I looked under the hood and it was a goldmine of low-hanging fruit:\n\n* Ranked on page 4 of Google (aka invisible)\n* No email follow-up system for quotes\n* Pricing way below market\n* Zero upsells (packing, storage, supplies)\n* Terrible website that screamed \"I made this in 2009\"\n* No tracking of lead sources or conversion rates\n\nBasically printing money if you just ran it like an actual business.\n\nI fixed first (in order of impact) - marketing was the biggest lever. Most movers think Craigslist posts and yard signs are \"marketing.\" Nah. I partnered with [mover marketing AI](https://www.movermarketing.ai)  to handle SEO and Google Business Profile optimization - within 5 months we were ranking top 3 in the Map Pack. Lead volume went from maybe 20/month to 60+/month. That alone changed everything.\n\n\\+ implemented proper CRM, automated quote follow-ups, raised prices 25% (lost zero customers), added packing services as default upsells, hired better and paid more to retain good crews.\n\nCurrent numbers (month 16):\n\n* Revenue: $1.2M annualized\n* Profit margin: 18% (up from like 8%)\n* Working maybe 20 hours/week on the business\n* Listed it for sale last month at $380K\n\nAnd this works cause moving has high demand, low barrier to entry means lots of poorly-run companies to acquire cheap, and the fixes are straightforward if you know basic business principles. You're not reinventing the wheel - just applying competence to an industry that lacks it.\n\nYou gotta be willing to get your hands dirty initially. I drove trucks for the first 3 months to understand operations before delegating. Can't fix what you don't understand.\n\nAnyone else doing acquisition plays in traditional service industries? Feels like there's gold everywhere if you know where to look.",

I am good with anything tech-related and can probably build quite anything with a little bit of time, app, saas, cybersecurity, CAD, AI pipeline/fine tune... (except obviously high cost technologies like building my own AI model) not to the level of a professional specialized developer but still enough for most cases. I think where I am the best is with science related things like maths, particle physics, mechanics, medicine, biology, finance... I consider that I have a very broad understanding of these disciplines, which let me learn specific subject deeply quite fast, I'm used to learning from the last research papers and applying to real world problems. I think however that while not being awful (I had an e-com business few years ago that was working great) I'm generally not good at prospection, marketing, communication, management... Still something I could do if needed.\n\nI am very motivated and willing to spend all the time and motivation I have on a startup as an associate figuring out and building solutions to real world problems with little means. The only thing I ask is someone in the same mindset, serious and really passionate about his project. If you need anyone, let's talk about it.\n\nEdit : As some people won't believe me when I saw famous uni, fuck my privacy, I'm at EPFL/ETHZ",

      "text": "Startup founder sharing unconventional timing strategy that worked. Started building backlinks and SEO foundation 90 days before product launch instead of waiting until launch day. Result was launching with 840 monthly organic visitors and DA 29 ready to convert versus competitors launching to empty room. The strategic insight was inverting typical startup timeline. Most founders perfect product then start distribution. But SEO takes 90-120 days to show results regardless of product quality. If we built backlink foundation during final beta months we'd have both ready simultaneously instead of launching then spending 4 months building distribution from zero.\n\nDay 1 of 90-day pre-launch period started SEO work. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to establish domain authority through 200+ placements. Published 3 foundational posts targeting buyer-intent keywords. Set up Analytics and Search Console. Domain authority: 0→11 in first 30 days.\n\nDays 1-45 built content library while finishing product. Published 12 blog posts total targeting problem-aware searches and comparison keywords. Domain authority reached 21 as directory backlinks indexed. Getting 240 monthly organic visitors to pre-launch landing page collecting 34 email signups.\n\nDays 46-90 showed acceleration into launch. Published 8 more posts (20 total). Updated earlier content with examples. Domain authority hit 29. Getting 840 monthly organic visitors. Collected 87 email signups from organic traffic. Ranking for 38 keywords with 14 in top 20 positions.\n\nLaunch day results showed advantage of pre-launch SEO. Had 840 monthly organic visitors ready to convert immediately, 87 waitlist signups from organic traffic to activate day one, domain authority 29 giving credibility for partnerships and press, ranking foundation for 38 keywords to optimize and scale.\n\nPost-launch month one hit $4200 MRR with 58% from organic versus competitors spending $8K+ on ads for similar revenue. The 90-day head start meant we were profitable month one while they burned cash catching up on distribution they should've built pre-launch.\n\nInvestment over 90 days was minimal. GetMoreBacklinks $127 one-time, hosting $18 monthly ($54 total), tools $35 monthly ($105 total), total $286 to establish foundation generating 840 monthly visitors. Compare to paid ads at $4-8 per visitor meaning $3360-6720 ad spend for same traffic. What worked specifically for pre-launch SEO was directory submissions establishing DA 0 to 21 in 45 days, publishing consistently even though product wasn't ready, targeting buyer-intent keywords showing commercial intent, collecting emails from organic visitors building launch list, optimizing for conversion since traffic was limited.\n\nFor other startups the playbook is start building backlinks 90 days before launch not after, use final beta period to establish domain authority and content, publish 15-20 posts targeting buyer keywords before launch, collect emails from organic traffic building launch audience, and launch with distribution ready not scrambling to build it. The mistake most startups make is sequential timeline: build product then distribution. Reality is both should happen in parallel. The 90-120 day SEO timeline fits perfectly with final beta phase. Starting early means launching with customers not launching to silence hoping to figure out distribution later when runway is burning.",

      "text": "One thing I didn’t expect when working on an early-stage startup was how much time naming and basic branding could consume. The product direction was clear, but choosing a name that felt distinctive, matched the vision, and wasn’t immediately blocked by domain issues turned into a bigger bottleneck than expected.\n\nI noticed that when naming, domain checks, and visual identity are handled separately, it’s easy to get stuck in endless loops of second-guessing. Seeing everything together seems to help some founders commit faster. I came across tools like BrandScoop that bundle name ideas with domain availability and basic visual direction, which made me think more about *process* than any specific tool.\n\nFor those who’ve been through this phase already: do you prioritize speed and iterate later, or do you believe getting naming and branding mostly right early on saves time downstream? I’d be interested in how different teams approach this tradeoff.",

I want to make money, not a little, as much as I can. I thought about starting a startup, but I feel like it’s a bit too complicated for the first thing that I build on my own and I thought i need at least a bit of experience in this world. I thought about reselling on Vinted etc, but never really got motivated. Seo/ smma seems like a good first job, I would do everting on my own I’m pretty good in tech and I could even code the websites (if needed) on my own. Idk, I just want to achieve that dream I just have to start, I don’t know where tho. Can someone help me? How did you start? How did you create a profitable business? What would you say it’s the best thing you can do at my age to make as much money as possible as of now? I can code, I’m good in every aspect of informatics/ cyber security, I’m determined and I become easily obsessed with something that I want to achieve. I would love to find people as motivated as me to work together and figure something out. Thanks in advance for your advice",

Hoping that would get ppl to take action.\n\n    Who it's for:\n\n    - Early-stage founders looking for co-founders\n\n    - Technical people wanting a business partner\n\n    - Marketers/Ops folks wanting equity roles\n\n    If you're actively looking for a co-founder (not \"someday\"), give it a try: businesssalonat.com\n\nCurious what you all think — would the timer stress you out or help you take action?",

If this is for serious founders or prospective founders, isn’t safe to assume people will be serious and won’t be ghosting people? \n\nI only checked out your website very quickly but a few notes: \n\n- I think it’s a solid idea. I can’t see what a profile would look like because I don’t see anyone there yet of course. So how are people going to promote themselves? what level of details are they to go into to share experience levels and background? \n\n- what makes people want to use this over LinkedIn? Or Y-combinator matching or cofounderslab? It felt like maybe that was the 72 hours idea but if you were to ask me I’d sometimes go more than 3 days without replying to an email let alone a match. \n\nOther less important but good to point out: \n\n- the name is difficult in particular the URL having 3 same letters in a row. This is not very common and that’s cause it leads to human errors. \n\n- Orange and white are typically colours associated with a cheap/bargain feeling. I assume for a platform like this that’s not the feeling you wanna give. \n\nJust a few of my notes.",

I tried to build and ship as fast as I can without building too much features its basically an MVP .   \nI always felt like LinkedIn is for career networking t’s noisy, incentives are misaligned (status, hiring, sales), and outreach is basically cold email with a nicer UI and I wanted to a **high-intent environment .** and as for YC and cofounderslab I plan to keep this free with a direct-path to first call. you made a good point regarding the time limit but it gets lifted once the 2 users exchange one msg . my assumption is serious founders who are actively looking will not waste time to connect or if they need to a lil push to connect would be enough .   \nYes I am aware of the current URL 3 letters flag and will be looking into options if this idea started getting traction with ppl .   \nthank you so much for your feedback once again",

I keep thinking about that system but for real human connection.\n\nWhat if you could open an app at any time, see who’s available to talk about things you’re actually interested in - startups, entrepreneurship, philosophy, whatever and just connect?\nNot people you know. Not people whose kids’ names you have to remember or who you have to ask about their last vacation. Just someone who shares your interest and is willing to be real.\n\nHot take: I think social media is dying. It’s turned into a 24/7 commercial where everyone’s performing. It’s exhausting.\n\nI think real conversation is about to make a comeback, but it’ll look different with technology. Like that call shadowing system but for connection: see who’s online, what they want to talk about, click, talk.\n\nNo followers, profiles to curate, or pretending. Just: “I want to talk about X with someone right now” → see who’s available → connect for 20 minutes → done.\n\nI want to build this.

Text-based scams work because people have time to craft responses and pretend. On a live call? Much harder to fake.\n\nThere will be some text exchange before the call - you need to know what you’re getting into. But I’m thinking minimal: topic selection, maybe a brief “what do you want to talk about?” Then you connect voice.\n\nOn the AI moderation side - I’m less worried about monitoring calls for scams and more interested in AI helping with better matching. Like, it asks you clarifying questions to get to what you actually want to talk about (not just surface level), then matches you with someone who’s in a similar place.\n\nThe tricky part is the transition: how do you go from “I selected ‘early stage startup idea’” to actually having a deep, meaningful conversation? \n\nI don’t have that figured out yet. Maybe the AI gives each person a brief summary of what the other wants to discuss? Or suggests conversation starters? Open to ideas.\n\nWhat made you think about this problem?",

You’ll never be matched with that person again automatically.\n\n\t3.\tReputation/trust system - like Reddit’s upvote/downvote but for behavior. If multiple people exit calls with you immediately or report you, your account gets flagged/suspended. This discourages people from being creepy because it affects their ability to use the platform.\n\n\t4.\tGradual access - maybe you can’t match immediately on day 1. Need some history/trust built first.\n\n\t5.\tMutual opt-in to reconnect - after a conversation, both people have to choose to connect again. One person can’t force continued contact.\n\nThe goal isn’t perfect security (impossible), but making it annoying enough for bad actors that they go elsewhere while keeping it easy for genuine people. Bad behavior has consequences.\n\nWhat else would make you feel safe using something like this?",

Based on that conversation (word choice, self-awareness, how they articulate problems), AI builds a matching profile.\nThis is similar to how TikTok learns what content you want without you telling it, except it’s learning what kind of PERSON you’d connect with based on how you communicate.\n\nYour event search approach is interesting.

Interests are fractal, and for needs into particular things small differences become chasms.\n\nHow people overcome those chasms is repeat interactions between the same people, which can only be achieved below the Dunbar number. \n\nAside from the fact that even with AI onboarding you won't be able to overcome the density problem of matching people at the exact moment that they want to talk.\n\nAnd that doesn't even mention the fact that people know they're talking to an AI and will lie to an extent, trying to confuse it and to trip up the AI to see if they can push it to say things you don't intend. You might assume that this isn't a problem, those people won't get matched, but:\n\n1. generative AI is not deterministic\n\n2. it's expensive, and these users haven't paid yet. \n\nCustomer service is a cost basis. Companies like the one you work for literally have to pay for it, either a person or an AI. But you're trying to monetise the cost basis after spending the money. That takes a lot of money, because you're banking on enough engagement (cost) to justify investment. \n\nBest case scenario for you is that you manage to stitch it together yourself, like Clubhouse, because you won't find a developer. Ask yourself why Clubhouse didn't do this? Audio social networks have been around for a while now. It's because of the density problem. Clubhouse were new enough that if generative AI made a difference it would have prevented them from failing.\n\nIn my view the only way to solve the loneliness and atomisation pandemic is by bringing people together in physical spaces, using LLMs to aggregate event data, which is then monetised like Substack and Patreon, but for event based creators (artists, teachers, organisers, speakers).",

But you just unlocked a massive B2B angle I hadn’t fully considered.\n\nThink about finding a realtor right now: you see a headshot, a phone number, maybe some reviews. Zero idea if you’ll actually vibe with them. So you either ask friends (limited options) or “date around” meeting 3-4 realtors in person (exhausting and awkward).\nWhat if you could have a 15-minute real-time conversation with available realtors who match your preference’s. Immediately know if they get your communication style, if they listen, if they’re pushy, whatever matters to you.\n\nSame for therapists (people “shop” for therapists constantly), financial advisors, wedding vendors, contractors, business coaches, really any professional service that’s relationship-based. The professional gets qualified leads who already like their vibe. The customer gets to filter for fit before wasting anyone’s time.\n\nIs that what you’re building for realtors? Or are you solving a different connection problem?\n\nAlso, what’s your unpopular programming method? I’m genuinely curious.\n\nYou’ve already helped me see this differently, if you think of more ways to collaborate or have other ideas, definitely let me know. Thanks for engaging!",

More “builder-mode.” In reality it cost months of work building the wrong thing really well. Code wasn’t the problem. Assumptions were.\n\nSecond close one was cheap talent or tools to move faster early. You don’t save money, you just defer the bill with interest. Rewrites, churn, lost trust, missed windows.\n\nThe pattern is pretty consistent. The stuff that feels uncomfortable upfront, talking to users, writing things down, paying for reliability, usually ends up being the cheapest path. The shortcuts mostly just hide the cost until it’s bigger and harder to unwind.",

Every time, the process felt… off.\n\nYou post a requirement.  \nYou get flooded with messages.  \nHalf of them didn’t read the brief.  \nThe other half sent Google Drive links with no context.  \nEveryone immediately asks to move to WhatsApp.\n\nWhat I actually wanted was simple:  \nLet me *see the work*.  \nLet me understand *how they think*.  \nLet me know *who is good at what* before starting a conversation.\n\nBut most platforms are built around proposals, not portfolios. Or they’re built for inspiration, not hiring. So you either get spam or vibes, rarely clarity.\n\nA few of us started talking about this and realized something obvious in hindsight:  \nFor designers, platforms like Dribbble and Behance work because discovery comes first.  \nFor video editors, there isn’t really an equivalent that’s hiring-focused.\n\nSo we started building a small platform where:\n\n* Editors showcase their work properly, not just links dumped in DMs\n* Clients browse portfolios first, then reach out\n* Conversations stay on-platform, without everyone racing to exchange phone numbers\n* No bidding wars, no proposal spam\n\nNot trying to “disrupt” anything. Just trying to remove friction that shouldn’t exist in the first place.\n\nIt’s still early. Rough edges everywhere. A lot to learn.  \nBut the goal is simple: make hiring video editors feel calmer, clearer, and more professional for both sides.\n\nPosting this here mostly to share the idea and hear thoughts.  \nIf you’re an editor or someone who’s hired one before, you probably know the pain points better than anyone.\n\nSometimes the best products come from being quietly annoyed for a very long time.",

      "text": "Hiring still feels very resume and ATS driven. A lot of candidates feel they get filtered out early because of keywords, formatting, or not having the “right” experience on paper, even when they can actually do the job. This seems especially common for entry to mid level roles, career switchers, and self taught folks.\n\nOn the hiring side, recruiters and hiring managers get flooded with resumes. Many are heavily tailored or exaggerated, which makes it hard to quickly tell who’s genuinely capable and who just optimized their resume well. This feels even worse in high volume hiring.\n\nI’m exploring an idea for a skill first hiring platform where resumes aren’t used at the start. Instead, candidates would complete role relevant challenges like problem solving tasks, simulations, or quizzes. Candidates would be anonymous initially, and shortlisting would be based on performance. Resumes or profiles would only be shown later once candidates have already proven their skills.\n\nThe goal is to reduce resume bias, discourage fake or overly optimized resumes, and give capable candidates a fairer shot. This is very early, idea stage only, and I’m trying to validate whether this problem actually matters before building anything.\n\nCompanies would pay to hire through the platform. Candidates wouldn’t pay.\n\nFor people who’ve hired or applied recently, does this problem resonate or am I overestimating how broken resume screening is? Would you trust challenge based shortlisting before seeing resumes, or would you still want resumes upfront? And what would make you not use something like this? Cheating, fairness, stress on candidates, legal issues, time cost, or something else?\n\nLooking for honest and critical feedback. If this is a bad idea, I’d rather hear it now.",

I’m guessing some candidates took longer (like half an hour) to perfect it (but that didn’t make them more likely to pass). I designed my challenges to filter about 50% of candidates who submitted it (and maybe 50% ended up submitting, so this got us down to 25%). These challenges are hard to get right, and were very role specific, so the hard part in my view for you will be figuring out that part. The way I hire, I don’t really care as much about broad skills, so things like “good at Python” (I’m in software engineering) would not matter to me (so general challenges probably won’t work).\n\nAs a candidate I would be incredibly suspicious, but the market is terrible so I would probably do it. Generally these types of challenges are either really time-consuming or just stupid and don’t evaluate skills that I believe actually matter for the role. I took quite a few testgorilla assessments while I was applying, as a first step in some hiring processes, and I generally got the sense that these were not companies I wanted to work for, even though I passed them, because I didn’t think they understood the role they were hiring for and didn’t feel like they respected my time.",

      "text": "So I’m going into my last year of high school and I want to set up the foundation of a business before going into college. The idea is to have a bit of money and something real to work with once I’m there.\n\nI’ve tried a few different ideas already and realised I should probably do something I actually know about, so I’ve decided on starting an \"education based business\". A few years ago, a guy who used to go to my school came back and talked about how he scaled his tuition business to six figures while he was in first year college. He basically hired high-scoring classmates and students from nearby schools as tutors.\n\nAcademically I’m doing well, so for anyone who’s going to say focus on school, dw that’s already a priority - but the thing is I gotta get this business stuff right so I don't waste time (which is where I could use some of y'alls guidance). There’s clearly a big demand for tutoring, especially from Asian parents, I can relate to that, but I don’t really want to start straight with tutoring right now cause tbh I don't really know how to - I mean I do have some friends who are first year college students who scored well on their exams but yeah....\n\nAtm its still early-stage. I’ve been making free guides on how to do well in my curriculum just to build some brand awareness. The curriculum I’m targeting is international, so I can reach students worldwide, not just locally. Even though I haven’t graduated yet, I still think there’s value in sharing what I’ve learned and turning that into guides and resources.\n\nI’ve also made a basic website and store using Payhip and I’m trying to promote it through Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBasically I’m asking how I should tackle this at my stage. What should I focus on, what should I avoid, and how do I turn this into something that’s actually worthwhile?",

Existing apps like Cronometer and MFP are built for barcode scanning and packaged food. Logging a homemade meal with 8 ingredients was painful enough that I'd just... not do it.\n\n**The journey:**\n\n* Started building early 2024\n* Solo dev, no funding, bootstrapped\n* Been nomading through Thailand, Vietnam, Bali while building\n* Launched a few months ago\n* Current users: small but growing\n* Revenue: $0 (free for now, figuring out monetization)\n\n**What's working:**\n\n* Reddit discussion posts get engagement (90K views on one post about tracking frustrations)\n* Problem is validated - people relate to the pain\n* Restaurant database is a differentiator nobody else has\n\n**What's not working:**\n\n* Converting interest to signups\n* \"Link in profile\" gets almost zero clicks\n* Some vegan communities are hostile to AI (learned that the hard way)\n\n**Honest question for this community:** At what point do you start charging?

In short, since this is what I do professionally, I often saw people overpaying for cloud services, so I gathered all the best practices and principles that I personally applied and recommended, and automated them a bit. In addition, I created a landing page and a blog, because I like to write, so I included that as part of this as well.\n\nSo my business model would be (in addition to the free option) that I offer anyway, that if I manage to find opportunities for savings, I charge for it, and if not, then I do not charge anything.\n\nLink to website: [costlyfy](https://www.costlyfy.com/)",

I’m curious what signals or moments helped you make that call before sinking too much time into the wrong thing.",
