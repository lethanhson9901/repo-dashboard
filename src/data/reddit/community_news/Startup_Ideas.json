      "text": "* 80%+ of people prefer Google sign in\n* Removing all branding/formatting from emails and sending them from a real name increases open rate\n* You won’t know when you have PMF but a good sign is that people buy and tell their friends about your product\n* 99.9% of people that approach you with some offer are a waste of time\n* Sponsoring creators is cheaper but takes more time than paid ads\n* Building a good product comes down to thinking about what your users want\n* Once you become successful there will be lots of copy cats but they only achieve a fraction of what you do. You are the source to their success\n* I would never be able to build a good product if I didn’t use it myself\n* Always monitor logs after pushing new updates\n* Bugs are fine as long as you fix them fast\n* People love good design\n* Getting your first paying customers is the hardest part by far\n* Always refund people that want a refund\n* Asking where people heard about you during onboarding makes marketing 10x easier\n* Marketing is constant experimentation to learn what works. Speed up the process by drawing inspiration from what works for similar products.\n* Don’t be cheap when you hire an accountant, you’ll save time and money by spending more\n* A surprising amount of users are willing to get on a call to talk about your product and it’s super helpful\n* Good testimonials will increase the perceived value of your product\n* Having a co-founder that matches your ambition is the single greatest advantage for success\n* Even when things are going well you’ll have moments when you doubt everything, just have to shut that voice out and keep going\n\nFor context, [my app](https://buildpad.io) guides users through ideation and idea validation.",

      "text": "Hello guys,\n\nIn theory, when launching a SaaS, you validate the need first.\n\nIf potential clients pay, you build.\n\nIn practice? We all make the same rookie mistake: We start with an idea, then try to find someone to sell it to.\n\nIt’s usually a disaster.\n\nIn 2023, I did exactly that.\n\nActually, I did worse.\n\nI copied someone else’s idea for my market without knowing if it would work.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nIt's 2023. I’m new to SaaS, naive, and I think \"YCombinator model = Guaranteed Success.\"\n\nI spot a company called OneText. They do \"text-to-buy\" for e-commerce in the USA.\n\nI think: \"Let's bring this to Europe! But with WhatsApp.\"\n\nI spend 6 months building a clone.\n\nResult? We launch the MVP. Nobody wants it.\n\nNOBODY.\n\nEurope wasn't ready for text-based purchasing.\n\nA total zero. 6 months of work thrown in the trash.\n\nSo, I pivot.\n\nNew logic: \"Let's find companies already selling WhatsApp tools in Europe making real money, and just copy them.\"\n\nI find Shopify apps making $2-3M.\n\nNot a creative idea but at least there is a market.\n\nWe clone the MVP features in 2 weeks. I try to sell it... and miracle.\n\nClients. Happy clients. Retention.\n\nIn 6 months, we grew from $0 to $50k MRR almost exclusively through cold outreach.\n\nWe had no vision. We didn't love the project, and we didn't know how to innovate.\n\nSo, we contacted buyers and sold the SaaS for 7 figures in just a few weeks.\n\n(This was early 2025).\n\n[Here is the SaaS I sold and the proof](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremyhorowitz1_after-45-yrs-352-deals-5-lost-lois-i-activity-7297946777532391424-x-zZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6Qr-cBuSULRKCL1d1JL7e1LIgV7c6UZ3c)\n\nA few months ago, I launched a new SaaS. This time, before writing ONE LINE of code, I sold the solution using a PowerPoint deck. We hit $7k MRR before coding a single feature.\n\nToday, we are over $30k/month.\n\nThe lesson: Don't waste time. SELL BEFORE YOU CODE.\n\nDon't be a donkey like I was and waste 6 months of your life.\n\nBTW, [here is what I’m building now](https://gojiberry.ai) (I hope we will reach $1m ARR very soon)\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR before I figured out what actually matters.\n\nHere's everything I learned the hard way. Wish someone had told me this on day one.\n\n**1. Offer Google/social login. Seriously.**\n\nI started with the magic link only. (cause i adopted ship fast mentality on the wrong things)\n\nMy signup completion rate was 45%.\n\nAdded Google OAuth. It jumped to 78% overnight.\n\nFriction at signup is invisible revenue loss. Every extra step costs you 20-30% of potential users.\n\nTakes like 1 hour to implement. \n\n**2. Post-launch is 80% marketing, 20% product. Maybe even 90/10.**\n\nI spent 3 months building features.\n\nThen I \"launched.\"\n\nGot 12 signups. 0 paying customer.\n\nI thought: \"The product isn't good enough yet. Let me add more features.\"\n\nSpent another week building.\n\nBut still got no results.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. The problem was nobody knew it existed.\n\nHere's the truth: your product only needs to solve ONE problem well. That's it. Everything else is marketing.\n\nI know founders with worse products than mine making $50k MRR because they're good at marketing.\n\nI know founders with better products than mine making $0 because they suck at marketing.\n\nPost-launch, you should spend 80% of your time getting eyeballs on your product and 20% improving it based on paying customer feedback.\n\nNot the other way around.\n\n**3. Market shamelessly. Talk about your product everywhere.**\n\nI was terrified of being \"salesy.\"\n\nSo I'd post about \"building in public\" but never actually mention my product.\n\nI'd write valuable content on Reddit but never link to my tool.\n\nSo I was staring $0 MRR every day.\n\nThen I started being shameless and mentioning my product everywhere.\n\nNobody will discover your product by accident. You have to put it in their face. Repeatedly.\n\nThe people who get offended by promotion weren't going to buy anyway.\n\n**4. Respect the ones who churn. They're giving you honest feedback.**\n\nWhen users churn, I used to feel rejected.\n\nNow I have an automated email that asks: \"What made you unsubscribe?\"\n\nThe responses are gold.  \n  \nA lot of times, I was able to get them back by just guiding them or fixing some minor issue in the tool.\n\n**5. Use your own product every single day. Not once a week. Every. Day.**\n\nI built Brandled but wasn't using it consistently for my own content.\n\nOne day I forced myself to use it like a real user would.\n\nFound 7 bugs in 30 minutes. Things I never noticed in testing.\n\nMy users were experiencing all of this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nNow I use Brandled for everything.\n\nI catch problems before my users do. And I understand their workflow because I live it.\n\nIf you're not using your own product daily, you're building blind.\n\n**6. Retention > acquisition.**\n\nI was obsessed with getting new signups.\n\nRan ads. Did outreach. Posted everywhere.\n\nMeanwhile, my churn rate was 40% per month.\n\nI'd get 10 new customers and lose 4 old ones.\n\nNet growth: 6.\n\nI was filling a leaky bucket.\n\nThen I focused on retention:\n\n* Fixed onboarding\n* Added email sequences to keep users engaged\n* Built features existing customers actually asked for\n* Checked in with users who went quiet\n\nChurn dropped to 15%.\n\nNow when I get 10 new customers, I only lose 2-3.\n\nNet growth: 7-8.\n\nSame marketing effort, but better results.\n\n\n\n**7. Your MVP should only have the must-haves. Actually stick to MoSCoW.**\n\nI know everyone says this. But I didn't listen.\n\nMy \"MVP\" had:\n\n* Content generation\n* Analytics dashboard\n* Post scheduling\n* Competitor tracking\n* SWOT analysis\n* Comment assistant\n* Hashtag research\n\nThat's not an MVP.\n\nI should've launched with ONE feature: AI content generation that sounds like you.\n\nThat's it.\n\nEverything else should've come after people paid for that one thing.\n\nHere's how MoSCoW actually works:\n\n* **Must have:** The ONE thing that solves the core problem\n* **Should have:** Stuff you add after the first 10 paying customers ask for it\n* **Could have:** Nice-to-haves that you build if you have extra time (you won't)\n* **Won't have:** Everything else (most of your ideas belong here)\n\nYour MVP should make people go \"holy shit, this solves my problem\" even if it's ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, this has so many features\" while not solving anything particularly well.\n\n**8. Price based on value, not competition.**\n\nI looked at my competitors:\n\n* Taplio: $39/month\n* SuperX: $29/month\n* Hypefury: $29/month\n\nI priced Brandled at $19/month to \"undercut the market.\"\n\nBig mistake.\n\nLow price signals low value. People assumed I was inferior.\n\nPlus, at $19/month, I needed 263 customers to hit $5k MRR.\n\nAt $39/month, I need 128.\n\nHalf the customers for the same revenue.\n\nThen I realized: my tool saves people 10+ hours per week. That's worth $500-$700/month atleast for most founders.\n\nI wasn't competing on price. I was competing on value.\n\nRaised my price to $29/month - $39/month. Conversions actually IMPROVED.\n\nBecause the people who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers anyway.\n\nYour best customers care about results, not price.\n\nPrice for the value you deliver, not for what your competitors charge.\n\n**The Truth Most SaaS Founders Don't Want to Hear:**\n\nMost SaaS founders don't fail because of bad ideas.\n\nThey fail because they give up too early.\n\n90% of SaaS products are gone within 2 years.\n\nNot because they couldn't work.\n\nBecause the founder quit before they figured out what works.\n\nI almost quit at month 5. I was depressed. Burnt out. Convinced I was wasting my time.\n\nThen I changed my approach and hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nStill small. But it's proof the model works.\n\nNow it's just about staying consistent and not quitting when shit gets hard (which it will).\n\n**Here's my commitment:**\n\nI'm building this to $10k MRR minimum. No matter how long it takes.\n\nI'm documenting everything on X and LinkedIn.\n\nNot the highlight reel. The real shit. The mistakes. The failures. The small wins.\n\nIf you're building something, my advice: stay in the game.\n\nMost people quit right before things start working.\n\nDon't be most people.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any of this.\n\n",

It won't.\n\nI wasted 6 months building shit nobody asked for before I realized something - as a solo founder stuck at $0, your problem isn't your product. It's everything else. Here's exactly what changed:\n\n**1. I Stopped \"Building\" and Started Talking**\n\nBig mistake: I spent 5 months coding in isolation thinking \"build it and they will come.\"\n\nThey didn't come.\n\nThen I forced myself to do something uncomfortable - I started cold messaging 50 people on LinkedIn every single day. Not copy-paste spam. Actually personalized messages to people who engage with top posts in my niche.\n\nResponse rate: 15-20%.\n\nThese people told me what they actually wanted. \n\nYour obsession with coding is just avoiding rejection.\n\n**2. Fuck Your Feature List**\n\nThis one hurt but... I deleted 7 features I spent weeks building.\n\nTurned out 3% of users ever clicked on them.\n\nStripped everything down to ONE thing: AI content that sounds like you, not ChatGPT.\n\nMade that 10x better instead of adding more mediocre features.\n\nYour feature bloat is killing you. Pick one thing and make it unfairly good.\n\n**3. The Pricing Move That Felt Insane**\n\nStarted at $19/month to \"compete\" with bigger tools at $39.\n\nConversion rate: 6%.\n\nThen I did something that felt stupid - raised it to $29/month.\n\nConversions went UP to 11%.\n\nPlus the customers who complained about the $10 difference:  \n  \nThey were going to be nightmare support tickets anyway.\n\nStop racing to the bottom.   \n  \nYour low price isn't helping you.\n\n**4. Reddit Became My Unfair Advantage**\n\nWhile everyone's trying to hack the algorithm on X, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote ONE valuable post per day on Reddit.   \n  \nNo promo links in the post. (Just let people ask)\n\nOne post drove 50+ qualified visitors. That's more than weeks of \"viral\" tweets with 50k impressions ever did.\n\nNow I repurpose that one post across 5-10 relevant subreddits.\n\nCost: $0. Time: 60 minutes per day.\n\n**5. SEO But Make It Actually Smart**\n\nEveryone told me: \"Write about LinkedIn growth tips!\"\n\nCool, I'd be competing with HubSpot, Neil Patel, and every marketing blog with DA 80+.\n\nI'd never rank.\n\nSo I went bottom-of-funnel instead:\n\n* \"Brandled vs \\[competitor\\]\" comparison pages\n* \"Best \\[competitor\\] alternatives\"\n* \"\\[competitor\\] review\"\n\nThese get 50-200 searches per month. But everyone searching is ready to buy.\n\nAnd I can actually rank for them.\n\nOne comparison page drives more revenue than 10 \"tips and tricks\" articles ever did.\n\n**6. I Stopped Pretending to Be a Big Company**\n\n**The Solo Founder's Actual Edge**\n\nYou can't outspend funded competitors. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them.\n\nEvery customer gets a personal response from me. Every feature request gets a Loom video (even if it's a \"no\"). Every cancelled user gets a real email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't even know their founder.\n\nYou ARE the founder. That's your moat.\n\n**Why I Almost Quit (And Why You Shouldn't)**\n\nMonth 3: $0. Thought about quitting. Month 4: $0. Definitely thought about quitting. Month 5: $0. Wrote my \"I'm shutting down\" post. Month 6: Changed everything. Hit $126 in 4 days.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: most founders quit right before things work.\n\nNot because their idea was bad. Because they ran out of patience.\n\nThe difference between $0 and $126 isn't talent. It's just refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\n**The Truth About \"Making It\"**\n\nI'm not at $20k MRR. I'm not at $10k. I'm at $126.\n\nBut you know what? I went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit, people are actually paying me.\"\n\nThat mental shift is worth more than the money.\n\nBecause now I know the model works. Now it's just about repetition.\n\nKeep doing outreach. Keep writing content. Keep talking to users. Keep shipping.\n\n$126 becomes $500. $500 becomes $2k. $2k becomes $10k.\n\nBut only if you don't quit at $0.\n\nLook, I'm not some guru. I'm just a solo founder who wasted 6 months doing everything wrong.\n\nBut if you're stuck at $0 like I was, maybe my mistakes can save you some time.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details.\n\n(And yeah, the tool is Brandled - helps founders grow on LinkedIn & X without sounding like ChatGPT. But more importantly: just keep building. Most people quit right before it works.)",

I removed my free plan but kept my pay-per-trip plan where you don't need a monthly subscription. I also lowered my prices slightly but raised the PPT price above the lowest monthly price. This hopefully entices people toward a monthly subscription.\n\nI also realized that I'm not developing features for everyone else, I'm developing them for me. If I think it's cool and fun to develop, or if it'll be helpful, then it goes in. It's not like I'm taking weeks to develop one feature anymore.\n\nLast thing that I hope drives some traffic is I improved my SEO a little to include better keywords, text on the home page, and one of those Google search cards. I've also been posting updates on Reddit in my own project sub. You're right that reddit is an incredibly good place to post links because it has high traffic, good interaction, and very well crawled. My reddit posts and comments show higher than my website at this point.",

We are in the initial stages and our current focus is to create a larger pool of farmland owners like ourselves. \n\nMost of the world is fed up of current approach that relies on boss and clients as primary source of income, wherein individuals can be easily replaced.\n\nHence we see a gradual shift, individuals seeking stress free income sources that can be actually owned by them making them a non replaceable part of the Ecosystem. \n\nThis and more is exactly why we feel our project matters. We believe Farmland Ventures will be next generation of startup in India.\n\nSo if you own farmland, or interested in partnership with people who own farmland, or just want to join the community to know more about the project you are welcome.

WLKMe allows you to create an elegant **Digital Guide** that centralizes everything in one mobile-first place.\n\nOur philosophy is that technology should \"disappear\" so the focus remains on the human essence of welcoming. We have launched a **Free Forever tier** for essential guest onboarding because we want to empower every Host to deliver hotel-level experiences without the operational burden.\n\nI’d really appreciate your perspective on how this idea could better elevate the guest journey. I’ve been finding it challenging to validate the concept early on, especially when it comes to encouraging people to take a look and share honest feedback before I invest more development time.\n\nAs we get closer to launch, I’m realizing that my main difficulty isn’t the product itself, but how to present it in a way that invites curiosity and engagement. I currently have fewer than 300 people on the waiting list, even though everyone I’ve had the chance to walk through the idea with felt it made sense for the target audience.\n\nIf anyone has tips on validating or communicating an early-stage product more effectively, I’d love to learn from your experience.",

      "text": "\nUsed to spend 4-6 months building each idea before showing it to anyone, then launching to complete silence. Did that twice over 2 years, wasted probably $7K and countless hours. Decided to completely change my approach and test ideas way faster before committing to building anything substantial. The new process was forcing myself to validate demand before touching code. For each idea I'd spend 2 weekends just researching, finding people actively complaining about the problem on Reddit and forums, DMing 15-20 of them asking about their current solutions and what frustrated them most. If fewer than 10 people responded or showed real interest, I'd kill it immediately and move to the next idea.\n\nIdea 1 was a scheduling tool for consultants. Found maybe 8 complaints total, got 3 DM responses, nobody seemed that bothered by current solutions. Killed it after one weekend. Idea 2 was a content calendar for small agencies. Found 25+ complaints, got 12 responses, but when I asked if they'd pay $39/month most said probably not or maybe $15. Pricing signal was too weak, killed it after weekend two. Idea 3 was invoice tracking for freelancers. Found 40+ complaints, DMed 30 people, got 18 responses with real frustration about losing track of unpaid invoices. When I asked about paying $19/month, 7 people said yes immediately. Built a landing page that weekend describing the solution, posted it back in those communities, got 32 email signups and 4 people actually paid upfront through Stripe giving me $76 before building anything. That validation felt completely different from the previous two.\n\nSpent 3 weeks building the simplest version, launched it to those 32 people, got 9 more paying in week one. That was 7 months ago, now at $2.1K monthly with 114 paying users. Growth is steady at 10-15% monthly, mostly from word of mouth and organic search from blog posts I started writing in month 3. The fast validation approach came from studying founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where successful people killed bad ideas in days not months. Saved me from wasting 8-12 months building ideas 1 and 2 that would've failed. Now I can test 3-4 ideas in the time it used to take me to build one wrong one.",

Startups are NOT for everyone, even though they’ve become a “fancy” thing to do.\n\nMost people who want to do startups approach it the wrong way. \nReal entrepreneurs usually never set out to “do a startup”. They were passionate about creating or obsessed with solving a problem and eventually realized they had no choice but to build something.\n\nSo shift your mindset. Ask yourself: can you create something people want or solve a real problem, preferably in a domain you understand? \nIf yes, just build a solution. Forget “startup”. Do not overthink. Just create a product.\n\nIf it works, great. Then evaluate milestones carefully and grow from there. If it doesn’t, you’ll still learn something valuable. You may discover that startups are not for you, but indie hacking, freelancing, or an agency model might be.\n\nDo not draw conclusions first and then try to justify them backwards. Do what you can do now, and let the journey unfold naturally.",

Based on the 17 trials, I project gaining 6 paid clients.\n\nTotal Revenue Impact: \\~$600 MRR.\n\nLet's be honest, for almost 2 million views, 6 clients isn't huge.\n\nThe massive drop-off happened because I advertised the SaaS in the thread (posts 2 and 3) rather than the main post.\n\nThe fall from 1.9M to 78k views killed the conversion momentum.\n\nNext time, I’m going to pitch the product directly in the first post/video to capture that initial traffic, rather than relying on them clicking through a thread.\n\nOverall, $600 MRR is not life-changing, but it’s profitable and validates that the attention is there. I'm definitely doing it again.\n\n[Here is the tweet](https://x.com/romanbuildsaas/status/2006974222300831980?s=20)\n\nCheers!",

Everyone was happy with their phones but then came Apple. \n\nI’d like to share my thoughts with the help of Avatar movie part one( there are loads of other inspirations). The main protagonist first learns flying with the ‘bird’ and through his adventures learns about the highest order of birds. He realises if he flies above that bird he can get access to. He flies above from a certain distance and takes a risk of jumping off his bird. But then succeeds.\n\nI hope you have got the idea what I’m trying to say here. You can always get into a problem and try fixing it. I don’t believe you need to rely on others opinions but rather your own gut feeling and taking a huge risk.",

          "text": "Hey there I'm Tate! Founder of Fleats.   \n  \nI'm building a career management tool for delivery drivers/gig workers. I've been a full time gig worker for 5+ years now and I've used every tool there is on the market and I've worked on most delivery apps along with running my own medical courier service. I have a strong sense of the market and I believe there to be a white space for an app such as Fleats to come in and potentially disrupt the industry. I am currently in a live PWA phase right now. \n\nLong story short I'm building a tool that delivery drivers need, and one I frankly wish I had years ago. I'm able to build on a super lean budget. I have great documentation. I'm not afraid of AI, but I value human effort and creativity. Just a fella trying to build an honest tool for an honest price and make it last.\n\nCheck Fleats out here: [https://www.fleatsdelivery.com](https://www.fleatsdelivery.com) (100 users max during our pwa test) *Development is active and ongoing so you might experience some issues as you navigate the app.*",

The product (by far the most important) Improve it constantly. Every small improvement chips away a few more % of churn. Rework your customer flow, ask users what frustrates them, accelerate the aha moment, and remove every friction point you can.\n\nWe do 5+ hours of customer calls every week just to understand how people actually use the product.\n\n2) Smart cancellation flow  \nWhen a user wants to cancel, we show a short survey (3 options max).  \nBased on the reason, we offer:\n\n* to pause the subscription\n* a coupon for the next month\n* or a call with an expert (me)\n\nThis alone saves 1 out of 4 users who want to leave, and gives insanely precise feedback on why people churn.  \nNo external tools needed. \\~1 hour of dev.  \nWe don’t block anyone, they can still cancel freely.\n\nIf someone cancels during the trial, we also offer 7 extra days if they just need more time.\n\n3) Failed payment recovery  \nStrong system with email reminders + in-app banners when a payment fails to recover unpaid subscriptions.\n\nResult: –30% churn → and a lot more room to grow.\n\nHope this helps someone.\n\nPlease don't buy costly tool to reduce churn, it's useless.",

Look for the authors who are ghosting their comments. If they aren't replying, that’s your opportunity.\n\nStep 2: Extract the list of everyone who commented. These people have a problem and are actively begging for a solution. You can do this with [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai).\n\nStep 3: Send them a LinkedIn message and an email saying: “I saw you commented on a post to receive a resource about (topic). Did you get it?”\n\n9 times out of 10, they will say \"No.\" You reply: \"Figured. I actually have a similar resource that covers \\[Topic\\]. Want me to send it over? No strings attached.\"\n\nThey’ll say yes, and then you simply send them your own guide.\n\nI started doing this a few days ago and I’ve never seen better results in cold outreach.\n\nI’ve never seen a cold outreach campaign perform this well.\n\nGood luck, and go get them!",

Don't forget to include a link too!\n\nWe’ll make this a thread of partnership and mutual support.\n\nAs a founder first accelerator, our team at Forum is happy to chat if you’re building something early-stage.",

My starter stack costs $73 monthly and stays the same for every new project until past $10K MRR. Then I upgrade based on real needs, not blog recommendations.\n\nCore stack: Railway at $20/month for hosting everything including database, simple and reliable. Postmark at $10/month for transactional emails with great deliverability. ConvertKit at $29/month for all marketing emails and simple automation. Stripe for payments. Plausible at $9/month for lightweight analytics. GitHub at $4/month. That's it. Everything else is free tier or manual work until revenue justifies more.\n\nWhat I specifically avoid early: Complex analytics platforms when conversion rate and revenue are the only metrics that matter, CRM software when spreadsheet works fine under 200 customers, monitoring tools beyond free tier when you're small enough to notice issues immediately, live chat when email support builds better relationships, marketing automation beyond basic sequences, any tool with enterprise features I won't use.\n\nThe pattern from both exits was clear: tool complexity grew with revenue, not before it. First company I wasted $8K on premature tools, learned my lesson. Second company I stayed lean until $15K MRR then upgraded methodically. Reached exit faster with lower burn. Third company I'm starting with the proven minimal stack and won't add anything until hitting clear pain points.\n\nStudied this approach across 300+ founder journeys in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org), successful exits almost always came from lean operations and focus on revenue, not sophisticated tool stacks. Failed companies often had beautiful infrastructure and zero customers. Tools should solve problems you currently have, not problems you might have at scale you haven't reached. Start minimal, upgrade deliberately based on actual pain.",

However, this approach has mostly led me to ideas that feel either non-profitable or extremely niche. Maybe I’m misjudging their potential, or maybe I’m not thinking big enough—but it often seems hard to turn these ideas into something scalable.\n\nAnother approach I’ve experimented with (and I know this might be controversial) is using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. I provided it with my background (CV), the geographic area where I’d like to build the startup, my budget constraints, and my risk tolerance, hoping it could help identify relevant problems and possible solutions. I’m curious to hear what you think about this method—useful tool, or a trap?\n\nHow do you personally approach idea generation? Are there frameworks, habits, or paths you’ve found particularly effective?\n\nThanks in advance for your advices.",

There's going to be compliance, security reviews, and other things.  Also, you have to have worked in a real company and observe the challenges people.\n\nIf it's a consumer problem you're trying to solve, join their Facebook communities, read the chats, ask questions about the problems, find out if people are willing to pay for a solution.  It is also quite difficult. \n\nMy perspective, soon after COVID, so many senior people left their professions and decided to become consultants, selling their \"expertise\".  Most of them struggle and fail because there are too many consultants.  Now with vibecoding, everyone thinks they can write an app and strike it rich. Also a pipe dream for most.

The app pins the exact location with the photo and an optional comment. Each post stays visible for 24 hours, and the marker changes color from green to red as time passes, indicating how recent the sighting is.\n\nI also added a separate “Lost Pets” tab where owners can publish their missing pets with a phone number and a direct WhatsApp link. This allows people to either search directly on the map or browse the list of reported lost pets. On the web version, everything can be viewed simultaneously.\n\nThe app is ready to be launched at any moment.\n\nI know similar ideas exist, but I couldn’t find one that works exactly like this, so I decided to build it myself.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.",

          "text": "Since you asked for it.\n\nThis is solving a problem that doesn't exist at scale, and the execution reveals fundamental misunderstandings about both lost pets and user behavior.\n\nFirst, the core premise is backwards. When someone loses a pet, they don't wander around hoping strangers spot it and upload photos to a niche app. They post on Facebook, Nextdoor, Instagram, and local community groups where millions of actual users already exist. Your app has zero users, which means zero sightings, which means zero value. You're asking people to download and check a ghost town app instead of using platforms they're already on.\n\nThe \"real-time photo upload\" feature is completely redundant. If someone sees a lost pet, they're already taking a photo and posting it to Facebook/Nextdoor with infinitely more reach. Why would they also download your app, create an account, and upload it again to your empty map? They wouldn't.\n\nThe 24-hour expiration is arbitrary and potentially harmful. Lost pets are often found days or weeks later. A sighting from 3 days ago is still valuable information about movement patterns and territory. You're deleting useful data for no reason except that you thought a color-changing timer sounded clever.\n\nThe separate \"Lost Pets\" tab completely undermines your own positioning. If owners are posting there with phone numbers and WhatsApp links, that's just a worse version of existing lost pet databases and Facebook groups. You haven't built anything new; you've built a fragmented, inferior clone of tools that already work.\n\n\"Ready to be launched at any moment\" but hasn't been launched tells me you know it won't gain traction. You're afraid to validate because deep down you understand nobody will use this. The app needs both pet owners AND random strangers to adopt it simultaneously to have any utility, which is a chicken-and-egg problem you have no strategy to solve.\n\nThe market has already decided this doesn't work. Similar apps exist and failed because lost pet recovery happens through network effects on existing social platforms, not through purpose-built apps with zero distribution. You've built a technically functional solution to a problem that's already better solved by posting in Facebook groups with actual community engagement.\n\nLaunch it if you want proof, but you'll get maybe 5 downloads from friends and then crickets. This isn't a startup, it's a portfolio piece pretending to be one.",

There are already quite a few tools that calculate calorie counts and suggest recipes.\n\nOne suggestion would be to add health tags like healthy / not healthy using the data already available to the user (protein, carbs, calories, etc.).\n\nIf a dish is marked as not healthy, the product could suggest ingredient swaps or additions to make it healthier.\n\nAdditionally, if a user’s protein intake is below the recommended level. For example, if a meal contains 40g of protein, the product could suggest other dishes to consume during the day to help them reach, say, a 50g protein target. This could work as an AI-based protein or nutrition suggester, helping users balance their daily intake rather than just track it.",

      "text": "Spent 4 months building my product in isolation, launched on Product Hunt getting 89 upvotes which felt amazing in the moment, ended up with 31 total signups and exactly 1 paying customer at $19/month. Launch completely flopped and I couldn't figure out why for weeks. Looking back now 8 months later with clearer perspective and $3.4K MRR from relaunch, the mistakes were painfully obvious. Biggest mistake was building for 4 months without talking to a single potential user about their actual problems. Had an idea that seemed logical in my head, assumed people would want it because I would use it, coded in complete isolation. Never validated the problem was actually painful enough for people to pay money solving it. Never asked anyone what they currently use or what specifically frustrates them about existing solutions. Just built what I thought was cool and innovative. Launch failed because I built a solution for a problem that wasn't urgent or painful enough for anyone to care.\n\n  \nSecond mistake was treating launch as one single day event. Posted on Product Hunt, got my upvotes and moment of validation, then sat back waiting for organic growth that never came. Should've launched systematically across 20+ platforms over 2 focused weeks. Should've spent weeks before launch building authentic relationships in communities where target users actually hang out. Should've created helpful content explaining the problem I solve. Instead I just showed up launch day expecting instant traction from nowhere.\n\n  \nWhat I'd do differently starting today: spend 2-3 weeks only having conversations with 20-30 people who actually have the problem I think exists, ask what they currently use and why it frustrates them specifically, build only if 10+ people describe urgent pain and show clear willingness to pay real money. Launch systematically across every relevant platform over 2 weeks, not betting everything on one Product Hunt day. Start publishing genuinely helpful content weeks before launch building trust and visibility. Manually onboard first 20 users learning everything about their actual needs versus my assumptions. Reading failed launch stories in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) showed this exact pattern everywhere: flops came from building in isolation then expecting launch day magic, successes came from validating continuously and launching systematically. One perfect launch day won't make your business, consistent execution over months will.",

      "text": "Most startup advice says focus on product first, distribution later. We did both in parallel using one key resource for SEO foundation during beta. Five months later organic search drives 37% of our signups before we even have PMF.​\n\nThe startup timing strategy was recognizing SEO takes 4-6 months regardless of product quality. That timeline matches typical time to reach PMF. If we started SEO foundation day one alongside product development we'd have both solid product and organic traffic by month six instead of reaching PMF then starting distribution from zero.​ The specific resource we used was [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to automate directory submissions establishing baseline domain authority. This saved us 10-12 hours of manual work we couldn't afford during beta when building product. Got our DA from 0 to 14 within first month giving foundation for content to rank.​\n\nThe parallel execution timeline looked like month one submitted directories and published 4 foundational posts, months two and three focused on product iteration while publishing 2 posts weekly, month four product reached acceptable quality while SEO started showing results, and month five had 800 visitors with product ready to convert that traffic.​ Results at month five showed domain authority at 22, ranking for 28 keywords, generating 800 monthly organic visitors, 24 trial signups from organic monthly, and 8 converted to paying customers at $49/month giving $392 MRR from channel we built during beta.​\n\nWhat made this resource valuable for startups was automating time-consuming work during constrained early stage. As founder I had maybe 60 hours monthly for everything. Spending 12 hours on directory submissions wasn't option. The $127 bought me 11.5 hours to spend on product instead.​ For other startup founders the resource strategy is identify specialized services that automate high-volume low-skill work, evaluate cost versus founder time opportunity cost, use services aggressively during beta when time is most constrained, and focus founder hours on product and strategy not execution tasks.​\n\nThe mistake most startups make is trying to do everything in-house to \"save money\" when founder time is most expensive resource. Spending $127 to save 12 hours is obvious when those hours could ship features users want. The scrappiness should be in finding right resources not refusing to use them.​ The broader startup lesson is building distribution and product in parallel not sequentially. The 4-6 month SEO timeline aligns perfectly with time to PMF. Starting SEO during beta means you have both ready simultaneously instead of reaching PMF with zero distribution then spending another 6 months building organic channel.",

Seeing everything together seems to help some founders commit faster. I came across tools like BrandScoop that bundle name ideas with domain availability and basic visual direction, which made me think more about *process* than any specific tool.\n\nFor those who’ve been through this phase already: do you prioritize speed and iterate later, or do you believe getting naming and branding mostly right early on saves time downstream?

Why is that?\" - then organically push on areas of frustration, emotion, complexity. With a survey you might send out 20 specific questions, with interviews you may have 3 or 4 'topics' which you organically explore. Typically user researchers then take all the feedback and group into themes to uncover pain points, frustrations, and opportunities, sometimes arranged on a timeline called a \"Journey map\".\n\nIf you survey 50 people you will get standardised answers to preset questions - high volume, but shallow understanding. If you interview 5-10 people, you will gain much greater insight and a depth of understanding that gives rise to new solutions and ideas, but less volume.",

I built SignalScouter, a founder‑led lead gen and engagement service that finds posts where users need solutions and crafts founder‑style replies, it already drove 89 waitlist signups and 10k+ post views; would love any feedback or to connect if you try it, and using it could help the connecting piece you mentioned — good luck with the MVP launch!",

It’s similar in spirit to Bandersnatch, but made for creator-driven video, especially short-form.\n\nI truly believe interactive video is the new wave of monetization for creators. \n\nIf you’re curious, there are two experiences live here:\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/58\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/69\n\nThey're not perfect, they're not even polished enough to make me happy in the slightest, but they prove the functionality and that's fine for the moment. The rest of the content is placeholder content used to test the interface.\n\nRight now, I’m focused on creating more interactive stories. I call them experiences because you're actually involved in the story alongside the creator. You choose how the story moves forward, following the path(s) the creator has set.\n\nThe name Choozza comes from “choose,” which is the core mechanic.\n\nHope that makes sense.

Guests don’t know where to send them, and organizers never get access to the best content from their own events.\nSo far, we’ve had:\n✔️100+ users\n✔️30+ events created\n✔️300+ photos and videos shared\nAll of this has been organic. Right now, I’m still working on the revenue side and testing what people are actually willing to pay for.\nPosting here mainly to learn:\n📌 what monetization models could work for a product like this\n📌 how others turned early traction into revenue\n📌 mistakes to avoid at this stage\nHappy to share more details or a link if anyone’s interested.",

              "text": "If I am allowed to be blunt, I think your pricing is too generous. The free tier already covers almost every family I know. Unlimited artworks and up to three children removes most practical reasons to ever upgrade. The paid plan does not meaningfully reduce friction or unlock enough additional value to justify spending money.\n\nRight now the free tier is not a teaser. It is the product. That makes monetization very hard unless you assume a user behavior that realistically will not happen.\n\nI also think your competitor comparison is weak. A family that wants to store their kids' artwork does not really need child-based tagging. They create folders per child. That already scales indefinitely. With basic image compression, cloud storage like Google Photos or Dropbox can handle this at very low cost and with almost no friction.\n\nMore importantly, I am not convinced the core problem is as strong as you assume. I do not think most parents actively want to track their kids' drawings over time. Not because they do not care, but because the value is in the moment. Seeing an old drawing later rarely recreates that feeling, except for very specific milestones, which are rare.\n\nSpeaking as a father of two, I do not remember most of the artwork my kids made when they were younger. Not because it was unimportant, but because it was a long time ago and did not carry lasting context. What I remember are the moments when something truly stood out.\n\nIn German kindergartens, kids often come home with new artwork almost daily. Or, in other cases, you are handed a full box at the end of the year. At that point, the drawings are disconnected from time, story, and context. You were not there when they were created. That makes archiving them less meaningful.\n\nIf anything, this feels less like a storage problem and more like a social or storytelling problem. A private, parent-focused sharing app where artwork is tied to stories, explanations, or short narratives about what the child said or felt in that moment would be more compelling. Something closer to a private Instagram for kids' art, focused on interaction and context rather than long-term archival.\n\nAs it stands, the product gives away too much for free, solves a weak problem for many parents, and competes against generic storage solutions that are already good enough.",

It’s similar in spirit to Bandersnatch, but made for creator-driven video, especially short-form.\n\nI truly believe interactive video is the new wave of monetization for creators. \n\nIf you’re curious, there are two experiences live here:\n\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/58\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/69\n\nThey're not perfect, they're not even polished enough to make me content in the slightest, but they prove the functionality and that's fine for the moment. The rest of the site is still placeholder content used to test the interface.\n\nRight now, I’m focused on creating more interactive stories. I call them experiences because you're actually involved in the story. You choose how the story moves forward, following the path(s) the creator has set.\n\nThe name Choozza comes from “choose,” which is the core mechanic.\nHope that makes sense. I'm open to any questions or enquiries.\nThank you.",

We applied for [our new SAAS.](https://gojiberry.ai)\n\nTwo days ago, we received an interview request.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t expect it at all, even though our SaaS is now very solid and growing fast.\n\nOn paper, we don’t really need VC money:\n\n* 300+ customers\n* Live for 3 months\n* Profitable\n* Happy users\n* Strong inbound lead flow\n\nThis wasn’t about survival.\n\nYC isn’t just about money.\n\n\\- The YC logo alone boosts conversions.  \n\\- Their network is massive.  \n\\- Learning how to execute better alongside world-class founders is priceless.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: even when you’re profitable, $500k is never a bad thing (marketing, hiring, speed).\n\nBefore the interview, we spent half a day training with my co-founders, doing mock interviews.\n\nOn interview day:\n\n* Login to the YC dashboard\n* Click “Join Zoom”\n* Three founders on our side\n* Two partners on the other side\n\nIt was super friendly. Very supportive. Nothing like aggressive VC interviews.  \nThey were curious, calm, and genuinely interested.\n\nThey asked us:\n\n* What we’re building\n* How the backend works / tech stack\n* Our competitive advantage\n* Number of customers and how we acquired them\n* Team roles\n* What we did before\n* A quick product demo\n* How we see the product evolving\n\nWe weren’t amazing but we were solid.\n\nThe next morning, we received the email : rejection.\n\nDisappointing, of course.\n\nReaching the interview already felt like a small miracle, so I thought we had passed the hardest part.\n\nAnd honestly… between the interview and the answer, I had already:\n\n* checked Airbnbs\n* looked at flights\n* started imagining what life in the batch could look like\n\nToo much projection. Reality check 😅\n\nWe’re re-applying for the next batch.\n\nBelow, I’ll share the exact YC rejection email, which is actually very insightful and explains the two main reasons they passed on us\n\n[Click here to see the rejection email and the reason why we were rejected](https://www.notion.so/YC-proofs-2c7b9abcbe3f80379d5ac08cf23d9b6f?source=copy_link)\n\nWe’ll be back next round 💪",

It’s similar in spirit to Bandersnatch, but made for creator-driven video, especially short-form.\n\nI truly believe interactive video is the new wave of monetization for creators. \n\nIf you’re curious, there are two experiences live here:\n\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/58\n\nhttps://choozza.com/experience/69\n\nThey're not perfect, they're not even polished enough to make me content in the slightest, but they prove the functionality and that's fine for the moment. The rest of the site is still placeholder content used to test the interface.\n\nRight now, I’m focused on creating more interactive stories. I call them experiences because you're actually involved in the story alongside the creator. You choose how the story moves forward, following the path(s) the creator has set.\n\nThe name Choozza comes from “choose,” which is the core mechanic. Hope that makes sense. \n\nI'm open to any questions or enquiries.\nThank you.",

Usually I end up Googling, opening multiple blogs or Wikipedia pages, and still don’t get a complete picture. I’m wondering if others face the same problem — what if there was an app that automatically uses your location and shows you curated history, mythology, and local stories about the exact place you’re visiting? Before building anything, I’d like to validate this with the community: is this a real problem for you, how do you currently learn about places you visit, and would you consider using or paying for an app like this? We can expand this idea with a map like interface and add AR to make it engaging.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I'm Tina.   \nI have 8 years of experience in influencer marketing.  Four months ago, I left my job at a brand company to start my own business. Since then, I've already secured collaborations with several brands. My work involves finding creators on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for these brands.   \n  \nHowever, currently, I'm the only one working full-time on this, with a friend (whose main job is also in influencer marketing) helping me find creators in their spare time. Even though I've worked in this industry for a long time and have a network of creators from around the world, the brands I'm working with need a large number of creators, and they have specific requirements regarding follower count, video views, and the creators' niches. My current network of creators isn't sufficient to quickly match these brands with suitable creators.    \n  \nFurthermore, consider this: if a brand asks me to find 100 TikTok creators in a month, and they want to collaborate for 6 months, I need to find 600 creators.  With only myself working full-time and my friend working part-time, we can't handle that volume of collaborations.   \n  \nAlso, influencer marketing is incredibly demanding. For example, I might email 10 creators, but only one replies.  And because the brand's budget isn't high, that one creator might not accept the offer, resulting in no collaboration. So, even though I spent time contacting 10 creators, I didn't get any results. This makes the business very tiring, and I'm starting to doubt whether I should continue in influencer marketing, or if there's a better way to improve efficiency.    \n  \nI also want to mention that I've worked for many brands and am part of many groups with tens of thousands of people, including Amazon sellers and brand owners. I believe that if I had a large pool of high-quality creators and could quickly connect with them, I could collaborate with many Amazon sellers and brands. This would save me from spending so much time writing individual emails (which is time-consuming, but the customized emails likely have a higher reply rate than mass emails).    \n  \nFinally, I'm planning to create a website to showcase my creator resources to brands and Amazon sellers. If they need influencer marketing services, they can contact me for collaboration. Additionally, I want to show creators that we already have several creators who have joined our agency.  I also have many brand and Amazon seller resources (I will show real group photos and demonstrate our ability to acquire brand and Amazon clients), so that creators will be more willing to cooperate with me long-term.   \n  \nOnce we establish a long-term partnership, creators will respond to my emails more quickly, and the cost per collaboration might be lower (because we might sign an annual framework agreement, for example, I would introduce a certain number of brands or Amazon sellers to the creator for collaboration over a year). Another question is, should I focus on KOLs or KOCs?   \n  \nMany brands want to collaborate with KOLs, but the price is high; brands feel that KOCs have too little influence and may not want to collaborate. However, for me, collaborating with one KOL might earn me more money than collaborating with 10 KOCs, but finding a KOL takes much longer than finding KOCs.   \n  \nThe above is about some of my work experience and my entrepreneurial ideas, which I have already started implementing.   \n  \nI hope to get everyone's advice and opinions to help me understand what I should do next, or whether this direction is correct. Thanks for reading.",
