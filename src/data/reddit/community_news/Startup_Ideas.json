[ScreenSorts](https://screensorts.app/) hit 20 paying users in just 3 days... I know that might seem like a small number to some, but to me, it’s everything.\n\nThis started as just another \"is this even a good idea?\" post on this sub, and today it’s a real product that people are actually willing to pay for. You guys gave me the reality check I needed. You pushed me to double down on the macOS experience and keep everything local for privacy. Honestly, that’s the only reason this worked. And to my surprise, the app was ranked #12 on ProductHunt 😭\n\nFor anyone who missed the original thread, ScreenSorts uses local AI to turn your mac's screenshot graveyard into a searchable database. No cloud, no subscriptions, just fixing the mess.\n\nI just wanted to come back and say thank you 🥹 If I hadn’t posted here and listened to the \"tough love\" feedback, I’d still be staring at an empty VS Code window.\n\nIf you’re currently in the \"is this even a good idea?\" phase, please keep going. Listen to this community, take the critiques, and just build the thing.\n\nAMA if you want to know about the tech stack or how the launch went!",

Raised $5M for my previous company, vibe coding a new one now, with paying customers.\n\nCase in Point: Last week a representative from Forum Ventures posted on reddit ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1qtblel/im_an_investor_dm_your_startup_idea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) to pitch your ideas to them.\n\nWhat they didn't mention is, they will in turn pitch ideas to proven founders who've already made lots of money, through their networks on linkedin ([Here](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4339379495/)).\n\nWhy Am I saying this now?  \n5 years ago, to have simply an idea, no one cared -- why? Because you'd have to go code it yourself, build a team, and raise money. That's hard. So hard < 1% of people could do it with a 90% failure rate.\n\nNow AI is here. Now AI can build it for 1% of the money in 1% of the time. Your ideas you share publicly can get legitimate competition from legititimate people very easily -- including from VC's.\n\nAI\n\nI've said publicly on reddit that from my experience with Forum Ventures, I think they're a very shady organization, and now I'm proving it to you. But I dont think theres anything unorigal about what Im saying. This can go for many orgs and people.",

Marketing. \n\nThe future success does not come from building. It comes from user acquisition and retention. More so then ever, it is going to be important to understand the specific (sub) niche you are catering too. \n\nSoftware will become like music: all the good songs already exist.

      "text": "This is absolute madness and I'm going to tell you how we did it.  \n  \n1) Do more of what works  \n  \na) We are scaling outbound like crazy.   \n  \nOur outbound system is sending 6,500 cold emails per day and 500+ LinkedIn messages with 12 LinkedIn accounts.   \n  \nIt's booking us hundreds of demos.  \n  \nWe are using Gojiberry.ai to grow Gojiberry.ai and that's awesome.  \n  \nb) More demos  \n  \nEven though I don't like doing demos that much... I'm now doing between 8 to 10 demos per day.   \n  \nMy goal is to get people to start a free trial.   \n  \nI only take calls with people who can spend a minimum of $500 with us.  \n  \nWe just hired a sales rep to help me out.  \n  \nc) More content  \n  \nMore LinkedIn posts, more posts on X, more blog articles, more Reddit posts.   \n  \nWe hired more influencers and bought more ad space in newsletters.  \n  \nThe more we post, the more money we make. So we scale.   \n  \nWe are also trying to work harder on the quality of the content we post.  \n  \n2) We got lucky  \n  \nSeveral events played in our favor:  \n  \na) RTs from Marc lou and Tibo on X (thanks guys!)   \n  \nb) A feature on Starter Story (+35k views)   \n  \nc) An article on IndieHackers's blog (thousands of views)   \n  \nd) A viral video that made us blow up on Twitter (830k+ views)   \n  \n  \n3) More customer support  \n  \nWe recruited an extra person for support.   \n  \nNow, every member (even on a free trial) can book a 15-minute call.   \n  \nIt’s time-consuming, but the customer feedback is excellent.  \n  \n4) Ads  \n  \nWe launched retargeting and we are about to launch cold ads.   \n  \nFacebook retargeting is already bringing in quite a few people.  \n  \nThere is no real magic, just a huge amount of work.   \nWe try to structure everything.  \n  \nFor those interested, I operate on a \"cooking recipe\" principle:  \n  \nDuring my day, I have to bake the most beautiful cake.   \n  \nEach ingredient is a task: post on LinkedIn, post on Twitter, etc.  \n  \nSo every day, I have my list of ingredients that I must work on as best as possible.  \n  \nThat's how, at the end of the day, I have a magnificent cake.  \n  \nGood luck everyone!  \n\n\nproof : [https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v](https://postimg.cc/SnnCNk6v)",

I’ve been tinkering with voice synthesis for a while, and I finally built something good enough to share:\n\n[imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/) — a voice cloning tool that can clone a voice from a short audio sample.\n\nThe workflow is simple:\n\n• Upload or record a voice clip (even a few seconds can work)  \n• The app transcribes it automatically  \n• Enter the text you want spoken  \n• Click generate, and get cloned audio back in seconds\n\nI’ve been genuinely surprised by how well it performs, even with short inputs. No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

      "text": "Most founders think scaling to $20k MRR requires a massive team and 12 months of coding. \n\nIt doesn't. \n\nIn 2026, the \"magic formula\" is 200 customers paying $100/month, and the fastest way to get there is by using AI Agents to replace manual growth and validation.\n\nI’ve scaled to $500k ARR before, and I’m doing it again right now. \n\nHere is exactly how you can use AI to skip the grunt work and hit $20k MRR FAST with surgical precision.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n# Lesson 1 : Don't Build Ghosts\n\nThe biggest mistake you can make is building a SaaS nobody wants.\n\nAI allows you to pivot before you waste a single cent on development. \n\nInstead of getting stuck on an initial idea, like an AI note-taker that people like but won't pay for, you can use AI to analyze competitor pain points across Reddit and LinkedIn.\n\nBy using AI to scan the market, you can pinpoint exactly where the real money is, such as high-intent lead generation. \n\nIf you can't get a \"yes\" from a prospect during a 15-minute demo, your AI agents shouldn't even be hunting in that niche.\n\n# Lesson 2 :Target High Intent Leads\n\nIf you want to be a SaaS founder winning in 2026, you need to stop doing cold outreach; it’s a 1% response rate game.\n\nYou should be using intent signals instead. \n\nYou deploy AI agents to monitor your competitors 24/7 so that when a lead comments \"Interested\" on a competitor’s post or starts a new role at a target company, your AI flags them immediately.\n\nYou aren't cold calling; you're joining a conversation they already started. \n\nThis is how you jump your response rates from 2% to 40%.\n\n# Lesson 3 :Scale Human Connections\n\nIf you want to stay lean as a solo founder, you have to realize that managing 500 conversations is impossible, but robotic AI kills deals.\n\nYou use LLMs to research the lead’s profile first to identify their specific challenges. \n\nYour sequence is simple: a 23-word opening question about their biggest struggle, followed by a personalized Loom video once they reply.\n\nBy letting AI handle the research and drafting while you maintain the strategy, you stay human at scale. \n\nThis is how you book 20 meetings and close your first 10 paying users in weeks.\n\n# Lesson 4 :Go Omnichannel \n\nTo hit $20k MRR, you must transform every network into a pillar of your growth machine. \n\nInstead of generic marketing, you need to orchestrate your channels to capture active attention and funnel it directly toward your trial.\n\nLinkedIn:  Stop manual prospecting. \n\nUse agents to scrape hot leads, specifically those engaging with competitors or industry-specific triggers. \n\nWhen you reach out, adopt a problem-first approach in their DMs. \n\nYour goal is not to pitch your product immediately, but to prove you understand their specific friction better than anyone else.\n\nReddit:  Post raw case studies and value-heavy stories. \n\nDo not just participate; dominate niches with data-backed narratives. \n\nThis ensures your insights are indexed by Google and LLMs like ChatGPT. When your target audience asks an AI for a solution in your category, your specific framework should be the one it recommends.\n\nCold Email: Scale your outreach by tracking intent signals. \n\nUse tools like Instantly to ramp up to 1,000 emails per day once your domains are fully warmed. \n\nBy targeting individuals who are already exhibiting signs of needing your solution, you transform cold outreach into a predictable, high-volume pipeline.\n\nYouTube:  Leverage YouTube for long-term dividends. \n\nFilm simple product walkthroughs that address specific user pain points. \n\nThese videos act as a 24/7 sales team, capturing long-tail search traffic and building the technical trust necessary to move a prospect from curiosity to a trial signup.\n\n# Lesson 5 : Try different pricing \n\nAI founders often overprice because the tech is powerful, or underprice because they're scared. I tried $499, but the churn was too high. \n\nI tried $297, but it required too many manual sales calls. \n\nThe AI SaaS sweet spot for us is $99/month with a 7-day trial. \n\nThis allows for a self-serve funnel where the AI does the prospecting, the landing page does the selling, and the MRR compounds on autopilot.\n\n# Your Next 48 Hours\n\nStop coding and create a simple landing page for one core feature. \n\nDeploy agents to find 300 leads interacting with your competitors right now. \n\nInitiate 50 curiosity-based DMs and install a chat bubble to handle support.\n\nThe technology is ready, you just need to stop doing manual work and start building the machine.\n\nIf you are a business owner ready to implement AI for high-intent lead generation and automated outreach, you need to set up your infrastructure at [gojiberry.ai](http://gojiberry.ai)\n\nInstead of manually chasing prospects, you can use the platform to identify high-intent signals and automate your acquisition machine.\n\nGood luck !  \n\nPierre-Eliott",

      "text": "Everyone obsesses over finding the perfect SaaS idea. Spent 8 months rapidly testing concepts using frameworks from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) database tracking 1,000+ profitable founders. Tested 23 different ideas. 21 got zero traction. 2 now generate $14K monthly combined. The difference wasn't idea brilliance, it was applying Kunal Shah's Delta 4 framework before building anything.\n\nDelta 4 framework breaks down like this. Rate your current solution (Delta 1) versus your proposed solution (Delta 4) on efficiency from 1-10. If the difference is 4 or more, you've got something irreversible. People won't go back to the old way. Example - booking train tickets at station (Delta 1 = 2/10 efficiency) versus IRCTC online booking (Delta 4 = 8/10 efficiency). That's a 6-point gap. Irreversible behavior unlocked.\n\nMy 21 failed ideas weren't bad problems. They were Delta 2 improvements at best. Built a better project management tool (existing ones rated 6/10, mine was 7/10). Delta of 1. Nobody switched. Built an email scheduler with slightly nicer UI (existing rated 5/10, mine 6/10). Delta of 1. Crickets. I was solving problems people could tolerate, not problems burning them daily.\n\nThe 2 ideas that worked both had Delta 4+ gaps. First idea was content repurposing tool turning long-form into 10 formats instantly (old way was 3 hours manual work rated 2/10, new way was 5 minutes automated rated 8/10). Second was directory submission tracker automating 100+ submissions (old way was 8 hours manual rated 1/10, new way was 20 minutes automated rated 9/10). Both solved hair-on-fire problems with 6+ point efficiency jumps.\n\nBefore building anything now, I validate using this approach. Create landing page on ConvertKit describing the Delta 4 solution, run $50 in Google ads targeting the problem keywords, get 10-15 people on calls asking about their current pain (Delta 1) and if proposed solution (Delta 4) excites them. If I can't get 50+ interested emails in 5 days, I kill the idea. This [validation method from FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) saved me months building products nobody wants.\n\nThe controversial truth is most SaaS ideas fail because founders build Delta 1 to Delta 2 improvements. Incremental changes don't create irreversible behavior. You need 4+ point efficiency gaps. Rate your idea honestly. If it's not making someone's life dramatically better, it's not worth building.\n\nStop chasing \"good\" ideas. Start hunting for Delta 4+ efficiency gaps. Incremental improvements don't build businesses. Irreversible behavior changes do.\n\nWhat's your idea's Delta score? Be honest, is it really 4+ or are you lying to yourself?",

      "text": "I spend a lot of time around early rounds. Pre seed, seed, under $5M.  \nAnd the outreach founders use on Reddit, LinkedIn, X, email… it’s not just bad. It's horrendous.\n\nNot because investors are evil.  \nBut because investors actually have a standard that weeds out non-pros (imagine that).\n\nIt's so bad, I'm writing this post as a helpful rant. Cheers\n\nHere are the 3 biggest self-inflicted wounds I see. If this is you at all... pay attention\n\n**1. The public begging post**\n\nYou’ve all seen it. And it grinds on me every time\n\n“Hey everyone, building an AI platform for creators. Need $300k. DM if interested.”\n\nNo real investor touches that.  \nIt reads like someone trying to pay rent, not build a company.\n\nInvestors fund momentum, clarity, and control.  \nBegging posts signal the opposite.\n\nIf you’re going to post publicly, do this instead:\n\n* State the problem in a way that sounds lived, not researched\n* Show what you built that proves you’re serious\n* Give one traction signal, even if small\n* Ask a real question\n\nYou’re not asking for money.  \nYou’re creating gravity.\n\n**2. The comment section ambush**\n\nInvestor posts something thoughtful.  \nFounder replies: “We are doing this. Can you invest?”\n\nThat’s not outreach. That’s street panhandling.\n\nAs shocking as it is, try to actually provide useful info instead:\n\n* Add a sharp observation to the thread\n* Show you understand the space\n* Ask one intelligent question\n\nExample:\n\n“Are you seeing these as workflow wedges or data moat plays? Most teams I talk to confuse the two and waste a year.”\n\nNow you sound like an operator, not a lottery ticket hunter.\n\n**3. The catastrophic DM (by far the worst of all)**\n\nReal message I received:\n\n“Hi, I have a great idea. Can you invest $85,000?”\n\nThat’s not a pitch. That’s a red flag in sentence form.\n\nDMs are not for pitching.  \nDMs are for getting permission to pitch.\n\nHere’s the actual sequence I’ve seen work over and over for sub $5M rounds.\n\n**Step 1: Build a real target list**\n\nNot “early stage tech investors.”  \nThat’s how you waste three months.\n\nYou want investors who:\n\n* Write checks your size\n* Invest at your stage\n* Already backed companies in your space\n\nIf you can’t name three relevant portfolio companies, you’re guessing.\n\n**Step 2: Borrow credibility**\n\nIf you have no network, don’t start with investors.  \nStart with operators in their portfolio.\n\nDM founders they already backed.  \nAsk for one piece of advice.  \nHave a real conversation.\n\nWarmth travels through operators, not cold founders.\n\n**Step 3: Send a three-line opener**\n\nNo deck.  \nNo life story.  \nNo pitch.\n\nJust this structure:\n\nLine 1: Specific reference  \nLine 2: One sentence on what you built + one traction signal  \nLine 3: One question\n\nExample:\n\n“Saw your post on vertical AI. We built a dispatch tool for HVAC teams and our beta users are already routing jobs through it daily. Too early to be interesting for a seed check?”\n\nShort. Human. Non-desperate.\n\n**Step 4: One pager before the deck**\n\nDecks are for meetings.  \nOne pagers are for curiosity.\n\nYour one pager should cover:\n\n* Who the customer is\n* What hurts\n* What you built\n* Why you win\n* One traction signal\n* How much you’re raising and what it unlocks\n\nIf they want the deck, they’ll ask.\n\n**Step 5: Run a tight process**\n\nMost founders lose here.\n\nThey:\n\n* Talk to one investor at a time\n* Drag it out for months\n* Lose all momentum\n\nDo this instead:\n\n* 30 to 45 day fundraise window\n* Batch meetings into 2 weeks\n* Push everyone to the same timeline\n\nMomentum is not luck. It’s structure.\n\nI’m not saying this to be harsh.  \nBut a bad outreach pattern can kill a round before it even starts. And how to post on Reddit when raising capital is a whole other conversation.\n\nAnd honestly, I have literally thought about creating a course just for founders to learn etiquette for contacting investors successfully (instead of driving investors crazy with horrible outreach)  \n✌",

      "text": "The biggest startup myth is:  \n\n“Build it and they will come.”  \n\nThey won’t.\n\n[I’ve been documenting idea selection and validation frameworks on Toolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) while building my own projects, and I keep noticing the same mistake:  \n\nFounders validate the solution but fail to validate the problem.\n\nHere’s the framework I use before touching any code: 👇\n\n1️⃣ **Validate the Problem (Not Your Excitement)**\n\nBefore building anything, I check:  \n\n- Are people already paying for this?  \n\n- Are competitors charging real money?  \n\n- Are users actively complaining somewhere?\n\nIf competitors exist, that’s a good sign. New founders often think, “There’s too much competition.” Experienced founders think, “Good. There’s demand.”  \n\nNo competition usually means no money.\n\n2️⃣ **Look for These 5 Opportunity Signals**  \n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I look for:  \n\n- **UX Gaps**: Ugly or clunky tools in high-paying markets.  \n\n- **High Pricing**: If a tool charges $99/month, it indicates budget exists.  \n\n- **Missing Features**: Users often complain in reviews.  \n\n- **Over-Complexity**: Many tools try to do everything. There’s opportunity in doing one thing extremely well.  \n\n- **Market Frustration Intensity**: Is it a mild annoyance or “hair on fire” urgent?  \n\nIf the pain isn’t at least a 7/10, I move on.\n\n3️⃣ **Define WHO It’s For**  \n\nIf your answer is “everyone,” it’s already dead. Specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is better than broad appeal.\n\n**4️⃣ Check Paying Capacity**  \n\nWould this user realistically pay?  \n\nStudents complaining do not equal revenue. Agencies complaining signal potential revenue. There’s different market psychology at play.\n\n***5️⃣ Distribution Plan Before Product**\n\nIf you can’t answer, “How will I get my first 100 users?” don’t build yet.  \n\nA great product without a distribution plan is just a hobby.\n\n**How I Validate Before Building** \n\nHere’s my sequence:  \n\n- 5-10 user interviews (no Google Forms - real conversations)  \n\n- Create a landing page  \n\n- Small ad spend ($5-$20)  \n\n- Try to pre-sell  \n\n- THEN build the MVP  \n\nIf nobody pays before the MVP, that’s data. It’s cheaper to kill an idea early than to wait six months.\n\n**Hard Truth**  \n\nMost founders fall in love with building. Winning founders fall in love with reducing risk. Validation might not be glamorous, but it saves years.  \n\nIf you find this helpful, I’m happy to share the exact interview structure I use.",

Simple tool, solves a real problem and makes money from day one.\n\nAnd honestly, the more I build, the more I believe micro SaaS > venture-backed startups. I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

      "text": "\nOur SaaS sales calls were painfully long. Average time from first demo to signed contract was 35 days. The product demos went well but prospects needed multiple touchpoints before trusting us enough to buy. The objection we heard constantly was \"I haven't heard of you guys before.\" Even when they liked the product, the lack of brand recognition created friction. They'd ask who else uses us, request case studies, want to see reviews on third-party sites.\n\nRealized the issue wasn't our sales process or product. The issue was we looked like a brand new company with zero web presence beyond our own marketing site. Prospects couldn't validate our legitimacy through independent research. Fixed this by building external credibility signals across the web. Used [backlink agency to get listed on 200+ SaaS directories](http://getmorebacklinks.org), review sites, and product comparison platforms. This created a breadcrumb trail that prospects could follow when researching us.\n\nThen optimized our presence on those third-party sites. Updated profiles, added screenshots, responded to the few reviews we had. Made sure anyone Googling our company name would find consistent information across multiple independent sources. The impact on sales showed up within 6 weeks. Prospects started saying \"I saw you guys listed on X\" or \"I read about you on Y\" during discovery calls. The credibility objection dropped significantly because they'd already validated us before the demo.\n\nAverage sales cycle shortened from 35 days to 21 days. The product and pricing stayed the same but the trust barrier came down. Prospects needed fewer touchpoints because they'd done their research and found us on sites they already trusted. The close rate improved too. Went from 18% of demos converting to 29% over the next quarter. Some of that is normal optimization but the external credibility definitely removed friction from the decision process.\n\nStarted embedding those third-party listings into our sales process. Share them in follow-up emails, reference them during objection handling, link to them in onboarding docs. They work as social proof without us explicitly selling. The SaaS sales lesson is that sales isn't just about your pitch and product. It's about the credibility signals prospects find when they research you independently. External presence on directories and review sites reduces friction and shortens sales cycles.\n\nIf your demos go well but deals drag on, check what prospects find when they Google you. Build external credibility that validates your legitimacy before they even talk to sales.",

Second friend shut down at $1,800 MRR after 11 months. I quit at $940 MRR after 9 months, went back to job. The difference wasn't talent, luck, or idea quality. It was strategy from day one. Friend who succeeded (let's call him Alex) started with distribution research. Spent first 3 weeks identifying where target customers gathered online, what keywords they searched, what problems they discussed repeatedly. Found 6 active communities and 25 searchable keywords. Validated he could reach 5,000+ potential customers organically before writing single line of code. Then built exactly what they needed.\n\nFriend who failed (call him Ben) and I both started with product. Spent 2-3 months building \"perfect MVP\" in isolation. Launched to communities we found after building. Hoped people would want what we made. Classic build-it-and-they-will-come trap. Ben had better product than Alex technically. Mine had more features. Neither mattered because we couldn't reach customers efficiently.\n\nAlex followed [framework from FounderToolkit database studying successful founders](http://foundertoolkit.org). Built minimal product in 4 weeks using no-code and boilerplates. Spent next 8 months purely on distribution. Posted in those 6 communities daily providing value. Submitted to 110+ directories. Ranked for target keywords within 7 weeks. First month brought 23 customers at $79/month. Month 12 hit 340 customers at $70 average.\n\nBen and I spent months adding features hoping they'd attract users. Tried paid ads we couldn't afford. Posted randomly hoping for traction. Burned through savings with no distribution system. Quit when money ran out and growth stayed flat. Hard lesson that product quality doesn't matter if nobody knows you exist.​\n\nThe brutal truth is most founders fail not because they built bad products but because they had no systematic way to reach customers. Distribution isn't something you figure out after building. It's the first thing you validate before building anything. Alex knew exactly how to reach 5,000 potential customers on day one. Ben and I hoped we'd figure it out later.​ Start with distribution access, then build products for audiences you can reach. Not the other way around.\n\nHow many founders here started with product instead of distribution strategy?",

      "text": "Been working with early-stage founders on customer acquisition for a while now. Most of them are pre-product, pre-funding and honestly pre-everything.  \nThe question I hear again and again is: *“How do I get my first 10 customers without ads or an audience?”*\n\nMy answer is almost always the same.  \nOutbound.\n\nHere’s the exact framework I walk them through.\n\n**why outbound before you build**\n\nMost founders build first and try to sell later. That’s backwards.\n\nOutbound lets you validate whether people are actually struggling with the problem. It helps you understand what the market truly needs, not what you assume they need. It also gives you a chance to get paid before you build through simple pre-sales, and it teaches you the real words and language your customers use to describe their pain.\n\nI tell every founder one simple rule: have at least 20 real conversations before writing a single line of code. No shortcuts.\n\n**the 3 questions that validate any idea**\n\nWhen you reach out to potential customers, there are only three questions that really matter.\n\nFirst, ask them what they are currently doing to solve this problem.  \nIf the answer is “nothing”, the pain is probably not strong enough. If they mention competitors, it means demand already exists. If they describe a messy or hacky workaround, that is usually a very strong signal that they would pay for a better solution.\n\nSecond, ask them what the most annoying part of their current setup is.  \nThis tells you what features actually matter and what does not.\n\nThird, ask them what a perfect solution would look like for them.  \nLet them describe their ideal world in their own words. That description should guide what you build.\n\nThese three questions alone can save you months of building the wrong product.\n\n**the outreach framework**\n\nThe first step is to find people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nNot people who might face it someday. People who are actively struggling with it.\n\nThe easiest places to spot them are posts on Reddit asking for tools, complaints on Twitter, discussions inside communities and negative reviews of competitor products.\n\nThe second step is to reach out with curiosity, not with a pitch.\n\nReference their exact situation, show that you understand what they are dealing with, and make it clear that you are trying to learn, not sell.\n\nA simple message like this works very well:\n\n“I saw your post about struggling with X. I’ve been researching this problem and already spoke to around 15 people facing the same issue. I’d love to understand how you’re handling it today. No pitch. Just trying to learn before I build anything.”\n\nMessages like this regularly get very high reply rates, because people genuinely enjoy talking about their problems.\n\nThe third step is to listen. Not to sell.\n\nIn your first three or four conversations, your only job is to listen, take notes and understand their reality.\n\nAfter that, you can say something like:  \n“Based on what you shared, I’m thinking of building X. Would that actually help you?”\n\nIf they say yes, then ask one more direct question:  \n“Would you pay Y for this?”\n\nIf that answer is also yes, you can move to pre-selling and ask if you can build it with them as your first customer. That is real validation, not opinions.\n\n**the numbers**\n\nWhat I see very consistently is this.\n\nAfter about 20 conversations, founders start to clearly understand the problem.  \nAfter around 50 conversations, they usually know exactly what to build.  \nAfter roughly 100 conversations, many are able to get 5 to 10 pre-sales or early customers.\n\nMost founders do zero conversations.  \nIf you do just 20, you are already ahead of almost everyone.\n\n**what makes it work**\n\nThe first thing that really matters is specificity.  \nGeneric outreach gets ignored. Referencing their exact words, their exact post and their exact situation is what makes people respond.\n\nThe second is genuine curiosity.  \nPeople can easily tell when you are trying to learn versus when you are trying to push a product. Approach these conversations like a researcher, not like a salesperson.\n\nThe third is consistency.  \nIf you speak to five people a day for four weeks, that is already 100 conversations.\n\nThe fourth is speed.  \nReach out to people who posted within the last seven days. After that, the problem is no longer fresh in their mind.\n\n**the founders who win**\n\nEvery successful early-stage founder I’ve worked with shares one common trait.\n\nThey talked to more people than their competitors.\n\nNot because they were smarter.  \nNot because they were better coders.  \nNot because they had more funding.\n\nThey simply had more real conversations.\n\nOutbound is the fastest shortcut to those conversations.\n\n**tldr**\n\nHave at least 20 conversations before you build anything.  \nFind people who are dealing with the problem right now.  \nAsk the three validation questions.  \nListen more than you talk.  \nPre-sell before you build.  \nFive conversations a day is enough to reach 100 in a month.\n\nIf you’re early-stage, start this week.  \nFive real conversations will teach you more than five weeks of building alone.\n\nWhat’s been your experience with outbound so far? I’m curious how others are doing this.",

      "text": "First UP, I didn't went from idea to $1300 in 28 days.\n\nFor the first three months I didn't knew that you have to market your product too.\n\nI just kept building.\n\nThen when I had 0 users after having a brutally failed PH launch.\n\nI just went down on researching on how apps really grow from \"0\"\n\nWatched endless starter story videos, reddit threads, podcasts, articles and what not.\n\nThen finally formulated a marketing strategy and went all in on it since 1st January.\n\nIt's been a month now since going all in on [my SaaS](https://brandled.app/) and I now have 35 paying users or about $1.3k in MRR\n\nIt's not millions but atleast a proof that my stuff is working.\n\nNow here's what worked:\n\n1. **Building in public to get initial traction:** I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. **Warm DMs:** Nope I didn't blasted thousands of cold dms and messages instead I engaged with my ICPs posts and content and then warm dm them asking them to try out my product and give me some feedback (this was the biggest growth lever)\n3. **Word of mouth:** I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. **SEO:** I went into SEO from day 1, not targeting broad keywords and instead focussed on Bottom of Funnel keywords (alternatives pages, reviews pages, comparision pages), it basically allows you to steal traffic from your competitors\n5. **Removing all formatting from my emails:** I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\n**What didn’t work:**\n\n**1. Building free tools:** The tools that received most traffic are usually pretty generic (posts downloader, video extractor etc.) so the audience is pretty cold and it's almost impossible to convert them\n\n**2. Affiliate system:** I’ve had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it’s extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n\n**3. Building features no one wants (obviously):** I’ve wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I’m not going to try any new marketing channels until I’m doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can’t stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won’t talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

It makes it easier to stay consistent when motivation dips.\n\nIf you want, we have a few SaaS marketing checklists and examples here: https://blog.promarkia.com/",

They pay anywhere from €150 to €500 just to post a single job ad on LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nMy thesis is that they are sitting on a goldmine they aren't using: their consultants' personal profiles.\n\nIf an agency has 10 recruiters, they likely have a combined network of 50k+ relevant candidates. Yet, they still pay for ads because coordinating 10 people to post the same job ad manually is a nightmare.\n\nSo I built a tool called **Copost** to solve exactly this \"distribution\" problem.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of buying a job slot, the agency writes the post once in my tool, and it pushes it to the personal profiles of the relevant recruiters.\n\nI added a specific feature to schedule the \"first comment\" automatically (so they can put the application link there without killing the reach in the main post). This way, not only do they save money on ads, but their recruiters actually build their personal brand and attract more candidates for the future.\n\nI managed to book 3 demos with actual recruitment firms for next week, so I feel like there is a real pain here regarding the cost of LinkedIn Jobs.\n\nDo you guys think this \"decentralized\" approach can actually replace paid job slots, or will companies always prefer the lazy option of paying LinkedIn?\n\nI’d love to know if this logic holds up.",

I’m honestly just trying to understand if I’m crazy or if others are seeing the same thing.\n\nI’ve been doing B2B for a few years now and I’ve tried almost every common outbound channel. Cold email gives me around a 0.5 percent reply rate, and most of those replies are just “unsubscribe”. LinkedIn automation got my account restricted twice. Twitter DMs work a little, but they are very time-consuming. Reddit DMs actually work well for me, but they take a lot of effort.\n\nWhat I’ve started to notice is this. Cold email feels almost dead for most people today. Inboxes are flooded, spam filters are aggressive, and very few people actually read cold emails anymore. But DMs, especially on Reddit and Twitter, still work when I truly personalise the message based on what someone posted. I’m seeing around a 20 to 25 percent reply rate when I do it properly.\n\nThe real problem is the time it takes. Every day, I spend two to three hours just to find relevant posts or threads, read what the person actually needs, write a message that is specific to their situation, and track who I messaged so I can follow up later. Even after all that, I can only do around 30 to 40 DMs a day before I’m completely drained.\n\nSo I wanted to ask a few honest questions to people here.\n\nIs anyone else doing manual DM outreach? If yes, what kind of reply rates are you seeing? Do you feel the time you spend on this is actually worth it compared to just running ads? What is the most annoying or painful part of this whole process for you?\n\nAlso, if there was a tool that helped with things like finding the right people and suggesting messages based on what they posted, would you trust something like that? Or does the idea of “automation” in DMs feel risky or spammy to you?\n\nAnd finally, what would actually make you pay for something like this instead of just continuing to do it manually?\n\nI’m not building anything yet. I’m genuinely trying to understand if this is a real problem for others too, or if it’s just my problem. I’d really appreciate any thoughts.",

But the time commitment for finding relevant posts and crafting them is a huge bottleneck.\n\nI've actually been looking at tools that help with this, like LeadsRover, specifically for the lead finding part on Reddit. I'm not sure if the AI drafting would feel too automated, but finding the right posts is half the battle.\n\nUltimately, if a tool can genuinely reduce that manual research time without losing the personalization, it's likely a net positive.",

There are done-for-you services that handle Reddit engagement for B2B companies so you don't have to spend those 2-3 hours daily.\n\nCommunity Mentions  is one that does this - they find the threads, write contextual replies, and handle posting so you're not stuck doing it manually or risking your account with sketchy automation. Might be worth looking into since you already know the channel works, you just need to get your time back.",

          "text": "Cold email isn't dead, your 0.5 percent reply rate just means your targeting or messaging sucks. Our clients doing proper cold outreach see 3 to 5 percent reply rates when they target tightly and personalize based on actual research. If you're getting mostly unsubscribes, you're either hitting the wrong people or your emails sound like spam.\n\nManual DM outreach works but it doesn't scale worth a damn. Twenty to twenty five percent reply rates sound great until you realize you can only reach 30 people per day versus 300 with email. The math only works if your deal sizes are huge and you genuinely can't reach those people any other way.\n\nAutomating DMs is risky as hell. LinkedIn already restricted your account twice, Reddit will ban you permanently if they catch automation, and Twitter is cracking down harder too. The platforms hate this shit because it ruins user experience. Even \"smart\" automation that suggests messages will probably get flagged eventually.\n\nIf you're gonna do manual outreach, stick with it but accept the volume limitations. Or fix your cold email approach so it actually works at scale instead of trying to replace it with something that can't scale.",
