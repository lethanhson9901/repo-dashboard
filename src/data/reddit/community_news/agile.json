They had low effort jobs and got paid a livable wage . Good for them. \n\nBut now are the dark ages.

But all too often, you see SMs not willing to understand the actual work, the tech, the product, the outcomes.  it isn't just that you can facilitate and coach.  \n\nI would tweek the things that you say have changed to:\n\n1. they want scrum masters to ALSO be accountable with the team for outcomes - the SM, team, coach, everyone is in it together and if the outcomes are not achieved, ALL of them have failed.  SM and Coaches that focus on form and think that being successful at Agile is the goal... are flat out wrong.\n\n2. product model is more prominent while Agile has become a bad word and a tech thing - the funny thing is that product doesn't mean no Agile... Agile has this thing called a PRODUCT owner.  the notion of a product model becoming the new paradigm is more about the elimination of \"projects\", the continuous planning,, continuous delivery, etc.  \n\n",

Before, everyone was trying to do huge waterfall projects that often burned out dev teams and delivered the wrong project.  It worked.  But when finances tighten, humanity shrinks and I’m afraid we are heading right back to the old days again.  \n\nPlus, we’re in a new phase now in the industry.  Most of the truly groundbreaking systems are kinda like standardized systems now, so requirements are easier to come by.  Agile is really good at discovery and innovation and bringing together diverse stakeholders.  So now, the next gen of software is kinda already specd, and just needs to get ported over to AI. Smart, dedicated developers will be able to do the work better without all the management overhead that Agile Inc became.  Sadly though, those overperformers will lead us right back to sloppy slaughterhouse conditions that many fought so hard to get away from.",

      "text": "I’ve been working at this company for 10 years, currently as a manager overseeing several IT teams. The company has its own internal IT department building internal products. When I started, we were moving from classic waterfall to Scrum. Like in any big corporation (2,000+ people in IT alone), it was slow and painful.\n\nDemos were basically walking through the backlog and accounting for every single task. Sprints had no real goal. Former analysts became Product Owners, and people with the least actual work were sent to Scrum Master trainings. Dailies were used by team leads to check if everyone was “doing something.” The organization cared about how much we delivered and how late it was - not *what* we delivered or what value it brought. A textbook “agile transformation.”\n\nBut after a few years, real change started to show. POs really dug into their domains and had deep knowledge of customers and competitors. IT invested in DevOps to speed up releases. Architecture evolved from one big monolith deployed 5 times a year into hundreds of independent microservices deployed on demand. Backlogs started to reflect actual customer needs instead of just task lists. Employee engagement scores were well above industry average in every survey. Over all of this watched a transformation department made up of Scrum Masters and change leaders.\n\nThen the board changed.\n\nThe new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed. Suddenly the board started blaming department directors for not delivering *their* goals. Directors started holding POs accountable for their existing roadmaps while trying to kill future increments to make room for “the strategy.” At the same time, IT directors bypassed POs entirely and pushed architectural changes under the label of “technical debt.”\n\nTeams ended up with three priorities: one from the PO, one from “the business,” and one from IT. Every delay caused fights between these three sides, finger-pointing, and accountability theater. A year passed. The board’s strategy was not delivered.\n\nSo the board decided to fire the entire transformation department (including all Scrum Masters) and introduced “improvement actions” to make sure this would never happen again.\n\nThose improvements included:\n\n* assigning an additional Project Manager to every PO to “help deliver projects on time”\n* abandoning story points in favor of estimating every task in days\n* limiting time for technical debt and bugs (!) to 10% and strictly enforcing reporting\n* hiring additional analysts to create Feature Requirement Documents for every product to “help IT estimate better and improve predictability”\n\nAll of this, of course, branded as *improving our agile way of working*.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nMore than half of the teams I know haven’t released a single change to production since then. Some teams still haven’t received FRDs for any change at all - analysts have been working on documentation for 6 months, and IT doesn’t even know what’s in it yet. I personally reviewed one of those documents (they had dependencies on my system) and saw that an FRD for a simple change was already 100 pages long.\n\nAt one point they asked me to confirm a single variable. I told them I’d look at it in a month because I was working on something else. They replied that in a month they’d already be assigned to another project and wouldn’t be able to update the document anymore.\n\nI’ve also heard Project Managers explicitly telling teams *not* to log time spent on technical debt, because we’d burn through our yearly 10% too fast and wouldn’t have any left for “more important bugs” later.\n\n10 years of transformation.  \nBuried in 6 months.\n\nI’m watching all of this from the sidelines. My department hasn’t gone through the new “transformation” yet and we’re still working the old way - just the team and the PO. We’re the last department in line for the great enlightenment. I’m going to try to use this time to prove to everyone above that the “old” system can still be efficient. Wish me luck - the last island of agility in this waterfall of despair.\n\nIn my opinion, the board threw the baby out with the bathwater. After the first year they clearly lost trust in POs and dismantled the entire system instead of trying other approaches. Not all POs were good at their job, and that’s probably the most important lesson I’m taking away from this whole story: being a PO is brutally hard and comes with real responsibility. Not everyone is cut out for it, and not everyone should take on that role. And paradoxically, over the last few months the best POs left, while the worst ones stayed - still pretending to be product owners, even though most of their decision-making power is already gone.",

Agile was never the variable. Organizational power structure was.   \n\nWhen the old board gave teams space, invested in DevOps, let POs grow into their domains, things improved. Not because of Scrum. Because leadership created conditions where competent people could do good work.   \n\nWhen the new board showed up they didn't kill Agile. They killed the conditions that made it work. Then blamed the framework for failing. Then replaced it with 100-page FRDs and project managers layered on top of POs. That's just waterfall with extra steps and a body count.   \n\nThe part about PMs telling teams not to log technical debt time. That's not process improvement. That's cooking the books. Everyone in the room knows it but nobody can say it because the people who created the rule are the ones who'd have to hear it.   \n\nYour observation about the best POs leaving while the worst stayed is a pattern I've seen over and over. You strip decision-making power from a role, the people who were good at making decisions leave. The ones who were always just going through the motions don't even notice the difference.   \n\nGood luck being the last island, I mean that. But start documenting your results now., delivery frequency, incident rates, team retention. When the \"great enlightenment\" reaches your department, the only thing that might save you is numbers that make someone above pause before flipping the switch.",

That's not the point here. The issue is orgs are paying a ton of money for someone who at best brings minimal value, at worst is complete dead weight, and most often doesn't move the needle at all. A lot of teams would be better off ditching the Scrum Master in favor of an additional dev, and integrating the SM responsibilities into the dev team. (A fully dedicated SM who is good at their job is better than devs taking the responsibilities, but a fully dedicated SM who sucks is not.)",

He constantly taunted us (team) like, he would come sit next to us and asked, explain the code and what it does or why is it not working (Idk haven’t had a chance to debug yet). One time he accused of manipulating the user story when I was talking to the QA engineer to explain the testing scope as he was new to the team, he straight. I’ve asked if I was asking the QA to manipulate and move the story forward - that’s where I come from.\n\nI hate confrontations so never said anything and decided to quit being a dev which I wasn’t a fan of so I became a Scrum Master and have been for the past 7 years now. I did this to become everything he was not and be the best and a dependable team member.\n\nReading through your post - it looks like they are just doing “Scrum” or “Agile” just for the sake of doing it. Scrum Masters are there to help, guide and support the teams without any disruptions.\n\nAnyone can share the screen and go through the board, he is not needed per se but he should be there to understand what’s going on and where they are needed.",

The pig refused. The chicken asked why and the pig replies, \"Because you would be engaged with the restaurant but I would be committed\".

It was not perfect, but it was honest and it delivered value more often than excuses.\n\nThen I came to this place that promised a big Agile transformation. What I walked into was project management with a new paint job.\n\nTwo months after I joined, new boss. Zero tech background. His boss? Zero tech background, but twenty plus years of traditional PM thinking and a deep love for dashboards that measure absolutely nothing useful. And the mindset that he’s right about everything and knows everything.\n\nNow we are “Agile” because we hold standups and shove work into ADO, which is a horrible tool, been begging for JIRA since Day 1. Leadership converts story points into days to close like math is optional and common sense is a rumor.\n\nThe newest brilliant idea is a KPI for velocity tracking. Not to help teams improve. Not to learn anything. Just to have a KPI to make it look like we’re doing something.\n\nThey also created a “demand intake process” and tried to make it Agile. It used to be a ticket queue with paperwork. Now it is a ticket queue with epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria that read like a legal contract. Same red tape, just wrapped in Scrum vocabulary.\n\nThere are no real teams. Everyone works on their own thing. Minimal collaboration. Priorities flip every couple of days. Ceremonies are status meetings with new names. Product ownership doesn’t exist, there’s no product. We are not Agile.\n\nSo I am stepping away from Agile for a while. Unless someone at the top decides to actually understand what Agile is, this will never change. They will keep measuring the wrong things, rewarding the wrong behavior, and acting shocked when nothing improves.\n\nAnyone else stuck in a similar Agile transformation?\n\nOh, and my boss uses ChatGPT to reply to every email the team sends now. Is that a new thing people are experiencing? Should I follow suite?",

As a Tester for many, many years, I need this information to be able to deduce if something has been implemented correctly (also understanding the hierarchy of functionality is handy).  Acceptance Criteria is crucial for me as tester to be able to deduce how 'well' whatever has been built.  That's not red tape, that's someone doing their job properly when they create PBI's.\n\n'Priorities flip every few days'.  Yup, that's part of having an Agile mindset.  The PO can change their mind about what the team builds every single day if they deem it necessary.  Sure, it's a pain in the arse and it's entirely inefficient, but being able to change direction is exactly what Agile teaches.  \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with velocity tracking, although it should primarily be used by Feature Teams themselves for their own reflection/planning.  Once you start to see external Stakeholders use the metrics, then be cautious.  Caveat, I have seen Finance departments use velocity to calculate the cost of Sprints in order that they fund teams appropriately.  Understanding that there is an eco system around teams is a very good thing.  You don't exist in isolation.  \n\nThere are no ceremonies mentioned in the Agile manifesto.  This sounds like you don't understand things, your points are vague.  Are you referencing Scrum here?  Agile is a set of mindset behaviour and principles, makes no reference to US points or how US's should be formulated for example.  \n\nWhen someone starts to criticise something, I always ask them to suggest something better.  Usually, they can't.  Don't be one of those people.  ",

We are an architecture/engineering setup with long-running projects, billable hours, resource planning, QA steps, and also a lot of invoicing tied to the work so I feel like Jira feels extremely task-heavy and too focused on software projects to help us with that specifically. We don’t really need epics and sprints as much as we need visibility from proposal to delivery and without integrations if possible tbh. I’m not even sure if this is possible but a girl can dream right?? \n\nCurious what people are using that’s more vertically focused and not just another kanban board with plugins on plugins.",

You adopt adaptive methods when there's uncertainty or ambiguity in the work, so there's an inherent need to accept this ambiguity and make decisions even when you don't (and won't) have the full picture. There's also usually a greater sense of shared ownership, with the project manager doing less controlling and managing and more sharing knowledge and expertise, so the team can own the work and the process. All of this requires shifting from a doing mindset to a facilitating, teaching, coaching, and sometimes partnering mindset.\n\nAgility sometimes comes with a shift to a product-centric organization, which also changes the role of a project manager. Ownership shifts to product management and long-term product goals, with project management supporting the movement toward those goals rather than serving as the primary funding and organizational structure.",

      "text": "I read an article from an organizational change consultant last week who was clearly depressed about what he viewed as a lack of impact in his work. Organizations start to make big changes and then the change fades and they lose attention and momentum. As I read it I thought of how many coaches and scrum masters I've heard tell the same story. However, I also found myself thinking \"This guy needs to be proud of the change he accomplished. Not every company wants or needs to be a B Corp. And over the weekend I thought, \"I should take my own advice.\"\n\nNot every company wants or needs to be Spotify or whatever company you read about. Sure, I worked a company that changed their industry with Scrum and another that saved their company with it, but most just got a little nicer to work at or gained a smoother deployment process, and honestly, good for them.\n\nI also look around at how software is made now vs in the 80's and 90's and wow has Agile made a big change. Anyone else remember just having architects and BAs work on a project for 6 months and then having a thousand-page long requirements doc to hand to developers and then they couldn't ask the architects anything because they were off on another project? You don't see that around much anymore. And testing - remember how we used to do testing? No unit tests, no testing before you call a feature d9ne. Just build the whole damn thing then send 18 months worth of code over to the testing department and watch the bugs come back in swarms. \n\nWe've changed and improved a lot as an industry and Agile has been a big driver of it. People can dislike Agile all they want, but I don't see any of them running back to the old ways of working. Hope that brightens a few people's day.",

Instead of 6 months of planning, 18 months of coding, we now use 1 week of planning, 4 weeks of coding and use sprints to measure that. I'd also say it's somewhat due to tech getting a lot better. Compared to 80s and 90s, we have supercomputers at our disposal and network speeds to match. Makes sense that the development process speeds up as well.\n\nThe problem is, organizations leadership don't want to adapt to an agile mindset. They still operate in that factory era mindset. And it does make sense because the rest of the world, starting from the shareholders, operate in that way. They want future predicions and plans and strategies for months on ahead. They can't just go and wing it, trusting that the entire org pivots if something goes wrong.",

That era was brutal. \n\nBut I think the honest version of this story is messier than \"Agile made things better.\" What actually killed the old way wasn't the Agile Manifesto. It was version control getting better, CI/CD becoming practical, cloud infrastructure making deployment cheap, and the internet forcing shorter feedback loops. The tooling changed the game. Agile gave it a name and a framework.   \n\nThe part that concerns me is when \"we're better than the 90s\" becomes the bar. Yeah, we are. But that's a low bar. We went from no testing to checkbox testing. From no collaboration to ceremony-driven collaboration. From waterfall to sprints that often run like mini-waterfalls anyway.   \n\nBetter than the 90s? Absolutely. As good as we could be? Not even close.   I don't think the people frustrated with Agile want to go back, they want to go forward. Past the certifications, past the theater, past the process that replaced one kind of rigidity with another. The original manifesto was about people and outcomes. What most of us live with daily is Jira workflows and sprint velocity charts.   \n\nSo yeah. Take the win. The industry is better. But let's not confuse \"better than awful\" with \"good.\"",

It also makes sense if you need stakeholders managed more closely and often, especially if you have multiple stakeholders fighting for priority of a single backlog. \n\nPI plannings are absolutely terrible if you plan in detail and plan individuals instead of a team (ergo not doing scrum in the first place). If you have a true scrum team, you can quickly plan stories, defined solely with \"description\", asking the team if it is a small enough vertical slice, and just breaking them into small batches. Monte carlo works great here too.  Don't spend time \"precising\" you estimates. Just make small, vertically sliced user stories.",

Teams that succeed spend serious time on backlog refinement, dependency mapping, and having honest conversations about capacity before they walk into that room. The PI planning should be about alignment and commitment, not figuring out what you're actually building for the first time. When teams use Programs for the cross-team coordination between planning sessions, they tend to show up way more prepared and the actual planning becomes much more focused.  \n  \nAfter about 18 months, most organisations either figure out how to make SAFe work for them or they start scaling it back to something more manageable.

Get's pretty \"heavy weight\" with a lot of sunk costs.\n\nProduct discovery is complex, so probe-sense-respond is the way to go.  And the best probe in an agile context is working, production grade software,  Not wireframes, or PoCs, or requirements, or any of that.\n\nMy go-to approaches tend to be: \n\n**- rapid lean canvas session,** so we are all on the same page on the problem being solved, why it matters, the benefits we want, how we'll measure them, key assumptions/risk and the user domain SMEs (or personas) we will be actively collaborating with when we work;  maybe 2 x 45 minute sessions, with a \"into backlog\" or \"rejected\" outcome\n\n**- user story mapping** with a couple of those SMEs, and the \"three amigo\": pattern;  record the session\n\n**- XP delivery;**  user domain SMEs embedded in and co-creating with the team, thin value slices, \"end-to-end\" skeleton first then add stuff by risk/value and get ultra fast feedback.\n\nIf the business is worried about investment risk then wrap Scrum round the outside, so you can make \"continue/stop/pivot\" decisions in a short cycle and invest one Sprint at a time, while delivering multiple increments per Sprint.\n\nWhich is all \"agile\" really ever was; make change cheap, easy fast and safe (no new defects) and get ultra-fast feedback on what is valuable. \n\nExercises like \"elephant carpaccio\" really bring this home for developers, as does the \"journey to work\" exercise in Jeff Patton's book on user story mapping\n\n[https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide](https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide) \n\n",

In the past, I’ve been involved in several projects, smaller ones went fine, but the last two large ones (1–3 years long) went very bad. I joined both halfway through, mostly to help push them to production, so I couldn’t really influence the structure or process. Now I’ve just joined a new company that’s kicking off a major refactoring and some new features project (expected to last almost two years), and I really want to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nI’m Italian, and honestly, i’ve always struggled with Agile. Too many rituals, too much overhead, not enough freedom. I used to think waterfall was better, but mostly because I didn’t really understand Agile deeply. So I spent time reading up on Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, XP, etc., and i’ve come to believe Agile makes more sense, especially with low code tools.\n\nBut here’s where I’m stuck: in my experience, Agile often means endless rework because requirements keep changing or were never properly analyzed at the start. Budgets are fixed here, timelines are tight, and we don’t have the luxury of endless iteration. On low-code platforms, even a small change can break multiple parts (data models, rules, UI, etc.), so frequent late changes are really costly.\n\nSo my question is: am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a way to truly apply Agile in this context, or should we invest much more upfront in detailed functional and technical analysis and get everything validated before development?\n\nWould love to hear from people who have faced similar constraints.\n\nThanks!",

You wind up with \"Sprints as a project reporting cadence\" and half the work in twice the time.\n\nXP used to have \"user stories\" that were written on a 3x5 index card, and were a placeholder for a conversation with the \"on site customer\", an SME embedded in the team and collaborating with them daily.  The constraint of the hand-written card had a purpose - it forced small, simple user stories.\n\nAlistair Cockburn championed a lot of this stuff and his \"elephant carpaccio\" exercise is one that really gets into small slices and rapid change.   \n  \nIt's hard to break out of that cycle though.    \n  \nManagement doesn't feel safe if they think change is expensive, hard, slow and risky.   \nThat makes them control things more tightly.  \nSo they are less likely to allow devs to put the work in to make change cheap, easy, fast and safe.

Then, in the final phase (with a lot of pressure and stringent deadlines), when the client is irritated by things not working, they accept every one of their dictates, for fear of starting a legal dispute.\n\nSo my question is, how do I, as a developer/tech leader, take charge of the situation and prevent this from happening? I'm wondering how I can best approach the initial, calmer part of the project, so as to build an effective analysis that doesn't trigger too many change requests in the future.

It's highly context sensitive. Some contexts are more tolerant of risks materializing than others.

That ROI only starts to arrive after the project is completed.\n\nAgile approaches don't make that assumption.  You continually deliver, and continually measure the actual benefits obtained.  This is less efficient, but allows you to stop at any time you think the next lot of benefits are at risk, or the ROI has shifted.\n\nEffectively you are removing the whole sunk-cost fallacy.  In a conventional project when you have spent a lot and have failed to identify or manage key risks, then you are stuck with a choice to spend more (and reduce the ROI) or cancel and write off all costs.    That's often politically unacceptable, so you carry on.\n\nWith an agile approach **you can stop at any time, having obtained high value benefits, with zero sunk costs.**\n\nIn that sense agile approaches can't really fail, when well executed.\n\nWith Scrum, each Sprint offers the business a potential zero-cost off-ramp from the project.\n\nAgile approaches are less efficient at delivery than big-design-upfront, but enable much finer-grained control on risk.  That means you can drop a lot of the stage-gate-and-sign-off and formal risk management stuff which saves you time and money.\n\nThere's a couple of core requirements, however.\n\n**- change is cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback from users on the value that change created**\n\nThis is where XP and DevOps comes into play.  When it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to make changes then the need to be 100% right first time, so detailed requirements are less important. XP took this to the extreme, with a sentence on a 3x5 index card, and a user domain SME collocated with the team and dynamically collaborating with them all the time - zero lag on feedback, and real CI/CD to an actual user they are sitting with.\n\nWith Scrum that looks like shipping multiple increments to (some) users within the Sprint and getting feedback on your progress to the Sprint Goal dynamically, so the stakeholders can choose whether to continue investing or to change direction.  Hence the idea that each Sprint is a small project in it's own right, and that the backlog is never completed, only abandoned when it doesn't offer a good ROI.\n\n**If you can't do those two things well, then you are better off with formal stage-gate project management.**",

But at least for Italian projects, it doesn't really work that way. Clients only pay us at the end of the project, or maybe at specific milestones, not based on what we've delivered along the way. And even if they pay upfront, if we don't deliver exactly what's been agreed on, it goes to lawyers and penalties kick in.\n\nI work with public administration, banks, insurance companies, etc., so the idea that the client at least has something usable from Agile doesn't hold up. They would never use a prototype or partial software that doesn't cover their full workflow. It's just not practical to switch from their current process to something incomplete (forcing them to use a bit of the old and a bit of the new), plus there are regulations, GDPR, etc. For example, you can't push forward document processing without the digital signature part, which relies on a third-party service. We only got mentioned about that integration later on, since it wasn't supposed to be implemented until much later, so we didn't check how it actually worked. Months later we realized it was impossible with our software setup.\n\nThe \"sentence on a 3x5 index card\" approach is something we've tried in a few cases, but it was a total disaster. Unless that user domain SME has full decision-making power and basically signs off on every change with their own blood, this kind of process usually runs into complete disagreement from all the other business users who will actually use the app, leading to massive rework.\n\nSo that's my main hesitation, and maybe it's just a specific case where the methodology isn't fully adaptable, or needs serious tweaking. Could also be because of the super tight constraints of low-code platforms. Overall, my concern boils down to: if I'm building a skyscraper",

You then have two pipelines for deployment, one which routes the \"as built\" and change documents to the sign-off authorities, and one that deploys code.  Both have to run to deploy to production.  \n  \nBut you are spot on - that user domain SME has to have the authority to act;  actually \"Own\" the product unlike a lot of the \"backlog managers\" you get, which means they are making business decisions inside and with the team, next to the customer.\n\nThat's what I have right now - we have empowered POs from \"the business' embedded within the teams accountable for value and making those decisions.  And it's the business making the tough priority calls when they need to, based on how our money works.  It's frankly great.  The teams feel a lot less pressure and so on.\n\nBig culture shift.  Our CEO back in the mid 1990s executed on this kind of culture so we on the technical side all got business training, the the business folk.  So much doesn't need to be said when you do that, the payoff is HUGE.  \n  \nMostly the banks where I am are going all in on SAFe, with a sprinkling of team topologies and value streams.\n\nBut yeah how you do projects matters;  we're in the process of swapping to a more value-stream approach because now we don't have on-prem servers and use IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS the CAPEX-OPEX model of old is a bit broken. And how the money works really, really matters. \n\nAnd the skyscraper thing is spot on.  \n  \nIf you aren't able to work with easily extensible architecture and you are pouring foundations in concrete then you can't add a couple of extra floors later on in the process.\n\nDoes sound like you are better off with waterfall;  you can still look at things like Kanban to help you smooth the delays and kinks out of the delivery - often it's not the \"time on tools\" that matters, its the delays.   Good kanban and flow can shift delivery by \\~20% or so, and really help with triaging defects when you are in a white-water period.\n\nPart of the issue I have now (big DW swap out) is they built by architectural layers for efficiency rather than running a strangler fig pattern (to manage risk);  anything you can do to break the project down into smaller, high value components helps.  \n  \nTMFASD talked about \"a few weeks to a few months\" and that's valid. Keep each chunk under $1m and have value at the end helps;  Scrum shrinks this to a couple of weeks but that's often too small for big projects (but essential for R+D)   \n  \nDon't fast prototype though - have disposable POCs to derisk delivery technology timeboxed to a couple of days, and build everything else to production standard. \n\nNothing as horrible as a hacked together POC pushed to prod lol.\n\n\n\n",

We needed to make a business process more efficient.  We would identify the scope and objectives. We would identify pain points and opportunities for automation. We would visualize end state by documenting as is process flows and to be process flows. We would identify software projects as incremental deliverables to reach our end state process flow.  Then we would take a highest priority software project and determine detailed business requirements and functional requirements. We would then break these down further into story board type chunks and actionable batch functions. Like I need a process that calculates something or feeds or extracts something. Here is the data I need or here is the data I need to send and the format or here are the business rules for the calculation or here is the data I need to capture and the business rules to edit input or here is what I need displayed including derived fields and the business rules to derive etc.\n\nOften the business can’t use the product until the feed comes in, data is displayed or input, calculations are executed and outbound feed is built.  All is successfully tested ie qa in pieces, UAT in pieces and then full integration testing. Controls pass and financial integrity is ensured.  \n\nOur leadership does not understand any of the steps before build it now that we are agile.  I’m not sure they understood it before but they were not aware of that piece because when we were waterfall we just gave them the proposal to build the incremental process identified as an automation opportunity as a proposal and got permission/money to build it then told them a time frame ie 18-24 months for example.  Then we would spend 3 months of that time just defining requirements and business rules. It was really business flushing out the details. “My bathtub needs to be a jacuzzi”. \n\nNow that we are agile and they are more involved they don’t believe in investing in the analysis needed up front. They think they can skip the process analysis.  They skip to focusing on a specific business pain point and start solutioning tactically based on the existing business process and trying to automate that….\n\nexample…”I get reports and key them into excel and then do work and update excel with results.  The excel is too big and not well controlled. So I need a tool I can up load excel reports to then key additinal data I research and actions I took to manually research additional stuff or decisions I have made.  I want an access database”. They get told access is not a tool we use.  They say ok… something like access then. \n\nNow they want to hand that idea “as is” to an agile team and start creating the thing immediately. But in my role I’m supposed to write the epic and tell the team what we want if this project makes the priority list for the next Product increment in six weeks.  I won’t know until a few days before. And then the team will struggle because refinement and analysis is also not understood as necessary so those hours are not billable. I’m expected to keep this team working at capacity where capacity at 5 hours per day per Dev and QA resource cannot include analysis. \n\nIt’s slowly devolved into this situation as the leaders used to just ignore the process analysis and incremental opportunity analysis.  They were unaware of the detailed business rule identification and functional requirements identification phase. And they eliminated the technical expert design roles ie hands on design architecture people who we partnered with during that phase to share the business rules and functional with to collaborate to develop a design roadmap before the build. \n\nBusiness leaders think all that needs to happen is for them to prioritize a high level solution and them the team builds in agile increments that should result in a new tool in 3 months or less.  They are in the stage of customer maturity where they think everything is an easy to build as it is for them to say what they want. Ie just upload the spreadsheet and create a menu screen for us to type into.  We will want reports from the data.  Shouid take 3 months. It’s easy.  \n\nI’m thinking where does the data in the report come from?  Is there data you key or with you had that you don’t get sent in the report. What is the business purpose or process this supports. Can we get this data fed to us vs uploading reports. Can we match it up using keys to other systems to retrieve any missing data etc etc. im a business architect being asked to admin the team building a solution.  \n\nThis is a perfect example to me as to why agile fails all the time. If we did all the missing pieces, the build could be agile. Ie bring in data, show it, capture data via matching, show it, etc etc. that is the agile delivery and it can be done in small increments. And it can be adjusted as demoed. Etc. \n\nBut the “we don’t need requirements” and “people over process” is being used to eliminate all the investment needed to identify and break the work down.  All that  is missing. And when I say we need all that not only do people not understand why we need it to build but also don’t think we need it to maintain.  But I constantly look back at past functional requirements to remember the business rules of what is in production to answer questions and to request enhancements. \n\nHow did agile, which is a great tool for transparent software development, get implemented in such a way as to kill the rest of the process that I don’t think it was ever intended to eliminate?",

It sounds like you are pretty experienced in software development, so you are probably more familiar with how to avoid the second. The first one you tackle with strong product ownership. Have a product owner who is good at saying \"that looks good, let's more on to the next thing\". The trick is that they need to be able to say it to both the team and stakeholders.\n\nScrum, XP, and most of the other frameworks are very flexible in what work gets done, which is needed in complex product development. But that means you need to have someone who can make the tradeoff decisions on where to focus.\n\nYou may also find that doing exercises like user story mapping or even just high-level user journey sketches early on give you a big-pucture view to work with to make those tradeoff conversations clearer.",

I was among the early (and successful) adopters of XP.\n\nAll the experience I've gathered over those years has taught me that there are just two fundamental \"steps\" to successfully deliver software systems.\n\n1. Ship something\n2. Reflect\n\nI find it interesting that working with LLMs has only reinforced the idea that you will never be able to create the perfect requirements document. Therefore, build something, preferable small, get it into the hands of the intended consumers of the work, and get their feedback.\n\nReflect is intended for the people/organization to look at what they did in the first step and seek out improvements. Retrospectives are one way of doing that, but there are many more. Regardless, if you don't honestly look at how to improve you work together, then step 1 will become more difficult over time.\n\nNow, HOW you accomplish steps 1 and 2 are going to depend wildly on your circumstances, or, dare I say it, *context*! The context for a small startup trying to establish a market for its web-based application is much different from that of an established telecom company writing phone switch software that handles 911 calls.\n\nAny \"canned\" process is going to have difficulty with this, even my beloved XP! For example, I was a strong believer in co-located teams until the COVID pandemic proved that in many cases we can be nearly as productive while remote (and with lower stress due to commuting). This is why I grew to love what Lean can teach us about observation and systems thinking on top of rote application of a process.\n\nSo, all that to answer that the only right way is to try something and reflect honestly on it. Did what your tried bring value? Did it improve morale? Did it improve lead & cycle times? Did it improve quality? Based on the answers to questions like those, adjust how you work then ask the questions again when you have new data.",
