Make the Sprint Goal smaller, then create a concrete implementation plan for the first 24 hours only, and adapt it each day.\n\nThat rolling 24-hour plan can change at any time as new information arrives. The Sprint Goal remains achievable because it represents a small, intentional subset of the Sprint. You deliberately leave slack in capacity for the known unknowns. If you get most of the way through the Sprint, you can always pull more work from the Product Backlog.\n\nThis is how Scrum is intentionally designed to adapt; we learn more by doing.",

Because from your description your velocity is not 40 points or whatever you are planning, it is far less.\n\nIn addition, I have found a lot of these problems management worries about, like getting done what you say you will each iteration, are mitigated by smaller stories. First, larger stories are more likely to not finish. A larger story started later in the iteration is less likely to finish. When unplanned work comes in to screw up your planning you are more likely to be able to move out whole stories, thus reducing WIP.\n\nOne other thing to consider. Make sure all the issues are painfully visible. Generally, various Agile processes make it harder to hide problems, but management loves their illusions of control that tend to hide what is really going on and therefore giving them little real control. So, make sure that while sucking it up and dealing with all these issues that they are painfully visible to everyone.",

          "text": "So many issues here. A few ideas come to mind. First thing first is to identify the root cause of the problems:\n\n-Why is spring planning taking so long?\n-Why isn’t there a good notion of the sprint plan in place before starting?\n-Why is the churn rate so high?\n-Why is the team or PO consistently allowing sprint goal/scope changes? Are these truly necessary immediate needs that can’t be brought in the next sprint?\n\nSorry to say, but these issues existing and not being addressed seems to be mostly a leadership and coaching deficiency of the Scrum Master or whatever agile lead role.\n\nAfter identifying root causes, I would ask the team for suggestions for changes to the ways of working. If there’s hesitancy, offer suggestions to consider yourself. You can always frame changes as an “experiment” to test for a few sprints. Some options that come to mind without knowing the true causes:\n\n-Try setting strict boundaries on sprint changes/churn, not allowing any changes except for emergency P1 level responses.\n\n-If the team truly needs to be available for drop-in issues, try reducing commitment and allocating a % of capacity for drop-in work.\n\n-Try Retroing your retro - bring to the team how the purpose of the retro is continuous improvement, and that the way it’s going isn’t fulfilling that goal. Ask for suggestions for changes (notice how I often go to asking the team, even if you steer them toward the best practices you already know, help them come to the idea themselves for quicker buy-in)\n\n-Consider using metrics for more objective insights. Measure average velocity, completion against commitment rates, churn rates, sprint volatility, etc. Having data to point to objectively helps frame the conversation, especially with analytical problem solvers like software engineers. It also shows it’s not your thoughts or opinions, but is empirical. Identify one or two deficiencies and devise tactical plans to focus on improvements.\n\nLastly, if agile ways of working are not encouraged by leadership, particularly in the business/product domain, coaching is needed. Assuming you have some type of Agile Delivery Manager or Agile PMO or something you report into, share the challenges you face with the community of practice and agile leaders so they’re aware of the misalignments. If there’s no space for coaching, feedback, improvements, or even working through these challenges with those not aligned and causing the problems, then thats a toxic environment and you should probably look for a new job.",

Specifically, make sure with the help of the PO that you have enough high priority stories refined, sized and ready to start. You can even do a quick run through with the PO a day or two before to make sure you're ready.\n\nWrt interference from outside, like Sales, what I found useful was to tell them you're mid sprint but are happy to discuss the details and fit it into the next sprint, but that's ultimately your PO's call. Crucially, tell them that if you are forced to put it into the sprint then the sprint will be cancelled to replan a new one, and, as per standing instructions, you will have to let senior management know.",

If predictability is important, you have enough data to prove that you will never get or improve on that with Scrum unless you stick to your sprint plan. The PO need to own shielding the team by saying \"my team is busy, we can start on this in 2 weeks time\". Note that suddenly imposing \"slowness\" in the process like that is a cultural shift that usually requires some kind of buy in from a PM or CPO or something like that, so it's important to anchor in why. \"We need to adhere to this to get the predictability we need to be able to plan this cross team effort and deliver our most important project on time. If we fail to plan, other teams delivery is impacted which puts the entire project at risk.\" Unless you can be clear about why, no one will care. And if they actually care more about quickly responding to change, maybe Scrum isn't the thing you need (or you need to find a better cycle time that balances the needs better).",

          "text": "**25 years building software, Head of IT Architecture at a bank. What you're describing has a name: it's called Risk Management Theater.**\n\nThe 2-hour planning ceremony isn't about planning. It's about creating the *appearance* of predictability for stakeholders who are uncomfortable with the inherent uncertainty of software development.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **the plan was never supposed to survive contact with reality.** Everyone in that room knows it. But the ritual continues because:\n\n1. **It gives management something to point at.** When the VP asks \"what's the team working on?\", there's a Jira board with story points. Doesn't matter if it's fiction by Wednesday.\n2. **It distributes blame.** When things slip, it's because of \"unplanned work\" or \"scope creep\" - not because estimates are fundamentally unreliable for complex knowledge work.\n3. **It feels productive.** Two hours of structured discussion with sticky notes and story points *feels* like work. Meanwhile, the actual work gets interrupted by \"quick questions from sales.\"\n\nThe pattern you're seeing - plan → interrupt → rollover → repeat - isn't a bug. It's the system working exactly as designed. The ceremony exists to manage organizational anxiety, not to optimize delivery.\n\n**Teams that \"make the plan stick\" usually do one of three things:**\n\n1. They have enough slack built in that interruptions don't derail them (rare, because slack looks like \"inefficiency\" to people who measure utilization)\n2. They have a PM/manager who actively shields them from \"quick questions\" (also rare, because that person gets labeled as \"not collaborative\")\n3. They pad estimates so aggressively that they always \"finish early\" (common, but nobody admits it)\n\n**What actually works:** Stop pretending you can predict 2 weeks out. Use a pull-based system. Work on the highest priority thing until it's done. When priorities change, acknowledge it explicitly instead of pretending it's an exception.\n\nBut that requires leadership to admit they don't have control. And the whole point of the theater is to avoid that admission.\n\nYou work at a Jira company - you've probably seen the dashboards people build. Burndown charts, velocity trends, cycle time reports. Ask yourself: how often does any of that data actually change a decision? Or does it just make everyone feel like there's a process?",

          "text": "What I'm about to tell you may break your spirit, but that's the truth for most cases.\n\nNow some may come and say that their experience is different, but I'm not talking about anecdotes, which are valid and I respect that. I'm talking about market and industry trends and behaviors.\n\nAgile Coach, as a role, is a dead end.\n\nIt is a delusion that in the best-case scenario is just a fever dream for a perfect world where people have common sense and environments are completely devoid of politics and personal agendas. In the worst-case scenario, it's just a money-grab scheme.\n\nAnd I'm no bitter developer/manager who was hurt by a bad scrum master. I speak from experience. I was once a believer. I lived through the Agile hype for more than 20 years. I started in 2008, through XP, then Scrum, then all the Scaling mania. I worked in startups, mid-size companies, and big corps, and in most of them Agile Coaching didn't work or would never work.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still think and work through the Manifesto values and principles, but the so-called 'Agile Coach' role is trying to achieve something that is unreachable through a group of individuals.\n\nLet's start with the Coach stance, which over the years was more and more co-opted by the 'Life Coach' style. Agile Coaches became corporate therapists, without having any qualification for that, and soon the field was invaded with a lot of wishy-washy-hugging-tree practices that simply don't apply to software development delivery. I value individual coaching, but that doesn't work for teams. Instead of becoming more like basketball/soccer/football coaches, i.e., having experience and authority on the field to provide guidance, agile coaches became more like 'Tony Robbins' figures, with very generic and toothless approaches that maybe make you feel good but don't have any influence on real software development.\n\nThings like 'influence without authority' or 'facilitate without intervening or being opinionated' are just BS.\n\nAdd to the mix that Agile was originally intended for software development teams, not entire companies or any other field.\n\nNot that the principles, values, and some techniques can't be applied at different levels and fields, but calling it Agile is a stretch.\n\nWhen context gets bigger, complexity increases exponentially, and expecting that one professional, or a department of said professionals, can change the entire system is insanity.\n\nBig corps are the way they are because they evolved to be that way. There's no training, workshop, or coaching session that will change years of politics and psychological conditioning.\n\nThis is system thinking 101: the system works exactly the way it is designed to work.\n\nI've seen rare changes in those environments during my career, but that happened when you had actual real leadership that was worried about quality, time to market, and customer focus.\n\nYou alone, or your department, will never succeed in this mission because you were not created for this.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays being an Agile Coach is being set up for failure.\n\nReality hit me hard like this a few years ago. Then I shifted my career back to being a tech lead, or Technical Product Manager, sometimes Delivery Lead.\n\nReassess your skills and check where you would fit in the software development cycle. Maybe go back to coding. Maybe focus on becoming a Product Manager, Program Manager, or Delivery Lead.\n\nTry to go back to something tangible, where you can feel accountable for and apply what you know, other than 'Agile mindset'.\n\nSorry for the sour honesty, but that's the message I would like to have received a decade ago.\n\nBest of luck",

The frustration you’re feeling comes from a few real dynamics we see a lot:\n\n1) Coaches are often brought in as magic fixers  \nOrganizations want the output (better metrics, faster delivery) but haven’t actually committed to the mindset shift Agile requires. Coaching without sponsorship, shared metrics, or leadership engagement leaves you doing political survival more than transformational work.\n\n2) Resistance to change is a real structural problem  \nEven teams with good intentions can dig in heels or adapt Agile superficially (ceremonies without mindset), which leaves coaches constantly “selling” basics instead of advancing real improvement.\n\n3) Role ambiguity and lack of authority drains energy  \nYou can have all the coaching skills in the world, but if your org doesn’t give you access to influence leaders or outcomes, you’re basically an advisor with no mandate. That’s corrosive to motivation.\n\nHere’s the part that might help clarify next steps: being a good coach doesn’t mean you’re competent at changing every environment , it means you know how to diagnose where the real blockers are (leadership, culture, metrics), and whether the org has the will to remove them. If not, that’s not personal failure , it’s a mismatch between the role and the context.\n\nA few practical ideas:\n\n* Try identifying which level the biggest blocker sits at  team, leadership, culture, or system  and be explicit about that with your boss or stakeholders.\n* If leadership sponsorship is weak, ask for clear goals and measurable coaching outcomes upfront. Without them, you’re coaching in the dark.\n* Consider whether an Agile coaching collective or community inside the company could share practices and influence, instead of you working solo.\n\nAnd one last thought: What you want to do (systems thinking + coaching + improvement) does exist, but often it lives in roles where you have some combination of authority, influence, and partnership with leadership , consulting, product ops, or even product leadership can be rewarding pivots if the pure coaching path doesn’t give you the impact you want.",

We are TINY.\n\nMy CEO has decided we need to get on \"proper sprints.\" He wants quarterly planning, pre-grooming, grooming, daily standups, retros, AND a mid-sprint check-in. For FIVE people on my team.\n\nThe real issue is that we are crushing it right now. Like, genuinely moving faster than any team I've ever been on. I use Telos to listen to customer calls, turn those into requirements and mockups, hand them to the engineers, they throw it into Cursor, and stuff gets shipped. Constantly. There is no bottleneck. There is no communication problem. We literally just talk to each other because there's five of us.\n\nI tried to explain this. But I'm 99% sure this is about looking good for investors. \"We run proper two-week sprints with quarterly planning\" sounds better in a board meeting than \"we just build stuff really fast.\"\n\nSo now I'm looking at potentially adding like 6 hours of meetings per week to a team that is literally 5 people. For what? So we can have a retro where the same 5 people who talk every day can talk about how the sprint went?\n\nI'm not against process when you need it. I've worked at bigger companies where \"real\" Agile made sense because coordination was actually hard. But we don't have a coordination problem. We have a CEO who wants to play startup theater.\n\nHas anyone successfully pushed back on a situation like this? Please lmk if so\n\n\n\nEdit: I don't normally share tools. But I've had multiple people ask what our setup is to move so fast. Like I said, my team uses [cursor](https://cursor.com/home) development and I use [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) for management",

If you have enough work planned, tickets assigned to people, just formally documenting that on a board sounds like a relatively minor ask. \n\n\nJust making sure each ritual has an objective, then when the objective is done the meeting ends. \n\n\nStand up is literally supposed to be done standing up.

          "text": "This doesn’t sound like a coordination problem or a delivery problem. By your own description, you already have fast feedback, zero handoffs, and constant communication. That’s why you’re shipping so quickly.\n\nWhat your CEO is asking for isn’t really about “proper sprints”. It’s about making the work *look* legible and orderly from the outside. Two-week sprints, quarterly planning, extra check-ins, those are governance signals, not delivery improvements.\n\nThe risk is that you replace a system that’s currently learning in real time with startup theatre. Six extra hours of meetings for five people doesn’t create better outcomes when you’re already talking continuously. It just formalises conversations you’re already having and turns learning into reporting.\n\nCeremonies only earn their keep when they solve a real problem, usually decision latency, missing context, or misalignment at scale. You’ve explicitly said you don’t have those problems right now. Adding process in the absence of a constraint usually slows things down, even if it “looks right” in a board deck.\n\nIf this is about investors, the real question isn’t “are we running Scrum properly?”, it’s “how do we show evidence that we’re learning fast and delivering value?”. That can be done without bolting a heavyweight process onto a five-person team that’s already working.\n\nPushing back doesn’t mean being anti-process. It means asking which specific problem these ceremonies are meant to solve, and what evidence you expect to see improve.\n\nThat usually comes down to visibility questions like:\n\n* Can the CEO see what’s been delivered each Sprint?\n* Can stakeholders see it?\n* Is it actually in production?\n* Is there a clear way to show how what’s being delivered ties back to the overall business objectives?\n\nIf those answers are already “yes”, more ceremonies won’t fix anything. If they’re “no”, fix *that* instead of adding meetings.",

Take the approach that you are trying to solve his problem with a minimum impact to the team's ability to deliver.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if most of the problem is a visibility problem. Shipping faster than ever could mean he has less visibility into what is really happening, which makes it difficult for him to explain to investors how well things are going. And, shipping fast without industry standard practices makes investors who know a thing or 2 jumpy because they have seen a lot of shiny on the outside, rotten on the inside software get delivered fast that looks great right up until the rot accumulates enough that the whole thing comes crashing down. So, they are probably asking questions he can't answer, and this is his solution.\n\nOf course, the ceremonies don't really help that, but they create the illusions of control that make everyone feel better. \n\nSo, find out the real issues, and more than likely, there are common solutions that you can use to solve those while maintaining team effectiveness. Preferably, try not to invent it yourself because someone has dealt with the same problem and saying we are using this solution from (insert name here) is an easier sell.",

Is the team postponing major categories of effort such as infrastructure, compliance, monetization, etc.\n* Does a small team indicate that the product market is a small gap or is it a major area for growth, acquisition, or opportunity?\n* How would an investment scale the product to compete further and grow?",

In 2000-2005 if a team is planning a weekly release, they were likely doing eXtreme Programming (XP), By 2005 Scrum was winning over XP and we saw often saw two-week intervals between planned releases. Add ten teams and some scrum teams were doing three weeks between planned releases.  Team that gravitated toward shorter release cadences would talk of Kanban more so than XP. Safe was a huge thing. More than ten years back SAFe and Less would often (not always) observe 2-week sprints within 4 to 6 week releases and be able to have 20-60 teammates subdivided across tiers/services/apps.\n\nYour boss might be used to one of those longer realities from their past, and simply want to re-implement it.

I looked everywhere on the site could not find any download links. I did see a renewal for version 6 and was not interested in being ropped out of another 300$ dollars and time.\n\nSo then I reached out to support. The level 1 personnel told me he could also not access the .pdf and I had to renew to have access to an old, expired, certifications I had earned. I explained I was not interested in the new material and simply wanted what I paid for. I had to insist on escalation to somebody who did have the authority. According to current law and buisness this was bad practice. \n\nWorth inquiring with the \\[BBB.org\\](https://www.bbb.org/us/co/boulder/profile/business-development/scaled-agile-inc-1296-1000123264) right? They are already UNTRUSTED with a C- as of early 2026.\n\nLevel 2 also tried to explain to me that the system was locked up behind the renewal paywall and they also could not provide the old certification. I asked them if they practiced Agile at their offices or that was in the title only.\n\nAfter finding them on Google maps. I found I was not the only person with bad support issues.

Names, dates, specific numbers that got mentioned. All captured correctly.\n\nBut the nuance gets lost sometimes. Like the summary might say \"team agreed to move forward with option A\" when really the actual conversation was more like \"team is leaning toward option A but wants to think about it more before committing.\" That difference matters a lot.\n\nStarted doing a quick skim of summaries right after calls to catch these.

For example: Dev, Test, Doc, Deliver.   \nAnd then only add tasks for specific blockers or issues that arise somewhere in the change. So do not split the Dev down to specific tasks. This is the start of waterfalling.\n\nTransition will never happen when you try and smoothen out the waterfall and just focus on better facilitating the handovers. Transition happens when the team realises they own the solution together.",

However, you’ll still need to solve for making the work visible at some point, and if you all aren’t located in the same office, that tool needs to be digital.\n\nPart of my checkered past is solving for work management solutions - specifically agile, scaled agile, asynchronous and autonomous team collaboration (“ride a horse 🐴, save a meeting 📆…”). I’m not selling you anything - I’m just passionate about this space). The trick is to not over-engineer and solve for every possible use case, but to start simple, cost effective, and consider scalability.\n\nCouple questions:\n1. Do you guys have a budget for tools or do we need to work with free and/or tools you already have?\n2. Do you have dependencies on other teams that track their work in different tools?\n3. If so, what tools are those?\n4. If no, would they be open to tracking their work that you’re dependent on in your solution?\n\nWe’ll start there. That will give us just enough information to pick a path.\n\nFeel free to DM but I’m happy to work with you on this. I happen to have some free time on my hands and I enjoy creating solutions that support agile teams… as well as helping fellow agile trench-mates : iron sharpens iron 😁\n\nCheers!\nMysti",

If they only care about delivering code, they'll never care about production alerts.\n\nHow was the tooling that generates alerts and backlog items picked and set up? Did the devs do it or was it imposed on them because there's a lack of trust?\n\nThe preferred flow here would be:\n\n* Tell devs that the reliability of their software is important, that there is a problem with how it performs in production, and that they need to deal with it (or you will, and they won't like it)\n* Your place here is to make suggestions if you have experience with these things, not to prescribe a solution.\n* Work together to hypothesise a solution to the problem, scope it out, and make sure it's prioritised correctly. You may be surprised. The solution might end up being something else entirely, or you might decide reliability is not important after all if it takes time away from feature factory churn\n* Iterate. The first attempt is always far from perfect. Noise is normal when a team first adopts monitoring software.

Are there certain thresholds we can measure, summaries or dashboards we can create, groupings we can do, etc.?\n\n\nIt might be worth it to take one or more stories to implement those reductions. The product is not just the end user interface, but the entire system including monitoring and operating standards.\n\n\nWith that noise reduction, then you can focus on the actionable. Obviously, best solution would be to keep taking those as stories to automate to further reduce new/future issues. But yes, if you can reduce that noise, there are a lot of ways to have it added to a tracker. You don't mention what you are using, but as a team you could do some basic research, or again, take a story or so to research and/or implement such a system.\n\n\nBut hopefully, your Product Owner is reviewing these findings and deciding the best course of action - aka, is the reduction in productivity really much of a drain that tradeoffs can be made?

That framing already assumes the wrong problem.\n\nIn Scrum, prioritisation is an **accountability**, not a voting exercise and not a power grab.\n\nPolitically, it maps closest to **technocracy with delegated authority**: decisions are made by the person accountable for outcomes, informed by evidence and expertise, and constrained by transparency, not popularity.\n\nThe Product Owner is accountable for maximising value. That means:\n\n* synthesising customer evidence, market signals, risk, and constraints\n* making trade-offs explicit\n* ordering work based on outcomes, not volume or loudness\n\nTeams don't vote on priorities because accountability without decision authority is meaningless. But equally, good Product Owners don't operate in isolation. They rely on:\n\n* Developers to surface technical risk and feasibility\n* Stakeholders to provide context and demand signals\n* Evidence from real usage to invalidate assumptions\n\nWhen prioritisation feels authoritarian, it's usually because strategy is unclear, feedback loops are weak, or the backlog is treated as a demand intake queue instead of a hypothesis list.\n\nWhen it feels like democracy, it's often because no one is actually accountable for outcomes.\n\nThe healthy pattern is neither.\n**Accountable technocracy under transparent constraint.**\n\nIf prioritisation can't be explained in terms of value and learning, it's broken, regardless of who made the call.",

If you're unlucky then they are going to give you 20 mins to prep before going to straight in - if this is so, the key is that you JUST PRESENT WELL - they know you're flustered and ill prepared, that's the test, not the content.\nThe subject they want you to present on will normally be a key problem in their business right now, you can often tell what sort of shit show you're walking into just by this...\nUse GPT to get \"top 5-10 key outcomes for [Role] to focus on in a company doing [market vertical]\", DO NOT get copilot to auto gen the presentation: it's paint by numbers, \"3-5 bullets and a picture\" design is obvious a mile out.\nDesign/Variants/Drop Down/Colours/Customize Colours; go to their website, install Colour Picker browser extension and steal their colour scheme hex codes and check their fonts, put them into your PowerPoint deck, you are now branded correctly for their company.  Keep each slide titled succinctly to one of the key points, don't present more than 5 points total, support each point with no more than 3 extra slides, pull in key quotes, process diagrams, etc.  Keep your slides clear of clutter and focussed, Whitespace is King (I've seen people have one word slides that they just talk around for 5 minutes).  Favour a smaller, focussed deck than a large one.  Do not over stay your welcome.  Stand up, speak up, then shut up.\nRead and reread the presentation subject and edit the deck to bring it back to WHAT THEY ASKED FOR - for this role it's probably going to be either \"tell us about this subject\" in which case they've asked for knowledge so give it, but support with \"and then you will solve this problem, or achieve this outcome\"; or it'll be \"how do we get out of this mess?\" In which case give an action plan supported by the reasoning of knowledge.  The second may be couched in \"what would you do in this scenario\" terms but they mean the former - soften the action plan verbage slightly, but it's still an action plan.

Better designs and defect prevention\n\n\\- continuous integration;  no long-live branches, and code check-ins multiple times a day.  Test automation on the pipelines prevents environment failures, and where it doesn't, that's the priority.  \n\n\\- team collaborations not hand-offs;  while you might have specializations, there's still a degree of cross-functionality so that if the residual manual/exploratory testing you have is a constraint, then others on the team can support  \n\nDon't worry, there's still plenty for technical experts to do on quality.

Outcomes are always influenced by multiple factors. What matters is whether the **conditions for better outcomes** now exist. An Agile Coach’s contribution is indirect by design: they make improvement possible by changing how the system works. Whether improvement is realised depends on whether the organisation acts on what is exposed.\n\nYou could start with:\n\n- **Time to Market (EBM)**  \n  How long it takes for an idea or hypothesis to reach users.  \n  **Why:** Exposes decision latency, batching, hand-offs, and approval drag. These only change when the system changes.\n\n- **Lead Time for Changes (DORA)**  \n  Time from code committed to code running in production.  \n  **Why:** Reveals delivery pipeline friction, testing debt, and organisational bottlenecks that sit beyond any single team.\n\n- **Deployment Frequency (DORA)**  \n  How often the organisation successfully deploys to production.  \n  **Why:** A strong proxy for flow, technical health, and organisational trust, none of which can be improved in isolation.\n\n- **Unrealised Value (EBM)**  \n  Known opportunities that exist but are not yet delivering value.  \n  **Why:** Shows whether the organisation is learning and adapting, or simply executing what it already decided.\n\nYou can also use **Columinity** for team-level metrics that avoid measuring individuals and instead surface stability, interaction patterns, and continuity over time.\n\nIf these measures improve, it does not prove a single cause.  \nIf they do not improve, it does show the system has not changed.\n\nStay away from BS metrics like:\n\n- Velocity  \n- Utilisation  \n- Story points completed  \n- Tasks  \n- Original estimates vs actuals  \n\nThese describe activity. They do not explain results, and they do not change the system.\n\nIf you want to go deeper, read:\n\n- Scrum.org – Evidence-Based Management (EBM)  \n- DevOps Research and Assessment – DORA Metrics  \n- Columinity – Team stability, interaction, and system signals  \n\nFlow metrics would also help a lot.",

That’s not how complex systems work, and it’s not how we measure any other leadership or system role.\n\nDevelopers produce features. Those features can be tied to money.\nAgile Coaches don’t produce features. They work on the conditions that allow teams to produce features reliably.\n\nAsking “how do you know it was the Agile Coach and not the team getting their shit together” misses the point. Teams don’t just magically improve inside the same constraints. When lead time drops, coordination improves, waste goes down, and delivery becomes more predictable, that only happens because something in the system changed.\n\nThat change doesn’t show up as a Jira ticket that maps to dollars. And expecting it to is a category error. We don’t ask architects, managers, finance, or legal to justify themselves in story points either.\n\nSaying “leadership only cares about numbers” also doesn’t really help the case. Numbers show outcomes, not who gets credit. No serious organisation tries to attribute revenue to a single role. They look at whether results improved after deliberate changes to how the organisation works.\n\nIf leadership is asking for a clean $$$ attribution, they’re not actually asking how to measure impact. They’re looking for justification during layoffs. No metric will satisfy that, because the decision isn’t about evidence.\n\nThe only honest question is:\nDid the system produce better outcomes after the coaching started?\n\nIf yes, the coaching mattered.\nIf no, it didn’t, or leadership refused to change.\n\nEverything else is just BS.\n\n---\n\nhttps://columinity.com/",
