      "text": "Early 2023s, small fintech startup. Deadline: 4 months to launch. Engineering team was literally 3 people. Me as architect, plus two devs. We had our shit together. Architecture designed, infrastructure running in the cloud, backend skeleton ready. \n\nDevs were building features. We were on track. Then month 2 hit and management started hiring. A bunch of managers showed up. Then they brought in a Scrum Master. First week this guy wants to implement full Agile ceremonies. \n\nDaily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog refinement. The whole package. His reasoning: \"You need process to scale.\" We had 8 weeks left. \n\nWe weren't trying to scale. We were trying to finish. I've seen this same pattern play out multiple times now. Small team shipping. Management gets uncomfortable with lack of visibility, they hire process people. Process people need to justify their existence, ceremonies get implemented and everything slows down. \n\nThe thing that kills me is the timing. We were working. Why fix what isn't broken when you're 8 weeks from deadline? I'm genuinely curious, why can't management just leave working teams alone? Is it actual concern about sustainability or is it just discomfort with not having control mechanisms in place? \n\nWhat's your experience with this?",

Don't do it in a confrontational way, just state your concerns, if you have any metrics that can prove you slowed down, show those metrics. Basically say, this is making things worse, what were you hoping to achieve, maybe we can find a way to make that happen.\n\nEssentially, the three different scenarios I've witnessed personally when it came to transitioning to agile all had different reasons.\n\n1. Some form of organization was needed. The company operated in a chaotic way for 10 years or so and got really successful, secured investment to grow even more so their headcount increase was 100% yearly. They were also really bogged down by their previous poor decisions, and were constantly firefighting because of shit code. All the new projects were started agile but the legacy team stayed fucked, once the new revenue channels outperformed the old solutions, they sunseted that product and had a unitary way of working.\n\n2. Company got bought, owners enforced their own ways of working, ended up being pretty average experience, not great, not terrible.\n\n3. CEO got conned by a consultancy firm to hire some consultants to fix something that wasn't broken. 6 months later, they broke the contract because they had no idea how to do that and it was just a massive waste of time. There were like 10 devs total, so there was no need for it, we were shipping everything on time, the product was decent.",

The direct conversation happened, but in hindsight I focused too much on \"can we wait\" rather than \"what are you trying to achieve and how can we get there without the overhead.\"\n\nYour scenario #3 hits close to home. That's essentially what this felt like - consultancy-driven change rather than solving an actual problem. We were shipping, had clear visibility, no firefighting.\n\nThe thing that makes it tricky: when you're the one questioning the change, it's easy to get labeled as \"resistant\" rather than \"concerned about timing.\" Framing it as \"let's find a way to achieve your goals\" is much smarter than \"let's not do this now.\"\n\nOn your scenario #3 - how did you guys eventually get out of it? Did leadership recognize it wasn't working, or did the consultants just run out their contract and leave?\n\nAnd on the metrics point: we didn't have formal velocity tracking (ironically, because we weren't doing sprints yet), so proving slowdown would have been anecdotal. Wish I'd had that data.",

                  "text": "How did we recognize it wasn't working? There were two teams that were small enough where it was easy to gauge the rate we were going at without measurements. Obviously the consultants came in and started enforcing a bunch of redundant nonsense and the story point system they implemented rather than be used for planning was being used for measuring performance, some people caught on, started overestimating, there was some poker planning where it was hard to land on an estimation because some people wanted to juke the numbers and some didn't. However, those measurements ended up doing them in, about 2 months in, our very clever team lead at the time told the scrum master that we should retroactively add value to completed work so we can have a better sample set for our estimations, they were super hyped for it, so we wasted a bunch of time doing that, and then he used those numbers to calculate our velocity pre-consultancy which was higher than after they joined. Took the numbers to the CEO, the reception was mixed, no action was taken immediately but he didn't dismiss it out of hand, basically ended up saying we'll keep an eye on it. A few months later, the numbers didn't get better and because they had already kind of established velocity as a measurement of performance, that was used as a metric to justify them doing bad work. We moved to some sort of compromise where we did measure some things, kept ceremonies to a minimum, estimations weren't done by commitee but by the leads alone, and there was an understanding that they are used for planning purposes and nothing else. I left maybe 4 months afterwards so I didn't end up seeing how it continued afterwards.\n\nThe key part here is to not wait until shit hits the fan, do your due dilligence, let your line manager know as early as possible, if you can have some way to quantify it, non-technical people love that shit, because they usually have a monetary value associated with the work you are trying to complete so they can translate that to potential losses. After that, if they dig in, wait for shit to hit the fan, that's probably the last opportunity for them to be convinced it's a bad idea. If nothing changes, jump ship, it's not the kind of management you want to work for.",

You need to be able to talk their language. Ultimately, leadership is responsible for your output so if you don’t do a good job of giving them inputs, they will find another method, hence the Scrum Master. Scrum is a way for leadership to understand the development process in chunks so that they can make strategic decisions when needed. \n\nThe “trust me bro” approach has been tried time and time again by small development teams and it has failed more times than it has succeeded. \n\nIf you’re already feeling the pressure to deploy in 8 weeks, likely the release date is too aggressive. A good SM could and should relay that to leadership, find a way for a compromise to give the development team more bandwidth. When you rush, things break. And while the sentiment of rapid release is common and likely practiced at my small organizations, taking a tactical pause and making the tough decision to delay a release is likely the better move. \n\nAs you scale, yes you will have increased overhead. That is the cost of doing business. If you don’t want leadership poking around into what you’re doing and adding unnecessary headcount, learn their language and garner trust.",

That is exactly what XP looks like in real life. Short feedback loops, almost no ceremony, lots of trust, and the assumption that most early decisions will be wrong and need fixing fast.\n\nThat phase is not about scaling.\nIt is about learning.\n\nXP exists for the moment when requirements are fuzzy, designs are still forming, and speed of feedback matters more than predictability.\n\nYou do not need sprints when your iteration cycle is hours.\nYou do not need backlog refinement when priorities change midweek.\nYou do not need formal standups when everyone already knows what everyone else is doing.\n\nFrom inside the team it feels efficient.\nFrom the outside it looks scary.\n\nThen management shows up and sees no charts, no velocity, no visible control points. Someone says we need process to scale.\n\nExcept you were not scaling.\nYou were trying to finish a prototype with a deadline.\n\nDropping full Scrum ceremonies into that situation does not make the team faster. It stretches the feedback loop. Work that used to flow continuously now waits for planning. Decisions that used to happen in minutes get parked until the next meeting. Momentum slowly turns into overhead.\n\nThe ironic part is that XP is not a lack of process. It is just optimized for discovery instead of reporting.\n\nScrum is great once you know what you are building and need predictability, coordination, and long term planning. XP is better when you are still figuring out what the product even is.\n\nTrying to apply delivery scale process to a discovery stage team does not create maturity. It just replaces progress with meetings.\n\nI have seen this transition work well when it happens later. Prototype fast using XP. Validate the product. Lock in the architecture. Then introduce Scrum once the work shifts from learning to delivery.\n\nBut doing it eight weeks before launch is not scaling.\nIt is hitting the brakes because leadership wants visibility.\n\nSometimes the best thing management can do is recognize that the team is already using the right process and let them keep shipping.",

          "text": "So many of the agile ceremonies are theater in a fast moving team when you just have to ship something fast. \n\nI’m on a team that just shipped a pretty substantial clean architected platform in just 90 days. We had to triage how we used our tooling essentially. We were rigid about git obviously, we used a ton of unit tests, we generated a lot of test data too, but we used jira board as little more than a sticky board to grab shit and knock it out. It’s all we could do. We had a year of work to do in 90 days, I’m not exaggerating (we were told a deadline and feature set by a client and it was do it or don’t take the contract no other option). \n\nWe build a really high quality beautiful full featured system to their specs and it just reminds me of how inefficient agile is. But basically we were a team of folks brought in, all the most technical people at the company (they had no one internal to do this) and the architect had a 3 month head start. \n\nThere were a lot of days where I was pushing 1000+ lines of code working 12-15 hour days. It was insanity and I know kloc isn’t a great metric but that’s a lot of code to pump out consistently day after day, so many features, a lot of highly technical code too on my end too while the juniors and mids on the team mostly churned out endpoints using the tools me and the architect wrote. When I wasn’t working I was thinking about the problem. When I take on a mission I’m obsessed with completing it. \n\nWe made it we shipped. Client loves it. \n\nBut here’s the thing…we had to drop almost every agile ceremony but a morning status that was overly technical at parts but brief too thinks offline constantly collaborating with each other to solve the tough problems fast. \n\nAdopting full agile ceremonies would have sunk our timeline: there’s no way we would have made it. It worked for us bc we are all highly technical, experienced folks, highly motivated, they hired the right team and they let us manage our process. \n\nWe are going to now move into more sustainable work going forward (I worked ~300 hours in January as per my timesheet). We have time now on feature enhancements and somehow we ended up shipping a well architected scalable system with really clean code all throughout. \n\nI suspect the agile ceremonies would have maybe not killed our timeline but the quality of code we would have written would have dropped tremendously. We would have been way too fatigued to get our work done as well from the nonsense meetings. \n\nAgile doesn’t have to be heavyweight to add value to what you do. We did sprintsish (it was essentially one big sprint tho), we iterated on things, we documented anything that needed documenting, etc, but we had literally no time for anything but a massive sprint to mvp and just pushing tickets through to testing. \n\nOof I’m exhausted. I would have left if upper management would have done to me what they did to you.\n\nWhen you shake up a team process you need a transition plan to move towards that slowly and figure out what helps and what hurts. /rant",

That's not sustainable and I think that's the other side of this conversation nobody wants to have. When you strip away all process and just say \"ship it\" you're basically betting on people burning themselves out to make it happen.\n\nWorked here. But if that team had one person get sick or one had a family emergency the whole thing collapses. The part about transition plans is key though, you can't go from full ceremony to \"just ship\" overnight without breaking things. And you can't go from \"just ship\" to full ceremony without killing momentum.\n\nMy situation was the second one. We were in \"just ship\" mode and someone forced ceremonies on us with 8 weeks left. Your comment proves exactly why that was the wrong call. Hope the sustainable phase is actually sustainable. 300 hours ain't it.",

Multi-stakeholder, complex requirements, high cost of getting it wrong. Yeah do the retros, do the refinements, make sure everyone's aligned.\n\nThree engineers, 8 weeks, clear scope?

Because from your description your velocity is not 40 points or whatever you are planning, it is far less.\n\nIn addition, I have found a lot of these problems management worries about, like getting done what you say you will each iteration, are mitigated by smaller stories. First, larger stories are more likely to not finish. A larger story started later in the iteration is less likely to finish. When unplanned work comes in to screw up your planning you are more likely to be able to move out whole stories, thus reducing WIP.\n\nOne other thing to consider. Make sure all the issues are painfully visible. Generally, various Agile processes make it harder to hide problems, but management loves their illusions of control that tend to hide what is really going on and therefore giving them little real control. So, make sure that while sucking it up and dealing with all these issues that they are painfully visible to everyone.",

          "text": "So many issues here. A few ideas come to mind. First thing first is to identify the root cause of the problems:\n\n-Why is spring planning taking so long?\n-Why isn’t there a good notion of the sprint plan in place before starting?\n-Why is the churn rate so high?\n-Why is the team or PO consistently allowing sprint goal/scope changes? Are these truly necessary immediate needs that can’t be brought in the next sprint?\n\nSorry to say, but these issues existing and not being addressed seems to be mostly a leadership and coaching deficiency of the Scrum Master or whatever agile lead role.\n\nAfter identifying root causes, I would ask the team for suggestions for changes to the ways of working. If there’s hesitancy, offer suggestions to consider yourself. You can always frame changes as an “experiment” to test for a few sprints. Some options that come to mind without knowing the true causes:\n\n-Try setting strict boundaries on sprint changes/churn, not allowing any changes except for emergency P1 level responses.\n\n-If the team truly needs to be available for drop-in issues, try reducing commitment and allocating a % of capacity for drop-in work.\n\n-Try Retroing your retro - bring to the team how the purpose of the retro is continuous improvement, and that the way it’s going isn’t fulfilling that goal. Ask for suggestions for changes (notice how I often go to asking the team, even if you steer them toward the best practices you already know, help them come to the idea themselves for quicker buy-in)\n\n-Consider using metrics for more objective insights. Measure average velocity, completion against commitment rates, churn rates, sprint volatility, etc. Having data to point to objectively helps frame the conversation, especially with analytical problem solvers like software engineers. It also shows it’s not your thoughts or opinions, but is empirical. Identify one or two deficiencies and devise tactical plans to focus on improvements.\n\nLastly, if agile ways of working are not encouraged by leadership, particularly in the business/product domain, coaching is needed. Assuming you have some type of Agile Delivery Manager or Agile PMO or something you report into, share the challenges you face with the community of practice and agile leaders so they’re aware of the misalignments. If there’s no space for coaching, feedback, improvements, or even working through these challenges with those not aligned and causing the problems, then thats a toxic environment and you should probably look for a new job.",

If you use all those blank cards in the sprint, there’s a bad pattern developing that needs to be escalated.",

Specifically, make sure with the help of the PO that you have enough high priority stories refined, sized and ready to start. You can even do a quick run through with the PO a day or two before to make sure you're ready.\n\nWrt interference from outside, like Sales, what I found useful was to tell them you're mid sprint but are happy to discuss the details and fit it into the next sprint, but that's ultimately your PO's call. Crucially, tell them that if you are forced to put it into the sprint then the sprint will be cancelled to replan a new one, and, as per standing instructions, you will have to let senior management know.",

The PO need to own shielding the team by saying \"my team is busy, we can start on this in 2 weeks time\". Note that suddenly imposing \"slowness\" in the process like that is a cultural shift that usually requires some kind of buy in from a PM or CPO or something like that, so it's important to anchor in why. \"We need to adhere to this to get the predictability we need to be able to plan this cross team effort and deliver our most important project on time. If we fail to plan, other teams delivery is impacted which puts the entire project at risk.\" Unless you can be clear about why, no one will care. And if they actually care more about quickly responding to change, maybe Scrum isn't the thing you need (or you need to find a better cycle time that balances the needs better).",

          "text": "**25 years building software, Head of IT Architecture at a bank. What you're describing has a name: it's called Risk Management Theater.**\n\nThe 2-hour planning ceremony isn't about planning. It's about creating the *appearance* of predictability for stakeholders who are uncomfortable with the inherent uncertainty of software development.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **the plan was never supposed to survive contact with reality.** Everyone in that room knows it. But the ritual continues because:\n\n1. **It gives management something to point at.** When the VP asks \"what's the team working on?\", there's a Jira board with story points. Doesn't matter if it's fiction by Wednesday.\n2. **It distributes blame.** When things slip, it's because of \"unplanned work\" or \"scope creep\" - not because estimates are fundamentally unreliable for complex knowledge work.\n3. **It feels productive.** Two hours of structured discussion with sticky notes and story points *feels* like work. Meanwhile, the actual work gets interrupted by \"quick questions from sales.\"\n\nThe pattern you're seeing - plan → interrupt → rollover → repeat - isn't a bug. It's the system working exactly as designed. The ceremony exists to manage organizational anxiety, not to optimize delivery.\n\n**Teams that \"make the plan stick\" usually do one of three things:**\n\n1. They have enough slack built in that interruptions don't derail them (rare, because slack looks like \"inefficiency\" to people who measure utilization)\n2. They have a PM/manager who actively shields them from \"quick questions\" (also rare, because that person gets labeled as \"not collaborative\")\n3. They pad estimates so aggressively that they always \"finish early\" (common, but nobody admits it)\n\n**What actually works:** Stop pretending you can predict 2 weeks out. Use a pull-based system. Work on the highest priority thing until it's done. When priorities change, acknowledge it explicitly instead of pretending it's an exception.\n\nBut that requires leadership to admit they don't have control. And the whole point of the theater is to avoid that admission.\n\nYou work at a Jira company - you've probably seen the dashboards people build. Burndown charts, velocity trends, cycle time reports. Ask yourself: how often does any of that data actually change a decision? Or does it just make everyone feel like there's a process?",

I'm talking about market and industry trends and behaviors.\n\nAgile Coach, as a role, is a dead end.\n\nIt is a delusion that in the best-case scenario is just a fever dream for a perfect world where people have common sense and environments are completely devoid of politics and personal agendas. In the worst-case scenario, it's just a money-grab scheme.\n\nAnd I'm no bitter developer/manager who was hurt by a bad scrum master. I speak from experience. I was once a believer. I lived through the Agile hype for more than 20 years. I started in 2008, through XP, then Scrum, then all the Scaling mania. I worked in startups, mid-size companies, and big corps, and in most of them Agile Coaching didn't work or would never work.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still think and work through the Manifesto values and principles, but the so-called 'Agile Coach' role is trying to achieve something that is unreachable through a group of individuals.\n\nLet's start with the Coach stance, which over the years was more and more co-opted by the 'Life Coach' style. Agile Coaches became corporate therapists, without having any qualification for that, and soon the field was invaded with a lot of wishy-washy-hugging-tree practices that simply don't apply to software development delivery. I value individual coaching, but that doesn't work for teams. Instead of becoming more like basketball/soccer/football coaches, i.e., having experience and authority on the field to provide guidance, agile coaches became more like 'Tony Robbins' figures, with very generic and toothless approaches that maybe make you feel good but don't have any influence on real software development.\n\nThings like 'influence without authority' or 'facilitate without intervening or being opinionated' are just BS.\n\nAdd to the mix that Agile was originally intended for software development teams, not entire companies or any other field.\n\nNot that the principles, values, and some techniques can't be applied at different levels and fields, but calling it Agile is a stretch.\n\nWhen context gets bigger, complexity increases exponentially, and expecting that one professional, or a department of said professionals, can change the entire system is insanity.\n\nBig corps are the way they are because they evolved to be that way. There's no training, workshop, or coaching session that will change years of politics and psychological conditioning.\n\nThis is system thinking 101: the system works exactly the way it is designed to work.\n\nI've seen rare changes in those environments during my career, but that happened when you had actual real leadership that was worried about quality, time to market, and customer focus.\n\nYou alone, or your department, will never succeed in this mission because you were not created for this.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays being an Agile Coach is being set up for failure.\n\nReality hit me hard like this a few years ago. Then I shifted my career back to being a tech lead, or Technical Product Manager, sometimes Delivery Lead.\n\nReassess your skills and check where you would fit in the software development cycle. Maybe go back to coding. Maybe focus on becoming a Product Manager, Program Manager, or Delivery Lead.\n\nTry to go back to something tangible, where you can feel accountable for and apply what you know, other than 'Agile mindset'.\n\nSorry for the sour honesty, but that's the message I would like to have received a decade ago.\n\nBest of luck",

That's why I offer fluff-free mentoring to less experienced practitioners.

          "text": "I really hear you  and sadly what you’re describing isn’t unusual for Agile coaches stuck in environments that haven’t truly bought into Agile principles. The frustration you’re feeling comes from a few real dynamics we see a lot:\n\n1) Coaches are often brought in as magic fixers  \nOrganizations want the output (better metrics, faster delivery) but haven’t actually committed to the mindset shift Agile requires. Coaching without sponsorship, shared metrics, or leadership engagement leaves you doing political survival more than transformational work.\n\n2) Resistance to change is a real structural problem  \nEven teams with good intentions can dig in heels or adapt Agile superficially (ceremonies without mindset), which leaves coaches constantly “selling” basics instead of advancing real improvement.\n\n3) Role ambiguity and lack of authority drains energy  \nYou can have all the coaching skills in the world, but if your org doesn’t give you access to influence leaders or outcomes, you’re basically an advisor with no mandate. That’s corrosive to motivation.\n\nHere’s the part that might help clarify next steps: being a good coach doesn’t mean you’re competent at changing every environment , it means you know how to diagnose where the real blockers are (leadership, culture, metrics), and whether the org has the will to remove them. If not, that’s not personal failure , it’s a mismatch between the role and the context.\n\nA few practical ideas:\n\n* Try identifying which level the biggest blocker sits at  team, leadership, culture, or system  and be explicit about that with your boss or stakeholders.\n* If leadership sponsorship is weak, ask for clear goals and measurable coaching outcomes upfront. Without them, you’re coaching in the dark.\n* Consider whether an Agile coaching collective or community inside the company could share practices and influence, instead of you working solo.\n\nAnd one last thought: What you want to do (systems thinking + coaching + improvement) does exist, but often it lives in roles where you have some combination of authority, influence, and partnership with leadership , consulting, product ops, or even product leadership can be rewarding pivots if the pure coaching path doesn’t give you the impact you want.",

We are TINY.\n\nMy CEO has decided we need to get on \"proper sprints.\" He wants quarterly planning, pre-grooming, grooming, daily standups, retros, AND a mid-sprint check-in. For FIVE people on my team.\n\nThe real issue is that we are crushing it right now. Like, genuinely moving faster than any team I've ever been on. I use Telos to listen to customer calls, turn those into requirements and mockups, hand them to the engineers, they throw it into Cursor, and stuff gets shipped. Constantly. There is no bottleneck. There is no communication problem. We literally just talk to each other because there's five of us.\n\nI tried to explain this. But I'm 99% sure this is about looking good for investors. \"We run proper two-week sprints with quarterly planning\" sounds better in a board meeting than \"we just build stuff really fast.\"\n\nSo now I'm looking at potentially adding like 6 hours of meetings per week to a team that is literally 5 people. For what? So we can have a retro where the same 5 people who talk every day can talk about how the sprint went?\n\nI'm not against process when you need it. I've worked at bigger companies where \"real\" Agile made sense because coordination was actually hard. But we don't have a coordination problem. We have a CEO who wants to play startup theater.\n\nHas anyone successfully pushed back on a situation like this? Please lmk if so\n\n\n\nEdit: I don't normally share tools. But I've had multiple people ask what our setup is to move so fast. Like I said, my team uses [cursor](https://cursor.com/home) development and I use [telos](https://www.telos-ai.org) for management",

That’s why you’re shipping so quickly.\n\nWhat your CEO is asking for isn’t really about “proper sprints”. It’s about making the work *look* legible and orderly from the outside. Two-week sprints, quarterly planning, extra check-ins, those are governance signals, not delivery improvements.\n\nThe risk is that you replace a system that’s currently learning in real time with startup theatre. Six extra hours of meetings for five people doesn’t create better outcomes when you’re already talking continuously. It just formalises conversations you’re already having and turns learning into reporting.\n\nCeremonies only earn their keep when they solve a real problem, usually decision latency, missing context, or misalignment at scale. You’ve explicitly said you don’t have those problems right now. Adding process in the absence of a constraint usually slows things down, even if it “looks right” in a board deck.\n\nIf this is about investors, the real question isn’t “are we running Scrum properly?”, it’s “how do we show evidence that we’re learning fast and delivering value?”. That can be done without bolting a heavyweight process onto a five-person team that’s already working.\n\nPushing back doesn’t mean being anti-process. It means asking which specific problem these ceremonies are meant to solve, and what evidence you expect to see improve.\n\nThat usually comes down to visibility questions like:\n\n* Can the CEO see what’s been delivered each Sprint?\n* Can stakeholders see it?\n* Is it actually in production?\n* Is there a clear way to show how what’s being delivered ties back to the overall business objectives?\n\nIf those answers are already “yes”, more ceremonies won’t fix anything. If they’re “no”, fix *that* instead of adding meetings.",

Shipping faster than ever could mean he has less visibility into what is really happening, which makes it difficult for him to explain to investors how well things are going. And, shipping fast without industry standard practices makes investors who know a thing or 2 jumpy because they have seen a lot of shiny on the outside, rotten on the inside software get delivered fast that looks great right up until the rot accumulates enough that the whole thing comes crashing down. So, they are probably asking questions he can't answer, and this is his solution.\n\nOf course, the ceremonies don't really help that, but they create the illusions of control that make everyone feel better. \n\nSo, find out the real issues, and more than likely, there are common solutions that you can use to solve those while maintaining team effectiveness.

Add ten teams and some scrum teams were doing three weeks between planned releases.  Team that gravitated toward shorter release cadences would talk of Kanban more so than XP. Safe was a huge thing. More than ten years back SAFe and Less would often (not always) observe 2-week sprints within 4 to 6 week releases and be able to have 20-60 teammates subdivided across tiers/services/apps.\n\nYour boss might be used to one of those longer realities from their past, and simply want to re-implement it.

I may not use it, but it's a great effort to understand the process. \n\nSpeaking of, seeing agilists asking what story mapping is hurts my heart. It's Agility 101. I can understand newer practitioners or non-agilists, but there new excuse in my book for a SM or PO to not know. They are the ones who would be bringing it to the teams.",

However, it's not free if you want to collaborate with others whilst using it, which is kinda the entire premise story mapping is built on, or at least how I read their pricing page [https://miro.com/pricing/](https://miro.com/pricing/)\n\nOne thing I wanted to do with [storymaps.io](http://storymaps.io) was offer live collaboration, and I did that. You can share links to boards with colleagues without sign-up, and you get the real-time benefits of seeing the active user count and their cursors as people move things around and fill in cards, adding the \"doing it together\" feel.\n\nI wanted to make it easier for remote teams (like my own) to build a story map together, take part in the backbone fleshing-out stages, and then decide where things go, rather than the model of one person running it all while others watch and don't participate.",

It's hard to do that over a 7 or 14-day trial; it's not long enough to see a product implemented, and pitching it to your client or company without demonstrating the benefits is a challenge in its own right. \n\nI'm hoping to fill that gap and offer a free sandbox environment, though with fewer premium features. I definitely can't afford to build in AI-driven story maps, ha!

Even as a newbie keen on the idea, I'm selectively taking the bits that make sense to me and leaving the ones that don't. For example, terms like \"backbone,\" \"walking skeleton,\" and \"narrative flow\" sound a bit fluffy to me, so I don't highlight them in the app. Although I understand what purpose they serve, I don't think those names help, and that bias definitely shaped how I built storymaps.io.   \n  \nThere is also some confusion about the right name for lower-level \"task\" cards. I've seen them described as \"details\", \"tasks\", and \"sub-tasks\", so I just settled on tasks as I think it covers all of the above.

On another, it sounded almost identical to a PM with an Agile label. Feels like every company defines it differently.\n\nPart of me thinks this might just be title inflation.

This is what you describe.   \n  \nAnd your asked for solution is: automate the waterfall.  \nYou don't need a better tool, you need better processes to make your team take ownership.\n\nThe most mature teams have 1 task: Deliver change. The ones responsible take ownership over all needed for it. Subtasks only get added for blockers or issues that arise that need input.\n\nWhen your team is not multi disciplinary enough transition can be done by reducing sub tasks to only those entirely necessary, but that create clear ownership of whole blocks of the process needed for delivery. For example: Dev, Test, Doc, Deliver.   \nAnd then only add tasks for specific blockers or issues that arise somewhere in the change. So do not split the Dev down to specific tasks. This is the start of waterfalling.\n\nTransition will never happen when you try and smoothen out the waterfall and just focus on better facilitating the handovers. Transition happens when the team realises they own the solution together.",

The teams I work with who solve this well usually tackle it in two stages.  \n  \nFirst, they build their templates and checklists directly in whatever tool they're already using for work tracking (Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear or whatever else they use). There you can create issue templates with predefined subtasks and assignees. The key is making these templates specific enough to be useful but flexible enough that people actually use them instead of working around them.  \n  \nSecond, and this is the bigger win, they may automate the routine stuff. Instead of manual subtasks for \"run security scan\" or \"update swagger\" they build that into their CI/CD pipeline. The documentation updates and wiki changes become part of their definition of done that gets checked automatically or prompted during code review.  \n  \nThe backlog tool becomes less important when you're not manually tracking repetitive process steps. Teams get much better velocity and consistency when they focus on automating the predictable bits rather than just tracking them better.",

However, you’ll still need to solve for making the work visible at some point, and if you all aren’t located in the same office, that tool needs to be digital.\n\nPart of my checkered past is solving for work management solutions - specifically agile, scaled agile, asynchronous and autonomous team collaboration (“ride a horse 🐴, save a meeting 📆…”). I’m not selling you anything - I’m just passionate about this space). The trick is to not over-engineer and solve for every possible use case, but to start simple, cost effective, and consider scalability.\n\nCouple questions:\n1. Do you guys have a budget for tools or do we need to work with free and/or tools you already have?\n2. Do you have dependencies on other teams that track their work in different tools?\n3. If so, what tools are those?\n4. If no, would they be open to tracking their work that you’re dependent on in your solution?\n\nWe’ll start there. That will give us just enough information to pick a path.\n\nFeel free to DM but I’m happy to work with you on this. I happen to have some free time on my hands and I enjoy creating solutions that support agile teams… as well as helping fellow agile trench-mates : iron sharpens iron 😁\n\nCheers!\nMysti",

Took us 5 years to stabilise the legacy code base, make change cheap, easy, fats and safe, move from 18 month delivery cycles to release on demand.  Drove strong product growth, and kept us alive in a downtown because we delivered stuff all the time, so people kept paying. Product and team still going strong 16 years later.   \n**Key successes : listening to the team, hiring an experienced senior XP developer to help us out of the mess.**\n\n**-** took over as HoD for a group of about 50;  very much zombie-Scrum and firefighting.  Team and Dev leads overwhelmed, lots of burnout, teams-as-silos stuff.  Got rid of the contract agile coach who didn't know what to do, and sent everyone on \"team member to team leader\" training.  That established a common non-technical footing and team members started to step up.  Within 12 weeks \"it was alive\", culture shift and we started to deliver.  Hit a massive (\"impossible!\") delivery target of a huge new value stream inside 12 months, under budget.  \n**Key success : foundational non-technical and leadership skills pushed them over the tipping point, \"eliminate fear\"**",

Culture change and small wins will spread and become viral fireside \"stories\" that are shared. Top down by mandate transformations are more theater than real change.  The model we went through and I pushed was bottom up and middle out. We had management support but not a mandate other than \"get better at delivery.\" Funny story, one of our agile coaches, who had a corporate mindset, kept complaining, \"why doesn't management send a memo telling everyone you have to go agile, these teams are not doing what they are supposed to!\" This made me laugh because if a coach can't help a team see the value of agile methods for themselves and have THEM buy in, no amount of coercion will result in change. Human beings do what is in their best interest and agile, for most, not all, is in their best interest. An empathic coach who can help them through that process, and it takes time, will create lasting change.",

Names, dates, specific numbers that got mentioned. All captured correctly.\n\nBut the nuance gets lost sometimes. Like the summary might say \"team agreed to move forward with option A\" when really the actual conversation was more like \"team is leaning toward option A but wants to think about it more before committing.\" That difference matters a lot.\n\nStarted doing a quick skim of summaries right after calls to catch these. Takes maybe 2 minutes and I've caught a few things that would've caused confusion later if I'd just sent the summary without looking.\n\nHow much do you trust your ai summaries?

You may be surprised. The solution might end up being something else entirely, or you might decide reliability is not important after all if it takes time away from feature factory churn\n* Iterate. The first attempt is always far from perfect. Noise is normal when a team first adopts monitoring software. Work on removing problems that are causing noise, even if those problems are not defects that affect users directly, because noise hides the real defects and erodes our trust in the monitoring solution.",

With a proper bug-handling policy, it's hard to drive that number down to something close to 0 (and keep it there) without lots of good things happening.\n\nRecently I've heard people assert (without proof) that all metrics are gameable, though lead and cycle times are harder to game.  That's probably true, but I recently started thinking about the mathematics of Little's Law in relation to ABA. Here are my thoughts: [Is the ABA Metric Gameable?](https://middleraster.github.io/mathmusings/ABA/IsABAGameable.html) My conclusion: I *think* it's hard or even impossible to game in a way that's not easily detectable.\n\nMy challenge/ask of you:  if you can think of a way to game the ABA metric, one that I haven't already covered in my posts, please let me know, and if we're really lucky, maybe I'll be able to think of a mitigation.\n\nP.S.:  Before we get started, ***please*** note the difference between [throughput and cycle time](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanThoughts.html): they are orthogonal. (I even wrote a [simulator](https://middleraster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanSimulator.html) to show the difference:  you can easily change cycle time, yet throughput stays the same).\n\n  \n\\--UPDATE--\n\nThank you for your responses. \n\n**1)** There seems to be quite a bit of misunderstanding of my ABA metric. It's the average age of the **open** bugs, For example, (not to pick on her post, but it got the most upvotes) Possible-Ebb9889 said:\n\n1. Discover a bug\n2.

Create a ticket when I'm done and checking the code in\n\nThen she claims the ABA for that bug is 0, but *that is measuring something else*, not the average age of the open bugs. \n\nIn my ABA metric, let's suppose that the average bug age of open bugs for her (or her team) was 7 days. She then works on this hidden bug for a week and checks in the fix. At this point, the ABA of the open bugs is now ***14 days:  worse than when she started.*** Not gaming anything:  time is relentless. \n\nThe open bugs age by a day per day, every day. You can't keep that number close to zero unless you can fix bugs quickly and easily, which means having code that is well-factored, simple to understand, well-architectured, with automated tests in place, etc.\n\n**2)** Other people have claimed that closing all the old bugs is \"gaming\" the metric, but I consider closing old bugs a completely appropriate action and is the standard advice for handling old bugs:  if they're really all that important, they'll come back. Again, not gaming anything. Similarly, I'm not claiming every bug has to be fixed; rather, I'm claiming every bug should be fixed immediately or closed immediately.",

If it is treated as a signal, an investigation determines that it is because low priority bugs are accumulating and now the team can decide on the best approach to deal with that situation.

If a bug keeps cropping up, then it probably deserves to bump one of the 30 bugs.\n\nIt's terribly easy to just add a bug to the giant list of bugs without realizing the overhead of doing so. That oldest bug will be triaged again and again and again. There's no shame in acknowledging that some bugs just won't be fixed. It's not quite so easy to explain to someone that their bug won't ever rise to the top of the queue.",

Those two steps I mention come from Patrick Hudson (\"Safety Culture : Theory and Practice\") \n\nIt's solid stuff.

In the 1980s W Edwards Deming was saying the same stuff about Lean (in \"out of the Crisis\")\n\nIt's nothing new.  Go as far back as \"The Human Side of the Enterprise\" in 1960, and Theory-X, Theory-Y.  You get the behaviors you manage for, no more or less.\n\nShow me an organsiation that is struggling with this stuff and then ask three questions:\n\n***- how much time do you expect (and protect) at all levels for reflection, learning and improvement?***\n\n***- do you expect leadership interactions with staff to be mostly transformative, or transactional?***\n\n***- what does your technical and non-technical professional development programme look like?***",

Also, a personal Kanban with \"to do,\" \"doing\" and \"done.\" Cards should have estimates (Fibonacci?) and due dates.  Take some time to poke fun at command and control pm systems.  😉\n\n2.  Legos!  A single, kinda big model that breaks into subassemblies well.  The kids decompose the project, sort into backlog states, and touch base a couple times to update.  Not sure what the timing is on this, probably like 10-15 minute \"sprints\" so you can have a couple. \n\n3. Individual time to lay out all their current assignments into personal Kanbans.
