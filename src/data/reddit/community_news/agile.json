If you're planning to put an order for a monthly build of 10.000 units (or even a one-shot order), the EMS and procurement  needs to know weeks, maybe even months ahead, when the manufacturing documents are ready, and when delivery are to start. \n\nBut none of the methods - not even scrum@scale or SAFe - are able to combine the path growing FROM a small team TO a world-wide enterprise. They break down once the company needs to face the facts: They can't do every project they want, because the money is limited. \n\nIf you plan on launching a major change to coincidence with Halloween, and another project is working on the black Friday project and the third is working on the holiday season clearence, and a fourth one deals with new regulations, those projects must start planning the work way ahead in order to not step on each other's toes the month before launch. \n\nOr, those methods (especially SAFe) provide way too much overhead for a small company to manage.\n\nOne of the things I think agile fail to address, is that on a higher level, product management needs to know at certain project gates if they are going to take the next step in the project or kill it completely. The latter doesn't meen running rm -rf /src, but even if they realize halfway through a €500 M project they are on the wrong path, making any meaningful change on the project goal level still means the project goes back to square one since that inevitably means a non-trivial change of requirements, priorities, team interdpendencies or even dependencies on deliverables that other projects expects this project to deliver.\n\nWith any decently sized project (even if we're only talking about €5 M in size), there's inevitably going to be a lot of teams involved, and neither developers, scrum masters or even individual teams' product owners might be the ones in direct contact with customers. Delivery of a feature that a customer actually see, might involve several teams' workpackages, developed over a period of sprints.\n\nNot to mention the fact, people come and go in the teams and projects. People that would be perfect to allocate for a specific project might not be available because they are currently busy working with another project, so the team's actual knowledge might be limited.\n\nFrom my experience as PO - and software development in general for the last 25+ years - I do believe scrum works, and it works well on a team level.",

The real failure happens when teams pretend they’re optimizing for one set of principles while being governed by another. Alignment beats purity every time. Bottom line: agree on the principles, be honest about the constraints, and be pragmatic about the practices. Labels don’t deliver value, people do.",

And a solid senior who guides this process.  \n\n\nNote on scrum: If scrum doesn't appear to work have sessions with all the people involved. Take the agile manifesto and use this as a lense to look at how scrum is currently applied. This usually yields enough improvements. ",

Oh we need X from another team first - Congratulations, you've discovered a dependency that is preventing your team from operating in a truly independent manner. Scrum did what it was intended to do: Find issues. It's up to you to fix it.\n2. The PRD was vague, now PO wants something different - It's gonna happen. But what changed to cause the PO to change their mind? Increased understanding of the problem space? That's a good thing.\n3. This turned out to be way more complex than estimated - That's gonna happen as well, even in cases where you thoroughly investigate the problem first. Good thing we didn't waste a lot of time estimating. Just split the story and move on.\n4. We discovered an edge case that changes everything - Awesome. Understanding increased. Value generated. Perfect. Now the ball is back in the POs court.\n\nLook, we know creating perfect plans is hard and diminishing returns bites pretty hard, pretty quickly. So:\n\n* We plan for small increments\n* We don't waste a lot of time planning\n* We get in there and start working, where the learning really happens\n* We deal with whatever pops up.\n\nThat's new product development in an uncertain problem space.\n\nNow, if you don't NEED that, that's cool.

He has individual 1:1s with each of us but no regular group sync, and largely expects us to self-organise.\n\nOn day one, he shared a document outlining responsibilities:\n\t•\tSenior PM: strategy and stakeholder relationships\n\t•\tMe: Scrum process and delivery\n\t•\tJunior PM: coordination and release support\n\nI started by running discovery workshops to understand current team practices and then gradually introduced Scrum cadence, with the aim of reducing change fatigue and bringing teams along through retrospectives and workshops.\n\nThe problem is that the other two PMs keep interfering with the areas I am meant to own:\n\n\t•\tThey attend Scrum ceremonies and publicly challenge or derail meetings with questions and suggestions\n\t•\tIn 1:1 conversations, they talk about plans to coach teams on estimation and process\n\t•\tThe senior PM now wants to do a “big bang” presentation telling all teams to follow a strict Scrum process immediately as she is not able to collect meaningful data from current state of Jira. \n\nShe also wants to change how I set up Scrum ceremonies and plans to announce during her presentation instead of discussing with me (this is what she told me). She is not my boss though. We both report to the same director and he told me clearly that each of us were individual contributors with not much overlap in our responsibilities.\n\nTeams are already tired of constant change, and having three PMs pushing different ideas is clearly making things worse. Engagement is dropping.\n\nI’ve directly raised this with both PMs and even revisited the original responsibility document together. They acknowledged it in the moment but continued behaving the same way the following week.\n\nI actually asked my manager about potential overlap during my first week in this company and he said he didn’t see much overlap between us. However, in practice, it feels like a competition over ownership of delivery and process.\n\nI’m UK-based, while my manager, the other PMs, and most teams are offshore. I’m worried about escalating too hard and being seen as “difficult” or as rocking the boat, but the current setup isn’t working and is actively harming delivery.\n\nHow would you handle this?",

The responsibility doc exists, but it isn’t being *used* to resolve conflict, so people default to influence and visibility instead. That’s why direct conversations haven’t stuck.\n\nA few practical moves that tend to work without blowing things up:\n\nFirst, stop debating process in public forums. When ceremonies get derailed, acknowledge the input and park it. Then follow up offline. Over time this makes it clear that ceremonies aren’t a free for all and reduces performative interference.\n\nSecond, shift the escalation away from personalities and toward impact. Frame it to your manager as “teams are getting conflicting signals and delivery is slowing” rather than “PM X is stepping on my toes.” Managers act faster on risk to outcomes than on interpersonal tension.\n\nThird, ask for one thing from your manager, not a big reorg. For example, a short recurring PM sync with explicit decision rights, or a clear rule that delivery and Scrum changes funnel through one owner. You’re not asking for power, you’re asking for clarity.\n\nFourth, document decisions in writing and circulate them. Not heavy docs, just clear summaries. When someone later contradicts it, you can point to alignment already reached instead of re arguing.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that in environments like this, delivery only stabilizes when someone actively protects it. If your manager won’t do that, you have to make the risk visible without making it personal. Otherwise the teams will keep absorbing the chaos for you, and that’s usually what leadership notices too late.",

On a team level, flow metrics are much more valuable since they are focused on the throughput of value rather than activity.\n\nThere's is one central question you should ask yourself regarding metrics: with what intent are you measuring?\n\nMost organizations you will find they measure to exert control. They mean to ensure teams are producing enough to keep the money printer going. Aside from the obvious lack of trust this lays bare (and trust is the foundation for any agile enterprise to succeed) it also evokes Goodheart's Law. For those not familiar with it:\n\n>*\"****When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure****\"*\n\nMeasuring to control, reward or punish basically means that any metric will be gamed for the advantage of the people at the receiving end. This is where you get your watermellon reports from (green on the outside, red on this inside)\n\nHowever, if you leverage metrics for learning instead, there is no incentive to bullshit the results. In fact, it incentives to create more accurate data in order to perform better, increase flow, and create better, more satisfying outcomes. This of course requires that the organization *trusts* teams (and the people that compose them) to do the right things.",

The goal is to have this at zero. Teams should finish the sprint with nothing in progress. This doesn't include items in Todo (if the work didn't start, then it's not in progress). The wanted behavior is that there is no spillover, since it restricts the amount of high prio work we can pick next sprint. This is trivial to achieve regularly when teams know how to slice items mid sprint.\n\n\n\n\nBacklog Ranking of items picked for next sprint. The goal is to pick the top items. If the picked items are #3 and #4, we should ask why #1 & #2 were passed over. The wanted behavior is that teams respect the po's priority as much as possible. No point in a PO if the teams pick whatever they want and ignore priority. ",

          "text": "Appreciate the thoughts here, but... when it comes to metrics, everyone does them backwards!!!\n\nPeople always first identify the metric they want to track and then they move forward and eye it continuously to make sure the metric meets their interpretation. Wrong!!!\n\nFirst, you have to state - WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU\"RE TRYING TO SOLVE?\n\nThen, you can select the metrics that help baseline the problem and also metrics that would help track improvement. \n\nBut, the biggest failure is assuming that one or a few metrics are needed to create a picture. No. Its almost like the laws of forces in physics - \"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\". Tweaking one metric and optimizing one thing - usually triggers de-optimization of another. \n\nFor example, if you want to improve quality, get ready for slower pace of work, get ready for less new things getting done, get ready to direct more attention to bugs and support cases, which again lead to slowing down the pace of developing new things. \n\nThe next thing - how you track things is important. Do you track of averages, or do you look at specific work item and how each went? Because averages will get you in trouble. Don't focus on averages, focus on those where things are wrong. Imagine target shooting, if you keep hitting the grouping, that's not bad. To improve, focus on addressing the shots outside the grouping.\n\nSo the metrics here identified as the \"RIGHT\" metrics. Not really, they are just \"another set\" of metrics.\n\nFlow time --> how long work actually takes   >>> first, lets define it right, its now how long it takes, its how long it takes to get to the customer in production. Which is basically cycle-time + deployment time, or implementation time. Why is this important? Do you really need to track every work item delivery to the customer? Why? Customer doesn't care about all items equally. Maybe if you're running a tech consultancy, or custom dev shop, but otherwise, not really important IMHO.\n\nThroughput --> how many items are finished per unit of time >>> Unless you're following #noestimates, this serves no value. Especially if you pick up varying amounts of different type of work, because you can't decompose everything into equally measurable elements of scope. And throughput can be abused no worse than Velocity. \"Why did you guys complete only 15 items instead of throughput of 20 you got every 2 weeks for the past 3 months?\" Shitty question to ask, and even worse to answer. But... it WILL be asked.\n\nWIP --> how much work is started but not finished >>> Do you mean average WIP? Or are you trying to keep track of the limit for one team? Are you trying to track activity across multiple projects and teams to detect lack of organizational focus towards a common goal? WIP by itself is just a number. Its an indicator that serves more the most value while working, not historically from past sprints. Exceed the WIP and hit the limit? Great! Take action. Don't hit the limit for a while and the work is slow? Then limit is too large!\n\nWork item age --> how long current work has been stuck >>> Means nothing if nobody is tracking it and taking action. Not all work is same size. So what's your \"Work Item Age\" red line that has everyone asking questions? And why does the conversation about things needing help are not brought up in the daily? As a matter of fact, running a good daily makes Work Item Age metric obsolete. Its only value is if someone is stepping away from the team for a while and then coming back would like to quickly catch up to understand what's happening. \n\nSo all in all, metrics are important, but not all metrics are equal or better than another in various environments.",

With this education you are able to talk to professionals on a same level, knowing what each terms means exactly and explicitly in order to avoid implicit misconceptions. A few sentences are not enough here to explain the theory and value of a PMP, its knowledge areas, project phases and artifacts. \n\nPractice and experience is equally important, combined with a PMP you will be dream PM for every employer.\n\nSimple example: Scrum Masters without any profound knowledge and certifications, proclaiming themselves as best in practice not needing any classes, are usually the ones who mess everything up. There are too many people in the market with half-baked superficial knowledge talking down the value of certification and education, not willing to invest in these due to lack of will, dedication, putting real effort into something etc. - quick and dirty without sustainability. \n\nI am sure I may get a lot of downvoted for that, but if you want to outstand from the grey mass of pseudo-PMs without any proper education, get a reliable certification and improve yourself on actual professional knowledge.",

Someone can have 10+ years experience and still be crap at their job and not know the basics. Plus, a lot of people lie and extremely exaggerate their experience. Like the teacher who wants to switch careers and claims they have 5+ years of project management because they managed children. The PMP ensures they know the basics or at least been exposed to the concepts. \n\nPerfect? Not by a long shot. But PMP vs non-pmp and I'm more likely to hire the PMP. When there are hundreds of applications coming in it's an easy way to weed out applicants. Won't guarantee you a job, but you're less likely to be tossed out. It wouldn't be a problem if people didn't lie on their resume and companies figured out a better way to hire people. But alas. This is where we are at.",

We know that some people embellish resumes and others are just \"good interviewers.\" Beyond, but oftentimes including certs, one needs not only proof of work experience, but the requisite soft skills to show one's true potential as a PM. Especially if one is to be leveraged towards critical, complex, and strategic projects in the business.\n\nLet's be honest, the PMP is not easy to get. For the vast majority of people, it takes serious study and rigor. I have never met any PM who achieved the PMP by taking the test cold, without any (or just a little) study. Conversely, I achieved my Scrum Master and Product Owner certs with just a week's worth of study for each (to be fair, those frameworks are light by design which does not make them inadequate). In my program, PMs with a PMP or PRINCE2 - for my European PMs - generally outperform those without them. What we have observed across our PMs is that the cert provides a common framework for governance and execution that is hard to replicate.\n\nBut, do we hire PMs without certification? Absolutely. We still hire uncertified PMs if their communication and skill-specific thought logic show obvious value. If they are the right fit, we will hire a PM and actually pay to get them certified later.\n\nThe PMP isn’t a magic pill, but it’s far from decorative. It’s a tool that, when combined with the right personal/professional attributes, makes a huge difference. Is it the end all, be all? No. It isn't.",

          "text": ">**Payment Triggers:** If you are delivering incrementally (e.g., every 2 weeks), do you actually invoice every 2 weeks?\n\nIn my experience, organizations, especially larger enterprises, have policies around how they pay. In one organization, outside of paying for specific jobs (think facilities services, or from software/IT, a penetration test with a defined scope), it was a pain to have a contract that was less than a year. When we wanted to buy a SaaS product, if the vendor didn't have the desired terms, we needed to use a reseller. Paying per iteration is probably the most by-the-book \"Agile\", it's also not necessarily the most realistic.\n\nDepending on the context, you also may want to separate iteration from incremental delivery. Is your customer really accepting a delivery every 2 weeks? You may be getting feedback every 2 weeks, but you may only be delivering to production every month or two or even three. Not all customers want frequent production changes, outside of resolving critical defects and security patches.\n\nShort story: you'll probably need to separate payment cycles from your development process and account for this in the agreements and contracts, especially what happens (penalties and refunds) if they want to end the arrangement early for any reason.  \n\n\n>**The \"Half-Done\" Problem:** In civil, if a contractor leaves, usually a consulting firm hired by the contractee measure what they built and approve the payment. In software, if a vendor delivers \"90% of a feature\" and leaves, that 90% is often useless to the next vendor (who might want to rewrite it). How do you protect against paying for \"useless 90% code\"?\n\nMost of my experience is in fields where the customer doesn't get the software. They are either buying a physical product (sometimes configured to meet a particular customer's needs) that contains software or they are buying software as a service. In these cases, this isn't applicable.\n\nThe \"Agile\" answer goes back to your first question. If you're paying often, you're seeing at least demonstrations of working software very quickly and understanding the cost. You can compare value to cost and end the arrangement if things seem to be going out of control. But, seeing my answer to that part, plenty of organizations choose not to work that way, meaning they don't see the financial benefits of very short iterations and small increments.\n\nIf you are working in a situation where you deliver code to a customer, it would be on them to work with future vendors to understand the implications of using that code versus throwing it away and starting again. If you're outsourcing software development, you probably don't have the technical resources to evaluate the technical decisions made, so I'm not sure what options are available to protect yourself.  \n\n\n>**Bidding:** Do you bid purely on hourly rates? Or do clients demand a \"Fixed Price\" for a scope that hasn't been designed yet? How it mainly works in contracts?\n\nI've usually seen time-based rates for SaaS products that account for the teams supporting the product, infrastructure costs, growth, and profit margins. For custom or configured software, it was usually a cost-plus contract, either a fixed fee or goal-based incentives, with a set timeline for renewing the contract.",

About a year in total.\n\nThere was no acceptance step with the client-side project team we directly worked with. They only got a high-level work log (\"X hours spent on doing migrations, Y hours on solving issues / doing custom solutions, Z hours on project management\"). They knew the rest due to daily stand-ups, dashboards showing completed migration ticket numbers, and a weekly status report. There was a formal signoff on the invoice amount, but that did not relate to looking at our work directly. Just normal corporate stuff. \n\nWe did UAT at the end-user level (\"Is it all still there and the latest version?\"), but they had no authority in the project or the cost.\n\nAnother team in my company had a similar project that was paid on migration tickets completed instead of time and material. But that was always considered the client having raked us over the coals. It was the status of *their messed-up server* environment that caused a lot of extra working hours. So *they* have to deal with the extra cost.\n\nGenerally, in consulting it's better to charge based on effort, not outcome. You have to deal with somebody else's shit, and the causer of that shit should bear the (financial) burden. If you work in your own environment as a normal developer, that might be a less clear-cut, because now the server-mess delay is your own fault.",

If that is the case here, I would expect questions around working with a development team, helping shape and prioritize a roadmap, and translating goals into work the team can actually deliver.\n\nSince this is an initial HR screen, I would not expect deep situational or technical questions. It is more likely they will focus on your background, the kinds of teams you have worked with, and examples of accomplishments you are proud of, either individually or as part of a team.\n\nThey also tend to listen closely for how you collaborate with other roles, such as architects, engineering leads, UX designers, scrum masters, and stakeholders. At this stage, they are often trying to confirm fit, communication style, and whether your experience lines up with how they define the PO role internally.\n\nI suggest asking them about expectations from this role, specifically because the expectations differ from organization to organization.",

Don't overthink it or try to fake deep Agile expertise you don't have yet. Be honest about being newer to the formal PO title but confident about your transferable skills in prioritization, stakeholder management, and translating business needs into actionable work. They're testing if you're worth passing to the hiring manager, not if you can recite the Scrum Guide.\n\nThe biggest red flags they're listening for are bad-mouthing previous employers, unclear career motivations, unrealistic salary expectations that waste everyone's time, or someone who clearly has no idea what a Product Owner actually does. Your background is actually solid for this transition - data-driven decision making and stakeholder translation are core PO competencies - so just connect those dots clearly and show genuine interest in the product ownership path. If you want to practice articulating your experience in terms that resonate with PO interview questions, I built [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to help with exactly that - it gives real-time guidance on how to frame your answers when you're navigating these transitions.",

Would you rather we spend 3 days working on it or would you rather know when you're going to get it?\"  \n  \nThen we make them sit with us and clarify the requirements until we can have enough detail to provide an estimate that actually has some fidelity.\n\nThey usually answer \"we don't know\" to too many questions and we say \"Since you don't know what 'it' is, I don't know when 'it' will be done.\"\n\nIf, through some modern miracle, there is enough definition to break the feature into small stories, my team leads check the  team calendar to see capacity, planned time off, other things that will diminish our capacity\n\nThey then pad the estimate again before telling me (a director), and then I double it again.",
