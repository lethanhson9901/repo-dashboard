      "text": "I’ve been working at this company for 10 years, currently as a manager overseeing several IT teams. The company has its own internal IT department building internal products. When I started, we were moving from classic waterfall to Scrum. Like in any big corporation (2,000+ people in IT alone), it was slow and painful.\n\nDemos were basically walking through the backlog and accounting for every single task. Sprints had no real goal. Former analysts became Product Owners, and people with the least actual work were sent to Scrum Master trainings. Dailies were used by team leads to check if everyone was “doing something.” The organization cared about how much we delivered and how late it was - not *what* we delivered or what value it brought. A textbook “agile transformation.”\n\nBut after a few years, real change started to show. POs really dug into their domains and had deep knowledge of customers and competitors. IT invested in DevOps to speed up releases. Architecture evolved from one big monolith deployed 5 times a year into hundreds of independent microservices deployed on demand. Backlogs started to reflect actual customer needs instead of just task lists. Employee engagement scores were well above industry average in every survey. Over all of this watched a transformation department made up of Scrum Masters and change leaders.\n\nThen the board changed.\n\nThe new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed. Suddenly the board started blaming department directors for not delivering *their* goals. Directors started holding POs accountable for their existing roadmaps while trying to kill future increments to make room for “the strategy.” At the same time, IT directors bypassed POs entirely and pushed architectural changes under the label of “technical debt.”\n\nTeams ended up with three priorities: one from the PO, one from “the business,” and one from IT. Every delay caused fights between these three sides, finger-pointing, and accountability theater. A year passed. The board’s strategy was not delivered.\n\nSo the board decided to fire the entire transformation department (including all Scrum Masters) and introduced “improvement actions” to make sure this would never happen again.\n\nThose improvements included:\n\n* assigning an additional Project Manager to every PO to “help deliver projects on time”\n* abandoning story points in favor of estimating every task in days\n* limiting time for technical debt and bugs (!) to 10% and strictly enforcing reporting\n* hiring additional analysts to create Feature Requirement Documents for every product to “help IT estimate better and improve predictability”\n\nAll of this, of course, branded as *improving our agile way of working*.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nMore than half of the teams I know haven’t released a single change to production since then. Some teams still haven’t received FRDs for any change at all - analysts have been working on documentation for 6 months, and IT doesn’t even know what’s in it yet. I personally reviewed one of those documents (they had dependencies on my system) and saw that an FRD for a simple change was already 100 pages long.\n\nAt one point they asked me to confirm a single variable. I told them I’d look at it in a month because I was working on something else. They replied that in a month they’d already be assigned to another project and wouldn’t be able to update the document anymore.\n\nI’ve also heard Project Managers explicitly telling teams *not* to log time spent on technical debt, because we’d burn through our yearly 10% too fast and wouldn’t have any left for “more important bugs” later.\n\n10 years of transformation.  \nBuried in 6 months.\n\nI’m watching all of this from the sidelines. My department hasn’t gone through the new “transformation” yet and we’re still working the old way - just the team and the PO. We’re the last department in line for the great enlightenment. I’m going to try to use this time to prove to everyone above that the “old” system can still be efficient. Wish me luck - the last island of agility in this waterfall of despair.\n\nIn my opinion, the board threw the baby out with the bathwater. After the first year they clearly lost trust in POs and dismantled the entire system instead of trying other approaches. Not all POs were good at their job, and that’s probably the most important lesson I’m taking away from this whole story: being a PO is brutally hard and comes with real responsibility. Not everyone is cut out for it, and not everyone should take on that role. And paradoxically, over the last few months the best POs left, while the worst ones stayed - still pretending to be product owners, even though most of their decision-making power is already gone.",

          "text": "This is one of the most honest posts I've read here in a while. \n\nThe part that's going to bother people is that both sides of your story prove the same thing. Agile was never the variable. Organizational power structure was.   \n\nWhen the old board gave teams space, invested in DevOps, let POs grow into their domains, things improved. Not because of Scrum. Because leadership created conditions where competent people could do good work.   \n\nWhen the new board showed up they didn't kill Agile. They killed the conditions that made it work. Then blamed the framework for failing. Then replaced it with 100-page FRDs and project managers layered on top of POs. That's just waterfall with extra steps and a body count.   \n\nThe part about PMs telling teams not to log technical debt time. That's not process improvement. That's cooking the books. Everyone in the room knows it but nobody can say it because the people who created the rule are the ones who'd have to hear it.   \n\nYour observation about the best POs leaving while the worst stayed is a pattern I've seen over and over. You strip decision-making power from a role, the people who were good at making decisions leave. The ones who were always just going through the motions don't even notice the difference.   \n\nGood luck being the last island, I mean that. But start documenting your results now., delivery frequency, incident rates, team retention. When the \"great enlightenment\" reaches your department, the only thing that might save you is numbers that make someone above pause before flipping the switch.",

Organization leaders will make or break any organizational transformation; and new leadership that lacks understanding of the current approach can easily destroy all progress with a few insufficiently-thought out changes. \n\nEvery successful transformation had full support from senior leaders. Every failure involved one of two factors: for whatever reason the senior leader refused to enforce the changes and gave people 'wriggle room' to not adopt the changes or to selectively adopt things, or the senior leader actively sabotaged the transformation. \n\nToo many times, a successful transformation that had been in place and working fantastically well for several years was destroyed by new management coming in, not understanding the current approach and why it worked, rejecting it for summary reasons (\"this is not how to do software\" or \"my way is better\") and destroying all progress. As a result, I've taken a client from bad to excellent, seen excellent endure for several years, then the people who grew up with the system leave, new leaders come in, and everything is scrapped. \n\nI realize that I'm an Agile Sisyphus... you know, the guy who was condemned by the Gods to roll a boulder to the top of the hill, and just as he reached the top the Gods would come in and give the boulder a shove so that it rolled back to the bottom so Sisyphus could start all over. I guess it means good coaches and consultants will always have a job, but in reality it's sad and disappointing to see people destroy what they don't understand.",

Eventually the company started to shift in things that actually matter. The would have go there sooner if, instead of introducing Scrum, leaders had simply asked teams what would enable them to go faster and built better things - and tried those approaches, learning along the way. Scrum was a false goal, a distraction, blocking true agility.\n\n\"The new board introduced a new one-year strategy. This strategy had little to do with the product visions owned by individual POs and was pushed into IT through side channels. Chaos followed.\"\n\nYes, the board stepped in an forced a top-down plan on everyone.

      "text": "At my last company Agile was real. Leadership backed it. The business understood it. Teams actually existed. Product owners owned something. It was not perfect, but it was honest and it delivered value more often than excuses.\n\nThen I came to this place that promised a big Agile transformation. What I walked into was project management with a new paint job.\n\nTwo months after I joined, new boss. Zero tech background. His boss? Zero tech background, but twenty plus years of traditional PM thinking and a deep love for dashboards that measure absolutely nothing useful. And the mindset that he’s right about everything and knows everything.\n\nNow we are “Agile” because we hold standups and shove work into ADO, which is a horrible tool, been begging for JIRA since Day 1. Leadership converts story points into days to close like math is optional and common sense is a rumor.\n\nThe newest brilliant idea is a KPI for velocity tracking. Not to help teams improve. Not to learn anything. Just to have a KPI to make it look like we’re doing something.\n\nThey also created a “demand intake process” and tried to make it Agile. It used to be a ticket queue with paperwork. Now it is a ticket queue with epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria that read like a legal contract. Same red tape, just wrapped in Scrum vocabulary.\n\nThere are no real teams. Everyone works on their own thing. Minimal collaboration. Priorities flip every couple of days. Ceremonies are status meetings with new names. Product ownership doesn’t exist, there’s no product. We are not Agile.\n\nSo I am stepping away from Agile for a while. Unless someone at the top decides to actually understand what Agile is, this will never change. They will keep measuring the wrong things, rewarding the wrong behavior, and acting shocked when nothing improves.\n\nAnyone else stuck in a similar Agile transformation?\n\nOh, and my boss uses ChatGPT to reply to every email the team sends now. Is that a new thing people are experiencing? Should I follow suite?",

As a Tester for many, many years, I need this information to be able to deduce if something has been implemented correctly (also understanding the hierarchy of functionality is handy).  Acceptance Criteria is crucial for me as tester to be able to deduce how 'well' whatever has been built.  That's not red tape, that's someone doing their job properly when they create PBI's.\n\n'Priorities flip every few days'.  Yup, that's part of having an Agile mindset.  The PO can change their mind about what the team builds every single day if they deem it necessary.  Sure, it's a pain in the arse and it's entirely inefficient, but being able to change direction is exactly what Agile teaches.  \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with velocity tracking, although it should primarily be used by Feature Teams themselves for their own reflection/planning.  Once you start to see external Stakeholders use the metrics, then be cautious.  Caveat, I have seen Finance departments use velocity to calculate the cost of Sprints in order that they fund teams appropriately.  Understanding that there is an eco system around teams is a very good thing.  You don't exist in isolation.  \n\nThere are no ceremonies mentioned in the Agile manifesto.  This sounds like you don't understand things, your points are vague.  Are you referencing Scrum here?  Agile is a set of mindset behaviour and principles, makes no reference to US points or how US's should be formulated for example.  \n\nWhen someone starts to criticise something, I always ask them to suggest something better.  Usually, they can't.  Don't be one of those people.  ",

Real Agile gives teams authority to say no, to push back on priorities, to own technical decisions. That's uncomfortable for people who spent 20 years with command-and-control, so they take the vocabulary, keep the structure, and call it transformation.\n\nThe velocity KPI is almost impressively honest though. They're not even hiding it, \"just to have a KPI to make it look like we're doing something\" — at least someone said the quiet part out loud.\n\nThe demand intake process thing is the one that stuck with me. You described a ticket queue with paperwork that became a ticket queue with epics and acceptance criteria. The red tape didn't go away, it got a product backlog and acceptance criteria. That's not transformation, that's liability distribution, now everyone can point to the story and say they followed the process when it fails.\n\nChatGPT emails are a separate disease.

Well-run planning sessions are an example (as compared to someone projecting Jira on a screen while everyone else just watches). Training people is MUCH harder when everyone is remote, but it can be done.\n\nNow counter that with the productivity and mental health gains of not having to commute, working in a comfortable space, being able to take breaks when needed, etc., and I think the gains at least balance the drawbacks.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, but I'm firmly in the \"get together in person when it makes sense to do to, otherwise work wherever you're most productive\" camp.\n\nAs for the Manifesto, it represents a \"point in time\" state of the industry where we were railing against the massive processes that delivered more binders of requirements and change requests than actual value. We've learned a lot since and I don't think the original needs to be updated. Just go with what we've picked up over the last quarter century.",

I \"grew up\" as a software developer during the same times as the people who wrote it, and experienced the same issues with the massive processes of the 1980s and 1990s. The \"funny\" part is that the complaints I hear today about Scrum and SAFe and other 🐂💩 approaches are the same ones we were making and the same ones that led to the Agile Manifesto being written in the first place!\n\nI'm lucky enough to know several of the authors of the manifesto, count some as friends and to even have worked with some of them. From all that, I know what they were trying to achieve, and for a while in the early 2000s they (we!) did! Things started to go south when the Certified Scrum Master program became popular and you could be \"certified\" after parking your arse in a chair for two days. Scrum also appealed to the project management community because it focused on just that - project management practices - where XP extended those with the technical practices as well.\n\nAnd here we are today, 25 years later, with islands of \"good\" in a vast sea of mediocrity and outright crap. I'm still building software, both hand-writing it and using LLMs, and helping individual teams as I go.\n\nOh, as for no estimates, I haven't estimated a story in years. I have, however, provided forecasts for releases constantly based on progress using story \\*counts\\* (Monte Carlo simulations are fantastic for this). I just break the required work down into the smallest reasonable stories and give a forecast (OK, estimate) based on the delivery rate of prior work.

Just an excuse to make the employee work like donkey for corporate masters and burn them out.\nThe problem is scrum,kanban is all derived from japan. Where they treat workers as piece of machinery and make them work long hours.It has destroyed their society. Once in internet forum I was debating with one of these high priests of agile. He was giving me the example of toyota.  I Just highlighted how it burnt out the employees in the company. The guy didn't respond at all.\nTo those I would say if you have sufficient money to splurge, would you buy a kanban process oriented toyota vehicle or a german made car. Be honest.\nThe agile has burnt out employees in japan, india,china. If you take anonymous survey, 99 percent of people will admit they hate agile. They just don't say it in publicTraditional waterfall was a perfect method. Agile was just an excuse for management and business analyst and product owners to escape responsibility for  not fully gathering the requirements",

We are an architecture/engineering setup with long-running projects, billable hours, resource planning, QA steps, and also a lot of invoicing tied to the work so I feel like Jira feels extremely task-heavy and too focused on software projects to help us with that specifically. We don’t really need epics and sprints as much as we need visibility from proposal to delivery and without integrations if possible tbh. I’m not even sure if this is possible but a girl can dream right?? \n\nCurious what people are using that’s more vertically focused and not just another kanban board with plugins on plugins.",

The only real restriction is you can only have 3 levels of task (epic/issue/subtask) in a project--but a) you can add 2 more if you go cross-project with some of the Advanced Roadmap stuff, and b) you can create issue types that are whatever you want so you don't ever have to use the word epic for any reason.

It just one big initial investment (bloat), but mothers look into a room and fine 10 items half buried within seconds. Or humans drive on the highway and track 10 cars in difficult visibility. Business Accountants and dogmatic \"accountability\" clean coders would rip vision from humans. No need to see colors. Eyes can be smaller.",

Scoping, estimating, and committing made sense when a feature took 2 weeks to build. When the feature ships in 2 days, the sprint isn't a timebox anymore, it's a waiting room.\n\nWhat you're experiencing isn't a process problem. It's the process becoming irrelevant. The backlog turns into a history book because the work moves faster than the documentation layer can capture it. Story points become meaningless when the unit of work changes from \"2 weeks of dev effort\" to \"45 minutes of AI-assisted building plus 3 hours of human review.\"\n\nThe teams I've seen handle this well stopped trying to fit AI-speed work into Scrum-speed ceremonies. What actually works:\n\nContinuous flow with a review gate. No sprints, no planning ceremonies. Work moves through a simple pipeline: define → build → review → ship. The human bottleneck isn't building anymore. It's reviewing. So the process should optimize for review quality, not build velocity.\n\nKill the backlog, keep a priority list. 5-10 items max, ordered by business value. No grooming sessions, no estimation. If something is worth doing, it goes on the list. If it's not top 5, it doesn't exist yet.\n\nDaily async check-ins instead of standups. When work completes in hours not weeks, a synchronous morning meeting is already outdated by lunch.\n\nThe new meta isn't a framework, it's accepting that the ceremonies were always just scaffolding for slow delivery. When delivery gets fast, the scaffolding comes down.",

Organizations start to make big changes and then the change fades and they lose attention and momentum. As I read it I thought of how many coaches and scrum masters I've heard tell the same story. However, I also found myself thinking \"This guy needs to be proud of the change he accomplished. Not every company wants or needs to be a B Corp. And over the weekend I thought, \"I should take my own advice.\"\n\nNot every company wants or needs to be Spotify or whatever company you read about. Sure, I worked a company that changed their industry with Scrum and another that saved their company with it, but most just got a little nicer to work at or gained a smoother deployment process, and honestly, good for them.\n\nI also look around at how software is made now vs in the 80's and 90's and wow has Agile made a big change. Anyone else remember just having architects and BAs work on a project for 6 months and then having a thousand-page long requirements doc to hand to developers and then they couldn't ask the architects anything because they were off on another project? You don't see that around much anymore. And testing - remember how we used to do testing? No unit tests, no testing before you call a feature d9ne. Just build the whole damn thing then send 18 months worth of code over to the testing department and watch the bugs come back in swarms. \n\nWe've changed and improved a lot as an industry and Agile has been a big driver of it. People can dislike Agile all they want, but I don't see any of them running back to the old ways of working. Hope that brightens a few people's day.",

Makes sense that the development process speeds up as well.\n\nThe problem is, organizations leadership don't want to adapt to an agile mindset. They still operate in that factory era mindset.

That era was brutal. \n\nBut I think the honest version of this story is messier than \"Agile made things better.\" What actually killed the old way wasn't the Agile Manifesto. It was version control getting better, CI/CD becoming practical, cloud infrastructure making deployment cheap, and the internet forcing shorter feedback loops. The tooling changed the game. Agile gave it a name and a framework.   \n\nThe part that concerns me is when \"we're better than the 90s\" becomes the bar. Yeah, we are. But that's a low bar. We went from no testing to checkbox testing. From no collaboration to ceremony-driven collaboration. From waterfall to sprints that often run like mini-waterfalls anyway.   \n\nBetter than the 90s? Absolutely. As good as we could be? Not even close.   I don't think the people frustrated with Agile want to go back, they want to go forward. Past the certifications, past the theater, past the process that replaced one kind of rigidity with another. The original manifesto was about people and outcomes. What most of us live with daily is Jira workflows and sprint velocity charts.   \n\nSo yeah. Take the win. The industry is better. But let's not confuse \"better than awful\" with \"good.\"",

In my experience, to be the most effective, the role needs to be people-focused. The goal is to guide the team into constantly improving how they work so that they can effectively and efficiently deliver what the customer needs. The goal is NOT to manage them into succeeding. You can use an unlimited number of tools to do this, but realistically they are all ultimately about the people doing the work. Depending on the needs of the team, this may involve aspects of both project and people management, but at no time should the SM have managerial power over the team or the project. That all too often quickly becomes a conflict of interest with their role.",

And the best probe in an agile context is working, production grade software,  Not wireframes, or PoCs, or requirements, or any of that.\n\nMy go-to approaches tend to be: \n\n**- rapid lean canvas session,** so we are all on the same page on the problem being solved, why it matters, the benefits we want, how we'll measure them, key assumptions/risk and the user domain SMEs (or personas) we will be actively collaborating with when we work;  maybe 2 x 45 minute sessions, with a \"into backlog\" or \"rejected\" outcome\n\n**- user story mapping** with a couple of those SMEs, and the \"three amigo\": pattern;  record the session\n\n**- XP delivery;**  user domain SMEs embedded in and co-creating with the team, thin value slices, \"end-to-end\" skeleton first then add stuff by risk/value and get ultra fast feedback.\n\nIf the business is worried about investment risk then wrap Scrum round the outside, so you can make \"continue/stop/pivot\" decisions in a short cycle and invest one Sprint at a time, while delivering multiple increments per Sprint.\n\nWhich is all \"agile\" really ever was; make change cheap, easy fast and safe (no new defects) and get ultra-fast feedback on what is valuable. \n\nExercises like \"elephant carpaccio\" really bring this home for developers, as does the \"journey to work\" exercise in Jeff Patton's book on user story mapping\n\n[https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide](https://blog.crisp.se/2013/07/25/henrikkniberg/elephant-carpaccio-facilitation-guide) \n\n",

This just seems like a terrible metric to me. \n\nStory points are meaningless to upper management. Each team in our department is averaging a different amount of story points. We also implemented Agile about 4 months ago, so everyone is still getting the hang off how to point out stories, and breaking stories into appropriate sizes. \n\nI asked them what they hope to achieve with these metrics, and they said that they wanted to demonstrate that \"we're doing agile and getting stuff done.\" Basically they want to justify our existence and try to insulate us from cuts. \n\nSIGH, does anyone have thoughts on better metrics? \n\nFor additional context, this is an infrastructure department that largely does O&M, and has occasional upgrades. There's a lot of help desk type work from customers dealing with issues. A lot of their tasks are upgrading the existing systems to meet compliance and security guidance that's coming from other departments/government. So I can't really use metrics like features pushed, etc. ",

(Or if what the did over the last six months wasn’t done, then what?)  \nCan be scary because the answer might be a couple of things that had impacts and many things that in retrospect made no difference. \n\nThen, for these impacts, are there metrics relating directly to them? Or second-level metrics around the speed/lag/delay caused to others? And asynchronous/disconnected benefits or costs (think quality, stability and reliability and associated risks)\n\nUp to this point, you’ll have external metrics that are defined/measured outside the team. A next level might be to derive metrics around the behaviour internal to the team for the teams own use (velocity is one of these, possibly) but from an org/exec level, they should be interesting but useless - outside the team the only thing that matters is impact on the wider organisation. \n\nSuggest reading The Goal, It’s Not Luck and The Phoenix Project.",

And frankly, points are fraught enough just internal to the team.\n\nOff the top of my head though, I'd say meaningful metrics (these are the ones I'm working at reporting for my group) could be along the lines of: SLO performance for key systems, number of tickets submitted, MTTR for tickets, some metric on open CVEs (I'm not sure the best metric here but security is important,) cost savings (obviously that one can't go forever but if you help a team cut a $10k service then take some credit for your involvement!)\n\nNone of those things are about \"agile\" per se, and in my opinion that's a feature rather than a bug. The point of \"agile\" has been to adapt pragmatically to the needs of the business, so using metrics that match that just makes sense. Think of it as Goodheart's Law used for good.",

That's valuable.\n\nMy estimation approach is not conventional; I teach relative estimation of 'units of work' and calculate velocity as units of work per iteration. Units of work are independent of the people/team doing the work, just as a mile is a mile regardless of who's running it. \n\nIn your world, it might be better just to calculate an 'issue velocity,' i.e., how many tickets your team (not individuals) can process to completion per unit of time (weekly or bi-weekly, whichever makes sense). What makes this useful for your team is that it gives you something concrete to use to assess process changes; if you come with idea to improve the way your team works and implement it, then issue velocity should increase. \n\nLean teams use throughput (the same thing as issue velocity), cycle time (the time it takes for an issue/work item to go through the entire workflow from when work actually starts on it until it's complete), and lead time (cycle time plus the time the issue waits from when it's created until work actually starts). These are three good metrics that can tell you how well you're doing, whether process changes increase efficiency or decrease it, and give you an idea of how long customers have to wait to get issues resolved. They are basic for process improvement, too.\n\nYour team should focus on the Lean metrics, measure them for a few weeks to get a baseline (a statistic of 1 is useless), and then try a process improvement change to see what impact it has on the metrics.\n\nI will tell you that I've worked with many teams (in the hundreds) and used these simple metrics plus techniques from Theory of Constraints and the Kanban Method to double, triple, even quadruple throughput in 90 days.",

Because you should 100% be able to collect that data and in fact you should already be collecting that data and presenting it. Especially if you are just starting. You need data from before agile to reference value achieved post implementation.\n\nAs for velocity, of course every team has a different velocity, that is a given. But velocity is a critical metric of teams running sprints. In fact if you are not tracking velocity, then why bother with sprints at all? I take it a step further and teams running sprints should track for a velocity variance of +/-10%. Because if you have a team that has a velocity of 44, but looking at the last 5 sprints if they have sprints of 48, 63, 29, 47, 32, those are wildly different outcomes painting a picture of instability, which would then spring the question, why? was it due to holidays, PTO, or did work get stuck then get flooded, low backlog health. Velocity for sprint teams is absolutely crucial for many more reasons as well.\n\n",

You'd be better of hiring some good XP people and doing cheap modern leadership courses for everyone.  **(Done both.  Works great.)**\n\nPLUS - \n\n**Transformations don't work.  They really, really don't.**    \n  \nThey pick the low hanging fruit - restructure, new jobs, new events/meetings and it's out with Gant Charts, in with Scrum Boards.

It also makes sense if you need stakeholders managed more closely and often, especially if you have multiple stakeholders fighting for priority of a single backlog. \n\nPI plannings are absolutely terrible if you plan in detail and plan individuals instead of a team (ergo not doing scrum in the first place). If you have a true scrum team, you can quickly plan stories, defined solely with \"description\", asking the team if it is a small enough vertical slice, and just breaking them into small batches.

Teams that succeed spend serious time on backlog refinement, dependency mapping, and having honest conversations about capacity before they walk into that room. The PI planning should be about alignment and commitment, not figuring out what you're actually building for the first time. When teams use Programs for the cross-team coordination between planning sessions, they tend to show up way more prepared and the actual planning becomes much more focused.  \n  \nAfter about 18 months, most organisations either figure out how to make SAFe work for them or they start scaling it back to something more manageable.

Every { and } goes on its own line. Every function parameter goes on its own line.  Plenty of spacing between lines of code.  Etc\n\nLOC goes up everyone is happy you look great and nothing actually improves. \n\nI’ve also seen this go the other way where devs heavily refactor so the metrics show negative numbers for LOC produced which is fun",

Under a LOC metric that would have counted as negative productivity.\n\nThe fact that they want to track authorship too tells you this isn't about improving anything. It's about blame assignment disguised as performance management. When something breaks they want to know whose name is on the commit.\n\nHere's what actually happens when teams measure LOC: engineers pad code instead of refactoring, nobody wants to delete anything because it looks like negative output, and the codebase bloats until it becomes unmaintainable. You optimize for the metric, not for the product.\n\nThe real question isn't whether you're in trouble. It's whether your leadership understands what engineering productivity actually looks like. And measuring lines of code in 2026 tells you the answer is no.\n\nIf your team is running Scrum but leadership is layering LOC tracking on top, that's not Agile.

Do you agree with them?\n* A specific case, Scrum, provides the role of Scrum Master to support team, remove roadblocks, etc. A SM is deliberately a role with no authority, so as not to undermine the autonomy of the team. \n* A team manager is often a corporate necessity, not a team necessity. \n* Corporate reasons for the existence of a manager often boil down to having one neck to choke. In more sane organizations you also need someone to form budgets, handle HR tasks such as reviews and salaries, oversee hiring decisions, equipment and software purchases, etc.\n* On to your questions:\n   * If a developer is stuck, I would expect them to reach out to the remainder of the team to help them become unstuck. I would expect the other members of the team to stop what they are doing and address the issue. It may not require the entire team, but I expect the team to do something about it. \n   * Does the tech lead step in first? Who cares? Sure. But why not someone else? \n   * Does the engineering manager monitor and intervene? Monitor sure. Intervene? That's trickier. For something as simple as a team member being stuck, I would consider it a failure if a manager needed to get involved. \n   * How do you balance autonomy and accountability? Command and control is not really accoutability. If I'm on a team and I want to get shit done, I hold myself accountable and I hold my teammates accountable. \n* Let's cut the bullshit for a sec. Assuming you're on a half way competent team, what exactly are you expecting the manager to do for you? If the manager is the technical resource you need to unstuck a developer you have a bigger problem than you think. \n* A good Scrum Master, to use as an example, should be working to make themselves unnecessary. In that sense, so should a good engineering manager. \n* There's an old agile model for team maturity: Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing. Interventions by a manager (or SM for that matter) need to be made in the context of where the team is maturity wise and balance the risks of intervening and preventing the team from learning. Sometimes you may have to take the wheel when the team seems intent on driving into a bridge abutment. Or do you? That depends on your context.",

The other is neglect with good branding.\n\nWhat actually works in teams I've seen over 25 years:\n\nThe tech lead handles technical blockers, code quality, and architecture decisions. They're in the code, they know the system, they unblock people because they understand the work. This is day to day.\n\nThe EM handles people, growth, performance, and organizational blockers. They don't need to be in every ceremony. But they need to know what's happening well enough to act when something breaks down. \"Forward performance concerns to me\" is not a performance management strategy. It's outsourcing accountability to the team.\n\nThe \"team swarms\" idea sounds great until you realize that swarming without someone coordinating it is just 4 people context-switching onto a problem that one person with the right knowledge could solve in an hour.\n\nPeer accountability doesn't emerge from a framework. It comes from trust, shared standards, and someone willing to have uncomfortable conversations. If your team isn't there yet, pretending they're self-organizing just delays the problem.",

At the same time they are accountable for following org and team rules (follow Definition of Done, take work toward the sprint goal, communicate with team members). \n\nIn a self-organizing team, there is additional autonomy and accountability. The team makes commitments to each other on what work they will get done and how they will collaborate toward the sprint goal. They are given freedom to do that, but then they need to meet their commitments to each other.\n\nIt's worth noting that in Scrum, the team as a whole is eternally accountable for the sprint goal. In mature self-organizing teams, external parties engage with the team and the team sorts out accountability to each other.\n\nI think that gets at the root of your question but you asked about managers. In short, a mature self-organizing team doesn't need one. The teams I've worked with that matured to this point did a lot of different things with their manager depending on what the manager was good at, but almost all moved the manager into a support role.

This doesn't mean the engineering manager wouldn't be involved if they had a dual role, but engineering management would be a strategic function rather than a tactical one.\n\n1-on-1s are a big part of the role. A key component of this is working with individuals to develop skills and explore career growth opportunities within the organization. When development teams or the broader organization lack skills or people in certain roles, the engineering manager works to fill those gaps by finding people to fill those roles, training people, or bringing in new people with the needed skills. Performance management is another aspect, making sure that people are actively participating and taking managerial steps when they aren't.\n\nThere's also a tools and infrastructure aspect. In my experience, managing the development tools and their costs often falls to the engineering manager. If there are any other considerations, such as qualifying and approving the use of tools on internal systems, that would also be part of the role.\n\nAlthough self-organization is good, the team also needs to serve the business. An engineering manager would be responsible for any guardrails or constraints on the process that the team needs to be aware of, such as compliance requirements.\n\nWith the right structures and temperament, an engineering manager could also function as a coach. Consider LeSS, [which has found that a Scrum Master could serve up to 3 development teams working on a single product](https://less.works/less/framework/scrummaster). My experience suggests that a person can support 4-5 teams if the teams are sufficiently mature and self-organizing at the day-to-day operational level. This pairs well with handling some people-management functions, tools, and process guardrails. However, not everyone has the mindset and approach to primarily sit in coaching, facilitation, and perhaps advising roles.",

          "text": "In any organization, engineering management should be focused on the 'how' more than the 'what,' and also with some aspects of the 'who.'\n\nShould your engineering manager be directly involved with team-level Scrum ceremonies? Certainly, as an observer, at times. Depending on the size of the group, the hands-on engineering manager may be a part of the team (as a Developer and/or Scrum Master, not a manager). Some managers struggle with leaving their manager hat at the door, some are naturally leaders and mentors instead of supervisors and task assigners.\n\nI've been an engineering manager with Scrum teams, where I served primarily as a coach with team level Scrum Masters and Product Owners, fully embracing self-management (the team figures out how to do things and how to allocate the work across the team) while also implementing and enforcing Definition of Done rules, e.g., coding standards, unit test requirements, policies on dealing with bugs, etc. There's a key rule: we manage things, we lead people. As a manager, my job was to create a framework (system) that my teams could effectively function in and succeed, and then to help them effectively utilize that system with advice and impediment resolution support when issues couldn't be handled by them. I think this is a good spot for a first level manager.\n\nConcerning involvement with team iteration events, with the exception of the retrospective all meetings are open to everyone in the interest of transparency, yet only team members can actively engage. In my role as coach and facilitator (not driver) I did attend most daily Scrums and all of the other events. Again, this requires that the manager remember that mentoring and coaching is much more powerful and effective than dictating process and outcomes. Some people can do it, some can be mentored and coached to do it, some people cannot do it.\n\nTo the OP: your manager seems to be very hands-off, which is good (doesn't unnecessarily interfere with the team) and bad (the team seems to be looking for leadership and mentoring and isn't getting it). Your manager needs to recognize that leadership is needed, that the team is looking for someone who will not step in and solve their problems but who can help by using mentoring and coaching techniques, e.g., the Socratic Method, to fully engage the team and teach them how to address their issues.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Story mapping is a brilliant concept but doesn't scale to large, multi-team programs. I spent several years evolving story mapping into strata mapping, turning it from facilitation art into algorithmic process so I could use maps for both simple, single-team projects and  large, multi-team complex projects with regulatory constraints. Here's why that matters.\n\n# Why I Needed Something Different\n\nIn 2009, I had recently left a role as Group Program Manager running a 100-person product team working on mobile device platform and application software. I'd moved into consulting, helping large companies re-plan and rescue failing projects.\n\nThese weren't small team efforts. These were complex, multi-team programs with distributed workforces, regulatory constraints, and millions of dollars at stake in domains like aerospace, medical devices, financial applications, even silicon chip design. These product domains aren't suitable for continuous releases to customers without extensive testing, because the cost of releasing is very high due to regulatory requirements. If you get a feature wrong, the regulatory requirements alone might take a year to satisfy before the next release. Dumping feature or functional experiments on end users in these environments is bad for business.\n\nThat's when I encountered Jeff Patton at Agile 2009 in Chicago, explaining story mapping on a hallway wall. His approach interested me immediately. I could see the potential. Organizing work around user activities and workflows made intuitive sense. It was far better than the flat, prioritized backlogs most teams were struggling with.\n\nBut I also saw the constraints that would render it ineffective for my needs. It was too team-focused for large, multi-team programs and heavily dependent on skilled facilitation. It wasn't easy to replicate across projects or teams. It was an art, not a process I could teach and then hand to a project team and say \"use this.\"\n\n# The Problem with \"Art\" at Scale\n\nWhen you're rescuing a $50M failing program with thousands of backlog items, hundreds of people across multiple teams, distributed locations, regulatory constraints and hard deadlines, facilitation art hits limits. Three specific problems emerged: skilled facilitators don't scale (I couldn't be in every planning session), maps became \"one and done\" artifacts that gathered dust during execution, and inconsistent approaches across teams made integration nearly impossible.\n\nYet we still needed Agile benefits because large projects invariably have large uncertainty and risk. The answer: approach planning in a truly agile manner that embraces uncertainty and responds effectively to change. That required process, not craft.\n\n# Four Years of Evolution\n\nFrom 2009-2013, I identified and resolved issues as I used variations on story mapping for large projects.\n\nI found that starting with users and benefits (rather than activities) made everything clearer. Stories flowed naturally from understanding user needs. This became the anchor for consistent results across teams. Better yet, Users and Features became natural units for higher-level planning, supporting product roadmaps organized by User and Feature, portfolio planning across products, executive visibility into the forest instead of just trees.\n\nI needed Feature-level boundaries teams could own end-to-end for parallel work. I needed maps that stayed relevant during execution, not just planning. And I needed systematic validation that caught cross-workflow dependencies before development, not during.\n\nBy 2013, this had solidified into strata mapping.\n\n# Returning the Gift\n\nAt the Lean Kanban North America conference in 2013, I again ran into Jeff Patton and sat down for lunch with him.\n\n\"Jeff, why haven't you written a book about story mapping?\" I asked.\n\nHe said, \"Because it's an art, not a process.\"\n\n\"Let me show you my approach to story mapping... how I turned it into a process,\" I replied. I grabbed a napkin and showed him what I'd been developing: an algorithmic approach that made story mapping systematic and repeatable, not dependent on facilitation artistry. A way to turn the insights from his technique into a process that anyone could follow, especially for large, complex projects where you can't rely on a skilled facilitator being in every room.\n\n\"Wow,\" he said.\n\nHe wrote his book the next year.\n\n# Why Process Matters (And It's Not What You Think)\n\nThere's sometimes resistance in agile circles to \"process.\" But process is a tried and true engineering approach for consistency, repeatability, and predictability. This isn't against Agile tenets - it's recognizing that while requirements may be uncertain, consistent elaboration and decomposition approaches reduce ambiguity.\n\nWhen you write code, you follow patterns. You don't reinvent how to structure a class every time. Those patterns are process. They free your mind to focus on the unique problem, not basic mechanics.\n\nStrata mapping provides that same engineering discipline for planning. The process reduces cognitive load by handling the \"how,\" freeing teams to focus on \"what\" and \"why.\" It enables learning because consistent structure makes it easier to spot what's different between projects. It supports collaboration through shared language. And it builds institutional knowledge - new team members learn once, apply everywhere.\n\nThe irony: disciplined process enables more agility, not less. When mechanics are automatic, you respond to change faster.\n\n# Core Philosophy: Understanding Over Plans\n\nScope never changes. Understanding does.\n\nThe scope is \"allow users to log in.\" That never changes. What changes is our understanding that login might mean OAuth, 2FA, SSO, magic links, biometric authentication, or passwordless options.\n\nThis is why planning is more important than plans. We create maps to develop shared understanding. As we learn, we revise our maps continuously. They're living documents, not static blueprints.\n\nTeams I rescued had failed not because scope changed, but because they hadn't created an effective plan that could evolve as knowledge increased. They treated planning as a one-time activity. Plans became increasingly irrelevant while teams devolved into heroics trying to control chaos.\n\nStrata mapping makes planning continuous. The same algorithmic process that creates the map keeps it current during execution.\n\n# The War Room: Making Progress Visible\n\nI spent more than a decade working with product teams to physically create strata maps with sticky notes on big sticky pages during workshops, then moving them to walls reflecting current plans and backlogs. We \"flowed\" Stories and Features across kanban boards, modeling the incrementally emerging product.\n\nAny stakeholder could walk into our war room and see actual progress and implemented functionality. Not a three-month-old plan. The actual current state.\n\nThe power: anything on the \"completed\" side could be demonstrated in the actual product. The map wasn't aspirational. It was operational. It guided teams to successful delivery, gave stakeholders visibility into progress, and established project leadership credibility with executives.\n\nThis taught me something crucial: the map must reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If a Story showed \"done\" but the Feature wasn't demonstrable, something was wrong. The map forced honesty about actual progress.\n\nI'm releasing StrataTree, a SaaS product that virtualizes and digitizes this approach. Tomorrow, it'll include refinement, estimation, management, and forecasting capabilities that make it a virtual War Room, bringing visceral progress visibility to distributed teams anywhere.\n\n# User-First, Not Activity-First\n\nHere's where strata mapping diverges structurally from Patton's approach:\n\n**Patton starts with business activities:** What activities do users perform? What tasks make up those activities? What stories implement those tasks?\n\n**Strata mapping starts with users and benefits:** WHO are we solving for? WHAT benefit do they need? HOW do they get that benefit? (the workflow emerges from this)\n\nWhy does this matter? If you start with activities, you're assuming you know the workflow before you understand the benefit. When rescuing projects, I often found teams had mapped activities, but mapped the WRONG activities because they hadn't started with actual user needs.\n\n# The Fourth Level: Users at the Top\n\nThis leads to the structural difference:\n\n    Patton Story Mapping: Activities → Tasks → Stories (2-3 levels)\n    Strata Mapping: User → Feature → Step → Story (4 levels)\n\nThat User level at the top isn't just organizational. It's what makes everything work:\n\n**Forces focus on WHO:** Every Feature serves a specific User. Every Story traces to a User's need. Prevents solution-first thinking.

Clear swim lanes, minimal coordination overhead. Essential for coordinating 5-10 teams on large programs.\n\n**Provides stability as understanding evolves:** Users don't change.

That means you can use valuable working software as a probe to uncover the actual needs of users, because if you are wrong, it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to change it.\n\n**2.  Theory-X management need not apply.**  High performance comes from unlocking intrinsic motivation of teams - broadly that means STOPPING the things that demotivate them or mean they are disengaged as a start point.  You need to lead, not manage.\n\n**The key shift in thinking is away from scope, budget and time.**\n\nEach Sprint/Iteration is a small project, where you create (and measure) benefits created so far, and check the assumptions made when you started.  You can extend scope, pivot to a new direction, or decide to end now and give the team a more valuable project to work on, based on what you now know.\n\nIn that sense scope, budget and time are all flexible, and you opt to invest one Sprint at a time, and review what to do next with all of the stakeholders.   The goal is not efficient delivery, but enabling \"off ramps\" from the programme  that have zero cost, every few weeks.\n\nAgile methods were called \"lightweight\" for this reason.",

No story points, no velocity tracking, no sprint commitments, just a 6-week cycle with a cool-down.\n\nThe appetite concept is the best part. Instead of estimating how long something takes and being wrong, leadership decides how much time something is worth. That's a fundamentally different question and a more honest one.\n\nThe downside is it requires something most organizations don't have: leadership that trusts teams enough to let them figure out the how within the timebox. If your org can't do that, Shape Up will fail for the same reason Agile fails, the culture can't support the framework.\n\nWorth reading the free book from Basecamp even if you don't adopt it.

              "text": "I've had tremendous experience with Scrum and Kanban, and have read the book on Shape Up. I think the contrast between Scrum and Shape Up is really a contrast in how many people (incorrectly) implement Scrum.\n\nA team is going to produce as much as it can over a fixed duration using a specific process/approach, regardless of their specific process. Shape Up says that these 6-week commitments will be made 'as a matter of honor.' I don't buy that. What I don't like about Shape Up is, I won't know how the teams are doing against the plan until the 6 weeks are up; with Scrum and running two week sprints, I know in 2 weeks whether we're ahead, on, or behind our predicted schedule. Not so I can beat the team up, but so I can update forecasts, adjust planning, etc. \n\nIn real life, much of the functionality we want to build for a new product, or a new release, is necessary, so how much time it's worth is irrelevant... if you need it you need it regardless of how much time it takes. Getting it done, quickly and efficiently is what matters. What happens if the leadership decided that something is worth 6 weeks, the teams spend 6 weeks working on it, and it's not done? If it's truly worth it, you spend another 6 weeks! Really, this 'how much time' question is about setting priorities, not scope.\n\nWhen people mention the unnecessary overhead of Scrum, I shake my head. Scrum done properly, running 2-week sprints, has about 4 hours over an 80-hour work period... about 5% of overall time. If done correctly, this doesn't even take away actual working time. Most people come into the office (or start work) by grabbing a cup of coffee, checking their email, maybe a quick chat with coworkers... and then they start their work period. Have your daily Scrum 15 minutes after the beginning of work hours and get it over quickly... 10 to 15 minutes MAX... and then people can come to work, grab a coffee, quickly check their email, and go to the meeting, and be heads down and working a half hour after the start of the day. If that little bit of overhead destroys your productivity... well, I don't believe it.\n\nIs Shape Up better than dysfunctional Scrum. Surely. But, why not follow a functional optimal Scrum process instead?",

The cycle times alone become a real challenge if you’re doing a greenfields project so you need to be at a stage where a 4-6 week cycle feels about right to deliver an impactful piece of work. \n\nShape Up will usually fail at places with low trust, or a large number of junior employees. By nature, you’re leaving people alone to do their work for long periods of time, so if the requisite cultural pieces aren’t there then you’ll have major challenges. \n\nI’m happy to ramble about shape up for days.

Makes the work more engaging and interesting, I laugh a lot, and I always learn something new. \n\nI've found the secret to pairing is regular switching of driver/navigator, and the way to do that is so simple...just set a timer (my favorite one: https://chris.dziemborowicz.com/apps/hourglass/) my preference is 15 minutes then switch, but I've found some people don't like that, so I'd say somewhere between 15-25 minutes is a good range. And be diligent at abiding by the timer. Developers are notorious for losing track and having a \"just a few more minutes\" frame of mind which always turns into much much longer. \n\nSwitching regularly naturally enforces engagement as well as a truly shared and understood solution. \n\n...I could go on and on about pairing :).",

There are several reasons: finding defects, developing a shared understanding of a system's design and implementation, identifying enhancements and opportunities to improve an otherwise working system, and exposing implementation details to testers to move from black-box to white-box testing, just to name a few. Code review, and even different types of code reviews, are better at some of these than others.\n\nOnce you know why you're reviewing the code, do you know how long you're actually spending compared to the value you get from that time? If your purpose is to find defects, how many defects are you finding? If your purpose is to develop a shared understanding, are the people who didn't implement that feature comfortable enhancing that feature in the future? Sometimes, value could be hard to quantify, depending on the reason for review.\n\nGenerally speaking, are you focusing on things that need human eyes during code review? Regardless of when or why you conduct code reviews, automate as much as possible. People shouldn't be looking for style problems. Use a linter and automate code formatting and flag anything that can't be automated before the review starts. Expose code coverage, test results, and static analysis to make sure that there is some confidence that the code is tested and does what it is supposed to do without introducing errors. Tool output can also be provided to the reviewers. Sometimes, I've gotten more value from reviewing a description of the proposed change, a test coverage report, and automated unit and integration test cases to identify missing edge cases than from reading the actual implementation code.",

A 900-line PR cannot be reviewed in 15 minutes, it can only be approved in 15 minutes. Those aren't the same thing.\n\nThe teams I've seen that cracked this had one rule: nothing over 200 lines gets merged without being split first. Painful to enforce for the first month, then it becomes the fastest thing you do because reviewers actually understand what they're looking at.\n\nThe other thing that helps is separating what the review is for. Architectural decisions should not be made during code review, that's too late, the code is already written. If the approach is wrong at that stage you're not reviewing, you're rewriting. Architecture gets discussed before a line is written. Review is for implementation quality only, and that's a much faster conversation.\n\nThe SLA thing is a symptom of the real problem which is that reviewers have no ownership of what they're reviewing. If I'm assigned 12 random PRs this week I'll rubber-stamp them to close the queue, anyone would. If I own the feature and I'm reviewing the implementation, I have a reason to actually read it.\n\nNone of this is a tradeoff, it's just structure.

They'll forget it by next week and it won't mean anything to them without the context of actually working on a team in a company.  What they will remember is the underlying ideas. And those are actually good.  \n\nBreak something complex into small pieces and build one piece at a time. Get feedback early instead of building the whole thing and hoping it works. Talk to each other every day about what's stuck. When something doesn't work, figure out why and change your approach.  \n\nThat's it. That's the useful part of Agile stripped of all the corporate scaffolding.  If you want to make it practical, give them a project. Something they can actually build in a few hours. A simple app, a website, a game, whatever fits their skill level. Split them into two groups. One group plans everything upfront for an hour then builds. The other group builds in 30 minute cycles, checking in with you as the \"customer\" between each cycle to see if they're on track.  \n\nDon't tell them which approach is \"agile.\" Let them compare results at the end. They'll figure out the lesson themselves. That sticks way longer than a slide about the Agile Manifesto.  \n\nThe worst thing you could do is teach them Scrum vocabulary. The best thing you could do is teach them how to think in small bets and fast feedback. That's a life skill, not just a work skill.",

Break the big picture into smaller, digestible contents,\n\n2 - try to make it half theoric half pratical;\n\n3 - show them real tools and how they are used ( jira. Kanban boards, etc),\n\n4 - contextualize them, treat them as a real team developing a real project,\n\n5 - teach them what are the cerimonies and what the use of them,\n\n6 - teach them the various stages of a project, the different people and roles involvwd.\n\nHope this helps.
