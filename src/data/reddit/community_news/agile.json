They had low effort jobs and got paid a livable wage . Good for them. \n\nBut now are the dark ages.

But all too often, you see SMs not willing to understand the actual work, the tech, the product, the outcomes.  it isn't just that you can facilitate and coach.  \n\nI would tweek the things that you say have changed to:\n\n1. they want scrum masters to ALSO be accountable with the team for outcomes - the SM, team, coach, everyone is in it together and if the outcomes are not achieved, ALL of them have failed.  SM and Coaches that focus on form and think that being successful at Agile is the goal... are flat out wrong.\n\n2. product model is more prominent while Agile has become a bad word and a tech thing - the funny thing is that product doesn't mean no Agile... Agile has this thing called a PRODUCT owner.  the notion of a product model becoming the new paradigm is more about the elimination of \"projects\", the continuous planning,, continuous delivery, etc.  \n\n",

Before, everyone was trying to do huge waterfall projects that often burned out dev teams and delivered the wrong project.  It worked.  But when finances tighten, humanity shrinks and I’m afraid we are heading right back to the old days again.  \n\nPlus, we’re in a new phase now in the industry.  Most of the truly groundbreaking systems are kinda like standardized systems now, so requirements are easier to come by.  Agile is really good at discovery and innovation and bringing together diverse stakeholders.  So now, the next gen of software is kinda already specd, and just needs to get ported over to AI. Smart, dedicated developers will be able to do the work better without all the management overhead that Agile Inc became.  Sadly though, those overperformers will lead us right back to sloppy slaughterhouse conditions that many fought so hard to get away from.",

      "text": "Here, on the vast plains of the Q3 roadmap, a remarkable ritual is about to unfold. The engineering tribe has gathered around the glow of the digital watering hole for the ceremony known as Sprint Planning. It is here that we can observe one of the most mysterious and misunderstood creatures in the entire corporate ecosystem: the Story Point.\n\nFor decades, management scientists have mistaken this complex organism for a simple unit of time or effort. This is a grave error. The Story Point is not a number; it is a complex social signal, a display of dominance, a cry for help, or a desperate act of camouflage.\n\nAfter years of careful observation, we have classified several distinct species.\n\n**1. The Optimistic Two-Pointer (Estimatus Minimus)**\n\nA small, deceptively placid creature, often identified by its deceptively simple ticket description. Its native call is, \"Oh, that's trivial, it's just a small UI tweak.\" The Two-Pointer appears harmless, leading the tribe to believe it can be captured with minimal effort. However, it is the primary prey of the apex predator known as \"Unforeseen Complexity.\" More often than not, the Two-Pointer reveals its true, monstrous form mid-sprint, devouring the hopes of the team and leaving behind a carcass of broken promises.\n\n**2. The Defensive Eight-Pointer (Fibonacci Maximus)**\n\nThis is not an estimate; it is a territorial display. The Eight-Pointer puffs up its chest, inflates its scope, and stands as a formidable warning to any Product Manager who might attempt to introduce scope creep. Its large size is a form of threat posturing, communicating not \"this will take a long time,\" but \"do not approach this ticket with your 'quick suggestions' or you will be gored.\" It is a protective measure, evolved to defend a developer's most precious resource: their sanity.\n\n**3. The Ambiguous Five-Pointer (Puntus Medius)**\n\nThe chameleon of the estimation world. The Five-Pointer is the physical embodiment of a shrug. It is neither confidently small nor defensively large. It is a signal of pure, unadulterated uncertainty. A developer who offers a Five-Pointer is not providing an estimate; they are casting a vote for \"I have no idea, and I am afraid to commit.\" It survives by blending into the middle of the backlog, hoping to be overlooked.\n\n**4. The Mythical One-Pointer (Unicornis Simplex)**\n\nA legendary creature, whose existence is the subject of much debate among crypto-zoologists of Agile. Sightings are incredibly rare. The legend describes a task so perfectly understood, so devoid of hidden dependencies, and so utterly simple that it can be captured and completed in a single afternoon. Most senior engineers believe it to be a myth, a story told to junior developers to give them hope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur research indicates that the Story Point has very little to do with the actual effort required to complete a task. It is a complex language of risk, fear, and social negotiation, practiced by a tribe that is being forced to navigate a dark, unmapped territory. The entire, elaborate ritual of estimation is a coping mechanism for a fundamental lack of visibility.\n\nThey are, in essence, guessing the size of a shadow without ever being allowed to see the object casting it.\n\n\n\nThought we could use some humor to start the week (this is all tongue-in-cheek ).  If I have overstepped, please let me know and I will take this down.",

The problem is well defined and small in scope (I say problem here, not solution, a story describes your users work, not your work).\n\nIf it's \"Too Fucking Big\" then the team understands the problem to be solved but feels that the problem is too large and needs to find ways to split it into more manageable problems of smaller scope, looking for a smaller MVP. \n\nIf it's \"No Fucking Clue\" then the team has no clear understanding of the scope of the problem and some investment must be made to investigate the problem space and come up with next steps. Some testing and iteration need to occur to determine what an MVP and the next iterations should even look like.\n\nThe goal is to have every story be a 1, if it's a 1 it's ready to be worked on, if it's one of the others, work needs to happen to make it a 1 (or more accurately to define multiple 1's). The main priority is to \"right-size\" the stories and get them feeling fairly uniform, with them all focused on defining a user-facing problem to be solved.\n\nThen to measure the teams performance and make estimations of projected performance it becomes just a matter of counting how many stories are completed within a time frame, how long stories stay in different phases of work, how many stories are waiting on being done, etc",

That's not the point here. The issue is orgs are paying a ton of money for someone who at best brings minimal value, at worst is complete dead weight, and most often doesn't move the needle at all. A lot of teams would be better off ditching the Scrum Master in favor of an additional dev, and integrating the SM responsibilities into the dev team. (A fully dedicated SM who is good at their job is better than devs taking the responsibilities, but a fully dedicated SM who sucks is not.)",

He constantly taunted us (team) like, he would come sit next to us and asked, explain the code and what it does or why is it not working (Idk haven’t had a chance to debug yet). One time he accused of manipulating the user story when I was talking to the QA engineer to explain the testing scope as he was new to the team, he straight. I’ve asked if I was asking the QA to manipulate and move the story forward - that’s where I come from.\n\nI hate confrontations so never said anything and decided to quit being a dev which I wasn’t a fan of so I became a Scrum Master and have been for the past 7 years now. I did this to become everything he was not and be the best and a dependable team member.\n\nReading through your post - it looks like they are just doing “Scrum” or “Agile” just for the sake of doing it. Scrum Masters are there to help, guide and support the teams without any disruptions.\n\nAnyone can share the screen and go through the board, he is not needed per se but he should be there to understand what’s going on and where they are needed.",

An engineer need not apply.\n\nEdit: thanks for the downvotes. here's the post: https://jobs.cvshealth.com/us/en/job/R0816661/Senior-Analyst-Scrum-Master",

You've summed them up nicely and I agree wholeheartedly. \n\nSM behaviors and rhetoric like this, spoken aloud and cheered as gospel, are directly responsible for team and leadership confusion during delivery, customer dissatisfaction due to poor releases and capabilities, lack of redirect from product partners, and eventual layoffs across the board. \n\nSide note: early Agile, like in the Snowbird days, used an analogy of a chicken trying to convince a pig to open a breakfast restaurant called Ham 'n Eggs. The pig refused. The chicken asked why and the pig replies, \"Because you would be engaged with the restaurant but I would be committed\". It was supposed to replace RACI ideas and was widely used in training agilists. I used the analogy once during a planning session, and my director lost his head over his perception of what i was saying, in that he thought i was suggesting he was too scared to make a decision.\n\nOne and only time.\n\nIt was a fun, quirky, subversive ha-ha way for some agilists to express perceived superiority over leaders and execs. Today, it's a clear signal of disdain - just as it comes across here, and any whilst worth their salt would never say it. \n\nI think if an SM called a UK engineering team for backlog grooming, that would receive less ire than chickens and pigs.",

Also, if it's not useful or something is wrong or you think it sucks because of a, b and c...

Thanks for sharing. \n\nI feel like a paid solution like that would be where I'd head to **after** experimenting with the concept and proving it out. It's hard to do that over a 7 or 14-day trial; it's not long enough to see a product implemented, and pitching it to your client or company without demonstrating the benefits is a challenge in its own right. \n\nI'm hoping to fill that gap and offer a free sandbox environment, though with fewer premium features. I definitely can't afford to build in AI-driven story maps, ha! I guess the usual starting point is probably Post-it notes, then ideally a free offering, and then, if you really get value from it, a paid service like the one you linked.",

On another, it sounded almost identical to a PM with an Agile label. Feels like every company defines it differently.\n\nPart of me thinks this might just be title inflation.

Culture change and small wins will spread and become viral fireside \"stories\" that are shared. Top down by mandate transformations are more theater than real change.  The model we went through and I pushed was bottom up and middle out. We had management support but not a mandate other than \"get better at delivery.\" Funny story, one of our agile coaches, who had a corporate mindset, kept complaining, \"why doesn't management send a memo telling everyone you have to go agile, these teams are not doing what they are supposed to!\" This made me laugh because if a coach can't help a team see the value of agile methods for themselves and have THEM buy in, no amount of coercion will result in change. Human beings do what is in their best interest and agile, for most, not all, is in their best interest. An empathic coach who can help them through that process, and it takes time, will create lasting change.",

I have another scrum master semi guiding me but I feel like he honestly thinks im stupid for not knowing how to do things or getting flustered with tasks that he views as straight forward. I try to ask him to help me as Ive never done any of this and he says i have to \"take initiative\" and that he cant \"hold my hand through it\" this has made me not want to reach out to him as I dont really get guidance, its more of a scolding and a \"you should be doing this and this\" my PO is great and understands I dont have any answers and am just trying to learn HOW things work so Im thankful for him. But I just feel so stupid and useless whenever I try to do things and they end up being \"all wrong\".

In my years as a SM, I didn't have a single day to day routine other than taking on the actions from standup. That meant coaching POs and BAs in writing stories, working with engineers to examine complexity, running through budgets and burn rates with directors, and helping QA learn BDD to leverage tools fully.\n\nThe only thing I didn't do was code - and even then, I was researching logs, engaging support teams, and managing delivery. \n\nSMs serve the team in whatever capacity. I was trained and obtained my CSM in 2011, CSP in 2015, when Scrum Alliance meant something in the industry.  Trust me when I say that Scrum dogma has no practical place in software and product development. Meeting your team where they are and responding to those needs is the mark of a good real world SMs.\n\nIf you want to do this, find a shop that understand and learn there. If you don't want to be a SM, find another role. \n\nThe only thing more disastrous to a team than a new, unsure SM, is one who has no passion or interest in the role.",

Start by capturing velocity this will take several sprints.\n2. Make sure your backlog is structured a way that not only helps Devs but also Leadership. If it doesnt help leadership start thinkkng of ways to tie work to OKRs or Initiatives.\n3. Make sure you host all the ceremonies. You can work into this one if its not happening but refinement in my opinion is one of the most important.\n4. Provide updates at the begginning of the sprint and sprint plan to manager and director.\n5. Provide updates on projects to managers, directors and project managers.\n6. Resolve Blockers is vague - but its really important to take this away from Dev Teams and own this. \n7. Side quest - each of my scrum masters is working towards next goal (project manager, product manager, data analysis) go get certs and on the job training. My SM built a beautiful power bi that helps us plan and analyze our teams performance.\n\nThis should keep you busy. And all the SMs that say this aint the job. They will be on Reddit complaining about the SM Job because coaching isnt enough to keep you busy for 40 hours or progress in your future.",

          "text": "There are significant differences in mindset between predictive and adaptive (or agile) methods. You adopt adaptive methods when there's uncertainty or ambiguity in the work, so there's an inherent need to accept this ambiguity and make decisions even when you don't (and won't) have the full picture. There's also usually a greater sense of shared ownership, with the project manager doing less controlling and managing and more sharing knowledge and expertise, so the team can own the work and the process. All of this requires shifting from a doing mindset to a facilitating, teaching, coaching, and sometimes partnering mindset.\n\nAgility sometimes comes with a shift to a product-centric organization, which also changes the role of a project manager. Ownership shifts to product management and long-term product goals, with project management supporting the movement toward those goals rather than serving as the primary funding and organizational structure.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how to start a big new project the right way and wanted to throw this out here for discussion.\n\nI’m a senior software engineer working mostly with low-code platforms. In the past, I’ve been involved in several projects, smaller ones went fine, but the last two large ones (1–3 years long) went very bad. I joined both halfway through, mostly to help push them to production, so I couldn’t really influence the structure or process. Now I’ve just joined a new company that’s kicking off a major refactoring and some new features project (expected to last almost two years), and I really want to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nI’m Italian, and honestly, i’ve always struggled with Agile. Too many rituals, too much overhead, not enough freedom. I used to think waterfall was better, but mostly because I didn’t really understand Agile deeply. So I spent time reading up on Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, XP, etc., and i’ve come to believe Agile makes more sense, especially with low code tools.\n\nBut here’s where I’m stuck: in my experience, Agile often means endless rework because requirements keep changing or were never properly analyzed at the start. Budgets are fixed here, timelines are tight, and we don’t have the luxury of endless iteration. On low-code platforms, even a small change can break multiple parts (data models, rules, UI, etc.), so frequent late changes are really costly.\n\nSo my question is: am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a way to truly apply Agile in this context, or should we invest much more upfront in detailed functional and technical analysis and get everything validated before development?\n\nWould love to hear from people who have faced similar constraints.\n\nThanks!",

The number of requirements that have changed are very very few due to the rigor that we put in at the start of the project.

Then, in the final phase (with a lot of pressure and stringent deadlines), when the client is irritated by things not working, they accept every one of their dictates, for fear of starting a legal dispute.\n\nSo my question is, how do I, as a developer/tech leader, take charge of the situation and prevent this from happening? I'm wondering how I can best approach the initial, calmer part of the project, so as to build an effective analysis that doesn't trigger too many change requests in the future.

They would never use a prototype or partial software that doesn't cover their full workflow, either because it's senseless to abandon their current process for something incomplete (forcing them to use a bit of the old and a bit of the new), or because of regulations, GDPR, etc. For example, you can't push forward document processing without the digital signature part, which relies on a third-party service, because we couldn't integrate with that external service, which the client had only mentioned casually, but since we weren't supposed to implement it until later we didn't check exactly how the integration worked, and months later we realized it was impossible with our software.\n\nThe bathroom example fits perfectly:  \nContinuing the example, let's say the client gets to step 8 and then says they want a jacuzzi bathtub, but you explain it's impossible because the bathroom and pipes aren't set up for the tub they want (I'm making this up), and you tell them that after all the work you've already done, to install the tub you'd have to tear everything apart, redo all the pipes, etc., and it would cost three times more with an extra month of work. At that point what do you do, is it your fault for not digging deeper into what kind of tub they wanted, or theirs for not being ready for the budget increase based on their special requests?  \nItalian companies are more the second case, and that's where the penalties come in that they make you pay because you can't deliver exactly what you had agreed on with them.",

And it sounds like you've learned about other frameworks and their perspectives on agility, rather than keeping with someone else's incorrect perceptions of agility.\n\nYour later experiences, such as the extensive rework isn't indicative of Agile either. Agility doesn't mean no up-front analysis and endless iteration.\n\nThe right approach is somewhere in the middle. Fixing a budget and a timeline is difficult, but it still gives you a flexible scope. The key is to do *just enough* up-front analysis and design and then quickly start building. You need to make sure you're pointed in the right direction, then iterate quickly to deliver the most value with the limited time and money you have, or fail fast and realize that your schedule and budget won't allow you to deliver sufficient value to make proceeding worthwhile.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no universal answer for how much up-front work is *just enough*. It's highly context sensitive. Some contexts are more tolerant of risks materializing than others. However, you also can't do *all* the analysis up front, since there's uncertainty about the completeness and correctness of any definition you have.",

          "text": "**TLDR;  Agile approaches control business risk by minimizing sunk costs; they are less efficient, but you can stop a programme of work at any time and have minimal write offs.**\n\nAn \"upfront design\" project has the assumption that if you deliver to scope, on time and under budget, the business will obtain benefits that match the ROI required.  That ROI only starts to arrive after the project is completed.\n\nAgile approaches don't make that assumption.  You continually deliver, and continually measure the actual benefits obtained.  This is less efficient, but allows you to stop at any time you think the next lot of benefits are at risk, or the ROI has shifted.\n\nEffectively you are removing the whole sunk-cost fallacy.  In a conventional project when you have spent a lot and have failed to identify or manage key risks, then you are stuck with a choice to spend more (and reduce the ROI) or cancel and write off all costs.    That's often politically unacceptable, so you carry on.\n\nWith an agile approach **you can stop at any time, having obtained high value benefits, with zero sunk costs.**\n\nIn that sense agile approaches can't really fail, when well executed.\n\nWith Scrum, each Sprint offers the business a potential zero-cost off-ramp from the project.\n\nAgile approaches are less efficient at delivery than big-design-upfront, but enable much finer-grained control on risk.  That means you can drop a lot of the stage-gate-and-sign-off and formal risk management stuff which saves you time and money.\n\nThere's a couple of core requirements, however.\n\n**- change is cheap, easy, fast and safe (no new defects)**  \n**- you get fast feedback from users on the value that change created**\n\nThis is where XP and DevOps comes into play.  When it's not expensive, hard, slow or risky to make changes then the need to be 100% right first time, so detailed requirements are less important. XP took this to the extreme, with a sentence on a 3x5 index card, and a user domain SME collocated with the team and dynamically collaborating with them all the time - zero lag on feedback, and real CI/CD to an actual user they are sitting with.\n\nWith Scrum that looks like shipping multiple increments to (some) users within the Sprint and getting feedback on your progress to the Sprint Goal dynamically, so the stakeholders can choose whether to continue investing or to change direction.  Hence the idea that each Sprint is a small project in it's own right, and that the backlog is never completed, only abandoned when it doesn't offer a good ROI.\n\n**If you can't do those two things well, then you are better off with formal stage-gate project management.**",

Which is all agile (and lean) software development actually is. \n\nKnowledge work is not the same as manufacturing, but the wider concepts like systems thinking that Theory of Constraints still apply.\n\nWhat Deming pointed out to Toyota (among other things) was \n\n\\- test-and-rework loops are very expensive  \n\\- building quality in to the system is much cheaper  \n\\- until a thing is in use (ie sold or shipped) it has no value  \n\\- you need to continually improve your processes  \n\\- you need to do that leveraging data and controlled experiments  \n  \nHard disagree on making change cheap, easy, fast and safe though.  That's the build quality in part - you get into the defect prevention business, not the defect discovery business.   \n  \nThat was the whole point of the agile movement from about 2000 onwards, following all of the lessons learned by the dot-com bubble, as well as The Lean StartUp and all of that.  It was a developer led thing too.\n\nThe whole XP \"Planning Game\" focused on delivering an minimal end-to-end Spine, and then adding slices of value that you adapted based on feedback.  The other XP technical practices supported that rapid change, and if you found a new direction was more valuable you'd follow that.  \n  \nMy first software team came to me around 2009 or so and said they wanted to try out this agile thing;  took us about 4 or 5 years to defuse the legacy code base and big-ball of mud, even when we hired a really experienced XP guy.

              "text": "When you talk about ROI being delivered incrementally in Agile, so you can stop if something isn't bringing value and avoid the sunk cost fallacy, which is definitely a huge issue in our field, that makes sense in theory. But at least for Italian projects, it doesn't really work that way. Clients only pay us at the end of the project, or maybe at specific milestones, not based on what we've delivered along the way. And even if they pay upfront, if we don't deliver exactly what's been agreed on, it goes to lawyers and penalties kick in.\n\nI work with public administration, banks, insurance companies, etc., so the idea that the client at least has something usable from Agile doesn't hold up. They would never use a prototype or partial software that doesn't cover their full workflow. It's just not practical to switch from their current process to something incomplete (forcing them to use a bit of the old and a bit of the new), plus there are regulations, GDPR, etc. For example, you can't push forward document processing without the digital signature part, which relies on a third-party service. We only got mentioned about that integration later on, since it wasn't supposed to be implemented until much later, so we didn't check how it actually worked. Months later we realized it was impossible with our software setup.\n\nThe \"sentence on a 3x5 index card\" approach is something we've tried in a few cases, but it was a total disaster. Unless that user domain SME has full decision-making power and basically signs off on every change with their own blood, this kind of process usually runs into complete disagreement from all the other business users who will actually use the app, leading to massive rework.\n\nSo that's my main hesitation, and maybe it's just a specific case where the methodology isn't fully adaptable, or needs serious tweaking. Could also be because of the super tight constraints of low-code platforms. Overall, my concern boils down to: if I'm building a skyscraper",

You then have two pipelines for deployment, one which routes the \"as built\" and change documents to the sign-off authorities, and one that deploys code.  Both have to run to deploy to production.  \n  \nBut you are spot on - that user domain SME has to have the authority to act;  actually \"Own\" the product unlike a lot of the \"backlog managers\" you get, which means they are making business decisions inside and with the team, next to the customer.\n\nThat's what I have right now - we have empowered POs from \"the business' embedded within the teams accountable for value and making those decisions.  And it's the business making the tough priority calls when they need to, based on how our money works.  It's frankly great.  The teams feel a lot less pressure and so on.\n\nBig culture shift.  Our CEO back in the mid 1990s executed on this kind of culture so we on the technical side all got business training, the the business folk.  So much doesn't need to be said when you do that, the payoff is HUGE.  \n  \nMostly the banks where I am are going all in on SAFe, with a sprinkling of team topologies and value streams.\n\nBut yeah how you do projects matters;  we're in the process of swapping to a more value-stream approach because now we don't have on-prem servers and use IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS the CAPEX-OPEX model of old is a bit broken. And how the money works really, really matters. \n\nAnd the skyscraper thing is spot on.  \n  \nIf you aren't able to work with easily extensible architecture and you are pouring foundations in concrete then you can't add a couple of extra floors later on in the process.\n\nDoes sound like you are better off with waterfall;  you can still look at things like Kanban to help you smooth the delays and kinks out of the delivery - often it's not the \"time on tools\" that matters, its the delays.   Good kanban and flow can shift delivery by \\~20% or so, and really help with triaging defects when you are in a white-water period.\n\nPart of the issue I have now (big DW swap out) is they built by architectural layers for efficiency rather than running a strangler fig pattern (to manage risk);  anything you can do to break the project down into smaller, high value components helps.  \n  \nTMFASD talked about \"a few weeks to a few months\" and that's valid. Keep each chunk under $1m and have value at the end helps;  Scrum shrinks this to a couple of weeks but that's often too small for big projects (but essential for R+D)   \n  \nDon't fast prototype though - have disposable POCs to derisk delivery technology timeboxed to a couple of days, and build everything else to production standard. \n\nNothing as horrible as a hacked together POC pushed to prod lol.\n\n\n\n",

I was among the early (and successful) adopters of XP.\n\nAll the experience I've gathered over those years has taught me that there are just two fundamental \"steps\" to successfully deliver software systems.\n\n1. Ship something\n2. Reflect\n\nI find it interesting that working with LLMs has only reinforced the idea that you will never be able to create the perfect requirements document. Therefore, build something, preferable small, get it into the hands of the intended consumers of the work, and get their feedback.\n\nReflect is intended for the people/organization to look at what they did in the first step and seek out improvements. Retrospectives are one way of doing that, but there are many more. Regardless, if you don't honestly look at how to improve you work together, then step 1 will become more difficult over time.\n\nNow, HOW you accomplish steps 1 and 2 are going to depend wildly on your circumstances, or, dare I say it, *context*! The context for a small startup trying to establish a market for its web-based application is much different from that of an established telecom company writing phone switch software that handles 911 calls.\n\nAny \"canned\" process is going to have difficulty with this, even my beloved XP! For example, I was a strong believer in co-located teams until the COVID pandemic proved that in many cases we can be nearly as productive while remote (and with lower stress due to commuting). This is why I grew to love what Lean can teach us about observation and systems thinking on top of rote application of a process.\n\nSo, all that to answer that the only right way is to try something and reflect honestly on it. Did what your tried bring value? Did it improve morale? Did it improve lead & cycle times? Did it improve quality? Based on the answers to questions like those, adjust how you work then ask the questions again when you have new data.",

They will get to being productive quickly.  \n  \nBut - solo projects have a habit of increasing in complexity over time, with little-to-no documentation, and \"safety rails\" designed for that one person's skills and experience.
